          "text": "\n\n\n\nBaba Ijesha\n\nNollywood actor, Olarewaju James, alias Baba Ijesha, on Friday testified before an Ikeja Special Offences Court that he was acting a script in the viral video with a minor.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Baba Ijesha made this revelation while being led in evidence by the defence counsel, Dada Awosika (SAN).\n\nBaba Ijesha told the court that the foster mother of the minor, Ms Damilola Adekoya, a comedian also known as Princess, had called and requested him to be part of the movie production.\n\n\u201cOn April 19, 2021, Princess sent me a message that she wanted to start a production and she would like me to play the role of a lover boy which I replied \u2018okay\u2019.\n\n\u201cShe said I was to play the role of a lover boy adding that she wanted to surprise people that I can also play normal roles.\n\n\u201cShe said the story is about rape and she wanted to tell the story in another dimension,\u201d he said.\n\nThe defence counsel tendered before the court, a printout of WhatsApps message between Princess and the defendant, which was admitted into evidence by Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo.\n\nThe embattled actor said he asked Princess for the movie location but she told him to come over to her house.\n\n\u201cBefore I entered, Princess met me at the balcony that the movie production was a Lagos State project, adding that the state wanted her to be the face of \u2018anti child molestation.\u2019\n\n\u201cShe told me to improvise and create a story by myself. I told her the house was dark when I entered. She said we should rehearse that she would use her phone.\n\n\u201cPrincess told me to kiss and suck the breast of the child, adding that the dress the girl was wearing was purposely for the role the girl wanted to play.\n\n\u201cShe would leave the room so that the child would not be shy to play out the role.\n\n\u201cAll those things we are seeing in that video is just acting. My lord check my record when it comes to acting, I can kill myself and die for acting. She was the one directing and filming my angles,\u201d he said.\n\nBaba Ijesha told the court that himself and Princess were directors of the movie, adding that she told him he could act out the scene in the kitchen as well.\n\n\u201cShe told me I could go into the kitchen as well. She told the girl in question you remember what I told you, when I leave the room now, act out your role perfectly.\n\n\u201cThe girl removed my shoe and I started acting out my role. I romanced her based on the movie role Princess gave me.\n\n\u201cAs I was acting with the girl, kissing and licking her fingers, I was also whispering to her \u2018hey do not look at the camera\u2019.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, I saw like eight people including Princess, entered the room and started beating the girl.\n\n\u201cI even thought it was part of acting. She beat her and said \u2018idiot is that what I asked you to do\u2019. One of the men gave me a blow and alleged that I raped the girl,\u201d he said.\n\nThe defendant further told the court that he was shocked when he was being beaten and thought that the men who meted out the beating were amateur actors because they are not meant to use actual physical violence in movie scenes.\n\nBaba Ijesha said that he was forced in one of the viral videos by Princess to admit that he defiled the minor.\n\n\u201cPrincess said \u201cyou know I love you, just tell me that seven years ago you used your car key to disvirgin the girl\u201d that she would allow me to go if I said so.\n\n\u201cI had to accept under pressure so that the men would not injure me the more, after Princess invited one police officer named Abigail, before I was taken to Sabo Police Station after,\u201d he told the court.\n\nThe defendant said he was forced to sign a statement which was not written by him at the police station.\n\n\u201cThe statement in question profiled me because I have all my information online and Princess knows all my information as well.\n\n\u201cImmediately, Abigail asked me to sign and I did just that, she took me back to the cell and I stayed there till the following morning,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder cross-examination by the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions, Dr Babajide Martins, the defendant admitted to have known the girl since she was seven.\n\nHe added that he did not inform the Police at Sabo and Panti, respectively that they were acting.\n\n\u201cI did not inform the policemen that we were acting because I was not myself.\n\n\u201cI also did not inform them at the two police stations that Princess and I were in a relationship,\u201d he said.\n\nProbing Baba Ijesha further, Martins said: \u201cWhile you were being beaten, you said you thought that they were amateur actors because of the actual violence.\n\n\u201cSince you said it was a movie script, so you are not meant to mimic sexual assault on an underage child?\u201d\n\nBaba Ijesha in his response said the scenes he acted with the minor were appropriate.\n\nThe defendant is facing a six-count charge bordering on indecent treatment of a child, sexual assault, attempted sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault by penetration.\n\nJustice Oluwatoyin Taiwo adjourned the case until March 11 for continuation of defence.\n\n\n\nNAN\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nThe Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) says there may be no extension of registration deadline for candidates, for the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME).\n\nThe Registrar of the board, Prof. Is\u2019haq Oloyede dropped the hint while monitoring the registration exercise in some centres on Friday, in Lagos.\n\nAccording to him, feelers reaching the board from states across the country reveal that the exercise has been seamless, hence there may be no room for an extension.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that registration started across the country on Saturday, Feb. 19 and will be concluded on March 26.\n\n\u201cWe are not expecting any extension. I want to say that we are very happy with the way the exercise has been going, two weeks after it started.\n\n\u201cMore than 55,000 have already registered today alone and we had expected at least 50,000 to register as at today, nationwide. But for the few disruptions witnessed in some of these centres, it is possible to register even 100,000 candidates in a day.\n\n\u201cOur target is to make sure that about 100,000 are able to register in a day. Therefore, so far,\n\nI must say I am very satisfied with the registration exercise nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe development gladdens my heart because it shows that we are on course, despite the few glitches witnessed in the registration exercise in some centres, there has been a huge progress made,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe said that in all, almost 600,000 UTME and Direct Entry (DE) candidates had been registered, noting that with the level of progress made already, coupled with the seamless, process, he did not foresee the need for an extension of the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe have hardly had complaint concerning the code 55019, where candidates should send their NIN numbers to, after following the laid down steps.\n\n\u201cWe even introduced the 66019, another code, and I must tell you that we have not even used that one; it has been redundant.\n\n\u201cThat goes to show you that 55019 is working and is still working. Any candidate having issues with it must be a self-inflicted one, on his or her part.\n\n\u201cIt has never been this smooth. So, now, we are having capacity problem, apparently, which started day before yesterday.\n\n\u201cWe have spoken with our service providers and Airtel has come on board with expansion. We are expecting MTN to come up with expansion too, so that this disruption will not continue.\n\n\u201cWe hope in the next few hours, the few technical hitches currently being experienced will be taken care of and we will be able to have the exercise run smoothly,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe JAMB boss attributed some of the challenges to heavy traffic, adding that too many candidates were trying to register at the same time.\n\n\u201cI think the traffic is heavy. What it means is that in the past you will register 25,000 or 30,000 candidates in a day. But here we are, registering over 50,000 candidates in a day.\n\n\u201cApparently, what is always obvious is that the system is not taking the traffic. That is what I think is responsible for this kind of challenge, which like I said, will be taken care of as we progress.\n\n\u201cThe service providers are now working toward expansion, so that it can take as many candidates as possible.\n\n\u201cTraffic is heavier than expected and we have mobilised resources to ensure it is solved. And that is why this kind of thing we are doing is seen as dynamic in nature.\n\n\u201cWe have seen what the challenge is and we have been talking to all our service providers; this is just to ensure that each and every one of them expands to accommodate the traffic.\n\n\u201cAnd we have no problems with that, because as at now, we have registered more than one third of the expected number of candidates,\u201d he said.\n\nOn whether the candidates could carry out the registration exercise on their own, the registrar noted that it was quite possible, but that the board was guarding against that for now, in order to avoid more confusion.\n\n\u201cFor instance, if we ask these candidates to go and do it on their own, some people would want to take undue advantage of them and in the end, create problems for them.\n\n\u201cIt is not like we cannot make it available. If you leave it open, like many people are citing UK and the U.S., they forget to know that it may not be that easy to obtain same here.\n\n\u201cSome persons could want to use it to backmail these candidates, seize their data and continue to manipulate them.\n\n\u201cSo, it is not like we like to control all what they are doing, but we must do it in the interest of these candidates, because if you leave it open, of course, there are many fraudsters that may want to take advantage of them, seize their data and continue to change and manipulate things.\n\n\u201cThere are so many reasons. You see, when you are not in the field, you are a better player. But when you are in the field, it takes so many other things for you to come out victorious,\u201d Oloyede explained.\n\nAccording to him, it will be easier for JAMB to ask candidates to do the registration online on their own, but with the the nature of what the board is doing, the candidate may be disadvantaged, as anybody could do anything.\n\nHe said that there was therefore no way the board would leave the registration open for the candidates for now, noting that good and attractive as it may sound, there was more to it.\n\nOloyede commended other service providers such as NIMC for a job well done, noting that so far, it had done well.\n\n\u201cI must also commend NIMC for what it has done so far, especially toward the build up of this registration exercise.\n\n\u201cFrom what I have seen this year, NIMC has done well. There might be a few problems here and there but definitely I respect the level of improvement in NIMC.\n\n\u201cI must say they have done well and I am proud of them,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, the board Head, Media and Information, Dr Fabian Benjamin, told NAN that only about 200,000 candidates were registered as at this time last year, compared to the 600,000 that had currently registered.\n\nOn the number of centres that would be participating in the conduct of the examination proper, Benjamin, who was in company with the registrar, noted that it was not yet certain, as monitoring was ongoing across the country.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, we are under monitoring exercise, any centre not found to be fit for the exercise will be delisted.\n\n\u201cSo, we do not have the exact number that would participate in this year\u2019s examination, until we are through with the monitoring exercise,\u201d he said.\n\nBenjamin noted, however, that over 700 centres were being used for the registration exercise.\n\nNAN reports that centres visited in Lagos include WAEC Test and Training Centre, Ogba, JKK centre, on Ikorodu Road, as well as Dalewares on Bode Thomas Street, off Ikorodu Road, among others.\n\n\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "ufolajimi Abegunde\n\nBy Abdulmin Murtala\n\nOlufolajimi Abegunde has spent three years of his six and half years conviction for money laundering in the United States of America prisons, but the bright and enterprising young man insists that his imprisonment was purely because he is black and a Nigerian and not based on real evidence. Abegunde popularly called LJ by his friends, told Encounter in a telephone conversion from his prison cell that a review of his case by the US Justice Department, would reveal a clear case of bias and racism against him by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI and the trial judge. According to him, several efforts to list his case for review have been futile as no one appears to be interested in listening to his appeal.\n\nRecalling his excitement upon being granted visa to study in the US, Abegunde told Encounter that he never imagined that four years after, he would be languishing in prison for an offence he did not commit.\n\nREAD ALSO:Reps reject bills seeking to stop children of public officers from schooling abroad\n\nJourney to US\n\nNarrating his journey from Nigeria to the US and his struggle to earn a living in the country, Abegunde said: \u201cI came to the United States in 2014. I studied in a top rated university in Texas. I eventually earned a Masters degree in Business Administration in 2016.\n\n\u201cI worked with a firm called Cock Automotive in Atlanta, Georgia. The company is a leading marketing and automotive corporation. I worked there as an interim marketing manager. After graduation, I founded an international money remittances, currencies exchange and remittances broking firm called LJ Williams. Our business was registered with the Central Bank of Nigeria which was a tedious process. We were also licensed and registered by the Chartered Department of Banking and Finance and also the Central Bank of Canada. Getting these licences also required a rigorous process. Fulfilling the requirement was tedious, rigorous and requires FBI background check. I was running this legitimate company until problem started.\n\nCourt account of Abegunde\u2019s alleged crime\n\nAccording to court records sighted by Encounter, Abegunde\u2019s travails began in August 2016 when his longtime friend, Ayodeji Ojo visited the US from Nigeria along with his pregnant wife and infant daughter. Ojo and his family were accommodated by Abegunde at his home in Atlanta, Georgia. In an interview by security agents,Ojo claimed that at the time of the visit, he had a wholly legitimate check of $26,900 that was issued to him by Bank of America. Ojo claimed that he intended to cash the check and utilise the funds for expenses associated with his family\u2019s trip, including medical expenses related to his pregnant wife.\n\nAccording to Ojo, after being unsuccessful in his attempts to cash the check at multiple Bank of America branches, due to the relatively large size of the check, he was advised by a Bank of America banker to open a new bank account at another bank, let the check go through the clearing process before the funds would become available to him.\n\nOjo said he chose Wells Fargo Bank, and at Wells Fargo, he was told that he was required to provide a valid identification document, and contact information for correspondence in the form of a US mailing address and a US mobile phone number. The court record quoted Ojo as saying: \u201cI informed the Wells Fargo banker that I was a visitor in the US and did not have a US mailing address and a US mobile phone number. After asking, the banker accepted that I could use Abegunde\u2019s address and mobile phone number to open the account.\u201d\n\nThe court records further stated that the bank account was opened on August 29, 2016, and Ojo was able to access the funds two days after without any challenges. \u2018The investigation found that after an approximately three- week stay in the US which involved staying in Abegunde\u2019s home, and travelling to other states, Ojo and his family returned to Lagos, Nigeria via Amsterdam, Netherlands on September 16, 2016 flying with Air France flight No KL0587 Resa, operated by KLM Royal Duch Airlines.\n\nAccording to Ojo, about the first week of October 2016, he needed to exchange some Nigerian Naira currency for the United States Dollar currency. As such, he contacted an informal vendor, Leke Adenuga, who after agreeing on the exchange rate, requested that Ojo provide his US bank account for the deposit of the agreed US Dollar amount of $9,000. The transaction was consummated, and Ojo eventually received the $9,000 in his Wells Fargo Bank account that he had provided Leke Adenuga.\n\nOn October 11, 2016 around one month after Ojo had departed the US; around two months after Ojo had opened the account at Wells Fargo Bank, and two months after Ojo accessed the proceeds of the wholly legitimate $26,900 check; according to court records, Brian Ancona, an investigator with Wells Fargo Bank called Abegunde on his mobile phone, the same mobile phone number Ojo had utilised to open Ojo\u2019s Wells Fargo Bank account, stating that a certain Luis Ramos Alonso had inadvertently deposited $9,000 into Ojo\u2019s bank account, and was seeking a reversal of the $9,000 deposit. According to court records, Abegunde told Ancona that the account owner was in Nigeria, and attempted a three-way call to connect Ancona with Ojo. The effort was, however, unsuccessful. Ojo eventually called Abegunde back, and after Abegunde conveyed Ancona\u2019s urgent message regarding the reversal, Ojo immediately agreed and authorised the reversal of the $9,000 deposit. When Ancona called Abegunde back, Abegunde conveyed Ojo\u2019s agreement authorising the reversal, and Ancona expressed his profound gratitude for Abegunde\u2019s cooperation in achieving the reversal.\u2019\n\nStrange indictment\n\nSpeaking with Encounter, Abegunde described his indictment for allowing a friend to use his address and telephone number, as the strangest thing that has ever happened to him. He said: \u201cThe transcripts of the proceedings in my case are all available on the court website. There is no answer to the question of why I was prosecuted in all the documents. They have not been able to tell me why I am being prosecuted.\n\n\u201cI am saying without a shadow of doubt that I am being prosecuted because I am a black man in America and a Nigerian. There is clearly no evidence that I committed any crime. What I was indicted of, the initial indictment is that I granted a friend permission to use my residential address and my phone number because he did not reside in the United States and did not have a US address and US phone number. That is what the indictment has to do with.\n\n\u201cAt the trial, the question was asked whether it was illegal to grant a friend permission to use your address and phone number to open a bank account and they said it was not a crime. So since that is not a crime, I can\u2019t say why I am in prison.\n\nI was arrested, humiliated\n\n\u201cI was arrested on February 7, 2018. Because of my noble act of granting a long-time old friend permission to use my address and phone number to open a bank account, I was unfairly and unjustly sentenced to 78 months in jail.\n\n\u201cThere is still nothing to show any crime I have committed in all the documents of my case. There is nothing to show what I did that is wrong.\n\n\u201cOn February 7, 2018, another friend of mine came to visit me from Nigeria in Atlanta, Georgia. So we had planned a trip to the Dominican Republic but due to unforseen circumstances, we had to change the plan. On that morning, we went to the airport to change the flight as the flight was to leave that morning. As soon as we were done changing the flight and walking out of the airport, some guys came to me and arrested me. They embarrassed me in front of everybody at the airport. I kept telling them: \u201cYou have the wrong person, it can never be me, I have no association with crime.\u2019 And all of a sudden, they pulled out an arrest warrant and I saw my name on the arrest warrant. And I saw that I have been charged with offence in Tennessee.\n\n\u201cI was charged with money laundering conspiracy. How they came about this, I don\u2019t know. It still remains a mystery to me. I chose to fight for my right, I chose to take my case to trial, I was offered a preview that would have set me free a long time ago but I chose to fight for my right because I know I am innocent.\u201d\n\nAlleges bias against FBI, Judge\n\nAbegunde accused the US justice system of compromising toward racist sentiments. He said: \u201cThis is what I will like the public to know. There is what is called an elephant in the room and the elephant in the room is big. People believe that for the United States Government or the FBI to put you in jail or to prosecute you, you must have committed a crime. All the evidence in my case shows the contrary. There is a criminal injustice system in the US for racial minorities, especially for black people. If you are black in the US, you are a target for the American injustice system.\n\n\u201cThe system is unjust, corrupt, stupefied and rotten but people don\u2019t know. People just say for this guy to be in jail, he must have done something wrong. But what I am telling everyone is to please look at the facts in my case. Look at the transcripts of my case and the indictment. I can assure you that there is no crime that I have committed, yet I am spending 78 months in prison for absolutely nothing.\n\nAppeal for help\n\nAppealing for a review of his case, Abegunde said: \u201cI need the public to turn the spotlight on my case. If the authorities, President Joe Biden and the Federal Attorney-General of the United States are aware of my case and it is reviewed, I will be removed immediately. I can assure you that the criminal prosecutors, FBI agents, that put me in this mess will be held accountable. That\u2019s all I want, if there is attention drawn to my case, I will get justice and the people that perpetrated this injustice will be held accountable. That is my appeal to anyone hearing me out there.\u201d",

          "title": "Vault Hill is building a human-centric metaverse. What about it?",
          "text": "Jimi Daodu has always been entrepreneurial. Back at Babcock University, he had established an entertainment business that organised parties in the school. After Daodu completed his master\u2019s programme in Advanced Computing at the University of Bristol, he wanted to stay back in the UK for a couple of years to work and earn back his master\u2019s fees. At the time, Daodu recalled, the British government allowed international students to apply for a post-work-study visa, which grants one a two-year stay in the UK. Daodu got the post-work-study visa, but things started to look grim when, for months, he couldn\u2019t get a job. Frustrated from his job search, Daodu contemplated booking a return ticket to Nigeria and returning to his shoe selling business.\n\nHe eventually got a job that sustained him until he got yet another which secured a visa for him and got him to stay. In the past decade, Daodu has worked in project management, hospitality, financial services, and the telecommunications industries all in the UK.\n\nDaodu was born in Lagos, Nigeria, and lived most of his years in the bustling city. He had studied Computer Science at Babcock University before going to the UK for a master\u2019s degree in Advanced Computing at the University of Bristol.\n\nIn 2017, Daodu got into the crypto space, Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin (BTC) were buzzy, so, he bought a couple. He then stumbled on virtual lands and saw them as an opportunity to diversify his digital assets and, as a Nigerian accustomed to the notion that land is the best investment, he bought some, even though he knew nothing about virtual lands. He got 8 plots of land in virtual spaces: 2 plots in Decentraland and 6 in Somnium Space for $200 each.\n\nThe idea for what would become a blockchain-based metaverse company, Vault Hill, started to form last February when he got an email stating that there was an offer on his land. He accepted the offer and sold a plot of land in Somnium Space for $10,000. He was stunned because he hadn\u2019t gotten such a high return from the stocks and shares he had purchased.\n\nHe realised that the only reason the buyer paid that much was because of the value associated with the virtual land, so, he realised that there was a market there. When he shared his idea with his friends, they said, \u201dJimi, you have come with your ideas again!\u201d But Daodu assured them: \u201cThis is the one.\u201d\n\nFounder and CEO of Vault Hill, Jimi Daodu\n\nIn May 2021, Daodu started bootstrapping Vault Hill by selling a few investments as well as plots of land in Somnium Space, for amounts ranging from $9,000 to $12,000. To differentiate itself from other virtual spaces and metaverse, Vault Hill City (Vault Hill\u2019s Metaverse) has four different islands and each island has 7 human-themed districts: Play, Romance, Curiosity, Community, Idealism, Vitality, and Imagination. \u201cEach district is human-themed to ensure the metaverse is open to everybody. This space is infinite; it is hard to choose a target audience, so we want to build an ecosystem where anyone can come in.\u201d Currently, the cost of a plot of land in a district in Vault Hill City range between $2,000 and $2,600.\n\nDaodu describing a metaverse, said, \u201cMetaverse is a shared virtual space. It\u2019s like Twitter, but in a gamified perspective\u2014the use of augmented reality and virtual reality. In a metaverse, you have to create a digital representation of yourself called an avatar, which allows you to navigate the digital world since you can\u2019t go into the digital world with your physical body.\u201d Daodu\u2019s definition of a metaverse involves a connection to the blockchain, decentralised finance, and freedom from control by the government, or even private individuals.\n\nIt is in respect to this vision that Vault Hill is building through 3 phases and at the end of the third phase, Vault Hill is handed over to a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO)\u2014the community of token and landowners\u2014which will be responsible for decision making on its metaverse.\n\nVault Hill is building a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace to allow NFT artists to list their art on the metaverse and display it to potential buyers through a gamified experience. Vault Hill is also encouraging companies to build edifices in their metaverse. The two plots of land Daodu bought on Decentraland were merged together to build Vault Hill\u2019s sales office.\n\nVault Hill is also partnering with Ready Player Me to build out avatars and incorporate digital wearables and limited-edition accessories. It is also partnering with Nigerian brands including Crivel Watches and Looks Like a Good Man for corporate and traditional wear. \u201cAdditionally, we are currently working to have interoperability of avatars. That is, using one avatar across multiple metaverses instead of having to create one for Vault Hill, and another for Decentraland,\u201d Vault Hill said. Vault Hill Part is also partnering with Lingua54 to use machine learning to translate the speeches of avatars across different languages in real time.\n\nAs funding was a constant headache for the team, Vault Hills started talking to traditional venture capitalists to raise funds, but a lot of them didn\u2019t understand what they were building. A senior colleague, at the time, had said \u201cIf you\u2019re talking to VCs, and they don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re building, you\u2019re doing something right.\u201d\n\nTo meet its funding needs, Vault Hill created a token called VHC token\u2014which is currently going for $0.003697 on Coin Market Cap, as of the time of writing. With it, Vault Hill raised $2.1 million in pre-pre-seed and private equity rounds, selling 25% of its total supply of tokens of 340 million. The majority of the fund will go into product development and hiring, Daodu said.\n\nMajority holders of the VHC token or majority landowners in the Vault Hill City will have voting power in the DAO. The VHC token will serve as a medium of a transaction within the metaverse, give majority token holders voting power in Vault Hill\u2019s proposed DAO and reward content creators when they get to sell or get traction for their artworks and content.\n\nDaodu speaks about the challenges of building a metaverse company: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a book on how to build a metaverse, so there isn\u2019t anything like what a good one looks like.\u201d But one challenge stands out: getting talent. \u201cYou need a host of developers\u2014extended reality developers, a mix of augmented and virtual reality developers, blockchain developers, full-stack developers, etc, but because it is an emerging technology and these skills are not taught in most traditional schools yet, they can be difficult to find.\u201d\n\nBut Daodu is optimistic, especially about the increase in VR adoption in recent years, which he said is both the cost and effect of the cost of the tech. \u201cAs adoption grows, the cost of technology always drops. The Oculus quest is retailing for $300, would that get to $50- $100 at some point in time? Absolutely. People are already spending $1,000 on an iPhone every year.\u201d\n\nDaodu noted that Vault Hill is not building an escapism platform, but intentionally thinking about how humans do things in the real world and then creating a way to augment it virtually\u2014with an ultimate aim of fostering human interaction. For example, in its Vitality district, it will collaborate with physiotherapists to help people with mental health challenges and create an augmented reality (AR) consultation service for London Bridge sports medicine, which will allow patients that can\u2019t come in physically for consultation in the hospital to get consultation services through augmented reality.\n\nThe first glance of Vault Hill City will be up by Q2 2022 and by the end of the year, it will be fully running. \u201cUsers will be able to design their own unique experiences, explore their fantasies, and also enjoy activities they do in the physical world such as interacting with other users, attending events, playing games, curating arts, exercising, host shows, visiting a library, build a music studio, and so much more,\u201d Vault Hill said. \u201cUsers will be able to access the metaverse using a virtual reality headset for a fully immersive experience. But they will also be able to explore the metaverse through laptops.\u201d\n\n\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Two years and 3 million rides later, can SafeBoda keep its lead in Nigeria?",
          "text": "On Wednesday, Ibadan-based Ugandan bike hailing startup SafeBoda clocked two years of operating in the Nigerian market.\n\nSafeBoda launched in Nigeria in December 2019 but started operations in January 2020. The startup had initially set to launch in May 2019 but months of deliberations\u2014including that of the best city market entry\u2014delayed its launch.\n\nThen, finally, in a surprising move which immediately created an outlier reputation for the company, SafeBoda skipped Lagos, the Nigerian commercial hub, to launch in Ibadan, a decision that continues to pay off\u2014especially considering that the Lagos government shutdown bike hailing businesses a month after it launched.\n\nSafeBoda\u2019s growth since its launch has been groundbreaking. In June 2020, about 6 months after its operation started, it reached a milestone of 100,000 rides. Also, in August 2020, it grew 150% and recorded 250,000 rides. And by the end of the year, while it was pausing its Kenyan operation, it celebrated half a million rides in Nigeria.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, its defining growth started when in April 2021, the startup reached the 1 million rides milestone; that\u2019s a 150% growth in a month. Prior to that, it had done the same rate quarterly, and since then to date, it\u2019s been bumping up the numbers.\n\nAs anyone would expect, an increase in the number of rides must have been the result of an increase in other proportional metrics. By June 2021, 100,000 passengers had signed up on the platform, and 3 months after that, its 8,000th rider was onboarded. And in November it was doing 20,000 rides daily.\n\nFast forward to today, SafeBoda claims to have recorded over 3 million rides, more than 10,000 riders, over 100,000 users, and completed 50,000 deliveries.\n\nThe startup currently offers 3 services in Nigeria: rides, deliveries, and airtime purchase. The payment vertical which has already launched in Uganda, will launch in Nigeria soon.\n\nThe end and the beginning of an era\n\nSafeBoda is endearing to people for many reasons. One of them is its first Nigeria Country Director Babajide Duroshola, who led the startup from launching till June last year when he exited for another East African startup that had just expanded into Nigeria.\n\nSafeBoda Nigeria\u2019s new Country Director Olaoluwa Arokoyu\n\nChanging leadership always comes with challenges and SafeBoda faced its fair share. But it quickly made an internal replacement when it appointed its Head of Operation Olaoluwa Arokoyu as CEO. Arokoyu had previously worked in operations with Opay and Jumia and joined SafeBoda 5 months prior to Duroshola\u2019s exit.\n\nEver since his appointment, Arokoyu has achieved some laudable milestones including taking the company from 2 million rides to over 3 million rides, optimising the app for address verification during the onboarding process to reduce fraudulent activities, and improving how riders are being paid to increase brand loyalty among riders.\n\nCreating a better experience for all\n\nSafeBoda says it\u2019s as compassionate with its riders the same way it is with passengers. It says in a statement that it\u2019s constantly looking for a better way to increase the earning power of its riders while giving passengers a good experience. \u201cAs a result of this increased earning power, SafeBoda riders and their families have access to a more quality lifestyle.\u201d\n\n\u201cSafeBoda\u2019s primary mission is to provide a better standard of living for drivers and customers. Everything we do is aligned with this goal,\u201d Arokoyu told TechCabal.\n\nSafeBoda\u2019s riders in Ibadan\n\nFor SafeBoda riders like Ghazali Saheed, who\u2019s the 5964th rider that joined the bike-hailing startup, the best thing about SafeBoda is the respect they [the riders] get from customers that other riders don\u2019t get. \u201cSafeBoda also makes it easy to set targets and reach them. It\u2019s easy for us to know where to get a lot of orders so that we can easily reach our targets,\u201d he said.\n\nLike many bike-hailing startups, SafeBoda is also destigmatising bike [okada] riding in Ibadan and Nigeria as a whole. The way it looks, it\u2019s like these bike-hailing companies are formalising a sector that\u2019s been informal for a long time.\n\n\u201cThe okada or boda business isn\u2019t categorised to be prestigious within African communities. But with a touch of orange, the story is different. SafeBoda riders are highly regarded and respected, not just because of the colour but because of their conduct,\u201d said Clement Obaro, Growth Manager at SafeBoda.\n\nCompetition is stronger than ever\n\nDue to SafeBoda\u2019s success in Ibadan, it has become apparent that the city is the new juicy spot for the bike-hailing market and, as a result of that, it has also become a battleground. Everybody wants a piece of the pie. Uber last month launched its bike-hailing arm in Ibadan and joined the host of others like MaxNG, ORide, and Gokada to snag more market share from SafeBoda.\n\n\u201cWe have been expecting this to happen and now that it has, we are not worried. Our focus is to keep giving the best experience to our customers and keeping our riders happy and willing to complete more rides daily,\u201d said Arokoyu. \u201cThe sky is wide enough for all birds to fly; healthy competition is always good for business.\u201d\n\nSafeBoda is one of the most active bike-hailing companies in sub-Saharan Africa as it holds more than 80% market share in Uganda and Nigeria. Uber and Bolt had first launched their bike-hailing product in Uganda but couldn\u2019t beat SafeBoda.\n\nIf combining the popularity and capital war chest of Uber and Bolt, the two most powerful mobility startups in the world, couldn\u2019t beat SafeBoda in Uganda, there\u2019s no saying that only Uber can pull it off in Nigeria. But it\u2019s a different market, however, with the level of loyalty SafeBoda has built among riders and customers, it won\u2019t be an easy call to dominate over it in Ibadan.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Facebook content moderators in Kenya will receive a 30-50% pay rise. This announcement comes two weeks after an investigation report by TIME revealed that content moderators in Nairobi were subject to poor pay and working conditions by Sama, a company responsible for Facebook\u2019s sub-Saharan Africa content moderation since 2019.\n\nEvery content moderator will receive an extra 20,000 Kenyan shillings ($176) per month, Sama told employees in a meeting on Tuesday, sources revealed to TIME.\n\n\u201cThe raise means that the lowest-paid Facebook content moderators at Sama will now take home around 50,000 Kenyan shillings ($439) each month after-tax, or around $2.20 per hour for a 9-hour working day. This is up from around $1.50 per hour previously.\u201d\n\nAll content moderators were also promised yearly bonuses worth one month of their salary, as an incentive to remain at the company, according to the sources.\n\nDespite the obvious correlation, Habel Kamau, a human resources director at Sama\u2019s Nairobi office, said that the salary increase wasn\u2019t a result of the release of the investigation by TIME. He claimed that the conversations about a salary increase had been ongoing for a while now, adding that the pay raise was made possible due to budget cuts from other places and not as a result of Sama receiving additional money from Facebook.\n\nAlthough the pay raise is welcomed by many of the content moderators, some still say it\u2019s not enough. Sama employees remain some of Facebook\u2019s lowest-paid workers anywhere in the world. While the lowest starting salary of a Facebook content moderator at Sama is $2.20 per hour, outsourced content moderators for Facebook in the U.S. are paid a typical starting salary of $18 per hour.\n\nSouth African Daniel Motaung, a former employee of Sama who was fired after trying to lead a union, noted that in 2019 employees had requested for their pay to be doubled. \u201cThis increase will make a difference but it won\u2019t change their lives,\u201d Motaung said in the statement. \u201cThey still won\u2019t be able to buy a house or feed their families in line with the \u2018lifting the poor out of poverty\u2019 narrative that Sama continuously boasts about.\u201d\n\nSama didn\u2019t comment on allegations that its managers suppressed a unionization effort in 2019, which led to Motaung losing his Job. Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company also declined to comment on the announcement of the pay raise.\n\nThe announcement of the pay raise is seen as a win for the content moderators and validation of the power in employees speaking up.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

I asked because it has become a catchword in a country with over 56 million unbanked adults.\n\nFinancially included individuals have access to basic financial services like a savings account, credit, and insurance. Also, a higher exclusion rate in Nigeria could result in a poorer population because a lack of access to credit and insurance places them at a competitive economic disadvantage.\n\nThe Enhancing Financial Innovation Access\u2019 (EFInA), Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2020 Survey (a2f) (PDF), shows that Nigeria has one of the highest rates of financial exclusion in Africa at 35.9%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsequently, given the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) goal to increase that figure to 94% by 2024, there is still much work to be done. And recently, the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) has joined the fray.\n\nNIPOST unveiled its new agency banking platform at a ceremony in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja, in January 2022. The platform includes a free debit card that can be used both offline and online, and it is available at all NIPOST locations in Nigeria\u2019s 774 local governments.\n\nThe agency banking platform, according to Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, would conform to the Universal Postal Union\u2019s (UPU) financial inclusion standards. He also stated that this is a part of the government\u2019s plan to digitise postal services and increase financial inclusion in the country.\n\nWhat is the plan? How do they intend to achieve this? You can catch up with this here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nHow to improve customer experience\n\nMTN in the metaverse\n\nSudo Africa\u2019s $3.7 million pre-seed\n\nChari\u2019s new acquisition\n\nImproving customer experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the most memorable customer service experience you\u2019ve had? It could be a good or a bad one, but trust me when I say that the bad ones outnumber the good ones, at least for me.\n\nThe most recent experience I had was on Wednesday. I wanted to buy plantain, so I inquired about the price due to its size. \u201cOmo,\u201d I said after hearing the price. \u201cThese plantains aren\u2019t good for this price\u2026\u201d I wasn\u2019t even done when the vendor cut me short, saying, \u201cGo and buy it elsewhere if it\u2019s too small.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not surprised, right? What exactly did I say to deserve that? I was indirectly expressing my dismay about the country\u2019s economic situation, and she responded in that manner? I didn\u2019t even think twice; I left for somewhere else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou might not have experienced this with roadside vendors, but you may have had similar dealings with telcos, retailers, or big corporations, ranging from a long wait time to being treated rudely or simply haven\u2019t been shown empathy.\n\nCustomer experience \u2013 the feeling or memory that a customer or prospective customer has whenever they come in contact with a business \u2013 is dependent on a company\u2019s customer service.\n\nSo, how can customer experience be enhanced? Apart from demonstrating empathy or helping employees understand customers aren\u2019t angry or frustrated with them, but with the product or service, you can use tools to help improve this experience. And that is exactly what MyServiceAgent does for businesses.\n\nMyServiceAgent is a technology company offering a variety of tools to businesses to improve the customer experience. Chimgozirim walks us through what they do and how the company uses AI to help companies to improve their customer experience.\n\nPlease read it here: Built in response to COVID-19, MyServiceAgent now helps businesses improve customer experience with AI\n\nMTN in the metaverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s no news that African telecom, MTN, has joined the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Shopify in betting big on the metaverse by purchasing 144 plots of land in Africarare, South Africa\u2019s first metaverse.\n\nWhat exactly is the Metaverse? The concept of a metaverse is not new. It was first described in the novel Snow Crash, published in 1992. Several companies later created online communities based on the concept, the most notable was Second Life, which debuted in 2003.\n\nAccording to Investopedia, it is a digital reality that combines aspects of social media, online gaming, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and cryptocurrencies to allow users to interact virtually.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means the metaverse is a shared virtual world that people can access via the Internet. In other words, it is a virtual world in which people can live, work, shop, and interact with others from the comfort of their room in the real world.\n\nIn the metaverse, technologies VR and AR are combined to create a sense of \u201cvirtual presence.\u201d\n\nAlso, the term \u201cmetaverse\u201d did not become popular until Facebook changed its corporate name to Meta in October 2021. At the time, the company announced plans to invest $10 billion over the next year to realise its vision of the metaverse.\n\nThe big question is, why did MTN decide to join the Metaverse? Is it to follow a trend, improve customers\u2019 digital experiences, or what?

Approximately 50,000 merchants use the platform for credit and bookkeeping services. It allows these businesses to manage the credit they extend to their customers.\n\nYesterday, the company announced that it had acquired Axa Credit, the credit branch of Axa Assurance Maroc, for $22 million.\n\nWhat does Chari do? Chari is a mobile app that allows small retailers in Morocco and Tunisia to order products from Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) multinationals and local manufacturers and receive them in less than 24 hours. It was founded in 2020 by Ismael Belkhayat (CEO) and Sophia Alj (Co-founder).\n\nThe acquisition of Axa Credit will provide Chari with the credit licence required to begin lending to its FMCG B2B clients, who will then lend money to their consumer clients.\n\nChari believes that shop owners understand their customers\u2019 spending habits, where they live, and when and how they are paid, and thus can perform the credit risk assessment that a traditional bank cannot.\n\nThe company intends to charge merchants a setup fee and low-interest rates as it gains more users.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nHow to Make \u2018Friends\u2019 with Anxiety: A Simple Technique to Gain Perspective.

          "title": "Inside NIPOST\u2019s latest financial inclusion play: Agency banking and fingerprint authentication",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the fintech space, phrases like \u201cfinancial inclusion\u201d and \u201cbanking the unbanked\u201d have become so prevalent that they\u2019ve almost certainly become buzzwords. Sometimes, it appears that a fintech startup claiming to be the latest saviour is born every second.\n\nThis is hardly surprising considering the proliferation of fintech startups in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem and the largely unsolved problem of the unbanked. According to the Enhancing Financial Innovation Access\u2019 (EFInA), Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2020 Survey (a2f) (PDF), the country\u2019s financial exclusion rate is 35.9% \u2014 one of the highest in Africa.\n\nThat leaves almost 54% unbanked. Considering the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) plan to increase that number to 94% by 2024, there\u2019s still quite a bit to be done. And the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) has recently thrown its hat in this ring.\n\nIn January 2022, NIPOST unveiled its new agency banking platform at a ceremony in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja. The platform comes with a free debit card that works offline and online and is available at all NIPOST outlets in Nigeria\u2019s 774 local governments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, the agency banking platform would follow the Universal Postal Union\u2019s (UPU) standards on financial inclusion. He also said that this is part of the government\u2019s plan to digitise the postal services and improve financial inclusion in the country.\n\nHow would this work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy UPU standards, NIPOST\u2019s agency banking platform should provide essential services like savings, payments, money transfers, insurance, and credit. However, it appears the platform would work much like a multi-teller PoS-based service, so the exact mechanics of how NIPOST hopes to serve its customers are a bit sketchy.\n\nTechpoint Africa sent a mail to the Postmaster General\u2019s office but received no reply and a visit to the NIPOST headquarters in Ile-Ife, Osun State, revealed that not much is known about the platform yet other than its March expected launch date.\n\nHowever, NIPOST is licensed by the CBN as a super agent and, by CBN guidelines, cannot provide insurance or credit facilities.\n\nAccording to Pantami, the free debit card would use biometric authentication.\n\nIn Africa, South Africa-based fintech, Paycode, provides biometric debit cards, which the company says are operational in several countries, including Namibia, Botswana, Nigeria, and Mozambique. In Namibia, Paycode works with the Namibia Post Ltd (NamPost).\n\nA biometric debit card uses the owner\u2019s fingerprints to authenticate transactions, ensuring additional security and ease of use by the uneducated, thus making it suitable for financial inclusion, especially in rural areas.\n\nThis also means the card can be used offline. For example, Paycode says anyone with access to its API can verify users biometrically without connecting to the Internet. ExtoLabs, a California-based software company with plans to launch in Africa, uses a Bluetooth connection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn unknown player\n\nInterestingly, NIPOST did not mention a partnership with any fintech company to deliver this card. However, pictures of the ceremony in Abuja reveal a name \u2014 GingrPay \u2014 etched on the demo cards.\n\nA Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) search uncovered a company named GingrPay Nigeria Limited incorporated on May 18, 2021. A Google search led to a third party website with more info like directors, shareholders, persons with significant control, and companies where GingrPay company officers show up as directors or shareholders.\n\nThe website cites GingrPay\u2019s activity description as \u201cTo facilitate electronic circulation of money as well as the exchange of value between individuals and organisations on a timely and consistent basis using technological softwares.\u201d\n\nA search on the CBN website does not turn up any licence registered to the company name.\n\nVisiting other nations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, postal services are no strangers to providing financial services. In Brazil, Correios, the state-owned postal company, operates the Banco Postal in partnership with Banco do Brasil, providing banking services to the unbanked.\n\nIn India, the India Post Payments Bank is a subsidiary of the India Post and has been in operation since September 2018, serving over four crore \u2014 40 million \u2014 customers. Initially, because the India Post appeared to be haemorrhaging money, there was some resistance to the initiative.\n\nOn the continent, in Ghana, the Ghana Post provides various financial services like agency banking in partnership with banks, insurance, and GhPostPay, which enables users to make online transactions. Remittance services are currently suspended.\n\nIn the Benin Republic, government-owned Le poste du B\u00e9nin enables customers to have both savings and current accounts, and provides credit facilities, insurance, and remittance.\n\nNamibia\u2019s NamPost gives customers access to a funeral cover and a savings bank that provides investment products, and save-as-you-earn accounts, among other things.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, postal services are used by significantly poorer persons, older, less educated, and people less likely to be employed than those who have an account at a financial institution or both a financial institution and the post office.\n\nLogically, it follows that postal institutions are essential to fostering financial inclusion.\n\nThe financial inclusion play\n\nNIPOST has made several attempts in this arena.\n\nIn 2017, it signed a partnership agreement with Nigerian fintech startup, Paga, to improve financial inclusion.\n\nOn a call with Techpoint Africa, Arike Okunowo, General Manager, Sales and Distribution, explained that the partnership broke down after a few months because there were some issues surrounding the staffing needed to successfully run the business.\n\nThe partnership saw Paga provide the platform, which NIPOST\u2019s workers manned. But Okunowo explained that the staff already had primary assignments and this created conflict.\n\nAs she told Techpoint Africa, \u201cIf you want to run financial services, you need some level of focus so that if the customer comes in, you are always available to attend to them.\u201d\n\nShe also said that NIPOST was very keen on having its staff man the platform with no third-party interference. However, she also said that they would be open to a possible partnership with the postal company in the future.\n\nOn its financial services page, the postal service company says it provides domestic transfers, international remittance, agency banking \u2013 this appears to have been on the page since April 23, 2021 \u2013 and mobile money services.\n\nNIPOST owns an International Money Transfer Operators (IMTO) licence and says it has partnered with companies like Western Union.\n\nA visit to the NIPOST headquarters in Ile-Ife, Osun State, revealed that the agency no longer carries out any of these services and doesn\u2019t seem to have done so for a while, an offshoot of Pantami\u2019s decision in 2019, which saw the agency adopt a cashless policy. All cash transactions, including remittance, are to be done in a banking hall.\n\nThere are also plans to create a microfinance bank.\n\nWhat industry players are saying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkunowo believed NIPOST\u2019s infrastructure makes it a good centrepoint as a shared resource.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say NIPOST should actually be a shared resource for all the providers because of its infrastructure, and because it\u2019s such a major part of the Nigerian state.\u201d\n\nWhile Edidiong Uwemakpan, Director, Brand and Corporate Communications, TeamApt, believed the decision is commendable, she worried about fraud.\n\n\u201cWhere I begin to find challenges is that you were trying to eliminate cash. Now, part of agency banking is, of course, bill payments, and that makes sense. But then the cash in, cash out part of things, that\u2019s where I don\u2019t really see how they plan to do it.\n\n\u201cBecause, are you going to be giving your NIPOST workers a float so that they can give people cash? And you were already trying to eliminate cash in the past because of fraud.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that NIPOST appears not to have partnered with well-known fintechs. And while Okunowo could not confirm if NIPOST had approached Paga, Uwemakpan said TeamApt did not receive any communication from the postal agency.\n\nHowever, though Uwemakpan believed that the market is big enough to contain everyone, she raises concerns regarding the number of outlets NIPOST has \u2013 3,000 \u2013 and whether this would be enough to serve customers. She said NIPOST might need to expand its reach to compete.\n\nOne thing Okunowo and Uwemakpan agreed on is that this endeavour requires quite a lot of investment by NIPOST.\n\nA digital economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, the Federal Government of Nigeria announced a three-year modernisation plan for NIPOST. By 2020, the postal agency was to have been unbundled into six subsidiaries: NIPOST Banking and Insurance Company; NIPOST Property and Development Company; NIPOST Transport and Logistics Services Company; NIPOST E-government Services Company; and NIPOST E-commerce Services Company.\n\nIn January 2022, speaking at a media parley held in Abuja, Dr Ismail Adewusi, Postmaster General and CEO of NIPOST, said that NIPOST was to be unbundled once more, this time, in three places: NIPOST Properties and Development Company; NIPOST Transport and Logistics Company; and NIPOST Microfinance Bank Limited.\n\nHe also said the unbundling would be done before the end of January 2022. However, there has been no announcement to that effect.\n\nThe NIPOST Act is still in the process of being repealed, and the Nigerian Postal Service (Repeal and Reenactment) Act 2021, passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives in 2021, is currently awaiting assent by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nWhen assented to, this means that NIPOST can be unbundled into whatever subsidiaries it sees fit and would hold regulatory powers, making the Postal Agency a Commission.\n\nNIPOST has also partnered with several private companies on its path to full digitisation. In December 2021, it announced an agreement with Egyptian startup, eGATE to create an app that automates last-mile delivery. Customers will be able to track communication with drivers and monitor their delivery.\n\nIn 2018, NIPOST introduced its Address Verification System and Digital Address System. Both were done in collaboration with identity verification startup, Youverify, to improve mail delivery and resolve addressing issues, but the link to the website leads to a dummy page.\n\nHowever, interestingly, there are plans to launch a digital postal code system that is expected to solve the same problem before the end of the first quarter of 2022.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the surface level, NIPOST does seem to have a lot planned that should benefit the average citizen, but implementation and consistency appear to be lacking.\n\nTo pull off its latest scheme, it might require an overhaul of its entire processes \u2013 like its unbundling, for instance. But these are still early days, and there is much that can still happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Chelsea is the seventh most valuable club in world football, according to KPMG football benchmark. The club was valued at \u00a32.4 billion by Forbes in April 2021. But since then, they have won a second Champions League title, and a Club World Cup \u2013 last month \u2013 to increase the club\u2019s value.\n\nRoman Abramovich is interested in selling Chelsea and Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss has shown significant interest.

Plenty of that money has gone into signing first-team players and Chelsea\u2019s current squad is worth close to \u00a31 billion, according to the club\u2019s latest financial results.\n\nRead also: Chelsea for sale: Hansjorg Wyss and 4 others who may buy\n\nThe owner of Chelsea wants to retrieve all of that money as part of the sale, which is why his asking price is said to be too high for some.\n\nThe Blues have won every trophy available to be won since Abramovich purchased the club in 2003, bringing with it immense money and riches as they became one of the world\u2019s most successful clubs.\n\nFive Premier Leagues, five FA Cups, three League Cups, two Community Shields, two UEFA Champions Leagues, two UEFA Europa Leagues, one UEFA Super Cup, and one FIFA Club World Cup are among the trophies in the clubs trophy cabinet.\n\nThere have been calls for further sanctions for Chelsea\u2019s owner, due to his alleged connections to Vladimir Putin and his regime, following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut one problem that stands in the way of potential buyers for the west London football club is the high asking price put up by Abramovich. Wyss told Swiss German-language newspaper Blick that it was \u201cfar too much\u201d.\n\nThe Russian billionaire is estimated to be worth \u00a39.4 billion, and he has so far turned down all proposals that fall short of his expectations.\n\nAccording to Wyss, he is eager to sell the club quickly, and if this is the case, Abramovich may have no choice but to accept a somewhat lower offer than what he has asked.",

          "title": "Amid poor power supply, FG vows to sanction Discos",
          "text": "As many homes and businesses continue to groan under poor power supply and lack of prepaid meters, the Nigerian government has vowed to sanction \u201cunderperforming\u201d distribution companies.\n\nThis comes more than eight years after the country\u2019s power sector was privatised, leading to the transfer of the distribution and generation companies carved out of the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria to core investors on November 1, 2013.\n\nThe total power generation in the country fell to 4,117 megawatts as of 6am on Thursday from 4,470.1MW on Tuesday, according to the Nigerian electricity system operator.\n\nIn recent weeks, major cities across the country have witnessed worse-than-usual levels of power cuts.\n\nThe Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, at a press briefing in Abuja, said the performance management of the distribution companies (Discos) had been fully transferred to the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) from the Bureau for Public Enterprise (BPE) as of January 2022.\n\n\u201cWe have a robust team led by the Boston Consulting Group performing a diagnostic of the performance of Discos from post privatisation to December 2021 and the results will be concluded soon,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBased on the results, actions will be taken against underperforming Discos under the guidelines of our contractual agreements,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, the enforcement of contractual agreements and regulatory clarity is the best way to bring underperforming Discos into compliance and improve the market.\n\nOn what it described as \u201cevolutions in the ownership of Discos,\u201d the minister noted that Abuja and Ibadan Discos \u201chave commercial transitions ongoing through UBA and AMCON respectively.\u201d\n\nThe Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) had on January 20 this year took over the control of IBEDC over the inability of the Disco to clear its acquisition loan obtained from the then Skye Bank, now Polaris Bank.\n\nA court ruling empowered AMCON to take over the asset and IBEDC immediately came under receivership.\n\nAbuja Disco also had issues with the United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA) over acquisition loans.\n\nNERC and BPE disclosed in a joint statement in December that there was a dispute with UBA over the inability of AEDC\u2019s core investor, KANN Utility Company Limited, to service its debt to the bank.\n\nBPE agreed with the lender\u2019s request to exercise its powers as receiver/manager over KANN by exercising its power over the 60 per cent equity in AEDC as a means of recovering the acquisition granted by the bank.\n\nAnalysts at CSL Stockbrokers had noted in a recent report that since the conclusion of the privatisation, the Discos had remained the weakest link in the electricity value chain \u201cas they have been grappling with enormous operational challenges.\u201d\n\nThey said the most obvious challenge had been the absence of cost-reflective tariffs that limited their ability to fulfil their financial obligations to the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET), leading NBET to default in its contractual obligation to the generation companies.\n\nRead also: Ikeja Electric, Eko DisCo, explain reason for constant power outage\n\nThe analysts had said, \u201cThe overall impact is that the power sector has continually suffered a cash crunch, forcing the government to inject funds to avert a total collapse. Despite a series of government interventions, the problems in the power sector prevail.\n\n\u201cAlthough we acknowledge that the challenges in the nation\u2019s power sector run across the entire value chain, we believe the distribution companies are the most troubled.\u201d\n\nThe power minister also said plans were in top gear to kick off the second phase of the country\u2019s mass metering programme, adding that contracts would be awarded by the end of the first quarter of 2022.\n\n\u201cWe are working assiduously to ensure that all locations in the country are metered through the National Mass Metering Program. DISCOs that fail to perform will be sanctioned,\u201d he added.\n\nData obtained from the latest report by electricity regulator, NERC, showed that only 4,529,497 (about 40.95 per cent) had meters, out of a total 11,058,939 registered energy customers as of June 30, 2021.\n\n\u201cWe aim to provide meters for all households and eliminate the metering gap,\u201d Aliyu said.\n\nHe said the ongoing maintenance work on some power plants around the country contributed to outages at a time where low water levels were witnessed in dams.\n\nThe minister said, \u201cWe are having maintenance work in the Eastern Axis around Odukpani leading to reduced power supply from the usually reliable NDPHC Calabar Power Plant and we are having challenges at Okoloma Gas Station linked to Afam VI power plant.\n\n\u201cWe are working on NNPC and gas suppliers also to improve the pressure on the Western Axis that is precluding units from reaching optimum supply.\u201d",

The shift in date, though has been kicked against by some members of the party, has provided the chairmanship aspirants the opportunity to reach out more.\n\nAbout 12 chieftains of the party are jostling for the position among who are former governors, a serving minister, as well as serving and former members of the National Assembly.\n\nSome of the aspirants are said to have the blessing of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nInitially, it was said that the choice had been narrowed down to three of the aspirants, namely, Tanko Al\u2019Makura (Nasarawa State), George Akume (Benue State) and Abubakar Bawa Bwari (Niger State).\n\nOther remaining nine aspirants are former deputy national chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Saliu Mustapha, former governor of Borno State, Ali Modu Sheriff and Senator representing Niger East District, Mohammed Sani-Musa.\n\nOthers are former governors of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari, Bauchi State, Isa Yuguda, Borno State, Kashim Shettima, Gombe State, Danjuma Goje, Sunny Moniedafe and Mohammed Saidu-Etsu.\n\nBut it would seem that the permutation has changed with the purported endorsement of Abdullahi Adamu, a former governor of Nasarawa State, as national chairman and Ken Nnamani, a former Senate president, as deputy national chairman, South.\n\nShortly after the meeting of the APC governors and other chieftains in Abuja last week Tuesday, Senator Adamu had met with governors of the North Central, including Yahaya Bello, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq (Kwara); Simon Lalong (Plateau); Abubakar Sani Bello (Niger) and Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State, whiched fuelled the permutation that he had indeed been anointed by the President.\n\nRead also: Convention: APC rebirth group kicks against Adamu, Nnamani \u201cendorsement\u201d for chairman, deputy\n\nBut Ali Modu-Sheriff, a former governor of Borno State said he was not aware of any official statement by Buhari on endorsement of any particular candidate and zoning of the chairmanship position.\n\n\u201cOf late, I have been inundated by insinuations that President Muhammadu Buhari has endorsed a candidate for this all important position in our party\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cI am in the race for the National Chairmanship position of our party APC because of my strength of character, capacity and competence. My intentions are clear and explicitly for public good rather than self-interest,\u201d Modu-Sheriff said.\n\nHe further said, \u201cAs a loyal party member, I will abide by decisions of Mr President at any time he makes an official decision on zoning or endorsement of any particular candidate. I have unequivocal confidence in Mr President\u2019s capacity to make the right choice for the growth of our party.\n\n\u201cI am totally committed to work with anyone/everyone to reposition our party towards actualising a resounding victory in 2023 general elections and beyond. Our guiding principle will be the party\u2019s constitution and manifesto, and I will be committed to it.\u201d\n\nMohammed Sani Musa, a serving senator and chairmanship aspirant in continuation of his lobby with leaders and stakeholders within the party, recently paid a courtesy visit to Nasir El-Rufai, Kaduna State governor, to seek his support.\n\nSani Musa, alongside members of his campaign team, was warmly received by the host, Governor El-Rufai.\n\nHe pledged to re-engineer the party if given the opportunity to lead the APC. He also emphasised the need for the party to have the right leadership, to enable it strategise and open for all Nigerians ahead of the 2023 general election and beyond.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said his administration will partner the federal government on the management of the Okomu National Park, to revitalize the park and strengthen security in the area.\n\nObaseki disclosed this on Thursday while addressing the Conservator of the Okomu National Park, Mr. Augustine Obekpa, when he visited the park in Udo Community, Ovia South-West Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe governor also stated plans to send a forestry bill to the Edo State House of Assembly for consideration to bolster efforts at protecting the state\u2019s forest reserves.\n\nHe noted, \u201cWe are going to be sending a forestry bill to the Edo State House of Assembly for consideration next week. We will make sure that we expand the law beyond forestry assets to also cover the natural assets found around the forest.\n\n\u201cWe want to collaborate with the National Park Service. I will visit the Minister of Environment to offer her a certain proposal to allow the Edo State Government to jointly manage the park with the federal government because this is our resource.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cWith that collaboration, it means that we would put in more resources. We would like to increase the number of rangers and park officers to protect not only this park but some other reserves that are around us here, particularly the Okumo Reserve and the Gelegele Reserve.\n\n\u201cWe will pay for the new hires under such an arrangement. We will upgrade your training, as well as provide more facilities and amenities for the park.\n\n\u201cNobody will come here if they don\u2019t feel secure and safe. This does not apply only to the park and the resources around this area, but it is important for people to know that they are secured when they come in to enjoy nature.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will make sure that we improve the security of this park and expose the beauty and ecotourism opportunities of the park,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki further stated, \u201cWe have been hearing of nefarious activities of criminal elements, both in the park and the forest reserve, and also the Okomu Oil Palm Company. Today, we are on a fact finding visit to examine what exactly is going on in the park.\n\n\u201cWe have to find out the number of attacks, where the attacks are coming from and see how the state government can come in and collaborate effectively with the park using the full security system in the state to deal with the security challenges that we have here.\n\n\u201cGovernment will not just sit back and allow the kind of criminality that we are seeing in this area. Our worry is that if we don\u2019t confront them now, it will get out of hand.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping to get the full report from you and to understand clearly how the criminals are operating. We saw a truck outside the premises which I believe was recently seized with high quality wood.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know how expensive these items are. Our concern is that these criminals come in, log illegally and take the logs out, sell them and procure more arms and come in to occupy the territory,\u201d Obaseki noted.\n\nIn his remarks, the Conservator of the Okomu National Park said the park is home to white-throated monkeys, Buffalo and Elephants, noting that farming, hunting and illegal logging was affecting the natural habitats of the animals.\n\nObekpa appealed to the governor for logistics support to enable them to effectively protect the forest assets.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

(It allows Nigerian men\u2019s foreign-born wives to be awarded automatic citizenship); Deny Nigerian women indigeneity through marriage; Deny 35 per cent appointed positions for women and settling for 20 per cent; Deny women affirmative action in party administration and leadership; and Deny specific seats for women in the National Assembly, among others.\u201d\n\nHe noted: \u201cIn Edo State, we have a healthy mix of women in our cabinet, as they occupy more than 30 percent of positions of commissioners and Special Advisers in government. They provide invaluable service to ensure the proper functioning of the engine of government.

We were about 15 in the house then, I was a prayer warrior and haven\u2019t even started a ministry. The Lord spoke to me to bless you and I present to you this N5million to start your own business,\u201d Fufeyin said.\n\nLeft in tears, Ebi said that she never expected that her story would be turned around by the prophet.\n\n\u201cI am so happy because I do not expect this. I have been praying and my encouragement to others is for them to pray and have strong belief,\u201d Ebi said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe equally called out Brume, who he was owing N25,000 and gifted him N2million, saying that the man was helpful to his rising.\n\nAccording to the prophet, he was into retailing of pharmaceutical products and was buying on wholesale from Brume but things turned for the worse and he couldn\u2019t pay back a debt of N25,000 at the time.\n\n\u201cI used to run and take different routes to avoid him. Because of the N25,000, I started looking for ways to buy from other wholesalers. But he did not take it against me. Today, I am paying back that N25,000 with N2million,\u201d he told the congregation.\n\nResponding, Brume disclosed that his business had already gone down and that the prophet\u2019s N2m gift appeared as a miracle money that will help him back on track.",

After days, which turned into weeks of grandstanding, we were able to meet with our client- Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cIn his unshaken/undeterred resolve, Onyendu was in high spirits as he took time to explain why he protested against the denial of access to his lawyers during the last three successive visits.\n\n\u201cHe was deeply troubled with those incidents, particularly when it was done in flagrant disregard and violation of extant orders of the court. We understood Onyendu\u2019s grouse and seized the opportunity to intimate him of the measures we have taken so far to ensure that such ugly incident does not reoccur.\n\n\u201cOnyendu used the opportunity to offer advice and words of encouragement, particularly to myself. He took his time to urge me to remain resolute and focused, and never to be distracted by the deliberate evil ploys of the enemies to break me.\n\n\u201cIndeed, Onyendu saw tomorrow! Unknown to him that at the time he was handing down these words of encouragement and encomium, the slander mongers were hurriedly putting together another stunt which, was, however, dead on arrival.\n\n\u201cOnyendu particularly encouraged me to be strong and even stronger in the coming days. He said that I should expect more and more slander, but I should be assured that he and Umuchineke will always be there for me.\n\n\u201cWe all agreed that this is a very critical period as victory is staring on our faces and, any opportunity offered to be distracted will take us back because the enemies are united in their resolve but their evil plots are all surmountable.\n\n\u201cAs for me, I am firm and solid any day any time. I remain firm like the rock of Gibraltar! Forward ever and backward never. On a lighter note, Onyendu requested his visiting team to make out time to hang out and enjoy some bottles of drinks.\n\n\u201cIn summary, Onyendu is in a very strong and firm spirit now than before. He implores all his followers and Umuchineke to remain undivided, resolute, and unshaken in their resolve for victory.\n\n\u201cOnyendu assures everyone that he will come out victorious and stronger. He commended his supporters and Umuchineke, and urged you to remain prayerful and continue to be peaceful in your conduct as you have always demonstrated over time.

          "text": "Indications emerged on Friday to the effects that the division in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) may have deepened further after some key party members discovered, via leaked documents, how President Muhammadu Buhari single-handedly dictated the composition of the next Executive Committee of the party.\n\nThe APC has been grappling with conflicts of interests with its chieftains jostling for who controls the incoming leadership of the party and by implication, has the upper hand in deciding the party\u2019s next presidential flagbearer.\n\nPresident Buhari has tactically avoided openly naming or endorsing his successor, but handpicking the APC Executive Committee according to insiders within the party, will enable him to single-handedly decide who runs to succeed him on the party\u2019s ticket.\n\nDocuments made available to Daily Independent on Friday, shows that President Buhari personally endorsed all the plans and choices of candidates presented to him by a clique in the party that is reportedly made up of some northern governors and ministers in his cabinet.\n\nThe documents show that the President has signed off on Senator Abdullahi Adamu as National Chairman, Senator John Akpanudoedehe from the south-south geopolitical zone as National Secretary and Senator Ken Nnamani from the south-east as Deputy National Chairman (South). The president also signed off on other positions that have been pinned down to geopolitical zones.\n\nA source close to Kaduna Government House, who craved anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, confirmed the documents, saying, \u201cBaba (President Buhari) endorsing the zoning formula and the candidate has closed any further debate on the matter\u201d.\n\n\u201cPeople will make noise even if it is their own brother that is given this position. So, someone must make decisions to end some of this back and forth at some point,\u201d he said.\n\nAnalysis of the documents showed that the President first endorsed a set of documents setting out zoning arrangements on March 1, 2022 while he endorsed Adamu and others on February 25, 2022.\n\nA party chieftain opposed to the arrangement, and who wished not to be named lamented that a bad precedent has been set to weaken Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nHe stressed that \u201cPresident Buhari has the right as the party\u2019s de facto leader to show the direction the party should go, but this aspect of one person sitting in a parlor and constituting the APC Exco is bad news for democracy in Nigeria. This is dictatorship baring its fangs and we cannot afford the luxury of silence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the essence of wasting time and resources on an elective national convention if the President and a couple of governors have constituted the Exco in their spare time? We will challenge this legally,\u201d he declared.\n\nAnother chieftain who also pleaded anonymity expressed worry that President Buhari could have verbally directed those he wanted to be elected to the Exco without committing ink to paper, the way he did.\n\nAccording to the chieftain from the northwest of the country, \u201cI have seen the documents and my own worry is that the President should not have gone to the extent of appending his signature to the papers. This is the same signature he uses to conduct matters of the state and to now contemplate the same signature on party\u2019s documents that amount to illegality is demystifying the office of the President\u201d.",

          "title": "How Electoral Act\u2018ll be game-changer in 2023",
          "text": "\u2026Aspirants speed up consultations \u2026It\u2019s hope for PDP aspirants \u2013 Mohammed \u2026No, it\u2019s searchlight on political parties, a win-win for APC \u2013 Okechukwu, others \u2018\u2026Not about individual ambition, but credible process\u2019\n\nThe new Electoral Act has thrown up some issues around the emergence of candidates ahead of the 2023 elections. BODE OLAGOKE and ABDULRAHMAN ZAKARIYAU take a holistic view on the striking benefits of the new legal instrument in the conduct of the nation\u2019s elections and how both the parties and their candidates stand to gain and lose.\n\nFor over a decade, Nigerians waited for an amended Electoral Act. Many times it was passed by the National Assembly and rejected by President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) government.\n\nInterestingly, after what could be described as an endless wait, President Buhari signed the amended Electoral Act into law February 25, 2022.\n\nA critical look at the amended Act showed that the 2023 election may be more credible and acceptable than the previous general elections. This is largely because some major sections of the document have corrected the defects in the nation\u2019s electoral system.\n\nMajor highlights of the Act\n\nMany sections and clauses of the new Electoral Act inspire hope and excite political parties, politicians and ordinary Nigerians. For instance, Section 50 of the Act states that \u201cvoting at an election and transmission of results under this Act shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the Commission.\u201d In the past, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had demonstrated its commitment and capacity to use the electronic transmission method in many elections. This has given the commission power to decide on whether to apply electronic transmission or not.\n\nAlso, the Electoral Act has addressed the issue of over-voting as contained in Section 51. Therefore, the total number of accredited voters will now become a factor in determining over-voting at election tribunals.\n\nSection \u201c50(2) states: \u201cWhere the number of votes cast at an election in any polling unit exceeds the number of accredited voters in that polling unit, the Presiding officer shall cancel the result of the election in that polling unit.\n\nSubsection (3) of this section further says: \u201cWhere the result of an election is cancelled in accordance with subsection (2), there shall be no return for the election until another poll has taken place in the affected polling unit.\u201d\n\nThis is just as Section 94 of the Act stipulates early commencement of campaign seasons at least, 150 days to elections. This provision has the advantage of giving the political parties and candidates sufficient time to reach the electorate with their manifestoes.\n\nAlso, in another provision, political parties are empowered by the Act to conduct a fresh primary election to replace candidates who die during elections.\n\nThis is explicitly stated in Section 34(3) that, \u201cIf after the commencement of poll and before the announcement of the final result and declaration of a winner, a candidate dies (a) the Commission shall, being satisfied with the fact of the death, suspend the election for a period not more than 21 days; and (b) in the case of election into a legislative House, the election shall start afresh and the political party whose candidate died may, if it intends to continue to participate in the election, conduct a fresh primary within 14 days of the death of its candidate and submit the name of a new candidate to the Commission to replace the dead candidate: Provided that in the case of Presidential or gubernatorial or Federal Capital Territory Area Council elections, the running mate shall continue with the election and nominate a new running mate.\u201d\n\nThe Electoral Act has also approved the use of card readers, as mandatory accreditation technology before voting. Section 47 (1) states that \u201cA person intending to vote in an election shall present himself with his voter\u2019s card to a Presiding officer for accreditation at the polling unit in the constituency in which his name is registered.\u201d\n\nSubsection (2) adds: \u201cTo vote, the presiding officer shall use a smart card reader or any other technological device that may be prescribed by the Commission, for the accreditation of voters, to verify, confirm or authenticate the particulars of the intending voter in the manner prescribed by the Commission.\u201d\n\n(3) \u201cWhere a smart card reader or any other technological device deployed for accreditation of voters fails to function in any unit and a fresh card reader or technological device is not deployed, the election in that unit shall be cancelled and another election shall be scheduled within 24 hours if the Commission is satisfied that the result of the election in that polling unit will substantially affect the final result of the whole election and declaration of a winner in the constituency concerned.\u201d\n\nThe major issue addressed by the electoral act, which is perhaps the most topical of it all is that it stopped presidents or governors from making their appointees automatic delegates in an indirect primary election.\n\nSection 84(10-13) of the Act states: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the Convention or Congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\n\n\u201cWhere a political party fails to comply with the provisions of this Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate for election shall not be included in the election for the particular position in the issue.\n\n\u201c Notwithstanding the provisions of this Act or rules of a political party, an aspirant who complains that any of the provisions of this Act and the guidelines of a political party have not been complied with in the selection or nomination of a candidate of a political party for election, may apply to the Federal High Court for redress.\n\n\u201cNothing in this section shall empower the Courts to stop the holding of primaries or general elections under this Act pending the determination of a suit.\u201d\n\nWike, Atiku \u2018war\u2019 ignited\n\nWith the Act, the race for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 2023 presidential ticket gets tougher with former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Bauchi state Governor Bala Mohammed, Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike and Sokoto state Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal having very limited time to put their acts together ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primaries.\n\n\u201cWhen President Muhammadu Buhari signed the Electoral Act, Atiku and other aspirants who are in a race for PDP presidential ticket have realised they have limited time.\n\n\u201cSince on February 25, 2022, when President Muhammadu Buhari signed the amended electoral act, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has stepped up consultation and this has further widened the crack in the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum. The forum is divided over zoning.\n\n\u201cThere is a proxy war going on within the PDP. While Wike is leading the war on behalf of the governors to prevent the former Vice President from getting the ticket, Atiku has rolled out all his machinery and engaged more in direct consultations with different stakeholders and organs within the party. As it is, in PDP zoning or no zoning Atiku will contest,\u201d said a major stakeholder within the party.\n\n\u201cSo, the Electoral Act and the timetable released by INEC have made more of the aspirants within the PDP to scale up in their consultation and campaign. So, all PDP presidential aspirants are consulting and also waiting for the party to realise the timetable,\u201d the source further added.\n\nWhat hope?\n\nA political analyst, Aminu Mohammed, said the Act would give opposition parties, especially the PDP, the hope of winning the 2023 elections.\n\nIn a phone chat with Blueprint Weekend, Mohammed recalled that, \u201cThat the 2010 amendments and other amendments by former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan-led Federal Government are part of what contributed to the success of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe introduction of the card reader was an added advantage that provided the then opposition party-the APC- that hope and victory.\n\n\u201cSo, with this amendment, there is hope for the PDP and candidates of other opposition parties. In the amended Electoral Act, more sections back the use of technology for accreditation, computing of results and other processes. So, it means the possibility of rigging will be reduced.\n\n\u201cYou see, now with the electronic transmission of election results from the polling units through to the collation centres, the practice of distorting figures of votes cast, may have become history.\n\n\u201cAnother benefit for political parties and their presidential hopefuls is that Section 94 of the Act provides all political parties opportunity for early commencement of campaign seasons, at least 150 days to elections. This provision has the advantage of giving the political parties and candidates, sufficient time to get to the electorate with their manifestos,\u201d he further asserted. \u201cAlso, the clause which makes it mandatory for political appointees to resign from their positions before participating as delegates at political party congresses and conventions or, as aspirants to elective offices, will provide a level playing field for all. So, there\u2019s no special treatment for any candidate or party.\n\n\u201cSo, to a large extent the amended Electoral Act will protect the opposition parties, especially the PDP against the plans by the ruling party to use the power of incumbency to make things work in their favour. Like every other law, this will ensure equity and fairness in the conduct of elections; it will protect the weak, in this case, the opposition party.\u201d\n\n\u2018Searchlight on political parties\u2019\n\nHowever, in the view of the director-general, Voice of Nigeria (VON), Osita Okechukwu, the new Act is a searchlight on political parties about their commitments to internal democracy.\n\nSpeaking in a telephone interview with Blueprint Weekend, Okechuckwu, who is also an APC chieftain, said the operationalisation of the Act would affect the selection process of candidates by the political parties.\n\nOkechukwu said Buhari has bequeathed to Nigerians an Electoral Act that empowers the deployment of the Smart Card Reader, Biometric Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) and other technological devices for electoral fidelity.\n\nHe said \u201cthe coming into force of the Electoral Act 2022 marks a significant turning point in Nigeria\u2019s journey towards electoral reforms, reinforced democratic rights, higher voters turn out and consolidation of democracy,\u201d stressing that by signing the Bill into law, the president had given lovers of democracy a booster shot of Vote-Rigging-Vaccine (VRV).\n\nThe VON boss described the new electoral law as a \u201csearchlight on the commitment of political parties to internal democracy and building of a united and inclusive country.\u201d\n\nHe said the battle between leaders and the led over accountability has shifted to the ballot box and social contract strengthened to be honoured, urging Nigerians to always reflect on the remarks by President Buhari when he signed the bill, especially where the President said, \u201cDistinguished Senators and Honourable Members of the National Assembly, from the review, it is my perspective that the substance of the Bill is both reformative and progressive.\n\n\u201cI am making this bold declaration, because I foresee the great potentials of the Bill. Worthy of note include the democratic efficacy of the Bill with particular reference to sections 3,9(2), 34, 41, 47, 84(9), (10) and (11) among others.\u201d\n\nBMO\u2019s take\n\nSimilarly, a pro-Buhari group, the Buhari Media Organisation (BMO), said the development would accord popularity and credibility to Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nChairman of the group, Niyi Akinsiju, said the new law has defined the new political environment for the political parties.\n\n\u201cIt better defined political environment and political parties now understand the options available to them. In fact, the new electoral law will popularise our electoral system and accord it credibility.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a win-win for APC\u2019\n\nIn yet another reaction, an APC member, Hon. Theo Imasuagbon, described the Act as \u201ca win-win for the party and all its presidential aspirants.\u201d\n\nHe told one of our correspondents that the ruling party and all its presidential aspirants stand for free, fair, credible and acceptable election.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur presidential hopefuls are not perturbed with the amended Electoral Act, rather they are consulting party members and other national stakeholders to achieve their ambition.\n\n\u201cWe are happy that the federal government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari of the APC, signed the amended Electoral Act. This shows what our party stands.\n\n\u201cThis clearly shows that the APC wants a simple and credible process for Nigerians to elect their leaders. If the process is simple and credible, more people will get involved. So, all the provisions in the amended electoral law will give all presidential aspirants and all political parties equal opportunity.\n\n\u201cWith this act, rigging is gradually becoming a thing of the past. So, any aspirant who will emerge as presidential candidate and any party that will emerge winner in the 2023 election must be popular. When the process is credible, it will throw up competent leaders and many will accept the outcome. So, 2023 elections will be better than 2015, because of the amendment.\u201d\n\n\u2018Not about ambition, but credible process\u2019\n\nAlso, weighing in on the issue, a political analyst, Dr. Katch Ononuju, said the Act has no implications on presidential aspirants, but rather about enabling a credible electoral process.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with this reporter, Ononuju said: \u201cThe amended Electoral Act doesn\u2019t have anything to do with anybody\u2019s aspiration for 2023 presidency.\n\n\u201cIt is an issue that solves the North \u2013 South scam because it kills three birds instantly. One is the issue of incident form which is also a way to manipulate population arguments. The issue of biometric applications, then the issue of transmission of voting data from the voting booth to the collation centre.\n\n\u201cSo, it will help to address all manipulation of population numbers in election results. No doubt, all political parties, presidential aspirants and Nigeria will benefit from it. Subsequent elections will be more credible,\u201d he said.\n\nMaking it work\n\nConsidering the efforts put in to the Act and the attendant controversies, many Nigerians are hopeful that the Act is the game changer the nation needs to up its game in the electoral process.\n\nBut notwithstanding this optimism, analysts are of the view that credible as the document appears, it will only give the desired results if allowed to be fully operational.\n\nThey further contended that for the presidential aspirants and any others for that matter, certain anomalies which the Act seeks to remove from the nation\u2019s electoral system is one huge challenge they may have to face in the realisation of their ambitions ahead of the 2023 polls considered as a litmus test case for the brand new Electoral Act.",
          "summary": "Major highlights of the ActMany sections and clauses of the new Electoral Act inspire hope and excite political parties, politicians and ordinary Nigerians.\nAlso, the Electoral Act has addressed the issue of over-voting as contained in Section 51.\nIn the amended Electoral Act, more sections back the use of technology for accreditation, computing of results and other processes.\nOkechukwu said Buhari has bequeathed to Nigerians an Electoral Act that empowers the deployment of the Smart Card Reader, Biometric Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) and other technological devices for electoral fidelity.\nSpeaking in an interview with this reporter, Ononuju said: \u201cThe amended Electoral Act doesn\u2019t have anything to do with anybody\u2019s aspiration for 2023 presidency.",

          "text": "Nigeria has moved to sixth in the latest Global Terrorism Index (GTI), following successes in the fight against Boko Haram insurgents.\n\nThe country dropped two places from fourth, a position it has occupied since 2017.\n\nThe GTI, published by an independent and non-profit think tank, the Institute for Economics & Peace (IEP) indicated that Nigeria, Syria, and Somalia are the only nations, among the 10 most affected by terrorism, to get an improved score from 2020 to 2021.\n\nAccording to the report, there was a decline in the number of terrorism-related deaths in Nigeria. It attributed this to the death of Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau, and the Federal Government\u2019s efforts at defeating the group.\n\nREAD ALSO: MNJTF Troops Neutralise Several Boko Haram/ISWAP Insurgents At Nigeria-Cameroon Borders\n\n\u201cTotal deaths from terrorism in Nigeria fell to 448 in 2021, the lowest level since 2011. Terror-related casualties dropped by almost half compared with the previous year. However, the number of terrorist attacks increased by 49 per cent between 2020 and 2021. 36 percent of attacks were claimed by ISWA, Boko Haram being responsible for eight per cent and 44 percent not attributed to any group.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, ISWA became the deadliest terrorist group in Nigeria. The decline of Boko Haram continued into 2021, with Boko Haram responsible for only 69 deaths, a decrease of 77 percent from the previous year. This is the lowest number of deaths by the group for a decade. Boko Haram\u2019s decline has resulted in a substantial improvement in terrorism in Borno State, which experienced a decrease of 71 percent in terrorism deaths when compared with the prior year,\u201d the report said, which was published on Wednesday, read.\n\n\u201cAttacks in the state also decreased from 121 to 86 respectively, a decrease of 30 percent. The state, however, remains the hardest-hit region in Nigeria for terrorism, accounting for half of all terror-related deaths in 2021. Boko Haram\u2019s decline coincides with a number of factors, most significantly the death of the group\u2019s leader, Abubakar Shekau. Shekau, who committed suicide by detonating an explosives vest during a confrontation with ISWA in May 2021.\n\n\u201cGiven the demise of their leader, Shekau\u2019s followers were faced with the decision to either continue Shekau\u2019s ideology or join ISWA. It has been reported that as many as former Boko Haram commanders have joined ISWA after Shekau\u2019s death. Attacks by ISWA as well as counter-terrorism efforts by the Nigerian government and foreign military forces have significantly weakened Boko Haram\u2019s impact in Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "Rivers State Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, says the rejection of five gender bills by the National Assembly is a major setback for Nigeria\u2019s democratic advancement.\n\nThe Rivers State Governor said this at the inauguration of Ahoada -Odiemerenyi -Ihugbogo -Odieke Road project in Ahoada-East Local Government Area on Friday.\n\nHe said women, including the wife of the President and Vice President,\n\nMrs. Aisha Buhari and Mrs. Dolapo Osinbajo, had approached, lobbied and secured the promise of members of the National Assembly to act in their favour.\n\nBut rather than do so, the lawmakers voted against the bills.\n\n\u201cLook at what happened in the National Assembly. I watched it and I laughed when I saw our wives, and women were disgraced. It has never happened anywhere. I saw wives of the president and vice president go to the plenary session of the National Assembly to lobby them, to please help them.\n\n\u201cThey (National Assembly) promised them. The party (APC) promised them. The same party that promised them failed them.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Saraki\u2019s Campaign Team Storms Katsina, Says He Can Wipe Away Tears Of Nigerians\n\nGovernor Wike said such will not be allowed to happen in progressive societies that have continues to harness the potential of women in the advancement of their countries.\n\nHe blamed the rejection of the bills on President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s lack of interest in allowing for affirmative action for women in political administration in the country.\n\n\u201cAPC controls the National Assembly. If Mr. President was in support of this, there is no way they will disgrace women in the National Assembly. Such shameful thing.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the Governor noted that the situation in his state is different because women are an integral part of the process of political administration of the state.\n\nHe explained that there are 23 female vice chairmen of local governments in Rivers State, and at least five female councilors in each local government area.\n\nAccording to him, this is as a result of deliberate policy implemented by the Peoples Democratic Party leadership in the state.\n\n\u201cLook, in this State, as a matter of policy, we said we are going to do this and we agreed that if women cannot be chairman of councils, they cannot be refused the position of vice-chairmen.\n\n\u201cToday, in this State, all 23 vice-chairmen are women. Today, in this State, we said we must have five women as councilors in each local government. It is a matter of policy and It is leadership,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further Governor Wike said he has used politics and governance to better the socio-economic conditions of communities and make the people happy.\n\nThe Rivers State governor said sustaining national development and providing a thriving economy for Nigerians is not difficult to attain across the country.\n\nHe said a lack of passion in leadership to improve the life of the people, and tendency of the APC to inflict pains on Nigerians, inadvertently, creates the impression that governance is difficult.\n\nFor him, the sole aim of governance is to solve societal problems and ensure that the people are happy because of the improved social services that include development projects, delivered to them.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing difficult in Nigeria. It is just because they want to punish the people. When people talk about Nigeria is lacking this, Nigeria is lacking that, I say it is because of the leadership.\n\n\u201cThere is no passion for this country. They (APC) are not committed to the development of this country.\u201d\n\nPerforming the inauguration of the 10.2km long road Ahoada -Odiemerenyi-Ihugbogo-Odieke Road project, former Governor of Kaduna State, Senator Ahmed Makarfi said Rivers State has a difficult terrain, and it takes courage and love to invest in such development endeavour to better life of rural dwellers.\n\nHe said just like the state, it is imperative for the PDP to take over power at the national level so that Nigerians will enjoy passionate leadership that is committed to their welfare.\n\nSenator Makarfi, however, called for greater unity in the party and an undivided focus towards the return to power at the national level to reverse the failure of the APC.\n\nProviding the description of the road, the Rivers State Commissioner for Works, Elloka Tasie-Amadi, said the Ahoada -Odiemerenyi -Ihugbogo -Odieke Road project is 10.2km long and 7.3m wide.\n\nTasie-Amadi explained that the road, which will benefit the many communities in Ahoada as it opens them up to three local government areas of the state.\n\n\u201cThere will be improved access to local markets, health centres, educational facilities, public transportation etc.\n\n\u201cWith the improved road access, more products will be available locally, and the number of local businesses will increase.\n\n\u201cThe value of agricultural land will also increase significantly following the completion of this road. All these benefits put together will increase the net income of the targeted beneficiaries,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Wike who was a guest on Channels TV\u2019s Politics Today later on Friday, also addressed other matters such as the issue of local government autonomy.\n\nWatch the full interview below.",

Honda will be responsible for manufacturing the first model, while Sony will develop the mobility service platform, they said.\n\n\u201cIn the joint venture, we would like to lead the mobility evolution by combining our technology and experience with Honda\u2019s long experience in mobility development and vehicle body manufacturing technologies,\u201d Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said.\n\nThe companies did not reveal financial details of the tie-up.\n\nDuring a news conference in Tokyo on Friday, Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe said although he is not thinking about taking the joint venture public immediately, he would not dismiss that as among the options to grow the firm.\n\nAsked whether the partnership between the two companies is exclusive, Mibe said they are open to bringing in other companies while wanting to focus on developing the electric vehicle model for now.\n\n\u201cIn the future, we would like to expand our business with an open mindset,\u201d Mibe said, adding Honda will continue to develop its own electric vehicle strategy separate from the joint venture.\n\nThe announcement comes as the electronics maker was seeking to further its ambitions to become a key player in next-generation automobiles, while automakers like Honda are under pressure to make carbon-free cars as well as vehicles equipped with features beyond traditional means of transportation.\n\nThe rapid shift to embrace electric vehicles around the world, stoked by a global push to slash carbon emissions, creates opportunities for tech companies to join the auto market since those vehicles are simpler to manufacture than cars carrying internal combustion engines.\n\nAt the same time, those tech companies face challenges of meeting rigorous safety regulations for vehicles, and making cars capable of withstanding sometimes difficult driving conditions. Yoshida announced in January a plan to create a new company, Sony Mobility, saying it was exploring a commercial launch of electric vehicles.\n\nAlthough its once-dominant position in consumer electronics has been eroded by Asian rivals like South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics Co, Sony still has an arsenal of sophisticated technology in areas such as sensors critical to autonomous driving.\n\nCompetition within the electric vehicle market is intensifying as well. Asked about how the joint venture would fend off challenges from competitors, Mibe said he wants it to \u201ccreate a chemical reaction\u201d that exceeds customers\u2019 expectations.",
