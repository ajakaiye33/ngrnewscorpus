          "text": "The National Union of Road Transport Workers in Oyo State has distanced the union from Alhaji Lamidi Mukaila, popularly known as Auxiliary.\n\nThe Deputy General Secretary of NURTW, Alhaji Suleiman Musa, who said this in a statement, stated that the union did not know anything about Wednesday\u2019s mayhem in Iwo Road which led to the killing of Rahmon Azeez and massive destruction of properties.\n\nMusa called on Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, to warn Mukaila to restrain from bringing the name of the union into disrepute to avoid any crisis.\n\nHe explained that Mukaila was expelled from the NURTW in 2011, stressing that the union had nothing to do with the Park Management System introduced by Makinde.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cLamidi Mukaila, aka Auxiliary, appointed as the chairman of the notorious Park Managers created by the Oyo State governor was expelled from the union in 2011 before he was empowered to unleash mayhem on the good people of Oyo State under the guise of running parks for the government.\n\n\u201cGovernor Seyi Makinde had proscribed the National Union of Road Transport Workers in the state since May 31, 2019. Hence, the union views the persistent reports linking it with the nefarious activities of the governor\u2019s appointee as highly unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThe union is urging the Oyo State Government to do the needful and call him to order to prevent avoidable clashes resulting in wanton destruction of properties and loss of lives.\n\n\u201cThe NURTW as a body of law-abiding individuals making a living in the transport sector is averse to all forms of violent activities capable of putting their sources of livelihood in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cThe constitution of the union is very clear in dealing with identified dissidents or bad eggs and that such elements should not be accommodated among peace-loving members.\n\n\u201cThe union appeals to the media and the general public to stop attributing the excesses of the ignoble Park Managers outfit of the Oyo State Government or the nefarious undertaking of its appointed chairman to the NURTW.\u201d\n\nTraders whose shops were vandalised and looted during the mayhem had accused Mukaila of leading the hoodlums who unleashed terror on them.\n\nHowever, Mukaila has denied the allegations.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nBy Ikechukwu Nnochiri\n\nABUJA\u2013The Federal High Court in Abuja, on Friday, held that President Muhammadu Buhari did not not act in violation of the law, when he extended the tenure of former Inspector-General of Police, IGP, Mohammed Adamu by three months.\n\nThe court, in a judgement that was delivered by Justice Ahmed Mohammed, held that no section of either the 1999 Constitution, as amended, or the Police Act, forbade the President from retaining a retiring IGP in office \u201cas a stop gap measure\u201d, pending the completion of the process for the appointment of a substantive successor.\n\nREAD ALSO3 kidnap suspects, Nasarawa Police in N35m bribe scandal\n\nJustice Mohammed noted that both Constitution and the Police Act were silent on the issue of whether or not the President could extend the tenure of a retired IGP.\n\nHe held that since the Constitution and the Police Act empowered the President to appoint an IGP, by implication, he could also extend the tenure of such an appointee, pending the conclusion of required consultation with the Police Council and other processes required for the appointment of a substantive replacement.\n\nConsequently, the court dismissed a suit an Abuja based legal practitioner, Mr. Maxwell Opara filed to challenge the legality of the three-month tenure extension President Buhari handed to the former IGP, Adamu.\n\nThough the court held that the Plaintiff, being a Nigerian citizen, had sufficient locus-standi to institute the action, it however held that he \u201cabysmally failed\u201d to establish the case.\n\nThe Plaintiff had in his suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/106/2021, which he filed through his lawyer, Mr. Ugochukwu Ezekiel, urged the court to declare that the extension of Adamu\u2019s tenure as IGP, after he had retired from the Police Force, was illegal and unconstitutional.\n\nThe Plaintiff told the court that though the former IGP attained the maximum 35 years in service on February 1, he got a three-month extension of his tenure by President Buhari, on February 3.\n\nHe argued that by virtue of section 215 of the Nigerian Constitution and section 7 of the Nigeria Police Act, 2020, Mr Adamu could not validly continue to function as the IGP having retired as a member of the Nigeria Police Force as from midnight of February 1, 2021.\n\nThe plaintiff, among other things, prayed the court to restrain Adamu from exercising any form of command or control over the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nHe equally sought an order of court mandating President Buhari and the Police Council to immediately appoint a new IGP, inline with the provisions of section 7 of the Nigeria Police Act.\n\nMore so, the Plaintiff, asked for, a declaration that by the combined effect of the provisions of section 215 and 216 of the 1999 constitution and section 7 of the Nigeria Police Act, 2020, the 2nd Defendant (Adamu), cannot lawfully continue to function as the Inspector-General of Police not being a serving member of the Nigeria Police Force as from midnight of February 1, 2021, and therefore all actions taking thereafter are illegal, null and void and constitute a breach of the constitution and the Police Act\u201d.\n\nAs well as, \u201cDeclaration that the failure of the 1st (Buhari) and the 4th (Police Council) Defendants to appoint an Inspector-General of Police as at February 1, 2021, constitutes an abdication of their duties under section 215 of the 1999 constitution and section 7 of the Police Act\u201d.\n\nCited as Defendants in the suit were President Buhari, IGP Adamu, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, and the Nigeria Police Council.\n\nMeanwhile, all the Defendants, urged the court to dismiss the suit.\n\nMr. E. V. Elodimuo who represented President Buhari, the AGF and the Nigeria Police Council, argued that the decision to retain Adamu as the IGP was not in breach of either the 1999 Constitution, as amended, or the Police Act.\n\nHe urged the court to uphold the preliminary objection the 1st, 3rd and 4th Defendants raised against the suit.\n\nSpecifically, President Buhari, who is the 1st Defendant, told the court that he retained Adamu in office as the IGP, in exercise of the executive power that was conferred on him by the Constitution.\n\nHe said the Constitution empowered him to appoint a serving Police officer as the IGP, in consultation with Police Council, stressing that neither the Council nor the Police Service Commission disclosed that Adamu was no longer a serving police officer.\n\nIn a five-paragraphed counter-affidavit he jointly filed with the AGF, President Buhari, described the case of the Plaitiff as \u201cfrivolous, unmeritorious and undeserving of the court\u2019s attention\u201d.\n\nHe therefore urged the court to dismiss it \u201cwith heavy cost\u201d.\n\nLikewise, Adamu\u2019s lawyer, Dr. Alex Iziyon, SAN, while urging the court to dismiss the suit, argued that going by section 136 of the Nigerian Police Act, his client, could remain in office as the IGP till 2024.\n\nInsisting that tenure of his client never elapsed, Adamu\u2019s lawyer, argued that the new Nigeria Police Act gave him a four-year tenure which would only expire in either 2023 or 2024.\n\nAccording to him, Adamu\u2019s tenure would elapse in 2023 if counted from 2019 when he was appointed as the IGP, or 2024, if counted from 2020 when the new Nigeria Police Act came into force.\n\nMeantime, shortly after judgement was reserved in the matter, President Buhari, on April 6, removed Adamu as the IGP, about 28 days to the end of his extended tenure.",

          "text": "The Tangale Community Development Association (TCDA) has called on the Gombe State Government to lift the four-month old curfew imposed On Billiri Local Government Area of the state.\n\nTCDA also said despite the curfew in place, \u201cour men and women are being kidnapped at night\u201d.\n\nDaniel Maddo, member Board of Trustee of TCDA, flanked by other officials of the association, disclosed this in Jos, the Plateau State Capital, while briefing journalists.\n\n\u201cWe urge the government of Gombe State to lift the longest curfew in Nigeria imposed on the Tangle people in Billiri Local Government since the 19th February, 2021.\n\nMal. Danladi Mai Shanu is not the Mai Tangale \u2013 Tangale people cry out\n\n\u201cSadly, under this curfew, our men and women are being kidnapped at night\u201d, the group decried.\n\n\u201cWe urged the government to always use legitimate and lawful security agencies to maintain law and order within Gombe State and avoid using \u2018Yan Kalare\u2019, hunters and other illegal vigilante groups\u201d.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that On the 11th of January 2021, the 15th Mai Tangle, HRH Abdu Buba Maisheru II died and was buried which led to permutations for who would succeed him.\n\nMembers of the ruling houses indicated interest and at the end of the day, 18 contestants emerged but the State government postponed the election process ostensibly to enable the Governor sign the Chieftaincy Law of Gombe State into law which was passed a long time ago but was not assented to until the death of Mai Abdu.\n\nOn February 15, 2021, the Tangle Kingmakers made up of nine people met and a selection was conducted on the 18 candidates that indicated interest out of which three people recorded votes.\n\nMai Tangale stool crisis: Gov. Mohammed Inuwa Yahaya designs Fulani rulership in Gombe \u2013 TCO\n\nThe votes of the kingmakers showed that Dr. Musa Idris Maiyamba secured 5 votes, Danladi 2 votes and Ahmed 2 votes.\n\nThe Kingmakers accordingly handed over the result of the selection to the Deputy Governor who witnessed the process in company of the Commissioner for Local Government and chieftaincy Affairs.\n\nSadly, the Governor went ahead and installed the aforementioned (Mallam Danladi Sanusi Maiyamba), despite just getting two votes, which has caused serious tension in the chiefdom.\n\nThe Group also called on the installed paramount ruler Mallam Danladi Sanusi Maiyamba that in the interest of \u201cpeace, tranquillity and good governance\u201d, to stop parading himself as the Mai Tangle (Paramount ruler of Tangle) in Biliri LGA of Gombe State.\n\nThe TCDA said in line with the chieftaincy law of the State and the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), Dr Musa Idris Maiyamba is the duly \u201celected and recognised\u201d, Mai Tangle.\n\n\u201cThat Mallam Danladi Sanusi Maiyamba (Danladi Maishanu) should stop parading himself as the Mai Tangle in the interest of peace, tranquillity and good governance.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn line with the Chieftaincy law and constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended); Dr Musa Idris Maiyamba is the duly elected and recognised 16th Mai Tangle.\n\nThe Group maintained that, if truly Mallam Danladi Sanusi Maiyamba is from the Tangle extraction, he would have respected and followed the guidelines of tradition.\n\nThe TCDA further stated that, as a peace loving people, it has decided to approach the court in order to resolve the issues surrounding the Mai Tangle stool.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary being the last hope of the common man, we hope it will rectify this great injustice done to Tangale people\u201d, it stressed.\n\nOn inflammatory utterances of the governor of the state, TCDA said, \u201cWe hope the utterances of the Governor of Gombe State does not incite other groups against the Tangale nation as this could lead to genocide\u201d.\n\nHowever, the Tangale people said it will be approaching the court next week, as it was unable to do so due to the Judiciary workers strike.",

          "text": "The Election Petition Tribunal seating in Calabar over the By-Election of December 5, 2020 in Cross River North Senatorial district, on Friday gave its final judgment affirming Senator Stephen Odey of the Peoples Democratic Party as duly elected.\n\nThe three man tribunal, presided over by Justice Yusuf Ubale Muhammad in a four hour long judgment read by Justice Muhammad dismissed the petition N0: EPT/CR/SEN/03/2020 between Joe Agi SAN and the All Progressive Congress as the 1st and 2nd Petitioners versus Stephen Odey, Jerigbe Agom Jerigbe, Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party and the Independent National Electoral Commission as 1st to 4th respondents respectively.\n\nThe Tribunal agreed with the preliminary objections earlier raised by the Respondents and held that the petition lacked merits before it, as the grounds of the petition was only suited for a pre-election matter.\n\nIt noted that among the issues before it, is if the PDP had a candidate that was duly nominated and if the petitioner was justified by the instant petition?\n\nThe judgment further noted that the petitioner admitted during cross examination by saying, \u201clet it be on records that I am not contesting the votes, all I am saying is that the PDP had no candidate in the election and so the votes scored are wasted votes.\u201d\n\nThe first respondent, Sen. Odey scored 129,307 votes and the Petitioner scored 18,165votes in the election. And as for the petition arguing that the two candidates for the PDP were not qualified to stand election as on the election day of December 5, 2020, the Tribunal judgment said thus;\n\n\u201cThe question to ask is in view of the admission of the petitioner that he is not a member of the PDP and he left since 2017, does he have the locus standi to challenge the primaries of the PDP? The definite answer is no.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe position of the law is that it is only an aspirant who contested a primary election that can approach the court under the provision of the section 87.9 of the electoral ACT. It therefore shows that the petitioner in this petition has no locus standi to challenge the return of the first respondent.\n\n\u201cAs for the evidence before the tribunal, the first petitioner alleged that the 3rd respondent sponsored two candidates for the senatorial by-election for CRS north which led to the issuance of two certificates of return; 1st to Odey on the 6th of Dec, 2020 and another to the 18th of Feb. 2021.\u201d\n\nThe tribunal submitted that the 2nd respondent Hon. Jerigbe Agom was not a candidate in the election and that the certificate of Return issued to him by the Independent National Electoral Commission was done wrongfully and should be discountenanced.\n\n\u201cIt is not possible for the INEC to hear someone who has not submitted form CF001 and CF 002 as the nomination process is complete only when the Commission receives the necessary documents \u2013 see the decision in PDM Vs INEC 2020. On the whole, we hold that there is no evidence before us to destroy the return of the first respondent as the duly elected senator represented Cross River North. We have studied exhibits A22, the Judgment of the Court of Appeal and we could not find where a certificate of Return issued to the first respondent is nullified and as such the issuance of the 2nd certificate of return to the 2nd respondent by INEC is wrongful and hereby discountenanced.\u201d\n\nCounsel for the petitioner, Olademeji Ekemgbe reacted to the judgment by hinting that they have seen areas in the judgment that needs to be tested in the appeal court and his client will be advised accordingly after studying the judgment.",

          "text": "Africa\u2019s leading ride-hailing platform, Bolt, has launched a vehicle financing programme that will enable drivers to own a car with low equity repayment. This first-of-its-kind offering in Nigeria is part of Bolt\u2019s commitment to improving earnings for drivers while allowing them to maintain flexibility as vehicle owners.\n\nThe vehicle financing programme was made possible through Bolt\u2019s operative verification of driver identities and extensive data on driver activities in partnership with Sterling Bank\u2019s Alternative Finance. The programme will provide a better alternative for drivers who currently lease a car via the hire-purchase or rental model to drive on the Bolt platform.\n\n\u201cThis initiative reiterates our continued commitment to helping our drivers earn more as our partners in moving Nigeria,\u201d says Bolt Country Manager Femi Akin-Laguda.\n\n\u2018\u2018Our drivers are vital to our business operations, and improving the earnings of every driver is fundamental to keeping the trust and loyalty that we have earned over the last couple of years. As we expand our presence into more cities across the country, it is important to provide solutions that ensure working with Bolt is more flexible and profitable for drivers, which inherently improves the overall experience for our riders as well. More importantly, the vehicle financing programme will enable drivers to earn at their own pace either driving full time or part-time\u201d.\n\nIn the pilot phase, existing Bolt drivers who meet specific performance benchmarks while driving with Bolt will be prioritised for vehicle financing. These drivers will be able to enjoy upfront equity contributions as low as a 15% mark-up and minimum weekly-instalment payments. Other benefits from the plan may include a monthly fuel card, comprehensive insurance and vehicle tracking for new and preowned cars with a three to four-year repayment plan.\n\n\u201cAt Sterling Alternative Finance, we understand that Nigeria is a predominantly cash-centric society; this sometimes cripples the purchasing power of the average Nigerian and in effect can have a negative impact on our economy. Our mission is to improve the quality of life of Nigerians by providing a more sustainable, flexible, and convenient way to own vehicles. Through the Alt drive platform, Nigerians can now purchase new or pre-owned vehicles, pay steadily over a convenient number of years at no interest.\u201d Temiloluwa Desalu, CMO for Sterling Alternative Finance\n\n\u201cWe are very excited to be partnering with Africa\u2019s leading ride-hailing platform, Bolt, to bring this service to their drivers, and we are confident of a long-lasting and truly rewarding alliance,\u201d concluded Desalu.\n\nBolt continues to provide opportunities for people in emerging markets, ensuring that more drivers have access to its platform to earn more, especially in developing economies. With more than 10,000 drivers, Bolt remains a leader in providing earning opportunities across Nigeria while providing safe, reliable, and affordable transportation options. This vehicle financing scheme is in collaboration with AltDrive.",

The command spokesman, SP Nafi\u2019u Abubakar, said in a statement that a team, comprising operatives from the Police Mobile Force, anti-kidnapping and counter-terrorism units have begun combing nearby forests, routes and suspected hideouts of the criminals.\n\nThe police boss assured that the command would do everything within its power to ensure the abducted persons are safely reunited with their families and perpetrators brought to book and appealed to residents to assist with prompt information that would aid in solving the crime and apprehending the criminals.\n\nNotwithstanding the assurance from the police, panic-stricken residents have begun mass exodus from the towns and communities in Yauri. At press time, no fewer than six villages had been deserted.\n\nAn activist from one of the villages, Mallam Muktar Yauri, told Daily Sun on phone that almost all the villagers have relocated for safety.\n\n\u201cAll the residents are running towards Yauri town for their protection. When the bandits attacked, about 200 of them, according to eyewitness, they were selective. They didn\u2019t pick student who were not matured. They overwhelmed the security officers in the school as they shot sporadically.

It is unfortunate and all the stakeholders must rally round to protect our schools, our state and our people.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that such incident is happening in Zuru and Yauri axis. Government should take proactive measures to protect our schools, our students. Kebbi State has porous borders with neighbouring countries. Our government needs to do something about that because Zuru and Yauri Emirates have porous borders with even other states.\u201d\n\nChairman, House of Representatives Committee on Health Services, Tanko Sununu, who represents Ngaski/Shanga/Yauri Federal Constituency of Kebbi State, decried the insecurity in his constituency and called for the intervention of the Federal Government.\n\nThe lawmaker told journalists in Abuja that children and farmers in his constituency can no longer go to school or farm as a result of insecurity.\n\n\u201cA week ago, we had another calamity when bandits numbering about 300, each with AK-47 and using very strong motorcycles, came into my constituency.\n\n\u201cThey had a field day and operated for more than eight hours, moving from house to house, room to room, collecting money, handsets, motorcycles and cattle. That has led to a massive influx of internally displaced persons into the headquarters of the Emirate in Yauri.\n\n\u201cHowever, we were able to convince people and they started going back to their respective areas. But they (bandits) left a message that they would be coming back. Taking it seriously, some people refused to go back and in the early hours of today (yesterday), they repeated what they had done earlier and they came into the constituency, sometime around 10.30 or thereabout.\u201d\n\nSununu called on the Federal Government to look at Yauri\u2019s position with its neighbouring Niger State.\n\n\u201cIt has direct access to Zamfara State and west of Yauri is the back of River Niger. Our fear is that their major target is to enter Yauri. Now we are calling on the Federal Government to provide adequate security.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Urges military to ramp up fight against insurgency\n\nDeji Elumoye and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday assured residents of Borno State of the federal government\u2019s readiness to fight terrorism to the end, telling the military not to give criminals a breathing space to undermine Nigeria\u2019s interests.\n\nThe president, during a visit to Borno State, commended troops for their loyalty and selfless service to Nigeria and urged them not to relent in their efforts to end the insurgency in the North-east.\n\nHe promised support for the families of fallen security personnel, saying he would ensure all Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) return to their homes.\n\nHe also commended the state Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, for his resilience and relentless efforts in rebuilding the state.\n\nBuhari, during the visit to appraise the security situation in the state and to inaugurate some development projects attributed the recent successes recorded by the military against the insurgents and terrorists at Dikwa, Damboa and Gwoza to careful planning, infusion of new equipment and other war materials as well as quality military leadership.\n\nHe, however, acknowledged the enormity of the task ahead of the military.\n\n\u201cThe attacks launched by cowardly terrorists against military and civilian targets last month and in previous months were a pointer to us that the work of defeating insurgency and terrorism and of restoring permanent peace to this region is not yet over,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe will not rest until all the millions of Internally Displaced Persons are able to return and resettle in their homes and rebuild their shattered lives.\u201d\n\nHe expressed the hope that the service chiefs would bring to bear on the war, their experience as commanders in theatre at various times.\n\nThe president said: \u201cAll of them are, therefore, personally familiar with the challenge of insurgency. I fully expect them to bring this wealth of personal experience to bear as we move to end this scourge once and for all.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, these successes owe a lot to the role played by volunteers of the Civilian JTF, hunters and vigilantes. These good people include women, who are making huge sacrifices and patriotic contributions to our peace-restoration efforts.\u201d\n\nHe stated that many servicemen and women, as well as volunteers, had been killed in the fight to rid communities and the country of terrorism and insurgency and thanked all those involved for their gallantry and sacrifices.\n\nBuhari assured their loved ones that their sacrifices will not be in vain: \u201cI must also acknowledge the very important role and the sacrifices made by parents, guardians and other loved ones amongst the people of Borno State, the North-east region and the country as a whole, who support their sons, daughters, husbands, brothers and sisters in going to battlefields to defend Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity and peace. I thank and commend them for their resilience and assure them success is in sight.\u201d\n\nHe said it was a mark of appreciation for the sacrifices made by Borno State\u2019s volunteers that the Nigerian Army was authorised to enlist hundreds of them into the Army.\n\nHe urged the people to sustain the cooperation with the military and the other security services.\n\n\u201cBoth must see each other as being on one side in order for us to succeed,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari said the late President Idris Deby of Chad played a major role in the fight against terrorism in the Lake Chad region and urged his successors to work hard in restoring democracy to the country and support the processes of bringing peace to the region.\n\nHe said the recent appointment of Ambassador Babagana Kingibe as special envoy to Chad and the Lake Chad Basin was intended to accelerate the restoration of democratic stability in the Chad Republic and enhance cooperation among all the countries of the Lake Chad Basin.\n\nHe assured the people that the federal government had taken decisive measures to safeguard IDPs and refugees who recently returned from Cameroon and the Niger Republic, adding that it was engaged in the task of rebuilding their communities after more than a decade of war and terrorism.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt was part of these measures that I gave approval for the federal government to build 10,000 resettlement homes in Borno State. Four thousand of these homes have already been completed. Furthermore, I approved for constant release of food intervention by the Nigerian Customs Service and the North East Development Commission in order to support displaced persons.\n\n\u201cI have directed these agencies to sustain and deepen this support. I also wish to specially commend His Excellency, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, for his tireless efforts in directly supervising the distribution of food and economic empowerment to IDPs in all local government areas.\u201d He expressed the belief that the efforts at alleviating the suffering of displaced communities will hamper attempts by terrorists and insurgents to recruit fighters and spies from IDPs and other vulnerable populations through the use of paltry material incentives.\n\nOn electricity supply, Buhari said his administration would continue to make concerted efforts towards guaranteeing energy security to all, adding that Maiduguri could not, and would not be left out.\n\nHe said the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had been directed to expedite the delivery of 50MW power plant in the state towards ensuring the restoration of electricity to Maiduguri and its environs.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, in the light of the current improvement of security in the state, I have also issued directives for the immediate resumption of oil & gas exploration activities in the Lake Chad Basin. This is part of our overall effort to restore the state back to normalcy,\u201d the president explained.\n\nThe president applauded Zulum\u2019s efforts at providing facilities that directly impact the livelihood of people, particularly building educational and health institutions and constructing roads.\n\nHe also commended the Shehu of Borno, Abubakar Ibn Umar Garbai El-Kanemi, as well as all the other royal highnesses and Bulamas at all levels for their very exemplary leadership, patience, determination and wisdom during the past decade of ravage by insurgency and terrorism.\n\nAccording to him, the fact that royal highnesses now operate from their domains was evidence that peace was being restored to the communities despite the challenges that remain to be overcome.\n\n\u201cThe elders, statesmen, Muslim and Christian community leaders all over this state and region also deserve our thanks and warm appreciation for their resilience, moral leadership and support for the federal and state governments during these trying times.\n\n\u201cI will never forget in my life that during my career as a politician, Borno State is where I got the highest percentage of votes, more than 90 per cent! The least I can do for you is to continue the relentless effort to fully restore peace to this state, the North-east region and the country as a whole,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged the military and security agencies to continue to make Nigeria proud.\n\nBuhari also interacted with some of the wounded soldiers assuring them that the government was committed to their recovery and welfare.\n\nIn his remarks, the Commander of Theatre Operations HADIN KAI, Maj. Gen. Felix Omoigui, assured troops of the president\u2019s confidence and commitment to their welfare, especially in ending the war.\n\nHe thanked the president for the visit to the troops, which he said would greatly boost the morale of all those fighting to keep the country in peace.\n\nGovernors of Borno and Yobe State, Zulum and Mai Bunu respectively; Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Leo Irabor; Chief of Army Staff, Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya; Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Awwal Gambo; Chief of Staff, Air Vice Marshal Isiaka Amao, and National Security Adviser, Maj. Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd), were also at the event.\n\nIn his remarks, Zulum thanked the president for the relative peace in the state, buoyed by the heavy presence of military and security men who have been engaging the terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe have witnessed the gradual return of peace to Borno State and it is our sincere hope that insurgency will soon be brought to an end,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor appreciated the president for various developmental interventions, which include infrastructure, particularly the approval of 10,000 units of housing for IDPs of which 4,000 had been completed.\n\nPresident Thanks Nigerians for Opportunity to Serve\n\nIn the meantime, the president has expressed his gratitude to Nigerians for the opportunity given to him to serve them.\n\nHe said under his watch, efforts would be made to improve the livelihood of Nigerians, starting with adequate security.\n\nHe said at the palace of the Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Abubakar Ibn Garbai El-Kanemi, that he started his administrative career as a military officer in Borno State as a governor for seven months, under Gen. Murtala Muhammed, before he was appointed Minister of Petroleum by former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was then a military head of state.\n\nHe added: \u201cMy commitment to serve Nigerians is a payback for the love shown to me. I started my political adventure in Maiduguri and I always look forward to coming here.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, El-Kanemi thanked the president for consistent response to the plight of the people in the state, saying that the security situation has improved.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022IMF laments re-emergence of fuel subsidy\n\n\u2022Welcomes CBN\u2019s measures to unify exchange rates\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos, Francis Ndubuisi and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nGroup Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, has warned that rather than being a positive development, the rising prices of crude oil in the international market could cause major challenges for resource-dependent nations like Nigeria.\n\nHe spoke just as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed concern over the re-emergence of fuel subsidy in Nigeria in the face of the country\u2019s low revenue mobilisation.\n\nThe Washington-based institution, however, welcomed recent moves by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to unify exchange rates, certifying Nigerian banks as being liquid and well-capitalised.\n\nKyari, at the virtual Citizens Energy Congress, tagged: \u201cSecuring a Sustainable Future Energy System through Strategy, Collaboration and Innovation,\u201d yesterday described the rising price of crude oil as a \u201cchicken and egg\u201d situation.\n\nHe added that oil prices had started exiting the comfort zone set by the NNPC, and becoming a burden.\n\nThe forum was organised by DMG Events, a London-based Public Relations company, which said the occasion was to provide an opportunity for players to reset the energy agenda post- COVID-19 and connect the divergent and polarising perspectives.\n\nKyari put the comfort zone globally at $58-$60, saying that for the NNPC, anything above $70-$80 will create major distortions in the projections of the corporation and add more problems to the company.\n\nBrent crude, Nigeria\u2019s oil benchmark, is currently selling for over $74 and is likely to increase further in the coming days as the NNPC continues to battle the dilemma of shouldering the payment of petrol subsidy, which has made it unable to contribute to the Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) on two occasions.\n\nKyari expressed the concern that as the commodity prices rise, buyers of Nigeria\u2019s crude may be compelled to accelerate their investment in renewable sources of energy, thereby leaving the industry in a quagmire.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn a resource-dependent nation like Nigeria when it gets too high, it creates a big problem because your consumers shut down their demand. Demand will go down and obviously even as the prices go up, you will have less volume to sell.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a chicken and egg story and that\u2019s why in the industry when people make estimates for the future, they always make it about $50 to $60. Nobody puts it beyond $60.\n\n\u201cBut for us as a country, as prices go up, the burden of providing cheap fuel also increases and that\u2019s a challenge for us but on a net basis, you know, the high prices, as long as it doesn\u2019t exceed $70 to $80, it\u2019s okay for us.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria will have no problems supporting the restoration of about 5.8 million barrels a day that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) still has offline since the pandemic, due to the curbs in production quota imposed by the oil cartel.\n\nHe said adding that number to demand will stabilise and probably bring oil prices down to about $60 level or a little below $60, stressing that that\u2019s a comfort zone for every producing company or country.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see them (Nigeria) having any difficulty agreeing to add additional volume to cushion the effect of these high prices for this period,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that Nigeria is already producing well below its capacity, because in early 2020, the country actually produced up to 2.4 million barrels of oil per day for both oil and condensates.\n\nWith declining investments in the oil sector, Kyari stated that in a short time, most likely the next five years, the world may experience an energy crisis if the current situation is not properly managed.\n\n\u201cBut we know that a number of things are going on in the transition journey at renewables. Many oil companies are transiting to renewables in the future. And that means that emphasis will be on gas and I see a very turbulent next five years and potentially some stability in the next 10 years,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described the transition to renewables as a reality, adding that for Nigeria, what is clear is that the country is deficient in infrastructure and, therefore, needs resources from oil to exit poverty.\n\nHe stated that for Nigeria, to transit means to go for a low-carbon option and move towards more gas development than the liquids, adding that in the long term, the country needs to find a way out of dependence on oil.\n\n\u201cRenewables are real and we are making efforts to go in that direction, but obviously, our first step is to develop our gas resources.\n\n\u201cIn this industry, you can\u2019t do anything except you have the financing and financing is now clearly constrained both in terms of available resources and the decision of some of the shareholders of some of the lending institutions,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that although everyone seems to be talking about peak oil, there is no reference to gas, which contains lower carbon.\n\nKyari said: \u201cEverybody is saying that in the next 10 years, we will get to peak oil. But nobody has said peak gas. And it\u2019s very difficult to distinguish the two because as you get peak oil, in many cases, you know, oil is produced alongside gas.\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s possible, it can be in 10 years time but you also know that what we are doing today in the industry is also curtailing investment and meeting the transition target in 2050.\n\n\u201cWhat that means is that in five years\u2019 time, you could be in a situation of shock and this shock will mean that people will have to put more money into producing the liquids and that means that it will defer the date for liquid oil and potentially pushing it by 20 to 30 years.\u201d\n\nRe-emergence of Fuel Subsidy Worrisome, Says IMF\n\nMeanwhile, the IMF has expressed concern over the re-emergence of fuel subsidy in Nigeria in the face of the country\u2019s low revenue mobilisation.\n\nThe IMF in a statement at the end of its staff virtual meeting with top Nigerian officials, said the views expressed in the statement were those of the IMF staff and did not represent those of the IMF\u2019s Executive Board.\n\nThe IMF team was led by IMF\u2019s Mission Chief for Nigeria, Ms. Jesmin Rahman, in the virtual meetings with the Nigerian authorities, held from June 1st to June 8th, 2021, to discuss recent economic, financial developments and outlook.\n\nAt the end of the visit, Rahman, in the statement, said the Nigerian economy had started to gradually recover from the negative effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe mission expressed its concern with the resurgence of fuel subsidies. It reiterated the importance of introducing market-based fuel pricing mechanism and the need to deploy well-targeted social support to cushion any impact on the poor.\n\n\u201cThe mission recommended stepping up efforts to strengthen tax administration to mobilise additional revenues and help address priority spending pressures.\u201d\n\nIt stated that tax revenue collections in Nigeria were gradually recovering but with fuel subsidies resurfacing, additional spending for COVID-19 vaccines, added to address security challenges, the fiscal deficit of the consolidated government was expected to remain elevated at 5.5 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nIt added that following sharp output contractions in the second and third quarters, GDP growth turned positive in the fourth quarter (Q4 2020) and growth reached 0.5 per cent (year-on-year) in Q1 2021, supported by agriculture and services sectors.\n\nHowever, it said employment level in the country continued to fall dramatically and, together with other socio-economic indicators, remained below pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\u201cInflation slightly decelerated in May but remained elevated at 17.93 per cent, owing to high food price inflation. With the recovery in oil prices and remittance flows, the strong pressures on the balance of payments have somewhat abated, although imports are rebounding faster than exports and foreign investor appetite remains subdued resulting in continued forex shortage.\n\n\u201cThe incipient recovery in economic activity is projected to take root and broaden among sectors, with GDP growth expected to reach 2.5 per cent in 2021,\u201d it added.\n\nIt anticipated that inflation in Nigeria would remain elevated in 2021, but likely to decelerate in the second half of the year to reach about 15.5 per cent, following the removal of border controls and the elimination of base effects from elevated food price levels.\n\nDownside risks to the near-term arise from further deterioration of security conditions, and the still uncertain course of the pandemic both globally and in Nigeria, it added.\n\n\u201cThe mission commended the authorities\u2019 measures to contain the transmission of COVID-19 in Nigeria, including the ongoing vaccination programme under the COVAX initiative, and strongly supported the authorities\u2019 efforts to acquire additional doses from countries with surplus stocks.\n\n\u201cThe mission urged the authorities to keep reliance on CBN overdrafts for deficit financing within legal limits, while the government continues to make efforts to strengthen budget planning and public finance management practices to allow for flexible financing from domestic markets and better integration of cash and debt management.\n\n\u201cThe recent removal of the official exchange rate from the CBN website and measures to enhance transparency in the setting of the NAFEX exchange rate are encouraging,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe mission recommended maintaining the momentum toward fully unifying all exchange rate windows and establishing a market-clearing exchange rate.\n\nOn the monetary policy to strengthen the monetary targeting regime, the mission recommended integrating the interbank and debt markets and using the central bank or government bills of short-maturity as the main liquidity management tool, instead of the cash reserve requirements.\n\n\u201cThe banking sector remains liquid and well-capitalised while non-performing loans (NPLs) are contained. The extension of the moratorium on principal payments of qualifying credit facilities on a case-by-case basis through March 2022 should be limited to viable debtors with strong pre-crisis fundamentals.\n\n\u201cCBN stress tests purport that the banking system would remain adequately capitalised except in case of a severe deterioration of credit quality.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, it remains to be seen what share of forborne loans may turn non-performing as the impact of the pandemic abates. Since NPLs often rise at the later part of economic crisis, CBN\u2019s strong oversight remains critical to safeguarding financial sector stability,\u201d it said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Says banking sector remains liquid, well capitalised\n\nBy Ndubuisi Francis\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has advised the federal government to keep reliance on overdrafts from the Central Bank Bank of Nigeria ((CBN) within legal limits.\n\nThe Bretton Woods institution said this should be done while the government continues to make efforts to strengthen budget planning and public finance management practices to allow for flexible financing from domestic markets and better integration of cash and debt management.\n\nSection 38(1) of the CBN Act allows the apex bank to grant overdrafts to the federal government to address any temporary deficiency of budget revenue, with sub-section 2 providing that any outstanding overdraft shall not exceed 5 per cent of the previous year\u2019s actual revenue of the federal government.\n\nThe IMF\u2019s admonition was contained in a statement from preliminary findings of a virtual visit to Nigeria by its staff.\n\nAccording to the IMF, real gross domestic product (GDP) is recovering but unemployment and inflation remain elevated, noting that recent exchange rate measures were encouraging.\n\nIt, however, called for reforms to achieve a fully unified and market-clearing exchange rate, even as it expressed concern on the re-emergence of fuel subsidies, particularly in the context of low revenue mobilisation.\n\nThe IMF team led by Ms. Jesmin Rahman, the statement added, held virtual meetings with the Nigerian authorities between June 1 and 8, 2021 to discuss recent economic, financial developments and outlook.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe Nigerian economy has started to gradually recover from the negative effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Following sharp output contractions in the second and third quarters, GDP growth turned positive in Q4 2020 and growth reached 0.5 per cent (y/y) in Q1 2021, supported by agriculture and services sectors.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the employment level continues to fall dramatically and together with other socio-economic indicators, is far below pre-pandemic levels. Inflation slightly decelerated in May but remained elevated at 17.9 per cent, owing to high food price inflation.\n\n\u201cWith the recovery in oil prices and remittance flows, the strong pressures on the balance of payments have somewhat abated, although imports are rebounding faster than exports and foreign investor appetite remains subdued resulting in continued FX shortage.\n\n\u201cThe incipient recovery in economic activity is projected to take root and broaden among sectors, with GDP growth expected to reach 2.5 per cent in 2021.\u201d\n\nThe IMF noted that inflation is expected to remain elevated in 2021, but likely to decelerate in the second half of the year to reach about 15.5 per cent, following the removal of border controls and the elimination of base effects from elevated food price levels.\n\nTax revenue collections, it observed, are gradually recovering, adding that: \u201cWith fuel subsidies resurfacing, additional spending for Covid-19 vaccines, and to address security challenges, the fiscal deficit of the Consolidated Government is expected to remain elevated at 5.5 per cent of GDP,\u201d it said.\n\nThe multilateral financial institution stated that downside risks to the near-term arise from further deterioration of security conditions, and the still uncertain course of the COVID-19 pandemic both globally and in Nigeria.\n\nWhile commending the authorities\u2019 measures to contain the transmission of Covid-19 in Nigeria, including the ongoing vaccination programmes under the COVAX initiative, it strongly expressed support to the authorities\u2019 efforts to acquire additional doses from countries with surplus stocks.\n\nHowever, it expressed its concern with the resurgence of fuel subsidies, reiterating the importance of introducing market-based fuel pricing mechanism and the need to deploy well-targeted social support to cushion any impact on the poor.\n\nThe IMF mission recommended stepping up efforts to strengthen tax administration to mobilise additional revenues and help address priority spending pressures.\n\nIt urged the authorities to keep reliance on CBN overdrafts for deficit financing within legal limits, while the government continues to make efforts to strengthen budget planning and public finance management practices to allow for flexible financing from domestic markets and better integration of cash and debt management.\n\nIt also described as encouraging the recent removal of the official exchange rate from the CBN website and measures to enhance transparency in the setting of the NAFEX exchange rate.\n\nThe IMF called for the sustenance of the momentum towards fully unifying all exchange rate windows and establishing a market-clearing exchange rate.\n\nOn monetary policy to strengthen the monetary targeting regime, it recommended integrating the interbank and debt markets and using central bank or government bills of short maturity as the main liquidity management tool, instead of the cash reserve requirements.\n\nAccording to the IMF, the Nigerian banking sector remains liquid and well-capitalised, while non-performing loans (NPLs) are contained.\n\nBut it advised that the extension of the moratorium on principal payments of qualifying credit facilities on a case-by-case basis through March 2022 should be limited to viable debtors with strong pre-crisis fundamentals.\n\n\u201cCBN stress tests purport that the banking system would remain adequately capitalized except in case of a severe deterioration of credit quality.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, it remains to be seen what share of forborne loans may turn non-performing as the impact of the pandemic abates. Since NPLs often rise at the later part of economic crisis, CBN\u2019s strong oversight remains critical to safeguarding financial sector stability.\n\n\u201cThe IMF mission would like to thank the authorities and other counterparts for the open and thoughtful discussions and excellent cooperation,\u201d the statement added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Buhari administration has stepped up efforts to regulate the online media in Nigeria in what is seen by many as attempts to further stifle the civic space in the country.\n\nTwo weeks after blocking Twitter\u2019s operations, the federal government has asked the House of Representatives to enact a law that will empower the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to control all forms of internet broadcasting and social media.\n\nThe request was made on Wednesday by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, during a public hearing organised by the house committee on information, national orientation, ethics, and values on a bill to amend the NBC Act.\n\nThe commission already controls television and radio broadcasting in Nigeria, based on provisions in Section 2(b) of the NBC Act. It states that \u201cthe Commission shall have [the] responsibility of receiving, processing and considering applications for the establishment, ownership or operation of radio and television stations including cable television services, direct satellite broadcast and any other medium of broadcasting.\u201d\n\nLai Mohammed now wants the commission to also regulate the online media, in addition to other channels of broadcasting. \u201cI want to add here specifically that internet broadcasting and all online media should be included in this because we have a responsibility to monitor contents, including Twitter,\u201d the minister told lawmakers.\n\nBefore Lai Mohammed\u2019s proposal, the broadcasting regulator had asked all social media platforms and service providers in the online broadcasting space in Nigeria to apply for a broadcast licence.\n\nPossible clampdown on freedom of expression\n\nWidespread criticism has trailed the proposal by the Nigerian government, which has only further stoked concerns over a possible clampdown on free speech and internet freedom by the Buhari administration.\n\nMedia stakeholders at the public hearing kicked against the inclusion of online media under NBC\u2019s mandate, asking the panel to instead make the commission more independent of the Minister of Information.\n\nOver time, the NBC has acted as an extension of the Ministry of Information and Culture, which rarely acts independently, and thus, the commission\u2019s operations have often been subject to political interference. This was condemned by the International Press Centre (IPC) and the Centre for Media Law and Advocacy in a joint statement that called for the neutrality of the commission.\n\nAccording to Akin Akingbulu, executive director of the Institute for Media and Society, the commission should not receive directives from the information minister. \u201cThe power to give directives to the commission, vested in the minister of information in section 6 should be removed and replaced with powers which include policy formulation for the broadcasting sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial media bill through the backdoor\u201d\n\nDespite the ban on Twitter, Nigerians continue to use the platform thanks to virtual private networks (VPNs) that help bypass the suspension. Many have taken to Twitter to express criticism over the proposed regulation of online media.\n\nBREAKING: NBC Amendment Bill Is Social Media Bill Through The Backdoor \u2014 SERAP (@SERAPNigeria) June 17, 2021\n\nAmendment of the NBC act;grafting the shoot of autocracy. \u2014 Senator Shehu Sani (@ShehuSani) June 17, 2021\n\nNigeria Govt is asking House of Reps to amend the NBC Act and include \u201cinternet broadcasting\u201d.\n\n\n\nThat means all online radio/TV stations must register with NBC and Lai Mohammed.

          "text": "Facebook, this week, said it has removed fake accounts, pages and groups that posted about news and politics ahead of Ethiopia\u2019s general election scheduled to hold next week.\n\nIn a statement published on its website, the social media giant reportedly took down 65 Facebook profiles, 52 pages, 27 groups and 32 Instagram accounts for violating its rules against misleading others about their purpose and identity.\n\nThe fake accounts mainly posted in Amharic about topics that include the Prosperity Party and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. They also criticised opposition politicians and groups in Ethiopia, such as the Oromo Liberation Front, Ethiopian Democratic Party, and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front.\n\n\u201cThe people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts as a central part of their operations to mislead people about who they are and what they are doing, and that was the basis for our action,\u201d Facebook said.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, the fake accounts posted the same content across multiple pages and groups to grow their following, and targeted domestic audiences in its own country.\n\nRoughly 1.1 million accounts followed one or more of the Facebook pages, about 766,000 accounts joined one or more of the groups, and around 1,700 people followed one or more of the Instagram accounts.\n\n\u201cGiven the upcoming election and the ongoing tensions in Ethiopia, our teams moved as quickly as possible to complete the investigation and disrupt this operation,\u201d Gleicher said.\n\nFacebook also linked the fake accounts to individuals associated with the Information Network Security Agency (INSA) in Ethiopia.\n\nA brutal war erupted in the country\u2019s Tigray region after which the United States restricted visas for government and military officials of Ethiopia and Eritrea over allegations of human rights violations.\n\nPro-government demonstrators in Ethiopia had criticised the move by Washington and Gleicher added that the fake accounts were critical of the sanctions as well. Although they did not directly focus on the conflict in Tigray.\n\nFacebook\u2019s move comes after severe criticism it has faced in the past for not doing enough to tackle fake accounts during national elections, including in the U.S. The social network has outlined plans in preparation for the Ethiopia vote, including ways to combat misinformation and hate speech.\n\nThe June 21 general elections will see Ethiopians elect members of the House of Peoples\u2019 Representatives.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Netflix on Sunday, June 13, commenced its first 3-month Episodic Lab (EPL) and Development Executive Traineeship (DET) programmes in Africa. This is in partnership with the Realness Institute, a South Africa-based Centre for African film-makers.\n\nOver 500 applications were received from Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe for the inaugural development lab for African writers and DET initiatives. However, only twelve professionals were selected to take part in both trainings.\n\nTwo Nigerians, Ayoade Adeyanju and Kehinde Joseph, selected to take part in EPL based on their story ideas, will get to develop their concepts with help from expert story consultants and creative producers. Other participants are Andile Ngcizela, Dominique Jossie and Kudakwashe Maradzika from South Africa and Mary Waireri from Kenya.\n\nThe lab participants will receive about $2,000 monthly stipend to enable them to focus entirely on their training, which will run remotely till September 5, 2021. At the end of the lab, each writer will have an opportunity to pitch their incubated concept to Netflix and could see their series further developed for production.\n\nMeanwhile, Ololade Okedare is the only Nigerian selected to participate in the DET, in addition to South Africans Anneke Villet, Antionette Engel and Thandeka Zwane, Damaris Irungu Ochieng\u2019 from Kenya and Lara Sousa, a Mozambican.\n\nThe executive trainees will get to immerse themselves in the story development process and receive technical training by partnering with the EPL writers to develop story concepts into quality productions.\n\nImproving storytelling in Africa\n\nThe Netflix programme is being held to strengthen the foundation of quality storytelling in Africa and is part of efforts by the global streaming giant to produce more original local content from creative writers on the continent.\n\n\u201cWithout the existence of our storytellers, our favourite Netflix stories wouldn\u2019t be possible,\u201d Alison Triegaardt, Netflix manager for Grow Creative in Africa, said. \u201cAfrica has an amazing pool of talent \u2013 both in front and behind the camera \u2013 hence Netflix is committed to investing in African stories and talent long-term.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a 5-day workshop focusing on post-production organised by Netflix is scheduled to be held later this month. The APost Lab is aimed at training film & television professionals from across Africa on technical best practices, technical and creative support methods, and methods to facilitate the best creative process.\n\nThirty-two participants have been invited to participate in the workshops while more than 100 film & TV professionals from across the continent will be part of the Masterclasses.\n\nPotential boost to subscriber base\n\nIn addition to improving quality storytelling in Africa, Netflix would most likely be looking to grow its relatively small subscriber base in the region by producing more relatable, original local content with the help of the development lab.\n\nAccording to a Digital TV Research study, Netflix currently has about 2 million subscribers in Africa, which is half of the continent\u2019s total streaming subscriber base.\n\nThere is a chance having more relatable original African content could lure more viewers on the continent to use the streaming service particularly as the London-based industry researcher estimates streaming subscriptions in Africa will reach 13 million by 2025, up from over 3.9 million in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re energised and excited by the many opportunities that lie ahead for us to help strengthen the quality of African storytelling and to bring fresh voices to our members in Africa and around the world\u201d, Triegaardt concluded.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Former Andela Community Manager, Babajide Duroshola, has stepped down as Safeboda\u2019s Country Director for Nigeria. Duroshola made this announcement today via his Twitter handle and in a Medium post.\n\nI came, I saw and conquered!!! https://t.co/vtdlgCWknP \u2014 Bab\u00e1j\u00edd\u00e9 D\u00far\u00f3sh\u1ecdl\u00e1 (@Babajiide) June 18, 2021\n\nDuroshola took over as Country Manager in 2019. This came after months of speculation regarding the Uganda-founded ride-hailing startup\u2019s launch in the country. During his tenure, the company introduced its finance offerings with users able to purchase airtime on the platform.\n\nThe startup initially announced plans to launch in Lagos following a Series B round, but that never happened. Although not the stated reason, the okada ban in Lagos meant that Safeboda had to launch in Ibadan, where ORide and MAX.ng were already present.\n\nThat decision seems to have paid off, with the company claiming to have completed 1.5 million trips and onboarded over 5,000 drivers. These appear to be impressive figures, especially when you consider that the startup said it had onboarded 2,500 riders and completed 1 million trips on the anniversary of its first year in operation.\n\nAt the time of its launch in Nigeria, there were predictions of bike-hailing wars with ORide and MAX.ng. However, in an interesting turn of events, as Safeboda launched in Ibadan, ORide exited the ride-hailing market.\n\nPerhaps to justify their decision to launch in Ibadan, Safeboda has regularly publicised the number of rides made on the platform. And with MAX.ng not doing the same, it is difficult to say if Safeboda is the dominant player in the ride-hailing industry.\n\nFounded in 2014 by Ricky Rapa Thompson, Maxime Dieudonne, and Alastair Sussock in Uganda, the startup soon spread to Kenya in 2018. However, by 2020, it announced that it was moving out of Kenya, having been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile no announcements have been made regarding Duroshola\u2019s replacement, he hinted that the startup had found a replacement internally.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has announced plans to restructure the country\u2019s current licensing structure to bring it in line with global standards in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ecosystem.\n\nThe current structure has served the industry for 18 years since its publication, and as NCC CEO, Umar Danbatta, says, it is due for an \u201curgent review\u201d.\n\nHe also set up a standing committee that would prepare reports and recommendations on existing licences, consultative fora, new licence undertakings, amendment to licence fees and durations, benchmarking of licences with similar jurisdictions, and the impact of certain licences on other licence holders.\n\nThe committee is also expected to recommend solutions and develop an updated regulatory framework for new and amended licences with a final report on the project with all recommendations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanbatta, while inaugurating the committee, said the need for the review of the existing licence structure was informed by the wide range of technological advances and the convergence of technologies and services which have characterised the global telecoms space over the years, and whose impact is increasingly being experienced in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria\u2019s licence structure\n\nNigeria currently favours a two-category regime \u2014 individual and class \u2014 for general and specific services.\n\nClass licences have a flat fee of \u20a610,000 ($24.39), while individual licences are within the range of \u20a6250,000 ($609.76) and \u20a650,000,000 ($121,952.22).\n\nThere will be amendments to fees as the committee is expected to give recommendations based on a comparative analysis of countries with similar jurisdiction.\n\nIn comparison with Nigeria, South Africa also operates a two-category licence structure, but its fees are more expensive. For class licences, they have a flat fee of R13,721 ($971.73), and for individual licences, application costs are determined by the Information Technology Association (ITA).\n\nKenya also operates the same licence regime with prices ranging from Ksh 1000 ($9.28) to Ksh 15 million ($139,146.57).\n\nConsidering all that the committee has to deliberate on, we might see significant changes such as increased licencing fees based on fees in other African countries, new licences relating to 5G implementation, mobile virtual network operators, or over-the-top licences.\n\nGlobal ICT standards\n\nAccording to the International Telecommunication Union\u2019s (ITU) 2020 Global ICT Regulatory Outlook, Nigeria is a third-generation (G3) country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo put this in context, the ITU ranks countries into five generations using Regulatory Tracker indicators divided into four pillars: Regulatory Authority, Regulatory Mandate, Regulatory Regime and Competition Framework. The Regulatory Tracker is an evidence-based tool to help decision-makers and regulators make sense of the rapid evolution of ICT.\n\nWith an overall score of 78.3, Nigeria barely passes the benchmark above G2 countries where basic reform \u2014 partial liberalisation and privatisation across all layers \u2014 occurs.\n\nThe Ethiopian government\u2019s bid to sell off its stake in Ethio Telecom gives more clarity. Before the sale of its first private national telecoms licence to Safaricom\u2019s consortium, the country ranked as a G1 country \u2014 government-owned and controlled industry.\n\nAfter the sale, it was bumped up to a G2 country because the industry had been privatised.\n\nAs a G3 country, Nigeria\u2019s ICT ecosystem enables investment, innovation and access \u2014 dual focus on stimulating competition in service and content delivery, and consumer protection.\n\nKenya is the only African country to rank as a G5 country. According to ITU\u2019s ranking, the East African nation\u2019s ICT Regulatory Framework fosters vibrant markets and is also key to finding market solutions. It also means that Kenya\u2019s ICT regulator plays a leadership role.\n\nIt\u2019s been 18 years since the last licence review. In that time, we\u2019ve seen Glo\u2019s famous per second billing that blew the market wide open, competition leading to reduced \u2014 but still expensive \u2014 data prices, 4G coverage, MainOne\u2019s fiber cable\n\nWill the door be open to new players? Will a new entrant come to break MTN\u2019s dominance? We will have answers when the review is completed.\n\nWhile this move by the NCC shows progressiveness \u2014 especially in light of recent policy amendments \u2014 it appears there are still some ways to go before Nigeria attains global ICT standards.",

          "title": "A lamplight on technology and autism spectrum disorder in Africa",
          "text": "From the Massai tribe in Kenya to the Yorubas in Nigeria, the birth of a child is a delightful and highly celebrated event in Africa. There\u2019s cooking and tons of prayers spoken over the child, and, of course, its parents are overwhelmed with a lifetime\u2019s worth of parenting advice.\n\nBut what happens when a child fails to reach expected developmental milestones? For example, how should parents handle a four-year-old who doesn\u2019t respond appropriately to things happening around, is overly sensitive to specific sights and sounds, and hasn\u2019t spoken their first words yet?\n\nIn most parts of Africa, the immediate response is fear as such challenges are believed to result from spiritual problems. However, the likelihood of these being symptoms of a neurological disorder is hardly entertained.\n\nA report by Spectrumnews reveals that autism goes undiagnosed in African children until they are eight years old, unlike their American counterparts, who are diagnosed four years earlier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAutism from the African lens\n\nMedically known as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), autism is a neurological developmental disability characterised by various symptoms, including nonverbal speech patterns, hypersensitivity to specific sights, sounds and colours, and, in some cases, intellectual impairment.\n\nOverall, it is a diverse group of conditions that primarily affects the ability to communicate and interact with one\u2019s immediate environment appropriately.\n\nUsually, it appears fully by age 2 or 3 but can be diagnosed as early as 12 months. Unlike Down syndrome and cerebral palsy, autism mostly comes with no physical signs.\n\nIt is a medically diagnosed condition, and because of its complexity and broad range of characteristics, it should not be diagnosed by non-medical personnel.\n\nDiagnosing autism is a challenge in Africa because of several superstitious beliefs associated with the condition and the unavailability of the proper medical infrastructure required to run the tests.\n\nIn some parts of the continent, people living with autism are \u201clabelled as devils, and they are not diagnosed or given treatment. Some people believe that the disorder is punishment for a parent\u2019s bad behaviour or an affliction,\u201d says Bernadette Lamar, a Sierra Leonean who runs a behavioural healthcare centre.\n\nDue to a lack of inadequate information, parents with autistic children in Africa are usually left with no choice but to seek help from spiritual sources. And to avoid stigmatisation, they lock up their children, keeping them out of plain sight.\n\nIn 2002, Zemi Yenus founded Ethiopia\u2019s first school for children with autism after her son was diagnosed with the condition. He had been rejected from multiple mainstream schools, and she had a hard time finding special needs children teachers in Ethiopia who knew what autism was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo she used her savings from her old job as a beautician to open her school in a small rented Addis Ababa house. She called it The Joy Center of Excellence for Autism and kicked off with just four children, including her son.\n\nOn May 11, 2021, Yenus passed on from COVID-19-related complications. Her centre currently caters for hundreds of Ethiopian children living with ASD.\n\nSome data to run with\n\nAccording to World Health Organisation statistics, globally, 1 in 160 children has ASD. With sketchy data on children living with autism in Africa, it is difficult to arrive at a figure for the continent.\n\nNevertheless, a 2019 Autism Society of Kenya (ASK) report revealed that in Kenya alone, there was likely to be 1 autistic child for every 25 children. And a globalliving.org report estimates that Ethiopia has 600,000 autistic children.\n\nWHO\u2019s global ratio might be very different if the Organisation accounted for Africa\u2019s autism figures. But that is neither here nor there in a discussion about the challenges autistic children and their parents face in Africa.\n\nHow tech fits into the picture\n\nCurious to discover how technology can create awareness and help autistic children lead better lives, I spoke with Mrs C. Adedeji, a special needs children instructor.\n\nShe mentioned how various applications and e-tools could assist parents and instructors in delivering individual-based lessons to these children.\n\nFrom our conversation, I learnt that autistic children, like everyone else, come with a unique, innate skill-set to harness adequate time and attention.\n\n\u201cIn my years as a caregiver for special children, it\u2019s a thing of joy and reward when I see children that I\u2019ve taught and nurtured \u2014 alongside somewhat tired and hopeful parents \u2014 do things for themselves and even build their talents. Because, like everyone else, they are gifted and can make meaningful contributions to the world,\u201d Adedeji said.\n\nThankfully, technology can assist learning and help autistic children grow, improve verbal communication, learn speech patterns, and build social interaction skills.\n\nShe confirmed that \u201ca lot of apps are so effective in helping and improving the lives of these children through self-guided learning and the removal of a structure common to most brick and mortar classes.\u201d\n\nWith mobile apps, video games, and medically approved online resources available, autistic children stand a better chance to manage the disorder today than they did years ago.\n\nThe slow rate of Internet penetration remains a big hindrance to parents and special children instructors who need technological assistance to care for and teach these children in most African countries.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me, I think the best option is for the government of most African countries to see this as a cause for concern and foster the integration of special needs technological materials in our regular schools,\u201d Adedeji added.\n\nThere is currently no cure for ASD, and because it is a spectrum disorder, the symptoms vary from mild to acute. However, a range of treatments can be administered to manage it better.\n\nMobile applications like Language Therapy for Kids \u2013 MITA, Speech Blubs 2, Otsimo and others help administer Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication-handicapped Children (TEACCH) \u2014 individual-based visual learning methods \u2014 to children living with autism and also assist instructors and parents in caring for them.\n\nThese apps should not replace a strong community of support from parents, a good special needs children instructor, and an inclusive society.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nThe most effective way to manage ASD is early diagnosis, and this is another area where technology has helped.\n\nThe electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test tool used to detect the brain\u2019s electrical activity. It can also serve as a biomarker for ASD. A team of researchers in South Africa decided to test the effectiveness of this technology.\n\nThey discovered that the biomarker could differentiate between ASD in typically developing children and those whose genes showed some signs of ASD but were not with the condition. The results had a 90% accuracy.\n\nA greater cause for concern\n\nBeyond the challenge of a lack of data on autism, the stigmatisation autistic children and their parents face in Africa is a major problem.\n\nThis is because the disorder is considered more of a spiritual condition than a medical one that can be effectively managed.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t understand this is purely a medical condition. It can happen to anyone regardless of their background. A lot needs to be done in our part of the world in terms of education, acceptance, and understanding,\u201d said Amoah, coordinator at a treatment centre for children with disabilities in Accra, Ghana.\n\nChildren living with autism can learn to live with the disorder if accepted and managed rather than rejected and stigmatised. By making room for the range of diversities that characterise our world, we can make the world a better place.\n\nHappy Autistic Pride Day!",

          "text": "It has been six months since the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) took off on January 1, but impossible to say how it has contributed to Nigeria\u2019s trade with other African countries, even as official data shows exports that were on the increase now suddenly dropped by half, while imports increased.\n\nThe latest news on the AfCFTA secretariat\u2019s website is from April 27, announcing that Wamkele Mene, the secretary-general, had a negative COVID test result on return to Accra from \u2018a mission outside the country\u2019, which hosts the secretariat.\n\nTill date, no information has been publicly made available as to if or how the trade agreement is impacting trade on the continent. No data on any activities that may have been executed or progress towards full trade is available.\n\nHowever, Nigeria\u2019s exports to other African countries has declined for the first time in five years within the first quarter, with data from the National Bureau of Statistics foreign trade report showing a year-on-year decline of 54 percent when compared to the same period of 2020. Conversely, imports from other African countries increased by 51 percent within the same period.\n\nFrom N393.8 billion worth of exports across Africa in the first quarter of 2017, Nigeria\u2019s exports increased in that same period of every subsequent year, recording N979 billion in 2020, before dipping to N449.8 billion this year\u2019s first quarter. Even though the final tally at the end of 2020 was lower than the previous full year, it is hard to imagine how 2021 would end with the year already starting weak.\n\nOn the other hand, imports with an unstable pattern of increasing and decreasing, surged 51 percent in the first quarter of 2021, with Nigeria importing N183.4 billion worth of goods from other African countries, from N121.4 billion in the same period of 2020.\n\nRead Also: AfCFTA: What social enterprises need to know\n\nIt remains unclear if AfCFTA is contributing to the trade pattern already being seen in Nigeria, even as it appears little is happening, at least publicly. Another poser has been; are the engines of AfCFTA itself being too slow to roar to life?\n\n\u201cIt is not right to say it has been slow. What will be correct is to say it is a process, and the process is on, one that involves national laws,\u201d said Demitta Gyang, assistant chief negotiator, AfCFTA/ECOWAS at the Nigerian Office for Trade Negotiations.\n\nAccording to her, whether one is able to export under AfCFTA would involve national laws. It is also a process that involves customs infrastructure as well as the readiness of exporters themselves to take advantage of the market that has been created.\n\n\u201cIt is a process that has come a long way in these six months,\u201d she asserted when the question was put to her during a recent webinar organised by the Nigeria-British Chamber of Commerce. She was, however, silent on what the value or volume of transactions have been so far.\n\nKabir Ibrahim, a member of Nigeria\u2019s National Action Committee on AfCFTA, also told BusinessDay \u201cWork is going on but you know this is the private sector, most people when the going is very good they hardly mention it.\u201d\n\nIbrahim stated there are people in different businesses, including manufacturers who have started benefitting but are not talking about it. It is there, silent but all the institutions are being made aware and repositioned to be able to play well. The export promotion council is also working to ensure all these things key into their protocol.\n\n\u201cWhen things are going well and there is opportunity to make money, people don\u2019t talk about it. It is only when they experience difficulties they start complaining,\u201d said Ibrahim who is also Co-lead of the Agriculture and Agribusiness sector of the NAC.\n\nHas anyone executed a transaction from Nigeria that he is personally aware of? \u201cHonestly, I cannot put my hands on facts and figures,\u201d he replied.\n\nHowever, for Emmanuel Ijewere, CEO of Best Foods, his first financial transaction on the basis of AfCFTA will come up between October and November with new business partners from Rwanda, although he wouldn\u2019t give detail so that his \u201ccompetitors won\u2019t latch on to it\u201d.\n\nHe also stated that the AfCFTA infrastructure is \u201cjust beginning to warm up. I know a lot of people especially in the agricultural space are having a better relationship with those from other countries.\u201d\n\nPersonally, he says his business has now \u201cestablished relationship with organisations in Namibia and Rwanda, increased my relationship with those in Ghana and there\u2019s another in Cote D\u2019Ivoire so it is just warming up. It is a marathon, not a 100-meter dash.\u201d\n\nUntil better clarity is available on what component of Nigeria\u2019s current and subsequent trade data can be attributed to AfCFTA, it will remain impossible to ascertain if and when the trade deal begins to make a real impact.",

          "text": "The Nigerian media industry has called on the House of Representatives to step down a bill seeking to amend the Nigerian Press Council Act, saying it is still a subject of litigation at the Supreme Court.\n\nThis message was given by the Nigerian Press Organisation (NPO), which covers the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN), and the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), at the House Committee on Information, National Orientation, Ethics and Values organised public hearing on the bill. The House, however, insisted on going ahead with the exercise.\n\nIn recent time, several media organisations and groups have criticised various clauses in the bill as possibly discouraging Freedom of Speech in the country.\n\nThe committee had organised the hearing on five bills that include the \u2018Bill for an Act to Amend the Nigerian Press Council Act, CAP N128, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, to Remove Bottlenecks Affecting Its Performance and Make the Council in Tune with Current Realities in Regulating the Press and for Related Matters (HB 330).\u2019\n\nOlusegun Odebunmi, chairman of the committee, apologised to the Nigerian media, especially NPAN that protested on Wednesday over exclusion from the exercise, saying an open invitation to the event was extended to all stakeholders.\n\nOdebunmi said, \u201cSo, I am sorry if there is anybody who thinks we did not invite them. It is not by intention; it was definitely a mistake. Notwithstanding, we have covered everybody through our advert.\u201d\n\nHowever, Azubuike Ishiekwene, editor-in-chief of Leadership Newspapers, who represented the NPO, said contrary to the claim of an open invitation by the committee, the organisation did not receive any notification that would have enabled it engage the lawmakers and Nigerians robustly on the bill.\n\nRead Also: War against everybody\n\n\u201cThere is a matter and I am sure that as stewards of the people and the law, you are aware that there is a pending matter between the NPO and some parties involved in this legislation. That is why a negotiated conversation seems to us to be a way to deal with it because there is a matter pending before the Supreme Court: between the NPAN and some parties involved in this bill that is being amended. And as stewards of the law, I am sure you are constrained just as I am to make any further conversations on this matter because it is a pending matter before the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThe last time it came up in 2010 \u2013 it is a matter that has actually been pending since 1999 \u2013 17 of the 39 clauses contained in the bill that you are considering were ruled unconstitutional by the court at that time. Of course, the Federal Government appealed the ruling. We won the appeal and the matter is currently before the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cI will rest my case by appealing to the honourable members of this committee; I crave your indulgence to refer to a conversation that was had on a similar matter in 2018 when this matter came up before the Senate and the pendency of this matter before the court was canvassed. And the Senate \u2013 the 8th National Assembly \u2013 at that time agreed that the prudent thing to do was to step it down. I urge this House to also consider a similar step,\u201d Ishiekwene stated.\n\nRead Also: In defence of dissent\n\nOn his part, Odebunmi argued that the House was doing its constitutional job \u201cand I am very sure (that) no court will restrain us from doing the job,\u201d saying while the lawmakers would not stop anybody from going ahead with the judicial process, the lawmakers had the mandate of Nigerians to amend laws.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is not about the matter in court, it is an Act of the National Assembly and we deemed it fit to amend it and we are doing that. It does not stop you from what you are doing but this is the position of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nIn a memo was signed by Lanre Arogundade, executive director, IPC; Edetaen Ojo, executive director, MRA; Richard Akinola, executive director, CMLA, and Dapo Olorunyomi, executive director, PTCIJ, the International Press Centre, Media Rights Agenda, Centre for Media Law and Advocacy and the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism, a joint memorandum titled \u2018For a Truly Independent and Media Freedom Friendly Nigeria Press Council,\u2019 called on the National Assembly to expunge all laws intended to criminalise free speech and press.\n\nArogundade, who read from the memo, said, \u201cFirst, we like to say that the international behaviour towards media regulation is peer regulation, constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the press, and the expunging from statute all laws that criminalises freedom of expression. This is the line the Committee should tow as Ghana has done and like South Africa has done; and with regards to throwing off defamation statute from the books, the way Sierra Leone has done.\n\n\u201cA consideration is that the amendment seeks an unabashed focus to restrict freedom of expression while masking the toga of something else. It attempts to do what other laws have done like the Cybercrimes Acts which Sections 24 and 38, which in no fewer than ten instances have been used to clamp down on bloggers or journalists for expressing opinion antagonistic to politically or economically powerful elites.\n\nRead Also: Armstrong\u2019s strong arm tactics threaten Nigeria\u2019s $1bn broadcasting industry\n\n\u201cBodies like the Amnesty International has documented 50 cases where the law had targeted, not cybercrime suspects, but bloggers and journalists for writing on what they \u2018know to be false, for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill will or needless anxiety to another.\u2019\u201d\n\nOthers are that \u201cThe ethical code that should be operationalised by the council is the Code of Ethics of Journalists in Nigeria as adopted by the Nigerian Press Organisation, comprising the Nigeria Union of Journalists, the Nigerian Guild of Editors and the Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria in Ilorin in 1998 and as may be regularly updated. This has been the practice. A political and non-journalism office like that of the Minister of Information should not be given the power of approval over the code of conduct of journalists.\n\n\u201cThe power to determine sanctions relating to hefty fines should be vested in the courts and not the council. The Court of Appeal has clearly established this legal principle in NOSDRA v Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (2018) LPELR-44210 (CA) where it held that \u2018the imposition of fines by NOSDRA was contrary to its powers on the basis that penalties or fines are imposed as punishment for an offence or violation of the law and the power as well as competence to establish that an offence has been committed belongs to the courts and not a regulatory agency.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe provision relating to revocation of license for alleged publication of fake news should be removed from the Act. Decisions for appropriate sanctions in relation to such offences should be vested in the law courts.\u201d",
          "summary": "The Nigerian media industry has called on the House of Representatives to step down a bill seeking to amend the Nigerian Press Council Act, saying it is still a subject of litigation at the Supreme Court.\nIn recent time, several media organisations and groups have criticised various clauses in the bill as possibly discouraging Freedom of Speech in the country.\nOdebunmi said, \u201cSo, I am sorry if there is anybody who thinks we did not invite them.\n\u201cA consideration is that the amendment seeks an unabashed focus to restrict freedom of expression while masking the toga of something else.\n\u201cThe power to determine sanctions relating to hefty fines should be vested in the courts and not the council.",

Osaigbovo Iyoha, reassured that his government will sustain ongoing infrastructure projects across the state to boost economic activities and improve the lives of the people.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are aware and know that the road has been awarded by NDDC. We make sure that we don\u2019t duplicate efforts. NDDC has not been forthcoming with contracts that have been awarded at that level.\n\n\u201cIn a normal system, if the NDDC has lived up to their responsibility and done the right thing, the government will not need to do the same project. We don\u2019t duplicate work; it amounts to a waste of funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cNDDC left the road in a worse shape than it was before the construction started. It is not an excuse to allow the people suffer, following the failure of an agency to perform their statutory responsibility,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cAs soon as possible, we would send government agencies to check the immediate state of the road and report back. We will do something quick for our people at Urhonigbe because we know that our people are predominantly farmers.\n\n\u201cWe would deploy officials from the Ministry of Infrastructure to examine the state of the road to enable us to provide palliative measures before providing a permanent solution to the road. As an administration, we will do our best to ensure that the people of the community feel the impact of the government.\u201d\n\nAppreciating the people of Ugha Quarters for the support before, during and after the governorship election in the state, the governor noted: \u201cI appreciate you for your support and prayers before, during and after the election, as well as your support throughout the time in the courts.\n\n\u201cThe last election proved to us that you trust this administration and I want to assure you that the confidence reposed in us will not be betrayed.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is recovering but unemployment and inflation remain elevated, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said.\n\nAn International Monetary Fund (IMF) team led by Jesmin Rahman made this observation after it held virtual meetings with the Nigerian authorities from June 1 to 8, to discuss recent economic, financial developments and outlook.\n\nThe IMF explained further that the recent exchange rate measures are encouraging, and further reforms are needed to achieve a fully unified and market-clearing exchange rate.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian economy has started to gradually recover from the negative effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic,\u201d the IMF said in a statement, adding that \u201cfollowing sharp output contractions in the second and third quarters, GDP growth turned positive in Q4 2020 and growth reached 0.5 percent (y/y) in Q1 2021, supported by agriculture and services sectors.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the fund said employment level continues to fall dramatically and, together with other socio-economic indicators, is far below pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\u201cInflation slightly decelerated in May but remained elevated at 17.9 percent, owing to high food price inflation. With the recovery in oil prices and remittance flows, the strong pressures on the balance of payments have somewhat abated, although imports are rebounding faster than exports and foreign investor appetite remains subdued resulting in continued FX shortage.\n\n\u201cThe incipient recovery in economic activity is projected to take root and broaden among sectors, with GDP growth expected to reach 2.5 percent in 2021. Inflation is expected to remain elevated in 2021, but likely to decelerate in the second half of the year to reach about 15.5 percent, following the removal of border controls and the elimination of base effects from elevated food price levels.\u201d\n\nSubsidy\n\nThe resurfacing of fuel subsidies is concerning, particularly in the context of low revenue mobilization, the IMF said.\n\nThe organisation said tax revenue collections are gradually recovering but, with fuel subsidies resurfacing, additional spending for Covid-19 vaccines, and to address security challenges, the fiscal deficit of the Consolidated Government is expected to remain elevated at 5.5 percent of GDP.\n\nDownside risks to the near-term arise from further deterioration of security conditions, and the still uncertain course of the pandemic both globally and in Nigeria, it said.\n\n\u201cThe mission commended the authorities\u2019 measures to contain the transmission of Covid-19 in Nigeria, including the ongoing vaccination program under the COVAX initiative, and strongly supported the authorities\u2019 efforts to acquire additional doses from countries with surplus stocks.\n\n\u201cThe mission expressed its concern with the resurgence of fuel subsidies. It reiterated the importance of introducing market-based fuel pricing mechanism and the need to deploy well-targeted social support to cushion any impact on the poor. The mission recommended stepping up efforts to strengthen tax administration to mobilize additional revenues and help address priority spending pressures.\n\n\u201cThe mission urged the authorities to keep reliance on CBN overdrafts for deficit financing within legal limits, while the government continues to make efforts to strengthen budget planning and public finance management practices to allow for flexible financing from domestic markets and better integration of cash and debt management.\u201d\n\nExchange Rate\n\nIMF said the recent removal of the official exchange rate from the CBN website and measures to enhance transparency in the setting of the NAFEX exchange rate are encouraging.\n\n\u201cThe mission recommended maintaining the momentum toward fully unifying all exchange rate windows and establishing a market-clearing exchange rate,\u201d it added.\n\n\u201cOn monetary policy, to strengthen the monetary targeting regime, the mission recommended integrating the interbank and debt markets and using central bank or government bills of short-maturity as the main liquidity management tool, instead of the cash reserve requirements.\u201d\n\nThe banking sector remains liquid and well-capitalized while non-performing loans (NPLs) are contained, the IMF said, adding that the extension of the moratorium on principal payments of qualifying credit facilities on a case-by-case basis through March 2022 should be limited to viable debtors with strong pre-crisis fundamentals.\n\n\u201cCBN stress tests purport that the banking system would remain adequately capitalized except in case of a severe deterioration of credit quality.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cNevertheless, it remains to be seen what share of forborne loans may turn non-performing as the impact of the pandemic abates. Since NPLs often rise at the later part of economic crisis, CBN\u2019s strong oversight remains critical to safeguarding financial sector stability.\u201d\n\nThe IMF recommendation comes days after the World Bank called on the Nigerian authorities to create the environment for a more predictable foreign exchange management system.",

Addiction to social media is like addiction to drugs. It can render a whole destiny useless.\n\n\u201cThis social media saga has eroded the substance of destiny of most youths today. What is supposed to be a plus has suddenly become a major minus because everything of value delivers through the investment of time.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, we are faced with a generation on the wrong side of history; the honour of this generation has been wiped off \u2014 chatting all day with no time left to think, plan, programme and engage productively in the pursuit of any task.\n\n\u201cMany youths spend less than 10 to 20 per cent of their time on their tasks per day. They can never match a generation that spends 70 per cent to 80 per cent of their time on their tasks.\n\n\u201cWe must devise means to put a check on free access to social media, particularly those that are not adding values.

          "title": "El-Rufai Sacks 99 Political Appointees",
          "text": "Governor Nasir El Rufai has said Kaduna state has started implementing its rightsizing policy by disengaging 99 political appointees, but is yet to disengage any state civil servant.\n\nThe governor disclosed that only agencies connected to the local government system have disengaged staff and these include the 23 local government councils, SUBEB and the Primary Health Care Board.\n\nEl-Rufai who made the disclosure at a media chat with some Kaduna-based broadcast journalists on Thursday night, explained that the disengaged political appointees constitute 30% of political office holders.\n\n\u2018\u2019So far, 99 political appointees have lost their jobs but we have not commenced rightsizing civil servants. We want to be fair with regards to civil servants. We had earlier promised that before we reduce the size of the civil service, we will start with political appointees and we have done that,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe governor who spoke in Hausa, said that the rightsizing of civil servants will still go on as planned because of dwindling revenues that is accruing to the state government from the federation account.\n\nEl Rufai explained that the rightsizing commenced with political appointees because their details are clearly known, making it more straightforward to disengage them.\n\n\u2018\u2019However, civil servants with question marks on the veracity of their data have to be given a chance to clear the doubts before any action is taken on them,\u2019\u2019 he clarified.\n\nThe governor said that his government has employed 11,000 more workers in the health sector, Kaduna State University as well as primary and secondary school teachers across the state.\n\nThe governor disclosed that it is a fallacy to allege that the salaries of political appointees account for the bloated personnel cost of Kaduna State Government.\n\n\u2018\u2019In March 2021, the salaries of these political appointees amounted to N259 million , while civil servants were paid N3.13 billion, aside from costs related to state contributions to pension, accrued rights and other personnel costs. So, it is false to insinuate that political appointees are the ones that guzzle most of the state\u2019s resources,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nJustifying the rightsizing of the public service, he said that all states and the federal government are affected by this shortfall of revenue and some states have even reverted to paying the old monthly minimum wage of N18,000.\n\n\u2018\u2019Kaduna State cannot continue to use 84% to 96% of our revenues to pay salaries of less than 1% of the population. The rest of our people, all 99% of them, need better schools, hospitals, water supply, roads, markets and support for agriculture to make a living outside government,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe governor however promised that Kaduna state will not reverse the N30,000 minimum wage that it has started paying.\n\n\u201cWe are the first government, federal or state, to pay the minimum wage. We will retain the minimum wage of N30,000 and the consequential adjustments that gave most of our civil servants a 66% salary increase. We will also retain the minimum pension of N30,000 monthly.\n\n\u201cThe unified Local Government Service continues to pay the minimum wage, even though they varied the consequential adjustments for their workers below the level for state civil servants,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nThe governor also promised that the state will still fund free education from primary 1 to the SS3, adding that \u2018\u2019we have directed our Ministry of Education to find ways of ensuring that we sponsor students for WAEC exams, the same way that we sponsor them for NECO. \u2018\u2019\n\nEl Rufai emphasized that basic education is a priority for Kaduna State Government because \u2018\u2019we see it as the bedrock for equality of opportunity.\u2019\u2019",
          "summary": "Governor Nasir El Rufai has said Kaduna state has started implementing its rightsizing policy by disengaging 99 political appointees, but is yet to disengage any state civil servant.\nEl-Rufai who made the disclosure at a media chat with some Kaduna-based broadcast journalists on Thursday night, explained that the disengaged political appointees constitute 30% of political office holders.\n\u2018\u2019So far, 99 political appointees have lost their jobs but we have not commenced rightsizing civil servants.\nEl Rufai explained that the rightsizing commenced with political appointees because their details are clearly known, making it more straightforward to disengage them.\nSo, it is false to insinuate that political appointees are the ones that guzzle most of the state\u2019s resources,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

          "title": "Global economic crisis: Is Nigeria ready for renewable energy transition?",
          "text": "\u2026Osinbajo advises a more equitable transition\n\n\u2026Gas, our own renewable energy \u2013 Sylva\n\n\u2018\u2026Stakeholders\u2019 collaboration needed\u2019\n\n\u2026 Nigeria ready, but\u2026- Expert\n\nThe world is moving from fossil fuel to renewable energy, but many have been left wondering whether or not Nigeria, with its dependence on oil as a major source of revenue, is ready for this global shift. BENJAMIN UMUTEME writes.\n\nIn 1957, when Nigeria discovered oil in Oloibiri, in the present day Bayelsa state, most people thought the country was set to become a global super player, but it was not to be. Rather, the country\u2019s economy has continued to struggle especially with the volatility of the oil market in recent times.\n\nWith the discovery of oil, Nigeria left its other sources of revenue without a look into the future. While the country made so much money from the sale of crude oil, it failed miserably to invest the money in critical sectors of the economy and, by extension, the oil sector, thereby stalling investments in the industry.\n\nAnd then the coronavirus pandemic hit the world economy making Nigeria\u2019s inability to make hay while the sun was shining obvious. By April last year, oil prices had entered negative territory and with it the need for the global economy began to look at cleaner and cheaper sources of energy to power production.\n\nEnergy transition/issues\n\nMany say the next transformation in human civilisation now occurs in the energy sector. Already, the transition has started disrupting oil exporting economies like Nigeria that depend heavily on oil for its economic activities.\n\nEnvironmental issues are one of the major problems facing humans today. Emissions from energy use, resource depletion and waste generation from production and consumption activities and many other anthropogenic activities impacts the globe adversely, consequently, the growing attention on energy transition and circular economy.\n\nFossil fuel has played a critical role in socio-economic development and international relations of countries over the last 120 years. However, climate change and air pollution have increased the inevitability to consider the use of fossil fuels. The major problem with fossil fuel use is greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions.\n\nThe GHGs\u2014N2O, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) have increased by 20 per cent, 40 per cent, and 150 per cent above pre-industrial level. In the 1880s, during the industrial revolution, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 was about 280 parts per million (ppm).\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, it was 399 and 403.9 ppm, respectively, representing a 30 per cent increase above pre-industrial level. Emissions from combustion of fossil fuel account for 65 per cent of the global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Residence time of CO2 in the atmosphere varies between 50 to 200 years. About two-thirds of global GHGs emissions come from energy production and consumption. Between 1880 and 2012, the average temperature of the globe increased by 0.85 \u2103.\n\nPresently, there are increased variations in temperatures and severe weather, resulting in increased degrees and incidences of hot days across most regions of the globe; thus, the present emphasis on renewable energy.\n\nActions that support sustainable development and advancement throughout all segments of the human environment are critical to human civilisation. Transition from \u201chydrocarbon molecules to electrons\u201d (fossil fuels to renewable and low-carbon energy) is growing globally.\n\nAs it stands, renewable energy technologies are becoming more cost-competitive relative to fossil fuels. The increasing transition will have serious socio-economic and political implications if the country does not diversify its economy. For instance, the contraction in oil export because of global transition to renewable energy will reduce the government\u2019s revenue, increase unemployment, decrease capacity to finance infrastructure and development projects, and increase poverty rate.\n\nNigeria has enormous renewable energy potential, solar, wind, biomass, among others. The use of renewable will improve environmental quality including increased use of biomass (organic wastes) for energy production which would advance Nigeria solid waste management system and vice versa. All these are associated with sustainable resource management.\n\nTotal\u2019s initiative, others\u2019 strategies\n\nIn a bid to drive home the reality of the transition to cleaner source of energy, oil major Total Exploration re-branded to Total Energies. This, the company said, signals its new strategy of diversification towards cleaner energy sources.\n\n\u201cThe group is expressing its intention to transform itself into a multi-energy company to respond to the twin challenges faced by energy transitions: more energy and fewer emissions,\u201d Total\u2019s chief executive Patrick Pouyanne said in a statement.\n\nThis year, Total plans to devote more than 20 per cent of its investment budget to renewable energy sources as well as electricity. But environmental activists say it must do more to fight climate change, and recently the International Energy Agency said all future fossil fuel projects must be scrapped if the world is to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nSimilarly, several international oil firms are already realigning their operations and reducing investments in upstream activities with a view to embracing cleaner fuels. Even European Banks are becoming reluctant to support new investments in fossil fuels.\n\nCountries, even the least expected to comply, are making commitments to a carbon-free world.\n\nChina has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2060, India has committed to a target of achieving 40 per cent of its total electricity generation from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, the UK sees the country carbon neutral by 2050 and for the first time, in 2020, renewable overtook fossil fuels as the European Union\u2019s main source of electricity.\n\nThe president, Nigerian Gas Producers, Ed Ubong, noted that gas will continue to play a key role as green fuel as we try to meet the renewable target as the country try to meet its sustainable energy demand.\n\nHe said, \u201cNigeria is sitting on a huge reserve of gas. We must utilise the gas we have. We must unlock the challenge that exists in the gas to power value chain and improve power to energy for the over 85 million Nigerians. We must address structural issues around the grid.\n\n\u201cHow do we reduce distribution losses, how do we ensure that payment happens, how do we ensure that gas plants get gas reliably.\u201d Here-in is the dilemma for Nigeria and most emerging economies that still rely heavily on \u2018dirty fuel.\u2019\n\nOsinbajo\u2019s admonition\n\nHowever, in what looks like a plea to the European Union, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has urged developed countries to adopt a more equitable energy transition for the developing world. According to the vice-president, they ought to recognise the significant differences between different fuels and the context of their use.\n\nHe is of the view that there should be a gradual adoption and implementation of the transitioning scheme for fossil fuels, especially for Africa\u2019s developing economies with huge energy access gaps.\n\n\u201cThe path to de-carbonisation by 2050 needs to solve energy poverty by 2030, or that demand will be met through dirty energy sources,\u201d he said.\n\nFG\u2019s regrets\n\nThe Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, regrets that Nigeria does not have the resources to go into renewable at the moment. He, however, does believe that for Nigeria, gas is a bridge to achieving its own renewable energy.\n\nSpeaking with Blueprint Weekend recently in Abuja, Sylva said while the world is moving towards clean energy, Nigeria would be transiting to gas, which it considers as its own clean energy.\n\n\u201cSo, should we also join them now to move to renewable energy and abandon our resources? I don\u2019t think so, and I say it boldly everywhere. After all, those economies were built on resources from coal and other dirtier fuels,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister was rather confident that with the county\u2019s abundant gas resources Nigeria would gradually transit to renewable. According to him, the country does not have the huge funds needed to go into clean energy research.\n\n\u201cOkay, today, they have moved to this level. In a situation where 600 million Africans are still without energy, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a realistic position. That\u2019s why in Nigeria, our focus now is on gas which we consider at best a destination fuel and at worst a transition fuel to renewable.\n\n\u201cAnd since we have it in abundance why don\u2019t we maximise it now so that at least we are taking a step forward as well. That\u2019s our position in Nigeria, not necessarily that we want to go into developing renewable. In energy usually, there must be a mix. You are not expected to use only one source of energy. Our focus now is on gas as a major source of energy which we have in abundance.\n\n\u201cThe global energy industry is moving towards renewable even the investors are taking out investable funds from the oil and gas sector and moving into renewable. Is Nigeria also joining that race?\n\n\u201cIt is something that is difficult to say. We are not in that race as such. There\u2019s a lot of funding required for research for renewable and we are not into that yet. But for Nigeria, we are looking at gas as a transition fuel to renewable.\u201d\n\nHe said further: \u201cSome people are even looking at gas not as a transition fuel, but as renewable. If you have gas you can consider it to be renewable fuel as well. The question I always ask when I go for international events is: if the concern with non renewable is carbon emission, why is the global economies are now focusing on developing carbon capture technologies instead of moving away from the non renewable?\n\n\u201cIf the global economy is focused on carbon capture, we can actually clean up the fuel as well and reduce the emission from non renewable, clean it and it becomes something that will not affect climate change. But the global system tends to be moving away from the oil and gas non renewable resources which we have in abundance.\n\n\u201cIn energy usually, there must be a mix. You are not expected to use only one source of energy. Our focus now is on gas as a major source of energy which we have in abundance.\u201d\n\nA gradual process?\n\nOn his part, the maintenance/project manager, Servon Nigeria Limited, Anderson Aleru, told this reporter that Nigeria was ready for the energy transition.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be a gradual process; natural resources like gas are something we have in sufficient quantities and the federal government wants to really start producing gas so that we can also convert it to supply electricity.\n\n\u201cIt will take time because to be able to build a central processing facility for this gas is very expensive. It\u2019s going to be a gradual process since funds will be involved,\u201d he said.\n\nStakeholders\u2019 role\n\nSpeaking to Blueprint Weekend on the sidelines of the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit (NIPS), the general manager, Sales of Global Process and Pipeline Limited (GPSS), Taiwo Abiodun, said energy transition can only be possible if all hands are on deck.\n\nAccording to him, with its abundant gas resources, Nigeria can use gas as a transition to clean energy.\n\nHe said, \u201cPresently, Nigeria is generating a certain percentage of gas but you can also see that with what is happening, what we are suffering with insecurity, what we are suffering about all the issues that affect crude and all that, the future is basically inherent in gas production. And how can that happen?\n\n\u201cYou will also agree with me that a lot of Nigerian companies have been given license to do a whole lot of local refineries just to support what the national companies are also doing. Why, because renewable energy is the future of the world globally. Everybody needs gas! Gas is life now! For us to even have light here, we need gas.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to pull our forces together to make sure that there is a high-level of improved production of hydrocarbons in Nigeria through our collaboration working with the right stakeholders and make sure that we deliver what we can do.\n\n\u201cWe have the resources, we have the technology, and we have the capability in Nigeria. What is lacking is that collaboration. If everybody, all IOCs, all technical persons came together to say \u2018hey, let us give it a try, let us take it over,\u2019 in the next 10 years, there will be less of crude and there is going to be more of gas because everywhere the talk is about renewable.\n\n\u201cJust last week, Total Exploration Nigeria changed to Total Energies. Now, Total is already thinking of a 10-20 years plan into renewable energy. What do you need to drive renewable energy? You need gas; you need hydrocarbons to drive it.

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nA member of the House of Representatives, Tanko Sununu, has described the attack on the Federal Government College, Birnin-Yauri in Kebbi State, as a promise fulfilled by bandits.\n\nThe lawmaker who represents Ngaski/ Shanga/ Yauri Federal Constituency noted that Thursday\u2019s incident was the latest in the chains of attacks on communities in the area.\n\nWhile featuring as a guest on Sunrise Daily on Friday, he narrated what transpired in the build-up to the attack that left a yet-to-be-ascertained number of students of the school missing.\n\n\u201cWhat really happened is that about two weeks ago, we had an episode when bandits residing within parts of the areas bordering Zamfara, Niger, and Kebbi came up through one of the villages in my constituency.\n\n\u201cThey killed a policeman and found their way until they reached Ibeto area where we have a quarry, killed some security men and kidnapped some of the foreign workers in the quarry and left,\u201d the lawmaker said during the Channels Television breakfast show.\n\nHe added, \u201c10 days later, they came back to the same area and entered into my constituency bordering some villages, and they had more than a seven-hour field operation going from house to house, room to room, collecting money, phones, cows, and any machine they deemed useful for their operations, and they left a message behind that they would soon be back.\n\n\u201cTo fulfill their promise yesterday, we had intelligence that they were on their way coming. Around 10:30 in the morning, they reached their final destination \u2013 the Federal Government College, Birnin-Yauri.\u201d\n\nA Major Success\n\nSununu noted that as soon as the bandits got to the school, they were faced with a tough task as they were initially resisted and engaged in a gunfight by operatives of the Mobile Police and Police Counter-Terrorism Unit stationed at the school.\n\nHe disclosed that the fire exchange lasted for a long period before the bandits overpowered the security operatives due to their large number.\n\nThe bandits, the lawmaker stated, succeeded in killing a policeman and gained access into the school and abducted an unspecified number of students and five teachers.\n\nHe explained that it was difficult to ascertain the exact number of students abducted as parents from nearby villages and towns raced to the school to take their children away immediately after the incident.\n\nSununu, however, gave an assurance that the military has swung into action, noting that progress has been made.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs at last night, I had a discussion with the Field Commander of Operation Hadarin Daji who said that they have succeeded in entering into the den of the kidnappers and I think this is a major success because the security agencies are now taking the fight to the base of the kidnappers.\n\n\u201cI was also told that over 800 cattle that were rustled some days back have been recovered and as of now, the military has combed the area where we are expecting that the students are with the bandits. They have also succeeded in creating many casualties on the part of the bandits.\u201d",
