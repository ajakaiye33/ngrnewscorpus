          "title": "Nigeria Startup Bill: Senators assure quick passage as youths protest at NASS",
          "text": "No NSB no votes\u2014group\n\nA coalition of youth groups, yesterday, held a rally at the National Assembly, NASS, to demand the speedy passage of the Nigeria Startup Bill,NSB.\n\nThe group said the bill, which has scaled second reading at the House of Representatives, has the potential of transforming the economy by creating meaningful job opportunities for young people and decent tax revenue for government.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the group, Ms Tracy Okoro, said: \u201cIf there is one thing young people in Nigeria demand of their government, it is an enabling environment that would encourage the growth of enterprise, innovation and ideas. Government now has a huge opportunity with the Nigeria startup bill to give Nigerian youths something they can use to create a pathway for themselves.\u201d\n\nOkoro noted that the bill before NASS can create thousands of high-paying jobs if passed into law.\n\nAnother participant, Mr Dayo Akorede, a digital rights activist and IT expert, said the best thing government can do after close to eight years of an economy that hasn\u2019t really worked for young people is to see that Nigeria Startup Bill is passed.\n\nHe said:\u201cA lot of young people believe this current administration, with the executive and the legislative arm, has done much for young people in the country. But I can assure you that if this bill gets passed, everyone would forget the previous years and celebrate it massively because of the potential of the bill to transform Nigeria\u2019s digital economy. So, the National Assembly has a chance to write its name in gold by passing this bill.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, a youth advocate and the leader of Youth Action For a Better Nigeria, Ayobami Smith, said young people would not vote for any member of the NASS who fails to support the NSB.\n\nSmith said:\u201cNigerian youths have also learnt to be selfish and to pursue policies that are in our own interest. To that extent, we will not re-elect any politician who fails to support the bill because such a politician is going against our interest as a group.\u201d\n\nWhile the rally continued outside the National Assembly, a delegation representing the youths met with members of NAS leadership.\n\nThe group met with Senator Yakubu Oseni, Chairman Senate Committee on ICT and Cybercrime, to lobby him to rally his colleagues to see to the speedy passage of the bill.\n\nAddressing the lawmakers, Mr. Jude Feranmi , spoke on the potentialities of the NSB and the impact it would have on the Nigerian economy.\n\nHe also urged the legislators to leave a legacy by passing what he described as the most consequential bill for young people in Nigeria.\n\nSenator Oseni welcomed the delegation and assured them that his committee had looked at the bill, saying there was no reason the bill wouldn\u2019t get passed. Continuing, he hailed the bill, describing it as what Nigeria needs.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI believe this bill will make Nigeria a destination for foreign investments and would strengthen our digital economy. That way, we can discourage young people from pursuing crime as this bill will create means where they can earn a decent living for themselves.\u201d\n\nSenator Oseni and other members present then assured the delegation that they would do their best to ensure the bill is passed in record time.\n\nHe further urged those pushing for the bill to allow it go through all the processes to avoid unnecessary amendments during implementation.\n\nContinuing, Sen Oseni said a hybrid public hearing on the bill where people can contribute to the discussion will be considered.\n\nSince the bill arrived at the National Assembly, several members have lent their support towards its passage. Some of these members include Senator Ajayi Borrofice who said: \u201cThis is the right time for us to encourage startups and put the right environment for startups to exist and grow. This is one way to unlock the potential of our youths to make their own contribution to national development.\u201d\n\nSenator Sabi Abdulahi who also hailed the bill said:\u201cI expect that when this bill becomes law, it will guarantee the reduction of cyber crime.\u201d\n\nSenator Smart Adeyemi said: \u201cThe bill will encourage our younger generation to embrace great ideas and innovations to breakthrough.\u201d\n\nOthers include, Hon Ibrahim Obanikoro, Hon Chuma Nzeribe, Hon Ben Igbakapa, Hon Simon Karu and others.",

          "text": "27 ships with petrol, others to berth in Apapa, Delta ports\n\nBy Godfrey Bivbere\n\nStakeholders in the Nigeria\u2019s ports industry have said that the campaign by the Standard Organisation of Nigeria, SON, to return to the ports is questionable.\n\nThey explained that the claims by SON that its presence at the port will help reduce the flooding of the nation\u2019s markets with sub-standard goods, is not only false but unfounded since its officials are still operating at the seaports despite the Federal Government\u2019s directive to the contrary.\n\nThe stakeholders spoke at a Harboursandport WhatsApp group (Maritime industry experts discussion platform), noted that without SON\u2019s release authorisation signed and endorsed by the Customs Area Command, CAC, importers\u2019 release and clearance of such SON related imports is dead on arrival.\n\nIn his contribution, a maritime lawyer and an Assistant General Manager at the Nigerian Ports Authority, NPA,Ahmed Wanka, said SON\u2019s desire to return to the ports is driven by its personnel\u2019s intention to operate without Customs involvement.\n\nIn his words, \u201cFor those of us who work in the ports, we have consistently seen these spasms.\n\nThere are people in some organisations who believe they cannot survive without partaking in the ports\u2019 activities.\n\n\u201cTherefore, whenever there is a change in policy or where the new management is being hailed for doing well, this issue keeps coming back. We have seen it with National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA and it is now SON.\n\n\u201cWhat is SON going to do new in the port, what has it been doing? The only thing it does is to list container numbers and give the Port Manager that those containers would be inspected because they have intelligence reports about the quality of the goods inside.\n\n\u201cTrust Nigerians, within 24 hours or a maximum of 48 hours, they will send another letter clearing them. Let us be honest, have the goods been standardised while inside the containers, has the defect in them been made good?\n\n\u201cYes, people import substandard goods but their arrival in the port is only a part of the importation process. If SON is serious, it knows where all goods are imported from and can easily get the source and nature of such goods without necessarily coming into the ports.\u201d\n\nChinedu Ogbonna, former Public Relations Officer of Tin-can Island Command of the Nigeria Customs Service, NCS, said that \u201cPresently the SON is involved in all examinations in the ports and they always, as a rule, write a report of such examination; without such examination reports, they will impound your container loaded on trucks at Area B (outward Ijora), or at Mile 2 (outward Tin-can port) and such other checkpoints where they are positioned all over the Ports and Terminals.\n\n\u201cMoreover, SON has access to all shipping manifests and usually blocks all SON-related imports through the Nigerian Customs Service. Without SON release authorisation, signed and endorsed by the Customs Area Command, CAC, your release and clearance of such SON-related imports is dead on arrival.\n\n\u201cIt is erroneous, false and misinformation to say that SON is not operating or functional at the Nigerian Ports.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Managing Director of Kammany Marine Services Limited, Charles Okorefe, said SON has never left the ports despite the federal government\u2019s directive that they should exit the ports.\n\nOkorefe explained that \u201cSON has never left the ports at any time; they are ubiquitous for cargo examination at the ports. So must they clog the terminals with offices and signposts before we know they are there?\n\n\u201cIn any case, the ports remain Customs ports and it is the prerogative of the Customs to invite SON or other agencies of government to witness cargo examination only when the need arises.\u201d\n\nFormer National President of the National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders, NAGAFF, Eugene Nweke, said \u201cCome to think of it, who says the SON is not in the ports (terminal) as we speak.\n\n\u201cAcross all the terminals, the SON designated staff are available and monitors the cargo physical examination. And they interface with the freight forwarders every day,\u201d he noted.",

The bank joined others from 36 countries in Africa at the prestigious Global Finance as winners in the 29th Annual Best Bank Awards.\n\nThe editors of Global Finance made the selections after consultations with corporate financial executives, bankers and banking consultants, and analysts worldwide. They considered factors that ranged from the quantitative objective to the informed subjective in selecting the top banks.\n\nThe objective criteria included growth in assets, profitability, geographic reach, strategic relationships, new business development and innovation in products. Subjective criteria included the opinions of equity analysts, credit rating analysts, banking consultants and others involved in the industry.\n\nThe bank\u2019s Group Managing Director/Chief Executive, Ebenezer Onyeagwu said: \u201cThis award is a testament to our tenacity despite a very challenging macroeconomic environment. Indeed, being recognised, for the third consecutive year, is an acknowledgement of the resilience of the Zenith brand as the leading financial institution in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe lauded the contributions of the bank\u2019s founder and Chairman, Jim Ovia, for his pioneering role in building the structures and laying the foundation for an enduring and successful institution, the Board for the outstanding leadership they provide, the staff for their commitment and dedication as well as the Bank\u2019s customers for their unwavering loyalty and support.\n\nGlobal Finance\u2019s \u201cBest Banks Awards\u201d are recognised amongst the world\u2019s most influential banking/finance and corporate professionals as the most coveted and credible awards in the banking industry, with winners chosen in 150 countries and territories across Africa, AsiaPacific, the Caribbean, Central America, Central & Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, North America and Western Europe.\n\nFounded in 1987, Global Finance regularly selects the top performers among banks and other financial services providers, and the awards have become a trusted standard of excellence for the global financial community. Joseph D.

          "text": "SIR: Ahead of 1979 presidential polls, the late sage, Awo 70 years, was an indefatigable never-say-die presidential aspirant, honest, transparent and well prepared based on indubitable track records of public service as former premier, federal minister of finance among others in the quest for nation building.\n\nAwo was the most qualified for the Herculean job of presidency. Indeed, all constellations, prognoses coupled with human factors seemed favourably disposed to Awo\u2019s election being a formidable and redoubtable political stalwart made up of sterner stuff at ripe age of 70 years.\n\nThis was in contrast to the abysmal moral failing and poor outing of some youths who blundered into politics and thereafter, hastily ran the country and the economy under.\n\nWithout being immodest, the National Leader of All Progressives Congress (APC) who now dons the garb of the septuagenarians can aptly be described as a political tactician and strategist imbued with high intelligent quotient, adept party organizer and a shrewd mobiliser of men and resources to maximize profit in the political arena.\n\nAsiwaju Bola Tinubu was destined through selfless and fearless political exploits in the defunct Action Congress to alter political scenario and mocking narratives in the country. Regardless of the asses that bray in the camp of malevolent political foes, he has through the grace of God attained 70 years with unique outstanding contribution to humanity especially in the socio-economic and political landscape.\n\nIt is pertinent to highlight some of his humble and sacrificial yeoman services to good governance and nation building. The political colossus started as an intrepid young political activist on leave of absence as a professional accountant/treasurer in the Mobil Nigeria, a multinational corporation. He was elected as Federal Republic Senator under the platform of a progressive party, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) 1991-1993. Later in the dark days of General Sani Abacha, Tinubu was in the forefront of revalidating the annulled June 12 Presidential polls won fair and square by the late business mogul MKO Abiola which forced him into self-exile. On his return, he was elected Lagos State governor under the aegis of defunct Alliance for Democracy / Afenifere (1999-2007).\n\nIn all, Tinubu deployed resources and personal liberty for the growth of justice, equity and liberal democracy in the country.\n\nNow to the crucial issue of the moment. Charity must begin at home. According to the late sage, Awo, was of the well-considered opinion that one must be able to distinguish himself in diligent service in the home front before proceeding forth to contribute or render such services outside the home front.\n\nBola Ahmed Tinubu as former Lagos governor has paid his dues as a tested and pragmatic political leader-servant in Yoruba nation par excellence.\n\nIt is worthy of note that he has not reneged or deviated for a fleeting second from the intricate, thorny and chosen path of progressivism and welfarist ideology which he imbibes courageously. With every sense of responsibility Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu can become the next president if his party, APC fields his well-deserved candidature. He deserves our full support and prayers in every nook and cranny of the country.",

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe NWC of the party recently released new guidelines mandating all political appointees who aspire to participate in its primaries at all levels to resign at least 30 days before the conduct of the primaries.\n\nIt was learnt that the new guidelines may have scuttled the ambitions of aspirants for different elective positions who did not resign from their appointments as of Tuesday, April 25.\n\nGovernorship, Senate, Federal and State Assembly primary elections to select APC candidates for the general elections, according to the party\u2019s timetable, would hold between May 18 and 23.\n\nExpectedly, appointees for such positions who did not resign would have lost whatever was left of their chances to contest in the primaries.\n\nBased on the guidelines, key appointees of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s, namely, Transport Minister, Rotimi Amaechi and his labour and education counterparts, Chris Ngige and Nwajuiba, who are gunning for the 2023 presidency have barely 24 hours to resign or forget their ambitions.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nThe APC primary for presidency, according to the ruling party\u2019s timetable, has been scheduled to hold between May 30 and June 1.\n\nSection 3(i) of the APC\u2019s final guidelines for the conduct of primaries, as of Tuesday states that \u201cno political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for the purpose of the nomination of candidates. Any political office holder interested in contesting for an elective office shall leave office 30 days prior to the date of election or party primary for the office sought.\u201d\n\nA credible source and member of the NWC told Daily Sun that recalcitrant aspirants who have refused to resign will be disqualified by the screening committee. The source said the NWC had waited, but without success, on President Buhari, to issue a directive that all his appointees contesting for various positions should resign in line with the provisions of the new Electoral Act.\n\nHe said their disqualification may pave an easy way for the leadership of the party and other critical stakeholders to settle for a consensus candidate that will square up with the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nA Federal High Court in Umuahia had nullified Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, recently passed the National Assembly. But an appeal filed by the National Assembly, the Court of Appeal directed all parties involved to maintain status quo, until a judgment was given. Despite the directive by the Appeal Court, Buhari\u2019s appointees, led by the Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, are unwilling to resign.\n\nNgige, while daring the NWC of APC, said his decision was in line with the 1999 constitution.\n\nHe said the March 18 judgment of the Federal High Court in Umuahia struck out section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, hence he was under no compulsion to resign his appointment.\n\nBut Nwajiuba, said yesterday, that he would not resign his position to contest 2023 presidential elections until 30 days to the election. He stated this in Abuja at an event to present to him the nomination and expression of interest forms of the APC for the 2023 presidential elections.\n\nHe stated that the Section 82 of the Electoral Act is not binding on him, rather he is following the guidelines as stipulated by the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria.\n\nNwajiuba made reference to Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, who, he said, resigned his position as minister of solid minerals four years ago after he had won the ticket of APC at the primary elections before he informed the president and members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) that he was leaving for Ekiti State.\n\nBut Asked when he will resign in line with his party directives, Ngige said: \u201cBecause I don\u2019t know about that I\u2019m hearing for the first time from you. But like I always say, I\u2019ll be guided by the letters and spirit of the Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYou are pushing me into something that is not necessary to discuss, because that aspect of the law enacted by the National Assembly, via the Electoral Act, that section 84(12) has been struck down by a court of law and the cases are on appeal. And for now, no matter how bad the judgement is, that\u2019s the maximum jurisprudence, no matter how bad the law is, it is a judgement of court, it should be obeyed, until upturned or stayed.\n\n\u201cBut there is no stay, there\u2019s no atonement of that particular pronouncement, and the party is on appeal. So the judgement is still subsisting, that aspect of the law was injurious to some persons and should not have been there.\n\n\u201cI also know that the Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria in certain sections, section 107, 137 and 88, prescribes disqualification clauses for people who are going for election and that prescription is supreme, because it\u2019s in the constitution and the constitution is grand-norm of all laws.\u201d\n\nWhen reminded that the same party is aware that the judgment of the court has not been vacated, and is also asking members aspiring for office to quit office, Ngige said: \u201cI have not seen that pronouncement from the party. I have not seen any release from the party. It has not been conveyed to me or to anybody. I\u2019m an aspirant, I\u2019m a presidential aspirant. So I\u2019ll find out and if it is true, I would then know what to do.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Says oath sworn only to Nigeria\n\n\u2022Boasts he\u2019ll hit the ground running\n\n\u2022He\u2019s eminently qualified to be president, declares Abiodun \u2022May you come back to my palace as president, Alake prays\n\nAfter all I have learnt, if called upon to serve the nation, should I say No? I have decided that I will run for the office. I have sworn an oath to the Federal Republic of Nigeria. It is an oath to our people; our children and the future of Nigeria. I owe nobody else any allegiance outside the oath\n\nJames Sowole in Abeokuta and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\n\n\nThe vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday, took his nationwide consultation tour, in promotion of his presidential ambition, to his home state of Ogun, with a declaration that he swore the oath of allegiance only to Nigeria, and not to any single citizen of the country. Osinbajo was addressing swirling allegations that his decision to run for president was a betrayal of his former principal and erstwhile political godfather, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, who had also declared his presidential aspiration ahead of 2023.\n\nThe vice president, who addressed an ecstatic crowd of supporters, said he was not in the state to campaign yet, but to inform his people of his intention to be president. He added that he was one candidate, who would hit the ground running.\n\nOgun State Governor Dapo Abiodun declared support for Osinbajo, saying the vice president is eminently qualified to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari, after seven years of working with him as his deputy.\n\nThe Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo, while praying for the vice president at his palace, also attested to the fact that Osinbajo was competent to run. He told Osinbajo, \u201cI want to pray that you will come back to this palace as a president and Nigeria will gain tremendously under your watch.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said he owed no one, aside Nigeria, any allegiance, an apparent reference to Tinubu. The statement draws the line at accusations of disloyalty and betrayal being sold by supporters of the former Lagos State governor.\n\nIn his speech, Osinbajo said he had consulted widely across different sections of the society and leaders, including Buhari, before throwing his hat into the ring.\n\nHe said, \u201cAfter all I have learnt, if called upon to serve the nation, should I say No? I have decided that I will run for the office. I have sworn an oath to the Federal Republic of Nigeria. It is an oath to our people; our children and the future of Nigeria. I owe nobody else any allegiance outside the oath.\u201d\n\nRecounting his contributions to the administration, Osinbajo said he was actively involved in the judiciary reforms and repositioning of the judicial sector for optimal operation. He noted that working with Buhari had exposed him to governance at the highest level and placed him in a position to tackle serious issues concerning the economy and security, among others.\n\nOsinbao stated, \u201cThe vice president position is an opportunity to serve and I have served with utmost loyalty. I put everything into my work. I am a candidate, who will hit the ground running when I am elected.\n\n\u201cI have the requisite knowledge to do the job and build on what others have put in place. My presidency will bring peace, unity and development to the country.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo commended the Abiodun administration for giant strides it had recorded in the last three years and expressed the hope that his quest to lead the country would be fruitful.\n\nAbiodun said Osinbajo had acquitted himself well, declaring that Ogun would support Osinbajo\u2019s presidential ambition to enable him continue with the laudable projects of the Buhari administration. He said the vice president also stood by him during his governorship battle in 2019. The governor spoke at different stakeholders\u2019 meetings with Osinbajo, held at the Akarigbo Palace, Sagamu, the Alake Palace in Abeokuta, the palace of the Olu of Ilaro, paramount ruler of Yewaland, and the Presidential Lodge, Ibara, Abeokuta.\n\nAbiodun said Osinbajo had in the last seven years contributed to the successes recorded by the federal government, noting, \u201cHe is eminently qualified to lead the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cThe vice president present here is home coming. We are pleased with his decision to run for the office of the president. He is competent and committed to lead the country in a higher capacity.\n\n\u201cYour steadfastness, integrity and character are all well-known. You are serving this country and the president meritoriously for the last seven years as the vice president. We have no doubt that you will do well as the president and we will support you.\u201d\n\nWhile extolling Osinbajo\u2019s academic achievements, the governor recalled how he stood behind his governorship election success and described him as a man interested in fairness, justice, equity, and the rule of law.\n\nThe paramount ruler of Remoland, Oba Babatunde Ajayi, in his remarks, said the vice president was competent with requisite qualifications to lead the country. He observed that his performance was there for all to see.\n\nThe Alake of Egbaland, who attested to Osinbajo\u2019s competence, said, \u201cThe vice president has paid his dues and is eminently qualified to succeed as president.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The fourth image depicted another group of 16 men in a sitting position.\n\nRecall that the terrorists had released a video about a week after the attack, showing the moment they were about to release the Managing Director of Bank of Agriculture, Alwan Ali-Hassan to his family.\n\nTHISDAY further gathered that the families of the kidnapped victims have also written the National Security Adviser (NSA), Maj.-Gen. Mohammed Munguno (rtd), demanding a status report on the state of their loved ones.\n\nIn the letter dated 25 April and jointly signed by Aliyu Mahmood, Idayat Yusuf, Aminu Othman and Dr. Baaba Muhammed on behalf of the victims\u2019 families, they lamented that they had been left in the dark by the authorities.\n\n\u201cWe, the families of victims of the Nigerian Railway Corporation train attack Ak9 departing from Abuja on 28th of March 2022 to Rigasa Kaduna have come together on behalf of the victims that are in captivity.\n\n\u201cWe write to express our concern that there is no representation from government to communicate with us on the status of our loved ones . Even though we know the information may be of confidential nature, but nonetheless, families need to be reassured and be carried along in a safe manner to ensure their release from captivity safely.\n\n\u201cWe humbly request for your facilitation to ensure that the federal government is in touch with the victims families. Thanking you in anticipation,\u201d the letter read.\n\nHowever, the pregnant women among the kidnapped train passengers was quoted by a family source, according to Arise, as having given birth at the weekend.\n\nThe woman who was reportedly eight months pregnant at the time of the attack, gave birth safely after the terrorists were said to have invited the medical personnel to attend to her. The state of health of the baby is however unknown.\n\n\u201cAccording to reports by family sources, she gave birth with the aid of doctors brought in by the terrorists. We can also report that the terrorists are demanding the release of their top commanders in exchange for the abducted train passengers.\n\n\u201cAccording to sources, the terrorists are Kanuri speaking, suggesting that were from the North-east region and backed by the deadly Islamic state group- ISWAP,\u201d the Arise report noted.\n\nBut the report stated that the government was apprehensive that the detainees who have strong ties with Boko Haram, if released, could cause a bigger security threat to the nation.\n\nThe families of the kidnapped victims are expected to hold a press conference today in Abuja and Kaduna to further mount pressure on the government to rescue their loved ones in captivity.\n\nA security expert, Abubakar Ahmed, was quoted as saying that the subliminal message inherent in the release of the pictures, explained that, \u201cThey want to tell the world that the abducted passengers are alive and in good condition.\u201d\n\nA family source added: \u201cWhat kind of country are we living in? There doesn\u2019t seem to be anything in the news. Is the government even doing anything about it or terrorism is now part of our norms and culture?\n\n\u201cSonny Okosun\u2019s which way Nigeria was 1984. Almost 40 years later, we are still asking the same question.\u201d\n\nAnother family member of one of the victims, claimed that they had been disturbed since the photos emerged, stressing that: \u201cWe have been praying for him and others day and night.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY further learnt that some of the elderly victims had complained about their deteriorating health conditions.\n\nThe Kaduna State government had recently approved the disbursement of N18 million to families of nine persons killed in the attack, saying it wasn\u2019t compensation but some kind of support.\n\nThe Executive Secretary of the Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency (KADSEMA), Mr. Muhammed Mukaddas, had explained that the governor had equally approved the disbursement of N250, 000 each to 22 persons severely wounded during the train attack.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Over 40 million Nigerians on microblogging platform\n\nWorld\u2019s richest man, billionaire Elon Musk has reached an agreement to acquire Twitter for approximately $44 billion, the company said.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press (AP), Musk, the outspoken Tesla CEO, the world\u2019s wealthiest person, had said he wants to buy Twitter because he thinks it\u2019s not living up to its potential as a platform for \u201cfree speech.\u201d\n\nHe said it needs to be transformed as a private company in order to build trust with users and do better at serving what he calls the \u201csocietal imperative\u201d of free speech.\n\nTwitter said it would become a privately held company after the sale is closed.\n\n\u201cTwitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world,\u201d its CEO Parag Agrawal said in a tweet. \u201cDeeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important.\u201d\n\nMusk describes himself as a \u201cfree-speech absolutist,\u201d although he hasn\u2019t been exactly clear what he means by that. In a recent TED interview, the billionaire said he\u2019d like to see Twitter err on the side of allowing speech instead of moderating it. He said he\u2019d be \u201cvery reluctant\u201d to delete tweets and would generally be cautious about permanent bans. He also acknowledged that Twitter would have to abide by national laws governing speech in markets around the world.\n\nThe shares of Twitter, which has over 40 million Nigerians on its platform, were up 4.5 per cent in pre-market trading in New York at $51.15.\n\nMusk, a prolific Twitter user, has said it needs to be taken private to grow and become a genuine platform for free speech.\n\nThe 50-year-old entrepreneur, who is also CEO of rocket developer SpaceX, has said he wants to combat trolls on Twitter and proposed changes to the Twitter Blue premium subscription service, including slashing its price and banning advertising.\n\nThe billionaire, a vocal advocate of cryptocurrencies, has also suggested adding dogecoin as a payment option on Twitter.\n\nHe had said Twitter\u2019s current leadership team was incapable of getting the company\u2019s stock to his offer price on its own, but stopped short of saying it needs to be replaced.\n\n\u201cThe company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form,\u201d Musk said in his offer letter last week.\n\nUp to the point Musk disclosed a stake in Twitter in April, the company\u2019s shares had fallen about 10 per cent since Parag Agrawal took over as CEO from founder Jack Dorsey in late November.\n\nThe deal came just four days after Musk unveiled a financing package to back the acquisition. This led Twitter\u2019s board to take his offer more seriously and many shareholders to ask the company not to let the opportunity for a deal slip away, Reuters reported on Sunday. Before Musk revealed the financing package, Twitter\u2019s board was expected to reject the bid, sources had said.\n\nThe sale represented an admission by Twitter that Agrawal was not making enough traction in making the company more profitable, despite being on track to meet ambitious financial goals the company set for 2023. Twitter\u2019s shares were trading higher than Musk\u2019s offer price as recently as November.\n\nMusk unveiled his intention to buy Twitter on April 14, and take it private via a financing package comprised of equity and debt.\n\nWall Street\u2019s biggest lenders, except those advising Twitter, have all committed to provide debt financing.\n\nMusk\u2019s negotiating tactics \u2013 making one offer and sticking with it \u2013 resembles how another billionaire, Warren Buffett, negotiates acquisitions. Musk did not provide any financing details when he first disclosed his offer for Twitter, making the market skeptical about its prospects.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has said his arrest in the United States over credit card fraud and forgery in 1986 is not sufficient grounds for his disqualification by the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nAbiodun disclosed this while responding to a petition submitted by an APC member, Ayodele Oludiran on behalf of Oluwatobi Sofela of Ogun Bibire Unity Forum to the National Chairman of the party, Abdulahi Adamu.\n\nGovernor Dapo Abiodun\n\nSofela had warned that the party might lose the governorship seat in Ogun due to Abiodun\u2019s criminal history and its concealment from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) despite swearing an oath.\n\nHe also cautioned that the discrepancies in the governor\u2019s educational qualifications might also cause opposition parties to question his eligibility for re-election bid, swaying the electorate to their side.\n\n\u201cIf action is not taken, the chances of our great party, the APC, retaining the governorship seat in Ogun State shall be in jeopardy as previously seen in Bayelsa and Zamfara states,\u201d Sofela said.\n\nAccording to People\u2019s Gazette, responding, Abiodun said that his probable arrest was not a conviction and hence was not answerable to the laws that applied to criminals.\n\nHe added that even if he was convicted in 1986, the Nigerian constitution only disqualifies ex-felons from contesting political offices if their sentence was less than 10 years before the election date.\n\n\u201cAn aspirant or candidate will only be disqualified by the court if the false information he gives relates to a constitutional requirement of eligibility. APC is not a court of law. Accordingly, it cannot disqualify our client,\u201d the governor\u2019s lawyer, Afe Babalola wrote in a letter to Adamu, citing section 29(6) of the Electoral Act 2022. See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Ogun Governor, Dapo Abiodun Was Jailed For Credit Card Fraud In Florida, USA\n\n\u201cIn any event, assuming but not conceding that our client was even convicted in 1986, he would still not be affected or caught by Section 182 (1) (e) of the CFRN because the CFRN requires that the conviction which would disqualify a person from the position of the governor must have occurred ten years before the date of election to the office.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had in March published the criminal record of how Abiodun was jailed in 1986 for credit card fraud in Miami Dade Florida, USA.\n\nThe governor was said to have used a pseudo name (Shawn Michael Davids) with the aim of concealing his criminal identity.\n\nThe record revealed that Abiodun was jailed for committing criminal offences which bordered on credit card fraud, petty theft and check forgery.\n\nHe was arrested on November 7, 1986, for fighting and injuring a police officer in an attempt to resist arrest.\n\nWhile being processed at the station, his fingerprint was run through the crime database and it was discovered that the Adedapo Oluseun Abiodun being processed for detention was the same as Shawn Michael Davids.\n\nHis criminal record and history were thus cemented and he was jailed.\n\nAccording to some documents obtained by SaharaReporters, Abiodun's jail number was 8600B9436.\n\nIn 2015, while contesting for the Ogun East Senatorial seat against the late Buruji Kasamu of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), he applied for the redaction of his criminal records in Miami Dade, Florida.\n\nThis act of concealment meant he could lie on his Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) forms that he had no prior criminal records; a perjury offence that could have disqualified him from ever holding an appointive or elective office in Nigeria.\n\nThe redaction was granted in August 2015.",

          "text": "Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has said his arrest in the United States over credit card fraud and forgery in 1986 is not sufficient grounds for his disqualification by the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nAbiodun disclosed this while responding to a petition submitted by an APC member, Ayodele Oludiran on behalf of Oluwatobi Sofela of Ogun Bibire Unity Forum to the National Chairman of the party, Abdulahi Adamu.\n\nGovernor Dapo Abiodun\n\nSofela had warned that the party might lose the governorship seat in Ogun due to Abiodun\u2019s criminal history and its concealment from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) despite swearing an oath.\n\nHe also cautioned that the discrepancies in the governor\u2019s educational qualifications might also cause opposition parties to question his eligibility for re-election bid, swaying the electorate to their side.\n\n\u201cIf action is not taken, the chances of our great party, the APC, retaining the governorship seat in Ogun State shall be in jeopardy as previously seen in Bayelsa and Zamfara states,\u201d Sofela said.\n\nAccording to People\u2019s Gazette, responding, Abiodun said that his probable arrest was not a conviction and hence was not answerable to the laws that applied to criminals.\n\nHe added that even if he was convicted in 1986, the Nigerian constitution only disqualifies ex-felons from contesting political offices if their sentence was less than 10 years before the election date.\n\n\u201cAn aspirant or candidate will only be disqualified by the court if the false information he gives relates to a constitutional requirement of eligibility. APC is not a court of law. Accordingly, it cannot disqualify our client,\u201d the governor\u2019s lawyer, Afe Babalola wrote in a letter to Adamu, citing section 29(6) of the Electoral Act 2022. See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Ogun Governor, Dapo Abiodun Was Jailed For Credit Card Fraud In Florida, USA\n\n\u201cIn any event, assuming but not conceding that our client was even convicted in 1986, he would still not be affected or caught by Section 182 (1) (e) of the CFRN because the CFRN requires that the conviction which would disqualify a person from the position of the governor must have occurred ten years before the date of election to the office.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had in March published the criminal record of how Abiodun was jailed in 1986 for credit card fraud in Miami Dade Florida, USA.\n\nThe governor was said to have used a pseudo name (Shawn Michael Davids) with the aim of concealing his criminal identity.\n\nThe record revealed that Abiodun was jailed for committing criminal offences which bordered on credit card fraud, petty theft and check forgery.\n\nHe was arrested on November 7, 1986, for fighting and injuring a police officer in an attempt to resist arrest.\n\nWhile being processed at the station, his fingerprint was run through the crime database and it was discovered that the Adedapo Oluseun Abiodun being processed for detention was the same as Shawn Michael Davids.\n\nHis criminal record and history were thus cemented and he was jailed.\n\nAccording to some documents obtained by SaharaReporters, Abiodun's jail number was 8600B9436.\n\nIn 2015, while contesting for the Ogun East Senatorial seat against the late Buruji Kasamu of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), he applied for the redaction of his criminal records in Miami Dade, Florida.\n\nThis act of concealment meant he could lie on his Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) forms that he had no prior criminal records; a perjury offence that could have disqualified him from ever holding an appointive or elective office in Nigeria.\n\nThe redaction was granted in August 2015.",

          "text": "Dapo Abiodun, governor of Ogun, has written to the All Progressives Congress (APC), asking the party to disregard a petition seeking to disqualify him from seeking a second term in office.\n\nA petition by one Ayodele Oludiran, an APC member, was said to have been submitted to the party, seeking Abiodun\u2019s disqualification over an alleged fraud conviction involving latter, as well as \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in forms submitted for the 2019 governorship election.\n\nResponding in a letter to APC by his counsel, Afe Babalola & Co., Abiodun described the allegations as \u201cbaseless\u201d and urged the national leadership of the party to ignore the claims.\n\nAccording to a statement issued on Wednesday by Kunle Somorin, spokesman to Abiodun, the law firm representing the Ogun governor, in the letter dated April 19, 2022, described the petition dated April 12, as full of \u201cspurious and unfounded allegations\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe letter, addressed to Abdullahi Adamu, APC national chairman, described the petition as \u201ca deliberate move to deprive him of the opportunity to set the records straight and knowing full well that the petition was characterised by falsehood and malice\u201d.\n\n\u201cAccording to Afe Babalola & Co, the allegation of discrepancies in Governor Abiodun\u2019s INEC Form CF001 for 2015 and 2019 is statute-barred, arguing that the allegation can only form the basis of a cause of action in court 14 days from the day the governor filed and deposed to the forms,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cIt further stated that the alleged contradiction in the two INEC gorms can no longer be a ground to disqualify Governor Abiodun in the upcoming 2023 gubernatorial election. Forms CF001 for 2015 and 2019 are spent and cannot be used to determine the eligibility of the governor to contest in the next governorship election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe law firm recalled that court cases were filed in court and petitions filed at the Governorship Election Tribunal seeking to disqualify the governor based on allegations of falsehood and inconsistency in the two INEC forms, saying that both the Tribunal and courts were unanimous in their decisions not only that the allegations were statute-barred, but held that the said Forms CF001 of 2015 and 2019 did not contain any false statement.\n\n\u201cIt further said the matter that the Supreme Court of Nigeria had also affirmed the decisions of the Tribunal and the Appeal Court, by dismissing the petition of false statement against the governor.\n\n\u201cOn the allegation that the governor had been convicted for an offence in 1986, the chamber said the petitioner failed to attach any court judgment to the petition to this effect, hence, the allegation was baseless, asking the APC top echelon to discountenance as such.\u201d\n\nThe law firm also denied the allegation that the governor has a former name, adding that \u201che never bore the name \u2018Shawn Michael Davis\u2019 or any other name however described\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, it is not in doubt that all the allegations in the petition relate to our client\u2019s Forms CF001 for 2015 and 2019 are baseless and unfounded,\u201d the letter reads.\n\n\u201cAs shown above, the High Court of the FCT, Governorship Election Tribunal, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court have all held that the said allegations are unfounded and statute-barred, so that there would be no basis for disqualifying our client.\n\n\u201cOur client has been adjudged by the Tribunal and courts to be eminently qualified to contest the 2019 Ogun State gubernatorial election, which he won landslide.\n\n\u201cSince, as of today, the courts have held that our client is qualified under CFRN, the party cannot impose additional grounds for disqualification on him. Also, the APC Constitution and Guidelines for the conduct of primary elections cannot override the CFRN. Therefore, the party has no vires to prevent our client from contesting any election under its banner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs rightly admitted by the petitioner, only a court of law can disqualify our client. The party cannot disqualify him or prevent him from contesting in the party\u2019s primary election.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, our client is ready and willing to, at the screening stage for the party\u2019s primary election, present his credentials and relevant documents (including his primary school certificate, which has been alleged to be non-existent) to establish his eligibility to contest in the upcoming 2023 governorship election in Ogun State.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTherefore, we urge the party not to be distracted or misled by unfounded allegations aimed at preventing the party from presenting our client, who is the best candidate for the 2023 gubernatorial election, as the party\u2019s flagbearer. We also urge the party not to give credence to any rumour which may scuttle the party\u2019s chances in the said election.\n\n\u201cFinally, we pray that the petition should be disregarded as it is fraught with falsehood, speculation, inaccuracies.\u201d",

Forms CF001 for 2015 and 2019 are spent and cannot be used to determine the eligibility of the governor to contest in the next governorship election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe law firm recalled that court cases were filed in court and petitions filed at the Governorship Election Tribunal seeking to disqualify the governor based on allegations of falsehood and inconsistency in the two INEC forms, saying that both the Tribunal and courts were unanimous in their decisions not only that the allegations were statute-barred, but held that the said Forms CF001 of 2015 and 2019 did not contain any false statement.\n\n\u201cIt further said the matter that the Supreme Court of Nigeria had also affirmed the decisions of the Tribunal and the Appeal Court, by dismissing the petition of false statement against the governor.\n\n\u201cOn the allegation that the governor had been convicted for an offence in 1986, the chamber said the petitioner failed to attach any court judgment to the petition to this effect, hence, the allegation was baseless, asking the APC top echelon to discountenance as such.\u201d\n\nThe law firm also denied the allegation that the governor has a former name, adding that \u201che never bore the name \u2018Shawn Michael Davis\u2019 or any other name however described\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, it is not in doubt that all the allegations in the petition relate to our client\u2019s Forms CF001 for 2015 and 2019 are baseless and unfounded,\u201d the letter reads.\n\n\u201cAs shown above, the High Court of the FCT, Governorship Election Tribunal, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court have all held that the said allegations are unfounded and statute-barred, so that there would be no basis for disqualifying our client.\n\n\u201cOur client has been adjudged by the Tribunal and courts to be eminently qualified to contest the 2019 Ogun State gubernatorial election, which he won landslide.\n\n\u201cSince, as of today, the courts have held that our client is qualified under CFRN, the party cannot impose additional grounds for disqualification on him. Also, the APC Constitution and Guidelines for the conduct of primary elections cannot override the CFRN. Therefore, the party has no vires to prevent our client from contesting any election under its banner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs rightly admitted by the petitioner, only a court of law can disqualify our client. The party cannot disqualify him or prevent him from contesting in the party\u2019s primary election.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, our client is ready and willing to, at the screening stage for the party\u2019s primary election, present his credentials and relevant documents (including his primary school certificate, which has been alleged to be non-existent) to establish his eligibility to contest in the upcoming 2023 governorship election in Ogun State.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTherefore, we urge the party not to be distracted or misled by unfounded allegations aimed at preventing the party from presenting our client, who is the best candidate for the 2023 gubernatorial election, as the party\u2019s flagbearer. We also urge the party not to give credence to any rumour which may scuttle the party\u2019s chances in the said election.\n\n\u201cFinally, we pray that the petition should be disregarded as it is fraught with falsehood, speculation, inaccuracies.\u201d",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "CAR becomes first African country to legalise crypto",
          "text": "The Central African Republic (CAR) has just become the first African country to adopt bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\nThe Parliament of the Central African Republic (CAR) today voted unanimously to sign a bill that will recognise Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency as national legal tender, according to a statement posted to the country\u2019s presidential Facebook page. After El Salvador, CAR is just the second country in the world to legalise it.\n\nThe bill was earlier proposed by Gourna Zacko, CAR\u2019s Minister of Digital Economy, and Calixte Nganongo, CAR\u2019s former Minister of Finance and Budget. Last week, lawmakers adopted proposals to facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies and create regulatory bodies to oversee the use and adoption as well. At Parliament earlier today, the draft bill was officially adopted and will soon be signed into law.\n\n\u201cWith cryptocurrency, there is no more control of the Central Bank. You have your money, you send it to an investor for a business, you receive it in any currency, you can dispose of it in Dollar, Euro, CFA, or Naira,\u201d said Zacko, according to a report by iAfrikan.\n\nHow popular is crypto?\n\nAlthough bitcoin has gained worldwide popularity and usage in the past decade\u2014with global adoption growing by 2300% since 2019 and 103 countries allowing crypto trading\u2014governments and regulators worldwide are still debating its safety. At least 9 countries, including China and Qatar, have absolute bans on crypto, while 42 others have levied other forms of prohibition.\n\nFour African countries\u2014Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia\u2014have banned all forms of crypto trading, while 7 including Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon have some forms of prohibition regarding crypto trading.\n\nThese governments have cited numerous reasons for the bans from fraud and money laundering to tax evasion and terrorist financing.\n\nThese prohibitions, however, do not mean that crypto adoption amongst citizens isn\u2019t growing in these countries. In its 2021 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report, Chainanalysis reported that Africa\u2019s cryptocurrency market grew by over 1200% between 2020 and 2021. Kenya, Nigeria, Togo, South Africa, Ghana, and Tanzania are also featured in its Top 20 Global Crypto Adoption Index. In fact, Kenya is leading the continent in peer-to-peer crypto trading.\n\nChainanalysis\u2019 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report\n\nThis is what makes the CAR\u2019s adoption an interesting feat. The country hasn\u2019t topped any charts, the highest crypto transactions don\u2019t originate from it. In fact, at 11%, CAR has the fifth-lowest internet penetration rate in Africa, and this brings into question the feasibility of crypto adoption in the country.

          "text": "Techstars, one of the most influential accelerators in Africa, announced on Tuesday the ARM Labs Lagos Techstars Accelerator for early-stage fintech and proptech startups across the continent.\n\nThe programme came about through a partnership between Techstars and ARM Labs, the innovation hub of ARM, an asset management group in Nigeria.\n\nWhile the accelerator will be open to startups across the continent, the opportunity highlights the continued focus on Lagos as Africa\u2019s fast-growing tech hub. Known as the commercial and cultural capital of Nigeria, Lagos surpassed Nairobi to become the top African city on StartupBlink\u2019s 2021 Global Startup Ecosystem Index. The ARM Labs Lagos Techstars Accelerator will be the second Techstars-hosted programme on the continent; the first was in South Africa.\n\n\u201cLagos has built a successful startup ecosystem that merits more global exposure, investments and resources, and we see extraordinary potential in the market,\u201d Techstars general manager Nancy Wolff said in a press release sent to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cTechstars has been investing in Nigerian and African startups for years, and through our partnership with ARM Labs we look forward to bringing the value and reach of the Techstars\u2019 global network to the increasingly prominent Nigerian startup ecosystem,\u201d Wolff added.\n\nTechstars\u2019 work in Africa is more than a decade old, with its investments and mentorship programs dating back to 2011. Since then, the accelerator programme has hosted more than 400 Techstars Startup Weekend events across 40 African countries. In 2016, the company launched its first Africa-based accelerator, Techstars Cape Town; that was the same year it operated the Barclays Accelerator Programme, which supported fintech innovators in South Africa.\n\nAfricans in the diaspora have participated in and benefited from Techstars\u2019 accelerators, too. Through about two dozen accelerators, including Techstars Toronto, Techstars New York City, and Techstars Atlanta, Techstars have invested in over 50 startups across Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. It has invested in 14 Nigeria-based startups collectively, including Healthtracka, FarmCrowdy, OurPass and Rent Small Small. Some of the startups it invested in outside Nigeria include Rwanda\u2019s PayDay, South Africa\u2019s WizzPass, Ghana\u2019s BenBen and Kenya\u2019s Duhqa.\n\nThe ARM Labs Lagos Techstars Accelerator Programme will also allow the partnering companies to tap into Africa\u2019s ever-lucrative fintech sector. Investment tracking platform Partech reported that 63% (or $3 billion) of Africa\u2019s total VC funding went to fintech companies in 2021.\n\n\u201cOver the years, ARM has been on a mission to support African fintech startups that are solving key problems in innovative ways,\u201d said Jumoke Ogundare, CEO of ARM. \u201cOur partnership with Techstars is the logical next step in propelling the African continent to become the future global capital of fintech and transform how Africans access financial services.\u201d The application window for the ARM Labs Lagos Techstars Accelerator Programme opens May 8. A selection committee will award 12 startups $120,000 in funding, as well as curated startup programming and mentorship. The inaugural class will have its Demo Day in February 2023.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Making sense of the Web3 buzz through the eyes of an African investor, founder, and designer",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditors Note: On Saturday, May 21, 2022, Techpoint Africa is hosting Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit, a groundbreaking blockchain summit where industry experts will reveal more about the Web3 ecosystem and where we fit in as individuals. Register here to be a part of the discussion.\n\nThe Web3 buzz is more than just another Twitter trend. With investors betting $27 billion on what can be described as the new iteration of the Internet, it\u2019s a buzz that people should pay close attention to.\n\nOn April 1, 2022, Techpoint Africa hosted a Twitter Space with some Web3 experts to make sense of the Web3 buzz, and in the two hours it lasted, we got a semblance of what to expect in a Web3-powered future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErikan Obotetukudo, Founder and Managing Partner of Web3 Fund, Audacity, kicked off the conversation by explaining the concept of Web3.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to her, the Internet has gone from Web1 to Web2, with Web3, the latest iteration. In the Web1 era, the Internet was in its most basic form in the Web1 era, with primarily text-based websites that visitors on which visitors could not give feedback.\n\nThe second era of the Internet ushered in social media and made it possible for anyone to create content and get feedback.\n\n\u201cThe second era brought in Facebook and Snapchat, Instagram and WhatsApp, which is an area that Africa adopted more quickly. Before that, we didn\u2019t have the Internet infrastructure and the telecoms infrastructure to benefit from this,\u201d Obotetukudo said.\n\nWeb3 is the new Internet generation predominantly focused on blockchain technology as its foundational infrastructure. Rather than dwell on the technicalities of Web3, Obotetukudo believes that the new age of the Internet presents an opportunity for Africans to play a crucial role in the development of new technologies.\n\n\u201cAs an investor, I want to encourage people to get excited about this and build around it because this is the beginning of the floodgates of a new technology that will change the world.\u201d\n\nClement Hugbo, Co-founder of Web3 design agency, Crevatal, added that \u201cWeb3 is an open Internet powered by the blockchain, which allows everyone to be part of creating platforms as opposed to systems where a single or central entity controls online platforms.\u201d\n\nWhat will Facebook look like in the Web3 era?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Web1 looks like\n\nThe Web3 buzz is a combination of other buzzwords Obototukudo said; it\u2019s a mixture of the buzzwords \u2018blockchain\u2019, \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019, \u2018non-fungible tokens (NFTs)\u2019, \u2018decentralised finance (DeFi)\u2019, and \u2018decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs).\u2019\n\nThese proponents will inform what a Web3-enabled Facebook and Internet will look like. One of Obotetukudo\u2019s examples includes helping Africans get even more value for exported culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe pointed out that her travels from Barcelona to Portugal made her realise that African music and fashion were being enjoyed across European countries. In the Web3 era, African creators can release their works on Facebook, for instance, as an NFT and get even more value.\n\n\u201cIf you were to release a piece of your music as an NFT, anyone worldwide can put some money towards the NFT instead of just liking and commenting on it.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, an artist\u2019s followers or fans can also make profits from appreciating their favourite works as their value increases.\n\nFor Chika Uwazie, Founder of decentralised autonomous organisation, Afropolitan DAO, the Web3 era means full access to the financial ecosystem.\n\nUwazie, who spends most of her time in the US, spoke about some of the issues she has faced with US banks when she is in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either I\u2019m being blocked or unable to use a particular service; it was always one thing after the other. I\u2019m a US citizen, and I was having issues accessing my accounts in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nUwazie believes Web3 will disrupt the financial ecosystem, making it easy for people anywhere in the world to access their finances. She also thinks the rapid crypto adoption in Nigeria results from the financial constraints Nigerians experience.\n\nAccording to blockchain data platform, Chainalysis, Nigeria ranked sixth in its 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index. And it\u2019s not just crypto; Nigerians and Africans are embracing more Web3 proponents, creating valuable NFTs from art and music that are being appreciated globally.\n\nHugbo, who corroborated Uwazie\u2019s points, said that Web3 offers access beyond finance. Given the nature of Web3 startups, The peculiarity of Web3 startups is such that people anywhere in the world can work with them, provided they can do the job.\n\n\u201cA DAO makes it possible for anybody to come into the community and showcase their skills. My second job was in a DAO; it was a one-time thing, but I got called back cause I did a great job. From there, people started reaching out to me for more jobs in the Web3 space.\u201d\n\nWeb3: An opportunity for Africans to be leaders in cyber security\n\nSky Mavis, the company behind one of the most successful crypto gaming platforms globally, Axie Infinity, suffered a $625 million hack on March 29, 2022.\n\nObotetukudo believes that such occurrences should encourage Africans to find ways to prevent similar hacks and become the go-to people for cyber security solutions in Web3.\n\nHacking and crypto-related crimes were on the rise in 2021. And according to Chainalysis, illicit crypto addresses received $14 billion, a significant increase from $7.9 billion in 2020.\n\nWhile crypto crime has risen by 76% between 2020 and 2021, it is also important to note that illicit transactions are only 0.15% of the $15.8 trillion transacted in 2021.\n\nFrom getting immediate value for exported culture to participating in one of the biggest technological changes of all time, Web3 is a chance for Africa to play a vital role in the global tech ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nHowever, Hugbo pointed out that while the Web3 buzz opens up many opportunities through decentralisation, we still need to be cautious.\n\n\u201cFor every new technology, there are always phases, from ideation to a complete full technology. Web3 is very much in its early stage, and I don\u2019t think we are fully decentralised yet.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, May 21, 2022, Techpoint Africa is hosting Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit, a groundbreaking blockchain summit where industry experts will reveal more about the Web3 ecosystem and where we fit in as individuals. Register here to be a part of the discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

And I have a little historical fact for you.\n\nOn April 27, 1950, the Group Areas Act was passed by South Africa\u2019s Apartheid government.\n\nWhat was the purpose of the Act? The Act mandated racial segregation in South Africa\u2019s urban areas. It also limited land ownership and occupation to a specific legal group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this mean? Essentially, Blacks in South Africa were not allowed to own or occupy land in White areas. While the law was supposed to apply in the opposite direction, it was Black-owned land that the government appropriated for White-only use.\n\nSomething you should know about Apartheid: As a system, apartheid was obsessed with racial segregation of South African citizens. This was done to promote White superiority and solidify the minority White regime at the expense of the Black majority.\n\nNow that you have an idea of what happened today in history, kindly take a look at what I\u2019ll be discussing today:\n\nJustin Irabor\u2019s transition into tech\n\nAirtel\u2019s licence to operate as a super agent\n\nEthiopia\u2019s plan to allow foreign mobile money service\n\nFarmerline wants to improve agricultural infrastructure\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom forging a career in blockchain to learning how to make money with NFTs, the Web3 space can be very tricky. That\u2019s why we have created an entire event dedicated to Web3.\n\nLet NFT artists and blockchain devs show the ropes at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit. Register and get your early bird tickets here.\n\nJustin Irabor\u2019s transition into tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin Irabor. Full-stack engineer, TradeCore\n\n\u201cJack of all trades, master of none\u2026\u201d has come to be regarded as an insult over the years. Perhaps because we don\u2019t get to hear the complete saying, or because we believe it\u2019s beneficial to be an expert at only one thing.\n\nOn the other hand, It\u2019s not so bad if you\u2019re only good at one thing. I, for example, am not particularly gifted or interested in a variety of areas. \ud83d\ude06\n\nNotwithstanding, I admire people who have various interests and are, to some extent, good at what they do. For example, I know Oluwanifemi, our Senior Reporter, can cook (not as a survival skill, but as an interest), sew, write, and probably do other things I\u2019m not aware of. That, to me, is impressive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn a side note, do you know anyone who believes in the complete saying, \u201ca jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one\u201d?\n\nWell, I\u2019d like you to meet someone who doesn\u2019t just believe in the saying but has demonstrated over the years that being exceptional at one thing is not enough.\n\nAlso known as Mogwai or TheVunderkind, his government name is Justin Irabor. He is an artist and illustrator who creates comics, talks about comics, shows (most recently, Archer), NFT, Metaverse, Web3, and sings.\n\nInterestingly, on a good day, he sends between 50 and 80 tweets. From one-liner quoted retweets to full-fledged tweet threads to images with ALT text, there\u2019s something for everyone.\n\nHe works as a software engineer, but was previously an editor-in-chief and a digital marketer. Anyone who can tell me the link between all of this, 20 marks. Show working, please.\n\nSidebar: If you\u2019re thinking of transitioning into tech and don\u2019t know how to start, I think you should read this to the end.\n\nAlso, he was also unemployed at one point. \ud83d\ude06 Don\u2019t think he had it all rosy. I believe you can draw inspiration and learn from his story. Kindly take a moment and read it here: How a search for infinite learning led Justin Irabor to the world of computer science\n\nAirtel\u2019s licence to operate as a super agent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirtel Africa Plc announced yesterday, Tuesday, April 26, 2022, that its subsidiary, Airtel Mobile Commerce Nigeria Ltd, has received a licence from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to operate as a super agent.\n\nThis means that Airtel Mobile Commerce Nigeria has received final CBN approval to conduct certain banking activities like financial services within communities. This is aimed at strengthening financial inclusion by expanding financial services to the unbanked and underbanked across the country.\n\nRemember that the company received an approval-in-principle \u2014 a temporary approval contingent on meeting specific requirements \u2014 in November 2021.\n\nAirtel believes that the licence will enable the company to establish an agency network to service the customers of licenced Nigerian banks, Payment Service Banks, and Mobile Money Operators in the country.\n\nIs this similar? Yes! Recently, MTN received final PSB approval to kick-start an exciting era for Nigerian fintech. Click on the link to find out more about that.\n\nEthiopia\u2019s plan to allow foreign mobile money services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s raining licences today, albeit a different type.\n\nHow is it different? The Central Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) proposed a bill to allow foreign investors to provide mobile money services in Ethiopia. This bill, if approved, will help firms like Safaricom, Kenya\u2019s telco company, to operate in the country.\n\nThis implies that Ethiopia has started the process of changing its national payment law. Consequently, Safaricom will be able to launch its mobile money service, M-Pesa, in the country.\n\nRecall that in 2018, Safaricom was reportedly in advanced talks with Ethiopian government officials to expand into Ethiopia.\n\nAnd in 2021, Ethiopia cleared the way for Safaricom to introduce its popular M-Pesa to the 110 million people in the Ethiopian market after the country\u2019s decision to include mobile phone-based financial services in the telco\u2019s licence.\n\nDon\u2019t forget: A consortium led by Safaricom obtained the first private mobile telecommunications licence but lacks a permit for mobile financial services like M-Pesa.\n\nWhy? For decades, Ethiopia\u2019s telecoms market was closed to foreign investors. To change that, the NBE is attempting to remove the final legal hurdle for Safaricom through the Bill, which was made public last week.\n\nRemember that Ethio Telecom, the state monopoly, attracted four million users within weeks of launching a new mobile financial service called Telebirr in May last year. This demonstrates the market\u2019s potential.\n\nPer the NBE, over 75% of Ethiopia\u2019s population is unbanked, so, I think M-Pesa should thrive because it has only one competitor, Telebirr. But do you think it will succeed? What are your thoughts?\n\nFarmerline wants to improve agricultural infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFarmerline, a Ghanaian agritech startup, has raised a pre-Series A round of $12.9 million \u2013 $6.4 million in equity and $6.5 million in debt.\n\nThe equity round was led by Acumen Resilient Agriculture Fund (ARAF) and FMO, the Dutch entrepreneurial development bank, with participation from Greater Impact Foundation.\n\nDEG, Rabobank, Ceniarth, Rippleworks, the Mulago Foundation, the Whole Planet Foundation, the Netri Foundation, and Kiva were among the debt lenders.\n\nWhat does the startup do? The startup says it improves farmers\u2019 access to high-quality production inputs and education on best farming practices, including how to cope with the effects of climate change. Its solutions are also intended to help farmers gain faster access to markets, resulting in higher earnings and less post-harvest loss and waste.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Alloysius Attah and Emmanuel Owusu Addai, Farmline aims to reach 300,000 farmers by 2022, representing a 400% increase in growth over the previous year.\n\nThe funding will be used to improve their infrastructure, including warehouses and distribution channels.\n\nWhat does this mean? According to Attah, \u201cHaving a network of partners that can help us quickly move inputs like fertiliser and seeds to rural areas, and farm produce from rural areas, is important and part of what we do. We don\u2019t intend to bring all of the logistics and storage in-house, but we want to be more efficient and that means working with the right partners.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it will begin operations in Ghana before moving on to Ivory Coast.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent.

          "title": "How a search for infinite learning led Justin Irabor to the world of computer science",
          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s The Experts series, a bi-weekly where tech career specialists take us on their journey from newbie to expert, and how they became successful in the industry. to get email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanies hire smart people to help improve how their customers perceive and interact with their products, and Justin Irabor is one of such people. One interesting thing about him is that he has provided value through various channels over the years. If Justin Irabor doesn\u2019t ring a bell, his aliases, Mogwai and TheVunderkind, should.\n\n\u201cI have been many things. It depends on the timeframe I\u2019m looking at,\u201d he begins.\n\nJustin has consistently demonstrated his belief that being exceptional at one thing is not good enough.\n\nIn one of his Substack blog posts, he quoted science fiction author, Robert A Heinlein\u2019s infamous words, \u201cSpecialization is for insects,\u201d not really in praise of self-sufficiency, but rather in the context of mastering one\u2019s craft. Ironically, you would have to move on to the next when that is done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJustin is driven by the philosophy of not being ruled by a scarcity mindset, and it appears that once he has \u201cslain his dragons,\u201d as he puts it, in a particular field, he\u2019s ready for a new exploit.\n\n\u201cLet things go if they are inconvenient for you, more things will come!\u201d\n\nFlipping the pages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin describes his career start as \u201ca classical spreadsheet monkey,\u201d working on an eCommerce product as a content executive. Between 2015 and 2021, he was editor-in-chief at a PR company, regional marketing manager for Jumia Food, and head of content and marketing at Hotels.ng.\n\nHe also tried his hands out as the product manager and editor-in-chief for Big Cabal and Zikoko. Later, he took up the opportunity to set up the digital marketing department for Eden Life.\n\nMogwai\u2019s past roles constantly saw him draw upon his superb ability to write convincingly and analyse outcomes and predictions \u2014 skills needed by a marketer and growth specialist. While in these positions, he built confidence and slowly transitioned from the shy person he once was.\n\nIn the past seven years, in contrast to the number of times Justin has granted interviews, he prefers instead to publicise his thoughts through texts and illustrations on different platforms, some of which I was able to track: two Substack blogs \u2014 do while thinking and Craft overflow \u2014 a very active Twitter account, a GitHub repository, a website, and a LinkedIn account.\n\nFun fact: Justin sends between 50 and 80 tweets on a good day. From one-liner quoted retweets to full-blown tweet threads to images with ALT text. If he isn\u2019t talking comics, it\u2019s a show (recently animated series, Archer), NFT, Metaverse, Web3, or songs.\n\nJustin is also an artist and illustrator who makes comics to pass the time. Despite all that he does, Mogwai does not let his works alone speak for themselves; he consistently shares his journey. That I got interested in his story is proof that this strategy works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarketing, for him, means convincing people and not spending a lot of money while at it.\n\nJustin\u2019s somewhat ironic background saw him having to speak to people despite how shy he was. As a young boy, he gained some sales experience and has grown to work as a digital marketer, content creator, and growth expert.\n\nSpeaking about his experience transitioning across companies and industries, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s very stressful; it\u2019s very distressful even. Half the time, you\u2019re gonna be thinking, \u2018Ah! I made a mistake. I should just stay with the thing I\u2019m comfortable in.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin Irabor. Full-stack engineer, TradeCore\n\nHowever, despite the challenges and doubts about new ventures, he finds that he is fulfilled at the end of the day.\n\nTransitioning to software engineering\n\nLet\u2019s begin with an excerpt from Justin\u2019s LinkedIn bio \u2014 \u201cI come from a background in digital marketing and growth, and that instinct makes me a software engineer who builds products with considerations for the end-user by default.\u201d\n\nI should probably reveal that his transition from digital marketing to software engineering was why I decided to meet Justin.\n\nWe meet at his place. He sits across from me, a table between us, in a sitting room with several strategically placed framed works of art belonging to his flatmate. Donning a pair of grey joggers with a matching T-shirt, he greets me with a warm smile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving a conversation with Justin Irabor. Full-stack engineer, TradeCore\n\nSoftware engineering called out to him when he was editor-in-chief at a startup, and every downtime had to be escalated to the technical team.\n\nHowever, he didn\u2019t act on this pull until 2019, when it was clear he needed to change direction. Two years earlier, he thought it was impractical for him to do it along with his job, but he did it nonetheless while still at Eden Life.\n\nA little back story here. By the time Justin had spent four years in marketing and growth, he knew it was time for a change. He was not entirely excited by where his career trajectory might take him \u2014 probably peaking at a C-level executive role and being responsible for a global company\u2019s continental growth.\n\n\u201cMoney is good, but it doesn\u2019t excite me; I am driven by a purely intellectual pursuit. This means that beyond a point, I began to feel like, \u2018Oh! d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu! I\u2019ve done all of these before.\u2019 Everything is the same thing but in a different context. It\u2019s like, when you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen them all. The only thing I could do was start to switch industries.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something that felt like when you get on a treadmill; you can\u2019t get off. Once you\u2019re a software engineer, and specifically, computer scientist \u2014 that\u2019s what I wanna be \u2014 your learning is infinite,\u201d he lets out an excited laugh with a lit-up face, \u201cyou\u2019re gonna know some things, but you ain\u2019t gonna know everything till you die.\u201d\n\nI recognise this demeanour anywhere; it could only mean that Mogwai had hit gold and found the perfect escape in software engineering.\n\nIn 2019, Lambda School, a California-based online coding school, opened its doors to students from Africa, and Justin was part of the cohort in that pilot phase. The full-stack developer education programme did not strain his finances since it was a school-now-pay-later arrangement. However, the challenging part was the commitment it required.\n\nJustin describes his daily regimen.\n\n\u201cFor 11 months at a go, every single day, I was writing code. Every single day, I was building a project. This was how I worked it. I attended classes from 8 to 10 a.m. before going to work at Eden till evening.\u201d\n\nOne of the most significant sacrifices he made was putting in extra hours at work to make up for time lost in the mornings. He\u2019d get home in the evenings and take a nap before waking up at 10 p.m. to work on meeting his learning expectation \u2014 to build products after every class.\n\nThe sacrifices paid off, and he\u2019s worked for two foreign companies in under two years.\n\n\u201cI graduated, and I got a job working for a designing agency in the UK called Series Eight. Did a few months there, and then I got a job at a fintech company in Belgrade, Serbia. I\u2019m a full-stack engineer there. So, I work on the backend APIs and customer-facing administrative data board.\u201d\n\nA year as a software engineer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin Irabor. Full-stack engineer, TradeCore\n\nAlthough Justin was sure about transitioning into software engineering, he didn\u2019t escape the frustration that came with the move.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I finished Lambda School, it was difficult to get a job as a software engineer.\u201d\n\nHe speaks about a period when he did not have a job. It lasted much longer than he thought and gradually depleted his savings. It took a lot of self-restraint not to pick up a marketing role or accept an offer from a Nigerian company \u2014 which he had initially decided against for some reasons.\n\nBut, in the face of challenges, he spurred himself on by repeatedly asking, \u201cHow badly do I want it?\u201d\n\nHis current job is at TradeCore, a fintech API company, where he\u2019s the only full-stack engineer on the team. He considers his craft as something very intellectually satisfying.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m building, I\u2019m nourished by the things I learn.\u201d\n\nHe adds that the appeal he gets from computer science is how difficult it can get sometimes.\n\nHe takes his time simplifying what programming is to me, but I can\u2019t deny it will take more convincing to agree that it is not more complex than he\u2019s making it. He can probably guess that from my look but still encourages me to try it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, but it\u2019s not as difficult as people tend to think because you only have to understand the context. Programming is the purest expression of creativity which means if you\u2019re a creative, you should want to be a programmer.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Justin\u2019s new obsession is all over his public-facing platforms.\n\n\u201cAnd lately, I have interest in Web3. So, I do a bunch of Web3 projects; I work on a bunch of DAOs, and I do some dev relations for Web3 products.\u201d\n\nJustin carries himself with the air of a seasoned software engineer, and you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking he has been in the space for longer. He attributes this to many things he picked up while working in marketing. It is safe to say that he\u2019s proud of his growth.\n\n\u201cI manage myself. I come into meetings and ask questions like I\u2019m a senior engineer. I take responsibility. I learnt that working in the hospitality space.\u201d\n\nMaking Justin proud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin Irabor. Full-stack engineer, TradeCore\n\nJustin takes pride in being a voracious learner choosing to expose himself \u201cto the trauma of ignorance every day.\u201d Once he discovers a problem, he finds a fix by getting books and tutorials.\n\nAnother smart move is documenting his journey to get a graph of his progress.\n\n\u201cI have something called \u2018Thinkboy\u2019, a note archive which is only for software engineering stuff. I create a folder for the month. I\u2019ve archived the one for 2021.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s committed to building apps even if they don\u2019t get deployed.\n\nHere\u2019s a glimpse of how an average day looks for him. He wakes up at 9:05 a.m., has a stand-up meeting at 10 a.m. to share progress on the previous day\u2019s tasks, and plans for the day. He typically spends the rest of the day on peer programming, debugging, responding to emails, writing code, and making deployments.\n\nHaving recorded a few high and low points, Justin considers Angels Among Us \u2014 a project he worked on during the lockdown in 2020 \u2014 as his proudest achievement. Angels Among Us was deployed a month before he graduated from Lambda School. He describes it as an app for people with relatively secure financial statuses to help a randomly-generated list of people who have been economically affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nIn a short time, it attracted several donations and volunteers to put smiles on the faces of several families after raising around \u20a64 million (~$10,000). And, of course, it was only a matter of time before it got the attention of international press platforms like Quartz and Reuters.\n\nDespite the stress that came with it, Justin accomplished his goal of making something purely altruistic. And he plans to do more of such.\n\nAlthough he can\u2019t put a number to the projects he\u2019s built, his most recent is Catalogue, a free NFT minting tool for people with no basic NFT knowledge. He also built Astrofy, an app that generates a horoscope-based Spotify playlist. There are also close to ten other software projects, one of which was runner-up at the BuyCoin fintech Hackathon.\n\nIf things go according to Justin\u2019s plans, he will build a startup in the next three to five years. But if that does not happen, he has the vision to improve on Angels Among Us and create a verifiable database of people who need help across Africa.\n\nIf it does take off, it will create a consistent help channel for people who need it. Say, an amount dedicated to a child\u2019s schooling annually. For him, this would have a long-term impact and cause a dent in the continent\u2019s institutional poverty.\n\nIf Justin is not working, he\u2019s illustrating. In a different life, he would be a filmmaker. If Justin could speak to the whole world at once, he\u2019d say, \u201cYou should be more willing to interrogate established wisdom.\u201d\n\nFun fact: There\u2019s a story for one of Justin\u2019s aliases, Mogwai. A quick Google search tells you it means \u201cevil spirit\u201d or \u201cdevil\u201d in Cantonese. Weird, yes? But Justin says his choice of Mogwai is to remind him to always take responsibility if he wants the best results. Side note: Mogwai used to be a cute pet.

The constitution guarantees every qualified Nigerian be able to aspire to any position in this country. The party cannot stop anybody from contesting because that will be at variance with the constitution.\n\n\u201cIn 1999, the PDP zoned its presidential ticket to the South. Remember that at the Jos convention, late former Governor Abubakar Rimi of Kano State said he agreed with the party but said as a Nigerian he would contest and the party did not stop him.\n\n\u201cRecently at the national convention, the party decided to zone certain offices. You will recall that at the national convention, three positions were contested: deputy chairman (North) deputy chairman (South), and national youth leader.\u201d\n\nThe PDP spokesman stated that a 37-member committee led by Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State had submitted its report which would then be considered by the National Executive Committee of the PDP on Wednesday next week.\n\nHowever, he said that the NEC \u2013 which is the highest decision-making body of the party \u2013 would be the one to decide on whether there should be zoning or not.\n\nHe assured all contestants that regardless of the decision of the NEC, they would still be allowed to contest.\n\nReacting to the zoning controversy, Obi\u2019s Media Adviser, Mr. Valentine Obienyem, said it would be unjust for the South-East to be denied the party\u2019s ticket.\n\nThe Spokesman for Obi said it was regrettable that the party had decided to jettison the zoning arrangement of the party.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "The Senate has passed a bill seeking to amend the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2013, which will prohibit the payment of ransom to kidnappers in Nigeria.\n\nThe passage of the Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2013 (Amendment) Bill, 2022, followed the consideration of a report by the Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights, and Legal Matters.\n\nThe report was laid by the Committee\u2019s Chairman, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele (APC, Ekiti Central), before consideration.\n\nBamidele, in his presentation, said the bill seeks to outlaw the payment of ransom to abductors, kidnappers, and terrorists for the release of any person who has been wrongfully confined, imprisoned, or kidnapped.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, \u201cthe overall import of this bill is to discourage the rising spate of kidnapping and abduction for ransom In Nigeria, which is fast spreading across the country.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that in the memoranda presented to the Committee, the plethora of issues relating to the subject matter of terrorism and terrorism financing in line with global best practices were raised.\n\nHe assured that the amendment to the Terrorism Act would set standards and regulatory system intended to prevent terrorist groups from laundering money through the banking system and other financial networks.\n\nHe added that, \u201chaving policies in place to combat financing of terrorism will surely reduce or eliminate privacy and anonymity in financial and other sundry transactions as it relates to the subject in our society.\u201d\n\nHe explained further that the need to comprehensively review the Terrorism Prevention Act arose from the unfavorable ratings of Financial Act Task Force (FATF) recommendations of Nigeria\u2019s Mutual Evaluation Report and consequent placement of Nigeria in FATF\u2019S International Cooperation and Review Group Process with its impending sanctions on Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nHe stated that the National Task Force on improving Nigeria\u2019s Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime in Nigeria proposed improvement on the Act in order to address the deficiencies noted in its provisions so as to align with the required standard as obtainable in other jurisdictions.\n\nHe emphasised that the proposed repeal and enactment Bill was geared toward improving the effectiveness of countermeasures against terrorism, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing.\n\nThe lawmaker noted that the repeal is aimed at providing an adequate framework for improved international collaboration, inter-agency cooperation, and freezing of terrorist funds/assets.\n\nBamidele said that, \u201cthe passage of this Bill will save Nigeria from being included among countries in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Grey List with its attendant negative consequences, which might ultimately result in international sanctions that would affect the image of the country in the comity of nations.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in his remarks after the bill was passed, said the bill would complement the federal government\u2019s efforts in the fight against insecurity when signed into law by the President.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is our belief here in the Senate, that this bill, by the time signed into an Act by Mr. President, will enhance the efforts of this government in the fight against terrorism, kidnapping, and other associated and related vices.\n\n\u201cThis is one piece of legislation that can turn around not only the security situation in Nigeria but even the economic fortunes of our country.\n\n\u201cWe have done so much as a government, in terms of infrastructural development across all parts of this country, but because the security situation is not the kind of situation that we all want, this tends to overshadow all the tremendous and massive developments in our country.\n\n\u201cI believe that the Executive will waste no time in signing this bill into law, and it is our hope that this additional piece of legislation will achieve the purpose for which it has been worked upon by the Senate, and, indeed, the National Assembly and, for the reason for which it would also be signed by Mr. President.\n\n\u201cLet me make it very clear here, that the fight against insecurity, whether it is kidnapping, terrorism, or whatsoever, is not the sole role of a government.\n\n\u201cThe contribution and support by citizens are essential because our security agencies need vital and critical information against terrorism and other things that make life difficult for us.\u201d\n\nThe bill was passed by the chamber after it scaled third reading on the floor.\n\nThe Senate, thereafter, adjourned the plenary session till May 10, 2022, for the Sallah break.",

The official Oil and Gas meeting of the Federal Republic will take place in Abuja from April 16th to 20th, 2023.\n\nThe speed of change projected in the fossil fuels segment as the world pursues the energy transition agenda gave rise to the theme of NIES 2023, which is; \u201cGlobal Perspectives for a Sustainable Energy Future\u201d.\n\n\u201cNIES 2023 will put on the front burner overarching global energy trends and perspectives so that policy makers and other players in the sector can more easily understand latest developments and the best roadmap to drive the energy transition\u201d, says Mr. James Shindi, Managing Director of Brevity Anderson, the event producer.\n\nIn an online media broadcast, Chief Timipre Sylva, Honourable Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, said \u201cNIES 2023 is primed to be a show stopper as it will be the valedictory edition of this administration\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe event will provide the platform for the administration to present its scorecard in the energy sector and also provide the opportunity to offer a roadmap for the next administration. It is therefore an epoch and a must-attend event for all the stakeholders in the industry\u201d, Sylva added.\n\nAs tradition, NIES 2023 will feature the highest level of attendance by top decision makers, industry leaders and all stakeholders from both the public and private sectors from across Africa and the global energy community. There will be a special dinner and other networking events with attendee ministers from other oil producing countries and heads of government delegation from other countries.\n\nWith the full backing of the Federal Government of Nigeria, NIES has over the years witnessed the highest level of attendance by top decision makers, industry leaders and all stakeholders from both the public and private sectors.\n\n\u201cN.I.E.S has grown from year to year and remains the definitive platform, not just for Nigeria, but also for Africa to engage the global energy community\u201d, Shindi said.\n\nN.I.E.S is a federal government of Nigeria official energy industry event with the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources and all its parastatals including the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NURPC), Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF) and Petroleum Training Institute (PTI) are joint hosts.",

          "text": "By Asuelimen Osasuyi\n\nMinister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami and the Executive Vice Chairman, EVC, of the Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, have promised to continue to drive policy initiatives that promote investment in infrastructure in the Nigerian telecom industry in order to deepen connectivity to enhance the nation\u2019s growth and development.\n\nThe duo stated this on the sideline of the reception marking the landing of the Equiano undersea Cable System in Nigeria at the Open Access Data Centre at Lekki in Lagos. Pantami and Danbatta commended Google LLC, the West Indian Ocean Cable Company, WIOCC, and other investors for bringing additional bandwidth capacity into the country to drive connectivity and growth.\n\nWhile Pantami was represented at the event by NCC\u2019s Executive Commissioner, Stakeholder Management, Adeleke Adewolu, Danbatta was represented by the Executive Commissioner, Technical Services at NCC, Ubale Maska. Other senior management staff of the Commission at the event included the NCC\u2019s Director, Technical Standards and Network Integrity, Bako Wakil, and the Controller, NCC\u2019s Ibadan Zonal Office, Yomi Arowosafe.\n\nAccording to the Minister, the Federal Government, through the Ministry, will continue to drive the implementation of existing digital economy-oriented policies already put in place by the current administration. Pantami also promised an enabling environment that encourages foreign and local investment in infrastructure project such as the way Google and its co-investors have done.\n\nAlso commenting, Danbatta said the Commission\u2019s expectations, initiatives, and vision towards increasing broadband penetration, quality of service, advancement of a digital economy, and commitment to improving national security through technological advancement, are on the priority list of its regulatory interventions.\n\nDanbatta expressed delight that Equiano has joined the list of other submarine cables at the shores of Nigeria, including SAT3 cable, MainOne cable, Glo1 cable as well as the African Coast to Europe (ACE) submarine cable by Dolphin and West African Cable System (WACS) by MTN.\n\nThe EVC assured stakeholders of Commission\u2019s commitment toward ensuring that the huge bandwidth capacity from these cables at shore in Lagos would be transmitted to different part of the country to drive robust and ubiquitous infrastructure. This is in keeping with the provisions of the digital economy policy being implemented by government in collaboration with all stakeholders.\n\nThe EVC expressed optimism that Google\u2019s investment in the subsea cable, Equiano, will be significant in driving NCC\u2019s ongoing implementation of the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP) 2020-2025, which aims at increasing broadband penetration to 70 per cent by 2025.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that Equiano, together with earlier undersea cables in the country, will have additional landing points in the hinterlands through collaborative efforts with NCC-licensed Infrastructure Companies (InfraCos). This will help to reduce retail data prices significantly and thereby complementing the Commission\u2019s efforts at ensuring that affordable Internet services are available to boost Commission\u2019s ongoing broadband policy initiatives,\u201d Danbatta stated, reiterating the objective linkages of policies and plans in the telecom ecosystem, and the national economic strategies.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who also witnessed the unveiling of the Google\u2019s submarine cable, underscored the cable\u2019s centrality to Nigeria\u2019s ongoing efforts to boost job creation and contribution to the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), over the next three years.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of WIOCC, Chris Wood, also described the landing of the submarine cables as a major investment in the Nigerian digital economy.\n\nThe new cable system is named after a Nigerian hero, Olaudah Equiano, who survived enslavement in the 18th century and went on to become a famous writer and anti-slavery activist. Besides, the triumph over challenges, which Equiano\u2019s life symbolised, the landing of the cable in Nigeria is expected to underscore Nigeria\u2019s leadership as a regional hub for connectivity, and thus, set to attract cloud operators, content providers, content distribution networks and their associated ecosystems.",

We made some progress,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his side, Dr Adesina said the Russia-Ukraine war would create global problems, and particularly for Africa, which imports a huge percentage of its food from the two countries.\n\n\u201cAlready, the price of wheat has gone up about 60%. Maize and other grains will also be affected. There may be a fertilizer crisis, as there would be about a 2 million metric ton deficit. And that will affect food production by about 20%. Africa will lose $11 billion worth of food, and coming shortly after COVID-19, that would be rather serious,\u201d the AfDB President disclosed.\n\nTo prepare against the evil day, Dr Adesina said the AfDB has developed a $1.5 billion Africa Emergency Food Plan, which is now before the bank\u2019s Board for approval.\n\n\u201cWe were not ready for COVID-19, but we are now planning to avert food crisis on the continent. There is a plan to help farmers cultivate wheat, maize, rice, sorghum, and soybeans. It will mitigate the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war,\u201d be explained.\n\nTalking specifically of Nigeria, the Nigerian-born Adesina, and a former Minister of Agriculture, said in the wet season of 2022, at least 5 million smallholder farmers would be helped to cultivate 1 million hectares of maize, 1 million hectares of rice, and 250,000 hectares of sorghum and soybeans, respectively.\n\n\u201cIn total, our support will help Nigeria to produce 9.5 million metric tons of food.\u201d\n\nStates that will benefit from the assistance include Kano, Ogun, Oyo, Kaduna, Imo, Cross River, and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nDr Adesina submitted: \u201cMr. President, you have a passion for agriculture. We are behind you strongly, and we want to ensure Nigeria won\u2019t feel the impact of the food crisis.\u201d",

          "text": "Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya is famed for its Scramble Crossing, where crowds of people crisscross the intersection in a scene symbolizing urban Japan\u2019s congestion and anonymity. It may have added another boasting right.\n\nTokyu Railways\u2019 trains running through Shibuya and other stations were switched to power generated only by solar and other renewable sources starting April 1.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThat means the carbon dioxide emissions of Tokyu\u2019s sprawling network of seven train lines and one tram service now stand at zero, with green energy being used at all its stations, including for vending machines for drinks, security camera screens and lighting.\n\nTokyu, which employs 3,855 people and connects Tokyo with nearby Yokohama, is the first railroad operator in Japan to have achieved that goal. It says the carbon dioxide reduction is equivalent to the annual average emissions of 56,000 Japanese households.\n\nNicholas Little, director of railway education at Michigan State University\u2019s Center for Railway Research and Education, commends Tokyu for promoting renewable energy but stressed the importance of boosting the bottom-line amount of that renewable energy.\n\n\u201cI would stress the bigger impacts come from increasing electricity generation from renewable sources,\u201d he said. \u201cThe long-term battle is to increase production of renewable electricity and provide the transmission infrastructure to get it to the places of consumption.\u201d\n\nThe technology used by Tokyu\u2019s trains is among the most ecologically friendly options for railways. The other two options are batteries and hydrogen power.\n\nAnd so is it just a publicity stunt, or is Tokyu moving in the right direction?\n\nRyo Takagi, a professor at Kogakuin University and specialist in electric railway systems, believes the answer isn\u2019t simple because how train technology evolves is complex and depends on many uncertain societal factors.\n\nIn a nutshell, Tokyu\u2019s efforts are definitely not hurting and are probably better than doing nothing. They show the company is taking up the challenge of promoting clean energy, he said.\n\n\u201cBut I am not going out of my way to praise it as great,\u201d Takagi said.\n\nBigger gains would come from switching from diesel trains in rural areas to hydrogen powered lines and from switching gas-guzzling cars to electric, he said.\n\nTokyu paid an undisclosed amount to Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility behind the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, for certification vouching for its use of renewables, even as Japan continues to use coal and other fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see this as reaching our goal but just a start,\u201d said Assistant Manager Yoshimasa Kitano at Tokyu\u2019s headquarters, a few minutes\u2019 walk from the Scramble Crossing.\n\nSuch steps are crucial for Japan, the world\u2019s sixth-biggest carbon emitter, to attain its goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2050.\n\nOnly about 20% of Japan\u2019s electricity comes from renewable sources, according to the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies, a Tokyo-based independent non-profit research organization.\n\nThat lags way behind New Zealand, for instance, where 84% of power used comes from renewable energy sources. New Zealand hopes to make that 100% by 2035.\n\nThe renewable sources driving Tokyu trains include hydropower, geothermal-power, wind power and solar power, according to Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility that provides the electricity and tracks its energy sourcing.\n\nTokyu has more than 100 kilometers (64 miles) of railway tracks serving 2.2 million people a day, including commuting \u201csalarymen\u201d and \u201csalarywomen\u201d and schoolchildren in uniforms.\n\nSince the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, when a tsunami set off by a massive earthquake sent three reactors into meltdowns, Japan has shut down most of its nuclear plants and ramped up use of coal-fired power plants.\n\nThe country aims to have 36%-38% of its energy come from renewable sources by 2030, while slashing overall energy use.\n\nTokyu Railways has sought to publicize its effort with posters and YouTube clips.\n\nStill, Ryuichi Yagi, who heads his own company that used to make neckties but has switched to wallets appeared surprised to learn he was riding on a \u201cgreen train.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had no idea,\u201d he said.\n\nYagi switched his business because of Japan\u2019s \u201ccool biz\u201d movement. It encourages male office workers to doff their suits for open-necked short-sleeve shirts to conserve energy by keeping air conditioning to a minimum in hot summer months.\n\nIn a sense, he said, \u201cI lead a very green life.\u201d\n\nAP",

          "title": "Russia Halts Gas Supplies to Poland, Bulgaria for Failing to Pay in Roubles",
          "text": "Russian energy firm Gazprom said on Wednesday it had halted gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland for failing to pay for gas in roubles, the Kremlin\u2019s toughest retaliation yet to international sanctions over the war in Ukraine.\n\nPoland confirmed that supplies had been cut, while Bulgaria said it would find out soon. Both accused Gazprom of breaching longstanding supply contracts.\n\n\u201cBecause all trade and legal obligations are being observed, it is clear that at the moment the natural gas is being used more as a political and economic weapon in the current war,\u201d Bulgarian Energy Minister Alexander Nikolov said.\n\nGazprom said in a statement it had \u201ccompletely suspended gas supplies to Bulgargaz and PGNiG due to absence of payments in roubles,\u201d referring to the Polish and Bulgarian gas companies.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin demanded that buyers from \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries pay for gas in roubles or be cut off, starting from the date payments are due for April. The European Union has rejected this demand as rewriting contracts that called for payment in euros.\n\nPoland receives its Russian gas through the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Russia\u2019s huge gas fields in the Arctic far north, which continues west to supply Germany and other European countries. Bulgaria is supplied through pipes over Turkey.\n\nPolish state-owned PGNiG confirmed its supplies from Gazprom had been cut but said it was still supplying its own clients as needed.\n\n\u201cCutting gas supplies is a breach of contract and PGNiG reserves the right to seek compensation and will use all available contractual and legal means to do so,\u201d the company said.\n\nSupplies from Gazprom cover about 50% of Poland\u2019s consumption and about 90% of Bulgaria\u2019s. Poland said it did not need to draw on reserves and its gas storage was 76% full. Bulgaria has said it is in talks to try to import liquefied natural gas through Turkey and Greece.\n\nRussia\u2019s energy exports had until now continued largely unhindered since the war began, the biggest loophole in sanctions that have otherwise cut off Moscow from much of its trade with the West.\n\nKyiv has called on Europe to stop funding Moscow\u2019s war effort by cutting off energy imports that bring Russia hundreds of millions of dollars a day.\n\nGermany, the biggest buyer of Russian energy, said this week it is hoping to stop importing Russian oil within days. But weaning Europe off cheap and abundant Russian natural gas, which heats its houses, fuels its factories and drives its electric power plants, would be a far more disruptive prospect.\n\nAndriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russia was \u201cbeginning the gas blackmail of Europe\u201d.\n\n\u201cRussia is trying to shatter the unity of our allies,\u201d Yermak said.\n\nRUSSIA MAKES GAINS IN EAST\n\nSince the Russian invasion force was driven back at the outskirts of Kyiv last month, Moscow has refocused its operation on eastern Ukraine, starting a new offensive from several directions to fully capture two provinces known as the Donbas.\n\nUkraine\u2019s general staff acknowledged that Russia had made gains at a number of areas in the east, capturing outskirts of the towns of Velyka Komyshuvakha and Zavody on one front, and the Zarichne and Novoshtokivske settlements in Donetsk region.\n\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry said its missiles had struck an arms depot in Zaporizhzhia region housing weapons from the United States and European countries.\n\nAn aide to the mayor of the port city of Mariupol said Russian forces had renewed their attacks on the Azovstal steel plant, where fighters and some civilians are holed up. No agreements had been reached on trying to evacuate civilians from Mariupol on Wednesday, aide Petro Andryushchenko also said.\n\nUkraine said it had attacked Snake Island, a Black Sea outpost seized by Russia early in the war when defenders became heroes to Ukrainians for rejecting a Russian demand to surrender with an obscenity.\n\nThere has been increasing concern over the prospect of the conflict widening to neighbouring Moldova, where pro-Russian separatists in a small region occupied since the 1990s by Russian troops have reported several explosions in recent days.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine has left thousands dead or injured, reduced towns and cities to rubble, and forced more than 5 million people to flee abroad.\n\nMoscow calls its actions a \u201cspecial operation\u201d to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists. Ukraine and the West call this is a pretext for an unprovoked war to seize territory.\n\nThe United States and its allies have increasingly been supplying Ukraine with heavy weapons for the fight in the east. More than 40 countries met at a U.S. air base in Germany on Tuesday to discuss Ukraine\u2019s defence. Germany announced its first delivery of heavy weapons to Ukraine, including Gepard light tanks equipped with anti-aircraft guns.\n\nAMMUNITION DUMP BURNS IN RUSSIA\n\nBlasts were heard in the early hours of Wednesday in three Russian provinces bordering Ukraine, authorities said, and an ammunition depot in the Belgorod province caught fire. The regional governor said the blaze near Staraya Nelidovka village had been put out and no civilians had been hurt.\n\nRussia this month accused Ukraine of attacking a fuel depot in Belgorod with helicopters and opening fire on several villages in the province. A massive fire also broke out this week at a fuel depot in nearby Bryansk. Ukraine does not confirm responsibility for reported incidents on Russian territory.\n\nBritish military intelligence said Ukraine retained control over most of its air space and Russia had failed to effectively destroy Ukraine\u2019s air force or its air defences.\n\nReuters",
