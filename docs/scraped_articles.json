We are even done with the traditional rites. The imams are preparing for his burial already. It\u2019s a painful loss,\u201d the palace official said.\n\nThe Head of Oyo Mesi, who is the Prime Minister of Oyo Kingdom, High Chief Yusuf Ayoola, said added, \u201cWe have called the Imam. Baba will be buried today around 4pm.\u201d\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that the top Yoruba monarch died in the late hours of Friday at the Afe Babalola University Teaching Hospital, Ado Ekiti.\n\nThe late Alaafin\u2019s first son, Prince \u2018Tunde, and other children received the monarch\u2019s remains at Idi-Igba, Oyo town early Saturday morning.\n\nAdeyemi ruled for 52 years before his demise, making him the longest-reigning Alaafin.\n\nThe Governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, is expected to make an official announcement of the death soon.\n\nThe late Alaafin of Oyo was from the Adeyemi branch of the Alowolodu family. He was born on October 15, 1938.\n\nDuring his late childhood stage, he lived briefly at Iseyin.\n\nAdeyemi III was the son of Oba Adeyemi II, the former Alaafin of Oyo who was deposed and sent into exile in 1954 for having sympathy for the National Council of Nigerian Citizens.\n\nHe succeeded Alaafin Gbadegesin Ladigbolu II in 1970 and was crowned on January 14, 1971.\n\nHe was a lover of boxing.\n\nAdeyemi\u2019s death came after the demise of the Soun of Ogbomoso, Jimoh Oyewumi, and the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Saliu Adetunji, who died on December 12, 2021, and January 2, 2022, respectively.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "King Hakbal: Styling Royalties",
          "text": "\n\nHakeem Adeyinka Balogun, the Creative Director and CEO of King Hakbal International; an established fashion brand is leaving no stone unturned in making a huge impact with his designs, home and abroad.\n\n\n\nKing Hakbal\u2019s bespoke wears speak volume of sartorial elegance, royalty, confidence and culture.\n\n\n\nIn this interview, the Mathematics graduate of The University of Lagos (UNILAG), says he hopes to, one day, style Former President Barack Obama and international music star Sean Combs (P. Diddy).\n\nHe also sheds more light on the problems of the Nigerian fashion industry and the way forward.\n\n\n\nWhat inspired the King Hakbal brand?\n\nI would say royalty, passion, and the eventual joy of wanting to make every man look Royal. I would also say that, my fashion sense is a natural God-given talent that I absolutely had to share with the world. Not sharing it would have been a sin against humanity in my opinion. I have always loved fashion, even, as a kid, but I would say my very fashionable parents were a great influence, especially my mother. She had always dressed my siblings and me with a very high sense of style, and so, I grew up with that standard. What particularly prompted my interest into making others look good was my sincere desire to see everyone looking classy and special. I, sometime, wished I had special powers, because I would have made every single human look lovely every single day. For me, fashion is life and fashion brings out the true beauty in all. These are the major reasons that inspired the King Hakbal Royal Bespoke brand.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you were starting out, what gave you the confidence that fashion designing is a profitable venture that could put bread on the table?\n\nTo be honest, when I started, I never thought of the financial side of fashion. My main focus was just to make my clients truly happy and basically to deliver a very satisfying value for money service. I will say truly that, all that I have achieved so far is from sheer dint of hard work, perseverance and God\u2019s divine grace. We all never know in the beginning that whatever we set out to do will be a profitable one, or will guarantee bread on the table. But if you are one that never likes to fail, that fear of failure will always keep you driven that, you will always want to do more. So, in a nutshell, I will say that it\u2019s the fear of failure and pure passion that gave me and is still giving me, the confidence that with God by side, He will always provide the next bread on my blessed table.\n\nTo God be all the Glory and praise.\n\nWhat were the initial challenges you encountered and how did you scale the hurdles?\n\nI used to have power problems (Electricity) when I started in 2003. We all know how bad our power situation is but by the grace of God, I saved up for a very good diesel generator; one that can conveniently power all the machines in my factory. That was a very huge achievement for me that year. I look back now and all I can say is \u2018Alhamdulilah Robeel Alameen\u2019. It is really not easy for a young Nigerian entrepreneur that has a very big dream ahead of him or her. I also didn\u2019t get the type of support that I expected to get from family and friends, but God put total strangers in my path and my story changed. These blessed people saw how hard working and passionate I was and kept referring me to other clients until the world knew my name. Social media has also been an amazing platform to show my pieces to the world; I am so thankful for that.\n\n\n\nHaving come this far what lessons have you learnt about fashion designing that can benefit those coming into the profession?\n\nAlways deliver a good job. Listen to your client\u2019s instructions to the letter z. Even if you forget, don\u2019t be too shy to put a call through to ask further questions because at the end of the day, that smile on your client\u2019s face when he or she receives or fits into the outfit is what will guarantee a smooth transaction, and eventually bring more clients to you. I have also learnt that a very good customer service is important. Right from the way you speak to your clients over the phone, to the way you welcome them whenever they are around you will say a lot and help a whole lot in pushing you and your fashion brand forward. Always note that one client is like a million because you never know who is who.\n\nAnother interesting thing that I have learnt is that as a fashion designer, you must always look the part because there is this wise saying that goes \u2013 \u201cWhoever says that he wants to style us, we will be wise enough to see what this so called person has on their own back first.\u201d This will tell us if he truly knows his onions or not. Furthermore, I have also learnt that humility is key. Choose your words very carefully whenever you are around your clients. Being in your presence is an experience for them and it\u2019s up to you to make sure that it\u2019s a fun one that they won\u2019t forget in a rush. This will ensure that you are always in their minds and on their lips whenever they speak about a fashion designer brand.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat has been your best and worst moment so far as a fashion designer?\n\nI have only had best moments because I love what I do. To name one of the many best moments will be taking a bow after the release of my collections on the runway on major platforms. Fashion is life so that makes everyday a chance to make another stunning fashion statement. I always say that the world is my runway and everyone around are my audience. I simply love what I do. I truly can\u2019t see myself doing anything else. God bless the Nigerian fashion industry (Amen).\n\n\n\nWhat motivated you to go to UK and New York?\n\nWhat motivated me to travel abroad was because of my clients in those parts of the world and also to broaden my horizon. I wanted to know and learn more about fashion. I also needed a refreshing inspiration that could bring out an outstanding creative side to my mind. The world is like a book. If we don\u2019t travel the world and stay in just one country, it\u2019s almost like reading just one page in an amazing and adventurous book. I also wanted to see the things that I used to watch on television as a kid in reality. Growing up and till date, I am only drawn to American movies. They actually make me feel like I am partly American deep down. So, travelling to these parts of the world was just out of curiosity and adventure.\n\n\n\nYou are trying to broaden your market to UK, what is unique about the Nigerian fashion industry?\n\nWhat is unique about the Nigerian fashion industry is the Nigerian sense of style and confidence that we Nigerians carry so effortlessly. I, also, particularly love how we Nigerians tend to stand taller and adjust our carriage whenever we are in any of our ethnic or traditional attires. One can immediately see a boost in our self-confidence; watching that transformation is simply priceless to me. This makes me want to share this truly regal Nigerian attires and regalia with the whole world.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow affordable are your designs and who are your target clients?\n\nMy pieces are very affordable for what I deliver. My target clients are men that see themselves as Kings at heart; men that do not see themselves as ordinary, men with a very simple yet outspoken sense of style. Men with class!\n\n\n\nKindly share with us some of the fashion shows you have participated in and which was your best and why?\n\nThe African Fashion Week and the ECOWAS Fashion Week; I particularly loved the African Fashion Week more because it carried so much power and the coordination. The turn-out was huge. I had the sound track from the classic movie \u2013 Coming to America \u2013 And my models dressed in stunning tuxedo, very sharp 3- piece business suits and some Dansiki and Agbada made out of Aso Oke. The screams and applause were extremely overwhelming for me. There is nothing like reaping the fruits of one\u2019s labour.\n\nWho is the perfect King Hakbal Lion Man?\n\nThe perfect King Hakbal Lion Man is one that is fearless in the pursuit of what sets his soul on fire. A King Hakbal Lion Man is also one that sees himself as a King at heart; a driven- man who puts his money where his mouth is. He is also a stand-up man that exudes so much confidence. A King!\n\nWho do you dream to style as a fashion designer and why?\n\nBarack Obama, Sean Diddy Combs. I mentioned these two great men because Barack Obama is my role model. In fact, he is a girl\u2019s dad just like me. He is also very stylish and he has so much swag. Secondly, I mentioned Sean Diddy Combs because he was my fashion idol growing up. He always loved to look sharp at every single chance given to him. He also inspires a whole generation.\n\n\n\nHow friendly is the Nigerian economy to fashion entrepreneurs?\n\nIt is extremely friendly because we Nigerians are so fashion forward. It\u2019s very inspiring. We also have lots of fashion-loving Nigerians in the Diaspora who see the good works that we fashion designers are doing on social media. They have been so supportive financially. Thank God for social media, especially Instagram. Instagram has helped every entrepreneur show their creativity to the world in a very easy, yet professional platform.\n\n\n\nWhat projection do you have for your brand in the next 5 years?\n\nTo be the Royal and Premium Men\u2019s wear brand all over Africa and the world at large. To have stores in major cities all around the world, and to continue to have the high and mighty in the society wear King Hakbal.\n\n\n\nHow do you relax and have time for family?I pray, drink lots of water and go to a private beach house with my family. I also love having conversations with my wife and daughters about almost everything. That really relaxes me as they are the love of my life.",

          "text": "Words By -Yemisi Suleiman\n\nWife of Nigeria\u2019s Chief of Naval Staff and current president of the Naval Officers Wives Association, NOWA, Nana Aisha Gambo is poised to create an absolutely better life for members of her association.\n\nSince assuming office in 2021, Mrs. Gambo has embarked on major projects, aimed at bettering and enhancing the organization by supporting military wives whose husbands are often absent on missions or stationed far away from their homes. Apart from her duties at NOWA, Aisha Gambo is also a philanthropist, who prides herself on a lot of philanthropic activities such as providing access to clean water in disadvantaged communities, empowering young and upcoming women in the business world, and offering scholarship opportunities to indigent students; a feat which, recently, earned her a spot as an inductee into the United Nations Humanitarian Hall of Fame.\n\nMrs. Gambo who holds a degree in Geography and Regional Planning from Ahmadu Bello University is also CEO of Framazaz Resources Limited, with several subsidiaries. The businesswoman also has her hand in properties and interior decoration.\n\nAs president of Nowa, what major initiative have you embarked upon to improve the lives of members of your organisation?\n\nSince assuming office, we have done several projects geared towards improving the lives of our people. We have done seminars and training to expose and enhance their livelihoods such as entrepreneurship training to enhance their business skills in topics like negotiating, marketing, profitable pricing, etc. We have held cybersecurity seminars to expose members to the effects, impacts, and detection of cyber fraud. Our members have been engaged with an African study tour that exposed NOWA executives and members to empowerment and welfare programmes, employed by other countries to improve the lives of women and children.\n\nAre you having the impact you hoped your initiative would have at the outset?\n\nI feel very good and blessed about the initiatives I put forth because the impact is felt across the board. There have been an increasing number of participants joining the skills acquisition training center for example, and we have a lot more clamouring for new centers to be built in more states.\n\nOften, we hear and see on TV wives of late military men lamenting that they and their children have been neglected after the death of their husbands.\n\nWhat does Nowa do in such circumstances?\n\nThere is always room for NOWA members in the NOWA organization. We understand that the circumstances are extremely painful, but in our own organizational capacity, we continue to provide opportunities and support for those whose husbands are late and died fighting for our country. NOWA in conjunction with the Nigerian Navy organizes sensitization workshops to sensitize the officers on the benefits of appointing their spouses as next of kin to enable the receipt of benefits and entitlements.\n\nIn what ways do you cater to both the developmental and moral growth of women and children left behind by late officers?\n\nOne of my core beliefs is that we don\u2019t leave anyone behind. We make sure that support is available for widows and their children. We also give work opportunities when the chance arises. In addition, we also offer opportunities for women and youths to learn vocational and entrepreneurship skills, at our skills acquisition centres in Oghara and Lagos. NOWA sponsors the children of late parents through primary and secondary education\n\nYou were inducted into the United Nations Humanitarian Hall of Fame some time ago, what does this mean to you?\n\nThe induction into the Humanitarian Hall of Fame about six months ago means a lot not because of the award itself, but because it means the work I have been doing behind the scenes has been impactful on so many lives, and my efforts have been recognized by the United Nations Economic and Social Council. With or without any awards, it\u2019s in my heart to impact lives and I will continue to do so in any way I see possible.\n\nThis year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day theme is: \u201cGender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow.\u201d How do you factor this in achieving your goals with regards to Nowa?\n\nNOWA is a strong women association made up of many strong and smart women and that is a vehicle for any initiative regarding the growth of women globally. We align with the International Women\u2019s Day theme \u201cGender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow\u201d because the celebration of women who have done what we aspire to do, encourages more women to push the boundaries for gender equality and a more sustainable future.\n\nHow do you balance being at the head of a property development and interior decorating company at the same time?\n\nBy the Grace of Almighty Allah, I am at the helm of a few different businesses and it can be challenging balancing different businesses in such an environment. I make sure I work with trustworthy people. I also train them and employ those who are willing to work hard and be rewarded accordingly.\n\nHave you always been entrepreneurial? What led you to take that first step in setting up your own business?\n\nYes, by the Grace of God, I have always been entrepreneurial from my childhood days. I got interested in my father\u2019s business ventures; he was also a builder and I noticed how he went about his work. Again, I always assisted my mother in getting things done, whether it was following her to the market, or just handling things around the house. I believe this upbringing grounded me to understand that success in life is a process and a journey.\n\nOver the years, have you encountered any barriers to your success or growth as an entrepreneur?\n\nEveryone experiences challenges in business but, that of a woman can be very different because there are many aspects involved. I had three young kids to take care of while also starting and running my business. Balancing the time my business needed to grow and the amount of time devoted to raising good kids posed a challenge. But with the wisdom and blessings I acquired as a young lady, I was able to make both works and by the Grace of God, raised three beautiful young adults. Another challenge I faced was the thought that business is supposed to be left for men to do. Early on in my career, when some of the men did not understand my passion and capacity, they thought the opportunities I was vying for were too big for me to handle until I was awarded the job and executed well. Consistent delivery was how I was able to continue to build credibility over the years and oftentimes my old clients would refer me to the next client.\n\nWhat event in your childhood years shaped you into the woman you are today?\n\nNo particular event but as mentioned earlier, watching and being involved with my parents activities gave me the courage and confidence to work hard and reach new heights over time.\n\nAs a businesswoman, leader, and philanthropist, what is your vision?\n\nMy vision is to be an inspiration to many people, especially the young and up-and-coming businesswomen in our society. I believe my actions, my stories, and my work, will help motivate and inspire them.\n\nHow does your business experience benefit your current position as president of Nowa?\n\nWell, I can look at the problems we face from a private sector point of view. This allows me to be a bit more hands-on and less bureaucratic in providing solutions to the organization.\n\nWhat are you most passionate about?\n\nMy big focus is on the sustainable development of the less privileged. It has been a passion of mine even before I became the NOWA President. I have taken pride in doing a lot of philanthropic activities such as providing access to clean water in communities, empowering young and upcoming women in the business world, scholarship programmes to mention a few.\n\nWhat do you hope to accomplish within the next year?\n\nOne of the biggest projects I would like to accomplish in the next year is the hospital we plan to build for women and children. This would be a specialized 200-bed hospital that would be equipped to handle all the necessary care for women and children. We plan to build it in three locations (Abuja, Kano, and Port Harcourt).\n\nYou look very fashionable. What\u2019s fashion like for you?\n\nWell, fashion is also an expression for me, it can be therapeutic to wear nice clothes and feel confident in them, and so I am intentional about that. I like my clothes simple but elegant.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing in your free time?\n\nBecause I am extremely busy with a lot of engagements with my different businesses, I enjoy resting, sleeping, and taking time for myself whenever I get the chance. I don\u2019t compromise on that and I think it\u2019s an important aspect that many busy people should focus on. I also enjoy listening to music and The Holy Quran.\n\nWhat is the one piece of advice you would give any young woman reading this?\n\nThe one piece of advice I would give any young woman reading this is, to understand that success is a process, there\u2019s a journey to it and it doesn\u2019t come as fast as social media might want to make you believe. Work hard, develop yourself because no one can ever take that away from you, be confident, and associate with the right people.",

One thing is to speak to your kids.\u201d\n\n@Geoffreydpr \u201cTo me Sanwo ordering opening school in short a time is sending a strong message to Nigerians , this is the second incident he is opening school in short time, investigation need to be concluded and guilty charged to court from opening school.\u201d\n\n@KesterDave \u201cSo that is it this country will not stop making me laugh no report of the investigation if at all all is to suspend the girl and reopen the school this is clear money have exchange hands\n\n@Omenaipearls \u201cCharity they say begins at home, fine! But then, schools have a great role to play in the life of their students too. Chrisland School cannot be exonerated. Acts may be learnt at home but they are perfected in Schools. Stop indulging brats. Set rules and follow them strictly.\u201d\n\n@Stanleyonuajah \u201cGovernment is reopening Chrisland Schools in Lagos. If you don\u2019t train your children from home, school can\u2019t do magic.\u201d\n\n@Dammygtnet \u201cIt was a wrong step ab initio. No need to shut it down at all.I repeat, giving a kid a smartphone is an invitation to societal vices.\u201d\n\n@Bankymoon \u201cSentiment will make people not to see that the fault the school had was that they didn\u2019t inform the family of the girl on time. But people wanna blame the school because the girl and the boys learnt about s*x or blame them for falling asleep at midnight.\u201d",

          "text": "Supporters of former President Goodluck Jonathan, who are pressuring him for another shot at the presidency in 2023, will have to wait for more time to know his decision.\n\nJonathan told some of the supporters who stormed his Abuja office yesterday in over 30 buses to ask him to join the presidential race that he was still making consultations.\n\nHe said the \u201cpolitical process is ongoing\u201d, hence his inability to give a firm response to their agitation yet.\n\nThey should watch out for his decision, he said.\n\nThe agitators comprised mainly youths and women.\n\nJonathan was midway into a breakfast meeting with some of his political associates at his Foundation Headquarters in Maitama, Abuja when the agitators came calling.\n\nHe excused himself from the meeting to address them.\n\nHis words: \u201cYes, you are calling me to come and declare for the next election. I cannot tell you I\u2019m declaring; the political process is ongoing. Just watch out.\n\n\u201cBut the key role you (youths) must play is to pray that Nigeria gets somebody that carries the young people along and somebody that can also work very hard to see that some of the problems we see are dealt with by the government, and I believe that collectively we will work together.\u201d\n\nThe former President, who was flanked by some of his associates, commended the youths for getting involved in political activities in the country, noting that the large turnout clearly showed that Nigerian youths are interested in politics.\n\n\u201cWe have always been saying that the youths must get involved in the political process and luckily the not-too-young-to-run bill has made it very clear that young people can contest almost every position in government,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo we will continue to encourage you to get involved in the political process, and as long as many youths get involved in the political process, the more we will be able to get the government that we want.\u201d\n\nOn security, the former president said with the vigour with which Nigerian youths are involved in the affairs of the country, the challenges would soon be surmounted.\n\n\u201cThe country has been facing so many challenges. Some of them started a very long time ago and I believe with the interest of the young people, these challenges will be dealt with. We will work very hard,\u201d he said.\n\nLeaders of the placard-carrying supporters had taken turns to persuade the former President to return to office in 2023, promising to work for his success and see to his victory at the polls.\n\nComrade Mayor Samuel, the Convener of Youth Compatriot of Nigeria (YCON) sought Jonathan\u2019s forgiveness for rejecting him in the 2015 election, claiming they were deceived by those he called saboteurs.\n\nSamuel said their eyes are now opened and appealed to the former President to come and rescue the country from insecurity, hunger, unemployment among others.\n\nAnother leader who claimed to come from a state told the former President that they were ready to mobilise for his victory at the polls.\n\n\u201cWe are here to tell you to run. We are tired of suffering, we are tired of insecurity. Our streets are no longer safe. Our children can no longer go to school. ASUU has been on strike. The entire machinery of Nigeria is not working. We are tired of excuses.\n\n\u201cWe want somebody that can transform the economy of Nigeria and there is nobody that can do that except Goodluck Jonathan. When he was the President, the economy was booming. We had a steady power supply and the fuel pump price was stable. But now, what are we experiencing? High cost.\n\n\u201cWe have come as Nigerian youth from all parts of the country to tell you to run in 2023.

          "title": "PDP ticket: Consensus a scam, says Wike",
          "text": "Get real time updates directly on you device, subscribe now.\n\nBy Justina Asishana, Minna, Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt, Samuel Oamen, Ogochukwu Anioke, Abakaliki\n\nTambuwal names Ogbeha campaign DG\n\nNorthern Elders endorse Saraki, Bala\n\nRivers State Governor Nyesom Wike yesterday took a fresh dig at the consensus arrangement being promoted in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ahead of next month\u2019s presidential primaries, dismissing it as a scam.\n\nWike, who is one of the aspirants seeking the PDP presidential ticket, said he would never be sucked in by such a move.\n\nHe spoke on a day Northern Elders in the PDP announced their endorsement of Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed and former Senate President Bukola Saraki as northern consensus candidates of the party.\n\nTheir leader and former Vice Chancellor of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Professor Ango Abdullahi, broke the news of the endorsement at the end of a meeting in Minna, Niger State with former military president, General Ibrahim Babangida.\n\nBut Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal, apparently unperturbed by the outcome of the Minna meeting, forged ahead with his presidential aspiration, naming Senator Tunde Ogbeha as chairman of his campaign.\n\nWike, speaking on BBC Pidgin ahead of the PDP presidential primaries, declared that only death could abort his participation in the election.\n\n\u201cSome people think they can deceive me with consensus. It\u2019s a scam. I don\u2019t like being deceived in my life,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cIf you want to do consensus, there must be equity and fairness. Are the hands of those demanding consensus clean? People talking about consensus are the ones running the election. Is it the party\u2019s decision?\n\n\u201cIt is not the party that is talking. In politics, there is something called shine shine bobo. The more you look, the less you see.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he could step down for another candidate, Wike said: \u201cWhy will I step down for anybody?\n\n\u201cThe only thing that can make me step down is death. If I am alive, we will run this thing; we will hold the primaries on May 28/29.\n\n\u201cBut I know that God has promised me that I won\u2019t die. There is nothing that will make me withdraw from it. It is what I want to do for my country. Before I came out I told my wife and she asked me to go. If I didn\u2019t tell my wife and she became angry and asked me not to go then I would obey.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on why he did not deem it fit to visit Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki during his recent trip to Benin City for consultation with PDP members, Wike said: \u201cNobody will force me to visit anybody. Is there any law that says if I go to a place I must visit somebody?\n\n\u201cI did not visit Governor Godwin Obaseki because that was not where the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) sent me.\n\n\u201cThey sent me to meet the delegates (not the governor) concerning how our party will win the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIt is not written anywhere that I must go through the Governor before seeing the party delegates.\n\n\u201cGovernor Godwin Obaseki is not in a relationship with me, he is not my girlfriend, so why should I be quarrelling with him?\u201d\n\nWike and Obaseki were recently locked in a stand-off after the Rivers State governor called him a serial betrayer and an ungrateful person.\n\nHe tendered an unreserved apology to Obaseki\u2019s former godfather and predecessor Comrade Adams Oshiomole for ignoring his warnings on the Edo governor.\n\nOn his part, Obaseki said PDP was not the personal property of Wike.\n\nThe Edo Governor said his state could not be bought and he would not accept political bullies or overlords.\n\nBacks Ugwuanyi\u2019s stance on justice, equity, fairness\n\nAlso yesterday, Wike said he was on the same page with Enugu State Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi that the election of PDP presidential flag bearer be based on justice, equity and fairness.\n\nAddressing Ebonyi State PDP delegates at the party\u2019s state secretariat in Abakaliki, Wike said: \u201cEvery consensus must be based on equity, fairness and justice as propagated by my brother Governor of Enugu State, Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi.\u201d\n\nThe Rivers State Governor pointed out that the primary aim of the PDP at the moment is to win the election and return to power at the centre, urging the delegates to vote for him during the presidential primary election as he has the needed qualities to win the presidential election and transform Nigeria for the better.\n\nUgwuanyi had advised Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State, Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed, and two other presidential aspirants of the PDP (Senator Bukola Saraki and Mohammed Hayatu-Deen) when they visited him at Enugu State Government Lodge, Abuja, to ensure justice, equity and fairness in the process.\n\nDrama as Ebonyi PDP members stop embattled state chairman from addressing Wike\n\nThe Abakaliki event was almost marred by a mild drama when some PDP members stopped the embattled Chairman of the party, Tochukwu Okorie, from addressing Wike.\n\nThe PDP State Secretariat, venue of the event, had been shut by security agents following the defection of Governor Dave Umahi to the APC in December 2020.\n\nOkorie was sacked by an Abuja High Court recently; a decision he has since appealed.\n\nHowever, he was introduced as the state chairman of the party and mounted the podium to address Wike and members present.\n\nDispleased by the development, some members started shouting, \u201cHe is not our Chairman; no, no, no, no.\u201d\n\nHe was prevented him from speaking.\n\nLater, the Vice Chairman of the party, Ifeanyi Emmanuel Nworie, was introduced as Acting Chairman of the party and allowed to speak.\n\nAbdullahi: How we picked Mohammed, Saraki\n\nProfessor Abdullahi said Babangida and the PDP Northern Elders stepped into the consensus arrangement at the instance of the four presidential aspirants involved \u2013Dr.Bukola Saraki, Bala Mohammed, Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal and Alhaji Mohammed Hayatu-deen.\n\nThe aspirants, according to him, had visited Babangida and gave \u201c him the mandate to lead the process for a consensus and agreed to abide by the outcome of the decision.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cThe former president encouraged the aspirants to have a resolve within themselves and come up with one candidate, which they reported back to him after some days and asked him to go ahead and pick one out of the four.\n\n\u201cGeneral Babangida on his part opted for inclusion through wider consultation and\n\nassigned me to design criteria and carry out the necessary consultations with\n\nelders and leaders across the three geopolitical zones of the North.\u201d\n\nThe candidates were subsequently assessed by \u201csix distinguished persons each from the three geopolitical zones\u201d, he said.\n\nContinuing, Abdullahi said: \u201cEach of the zonal delegates was allocated two votes to choose the first and second choice, making a total of 36 votes overall.\n\n\u201cThe outcome of that consultation was as follows:\n\n7 votes for candidate (A) Aminu Waziri\n\n10 votes for candidate (B) Bala Muhd\n\n10 votes for candidate (C) A-B Saraki\n\n5 votes for candidate (D) M Hayatu-deen\n\n\u201cOne of the elders deferred his votes on grounds of continuing consultations with\n\ntraditional rulers and other major stakeholders.\n\n\u201cTwo members did not cast their second ballots, bringing the total to 32 votes cast\n\nout of 36\n\n\u201cThe next phase involved opinion based on regions which was concluded as follows:\n\nNorth Central \u2013 (Eight) North East- (Seven) North West \u2013 (Two)\n\nOne is still under consultation\n\n\u201cIn the end, resort was made to the historical antecedents of the PDP with regards\n\nto previous northern aspirations and the following conclusion was reached:\n\nThat the North West has had the opportunity of contesting and even forming\n\ngovernment in 2007.\n\nIn 2011 a consensus was made among the four northern candidates, which\n\nNorth East got the slot but lost at the primaries. In 2019, it got the slot again though\n\nthe party could not form the government.\n\nThe North Central has not had a single opportunity to get the PDP ticket since\n\nthe inception of the current Fourth Republic.\u201d\n\nThe former VC said it was then resolved \u201cthat a leading aspirant from the North Central and one from the\n\nNorth East are to be presented as northern presidential candidates.\u201d\n\nThe two, Saraki and Bala Mohammed, are expected to make further concessions \u201cso that in the end, one of them would be presented as the consensus candidate out of the four that presented themselves from the North.\u201d\n\nLeft out of contention were Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal and Mohammed Hayatu-Deen who were originally part of the consensus move.\n\nTambuwal picks Ogbeha as campaign chairman\n\nHowever, Tambuwal pressed ahead yesterday with his presidential ambition with his appointment of Senator Tunde Ogbeha as his campaign chairman.\n\nTambuwal\u2019s media aide, Muhammad Bello, said in Sokoto that the appointment took immediate effect.\n\nOgbeha is expected to \u201cdeploy his vast experience in administration, public policy and politics to the campaign and will chair meetings of the Tambuwal Campaign Council. He will help set up priorities and give direction to the campaign.\u201d\n\nThe retired Army Brigadier General was military administrator of Akwa Ibom State and later of the old Bendel State during the General Ibrahim Babangida regime.\n\nHe was also a two term senator representing Kogi West senatorial district for two terms.",

While persuading him to declare for the 2023 presidential poll, the supporters took turns to ask him to return to office in 2023, promising to work for his victory at the polls. They carried placards with various inscriptions like \u2018Goodluck Jonathan, you must run;\u2019 \u2018We need you to restore Nigeria, among others.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above?

          "text": "From Magnus Eze and Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu\n\nAhead of political parties\u2019 primaries for the 2023 general elections, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has disclosed that it would next week commence screening for a consensus aspirant to be supported for the Presidency from the South East.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the body, Chief Alex Ogbonnia who disclosed this a chat with Saturday Sun, said the apex Igbo socio-cultural body had delayed action on the issue because people were still purchasing the expression of interest and nomination forms of their various parties.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nOgbonnia said Ohanaeze would not allow its sons and daughters take suicidal actions in the primaries of the political parties by fielding several aspirants.\n\nFour of the presidential aspirants from the zone on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), namely: Anyim Pius Anyim, Peter Obi, Sam Ohuabunwa, Dr. Nwachukwu Anakwenze, had in a surprise move in Abuja on April 9, agreed to fight as a bloc for the party\u2019s ticket.\n\nAfter their meeting, the quartet agreed to fight as a team and throw their weight behind any of them that is eventually best favoured.\n\nGiving indications on the plans and efforts of Ohanaeze Ndigbo in actualizing a President of Igbo origin next year, Ogbonnia said: \u201cBy next week we will begin to look into the issue of consensus. Having a consensus will not be a problem because the people we are going to screen are all Igbo sons and daughters, so we already know them. We have their track records.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t allow a cocoon of three or four Igbo contesting against one person from the north in a political party because that will be suicidal.\u201d\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nOhanaeze, he said, was waiting for the aspirants to conclude buying forms so that they would be able to know who the actual aspirants are and the political parties they intend to pursue their ambition.\n\n\u201cWe have not zeroed in on consensus because people are still buying forms. Just the other day we learnt that Chris Ngige and Ken Nnamani have joined the race in the APC and we are happy with that.\n\n\u201cRecall that Ohanaeze had urged more political chieftains from the South East to throw their hats into the ring for the Presidency of Nigeria because it is our turn. So, we are going to prune down the number and settle for certain qualities we are looking for,\u201d the Ohanaeze spokesman said.\n\nSpeakers at the civic reception organized by the Imo State Government for the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, George Obiozor, urged him (Obiozor) to, as a matter of urgency, convene a meeting of the Ime Obi Ohanaeze, so that they would give him the mandate to pronounce the position of Ndigbo on the 2023 Presidency.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nThe host, Governor Hope Uzodimma stated that beyond the merriments, the occasion provided opportunity for the Igbo to talk about their position in Nigeria, do a quick review and commence the process of self-rediscovery.\n\nHe noted: \u201cWhat cannot be taken away is that for too long Igbo have cried out profusely over their plight. This plight is comparable to the plight of the South-West over the annulment of the June 12 elections.\n\n\u201cFollowing that annulment, the South-West felt short-changed. They cried out for justice. While some groups did so responsibly, others resorted to violence. The instructive thing here is that at a point, the patriotic zeal in the political class in Nigeria was touched and they rose in unison to acknowledge that the Yoruba had cried enough and that it was time to wipe their tears.\n\n\u201cIt is now obvious from every indication that Ndigbo have also cried enough about their marginalization. It should also be clear to the political class that the time has come to wipe these historical tears of Ndigbo. What is more, most of the patriots who engineered the plan that made the South-West produce the presidential candidates for the two major political parties in 1999 are still alive and active in politics.\n\n\u201cThat same undying love for the country that inspired them to do what they did for the South-West in 1999, should inspire them to do the same for the South-East in 2023.\u201d\n\nNoting that Ndigbo had paid enough price in Nigeria, elder statesman, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu said the outcome of the 2023 elections as it relates to the Igbo, would determine the future of Nigeria.\n\nIn the same manner, immediate past President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo told Obiozor that \u201cWe have those who can fight this war; you\u2019re at a moment in history, exercise your mandate.\u201d\n\nOn the Nigerian question, Obiozor said that the diversity of the country has been grossly mismanaged, noting that the upcoming presidential election provides an excellent opportunity to redress any sense of exclusion or marginalization felt by people of South East zone over the years.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason that I call on all political parties in the country, to zone the Presidency to the South East,\u201d he counselled.\n\nMeanwhile, regarding Ohanaeze reaching out to people from other zones, Ogbonnia said: \u201cWe have done that but that is not enough, we will continue the lobbying next week, reaching out to other regions. They have the moral burden of supporting of demand.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n\u2018I cannot tell you I\u2019m declaring; the political process is ongoing\u2019\n\nAdedayo Akinwale\n\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan yesterday in Abuja came under intense pressure from his supporters, urging him to contest for president in 2023 and he did not disappoint, telling them that \u201cthe political process is ongoing; just watch out. just watch out.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe supporters, comprising largely women and youths, stormed the Jonathan Foundation\u2019s Abuja office, chanting his name, forcing him to come out to address them.\n\n\n\nThe former president acknowledged that youths wanted him to contest for President in 2023, but told the supporters that he could not, for now, tell Nigerians whether he would be contesting and that his final decision would manifest very soon.\n\n\n\nJonathan said: \u201cI cannot declare because some processes are still ongoing. Yes, you are calling me to come and declare for the next election. I cannot tell you I\u2019m declaring, the political process is ongoing. Just watch out. The key thing you must do is to pray that Nigeria gets somebody that carries young people along, somebody that can also work very hard to see that some of the problems raised are tackled.\n\n\n\n\u201cI sincerely appreciate the youths of Nigeria. For you to come this morning in this manner shows clearly that the youth are interested in politics.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have always wanted the youth to get involved in politics. And luckily, the Not Too Young to Run Act has made it very clear that young people can contest almost every position in the country. So, we continue to encourage you to get involved in the political process.\u201d\n\n\n\nJonathan noted that the country was facing challenges, saying that some of the challenges started a long time ago, stressing that he believed in the interest of young people and that the challenges would be dealt with.\n\nThe supporters, who demanded the return of Jonathan as President in 2023, arrived in four buses and displayed placards at Jonathan\u2019s Taraba Close, Maitama office.\n\n\n\nSome of the placards read, \u201cGoodluck declare now\u201d; \u201cWe are sorry, Goodluck don\u2019t abandon us, come back\u201d; \u201cGoodluck please come\u201d; and \u201cGoodluck we love you\u201d, among others.\n\n\n\nA spokesman for the supporters, Mayor Samuel, who is also the convener of the Youth Compatriots of Nigeria, said, \u201cWe were deceived and brainwashed by those who claimed they could do it in 2015.\n\n\u201cNow, we know better, under Jonathan the minimum wage could buy one or two bags of rice. What do we have today? We are begging President Jonathan to forgive us, we have realised our mistakes, we want him back to complete what he started.\u201d\n\n\n\nSamuel admitted that they were deceived to believe that the administration of Jonathan was bad and that they were out in their numbers to seek Jonathan\u2019s forgiveness.\n\n\n\nHe noted that they had realised their mistake and that the \u201csaboteurs\u201d that came after him were empty.\n\nSamuel adds: \u201cWe are here to say sir, forgive us, come and lead us again. We are calling on you to come and take the mantle of leadership in 2023. Nigeria is in comatose. Please answer this call, the youth are here, the women are here, the children are here, pregnant women are here, please hear their cry.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are here to call on our former president. Nigeria is in a state of no return, it is in a state of comatose, which is why we are here calling on him to declare.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll we need is a leader that will not discriminate, a Nigerian that will work for the South-South, South-east, South-west, and the north.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Transformation agenda was working until the saboteurs came to deceive us, to brainwash us. Now we have realised that those that deceived us are empty and have nothing to offer.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe want Jonathan to run under the Nigeria Peoples Party. Any party that gives a ticket to Jonathan is a party of the masses, the party of the downtrodden and that\u2019s the party we will support.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of the women speakers, Ms. Angela Obi said they were tired of the administration of President Buhari and called on Jonathan to come back.\n\n\n\nShe said: \u201cWe are dying, hunger wants to kill us, we are tired, please come back, we are suffering, we have no food to eat, we have no water, we need you back.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso speaking on behalf of women, Ms. Ngozi Okafor said since the former president left office in 2015, both men and women had been suffering.\n\n\n\nShe said, \u201cChildren are dying, we are tired. We have turned to beggars, women are begging, children are begging. We don\u2019t need Baba Buhari again.

I think that one of the most important things is that the country needs people, those who have feelings for the common person; people who deeply care about the common man.\u201d\n\nWhile praising the Olubadan for always being a lover of the common people, even before he ascended the throne, he said: \u201cno matter in whatever shape of form, even as Kabiyesi, you are still going to be the Kabiyesi of the common man, Kabiyesi of the people.\u201d\n\nAccording to the vice president, the people of Ibadan are not only blessed with an intellectual but one who cares for the people.\n\nOsinbajo said: \u201cAs the Olubadan, Your Royal Majesty, you are a great gift to the people of Ibadan and also to us as a nation. I pray that your years will be very long and that all the people of this great city, kingdom will feel the impact, and that they will all know that you are someone who cares about them.\n\n\u201cAs you know, on April 11, 2022, I declared my intention to run for the presidency of our great land under the flag of our party, the great party, the All Progressives Congress. I did so while taking into account the fact that our country needs all of those who are willing to serve it to the best of their capacity and knowledge.\n\n\u201cWith great humility and sincerity, I come to your majesty, that after serving about seven years as Vice President, and also as acting, under our President, President Muhammadu Buhari, who truly gave me every opportunity; he opened up doors in a way that most deputies may not have experienced, and entrusting a lot to my care, including very sensitive positions.\n\n\u201cAfter all of that, I felt that it would be the right thing to do, to make that experience available to the people of our country. By the grace of God and the will of the people, if I am voted in as the President come 2023, I believe that there is so much to do. The desire of our hearts is that our country will be much greater and will be able to attain all of the great potentials of our people.\u201d\n\nDescribing the monarch as a \u201cfather of all,\u201d Osinbajo thanked him for the warm reception, noting that he will always covet the Olubadan\u2019s \u201cprayers and good wishes all the time.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cYou can be sure that wherever I am and in whatever situation I am, I hold you in the highest esteem, I will always continuously support whatever it is that you want to do, either for yourself or the great people of Ibadan.\u201d\n\nThe Olubadan described the Vice President as \u201ca wonderful human being, a wonderful person,\n\n\u201cHopefully, in God\u2019s name, you will be President of Nigeria,\u201d he told the VP, adding that \u201cmay Allah grant you success on what you have in mind, may Allah support you. I can spend the next two hours just praying for you.\u201d\n\nIbadan High Chiefs present also expressed their support for the Vice President\u2019s aspirations, declaring that \u201cwe are with you.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeeting with APC Stakeholders\n\nOsinbajo later departed the palace to interact with APC leaders and delegates in Oyo State at an impressive event where his speech was often interrupted with singing as the audience kept bursting out in festive renditions of different political lyrics welcoming the VP\u2019s emergence and expressions of support for him.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the seven years that I have been involved, because the President considered it the right thing to do and, in his generosity, and openness, he gave me every opportunity to serve, including sensitive international assignments.\n\n\u201cAs you know, I also acted as President during certain periods when the President was away and everything I learnt as acting President has prepared me to run as President of our country.\n\n\u201cGod doesn\u2019t make mistakes. God is deliberate in everything He does and by giving me all of these opportunities to understand governance for myself at the highest level of our country, all of it was not just so that I can sit down and write a memoir, no, it was to come handy one day and I believe the time has come.\n\n\u201cI believe that the time has come and I have the responsibility to my country, to you, to all our children and the coming generations to give all of what I have learnt, everything I have learnt, all of the services to be able to give it to our country. To serve our country faithfully and honestly is my intention.\n\n\u201cOne advantage I would have is that on day one, I can hit the ground running because I know what it takes.\u201d\n\nOther speakers at the event included Senator Teslim Folarin, Chief Niyi Akintola, Chief Jacob Tilley-Gyado and the APC Chairman in Oyo State Hon. Isaac Ajiboye Omodewu, who all expressed support for the Vice President\u2019s aspiration.\n\nAccording to Akintola, \u201cWhen it comes to the candidacy of Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, there are no factions at all.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President, who travelled with a number of National Assembly members from Abuja, was received by the Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Engr. Rauf Olaniyan at the Ibadan airport. The Deputy Governor also joined the vice president for the visit to the Olubadan.\n\nMembers of the National Assembly with the Vice President besides Folarin, included Senator Adamu Bukkachuwa, Kola Balogun, Fatahu Muhammad, Odebunmi Olusegun, Shehu Saleh Rijau and Karu Simon.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State has pulled out of the drive by the northern Peoples Democratic Party to produce consensus candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThis came just as news emerged that former Senate President Bukola Saraki and Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed had emerged PDP consensus candidates for the North.\n\nA statement by the Tambuwal Campaign Organization (TCO) Friday said the team met on Wednesday at Bauchi Governor\u2019s Lodge in Abuja for a review and unanimously agreed that the consensus arrangement was not working.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Gov Tambuwal has submitted his Presidential nomination forms and now that the quest for a consensus candidate out of the four has clearly collapsed, will go ahead and face screening and indeed contest the PDP presidential primaries.\u201d\n\nWith the latest development, Tambuwal will join former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, who had earlier rejected the consensus drive, and other PDP aspirants to vie for the party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nThe statement read: The attention of Tambuwal Campaign Organization (TCO) has been drawn to a news item that former Senate President, Bukola Saraki and Gov. Bala Muhammad of Bauchi state have emerged as consensus candidates from amongst the four of us announced at a meeting in Minna, Niger state.\n\n\u201cThis is, to be candid and forthright, not correct.The correct situation is that the team met on Wednesday 20th April, 2022, at Bauchi Governor\u2019s lodge in Abuja and had a review meeting; and, unanimously agreed that the consensus arrangement was not working.\n\n\u201cThe team further agreed that Sen. Saraki should come up with a draft statement on how to communicate this decision to the Nigerian public. This was the last time that members of the team sat and mutually agreed on anything. The proposed meeting to review and vet the statement scheduled for 10 pm of the same day was aborted unilaterally by Sen. Saraki via a WhatsApp message.\n\n\u201cHowever, on Thursday, 21st, 2022, same Sen Saraki circulated yet another WhatsApp message suggesting that members of the team should head to Minna for a meeting on Friday, Gov. Tambuwal reached other members of the team and informed them that he stands by the decision of the team that the initiative is not working. This is the reason Gov. Tambuwal was absent at today\u2019s (Friday) meeting in Minna. As a result therefore, the outcome of the Minna meeting has no consequence or any implication on the aspiration of Gov. Tambuwal, who had earlier on informed his colleagues of maintaining their agreed position that the initiative has collapsed.\n\n\u201cMembers of the public should be reminded that what was canvassed for was a consensus candidate and not consensus candidates.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Gov Tambuwal has submitted his Presidential nomination forms and now that the quest for a consensus candidate out of the four has clearly collapsed, will go ahead and face screening and indeed contest the PDP presidential primaries.\n\n\u201cThis is in consonance with his acclaimed outlook as a pan-Nigerian candidate, with pedigree of national service as the Speaker of the Federal House of Representatives, life member of the Body of Benchers and now in his second and final term as Governor of Sokoto state.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Buhari: Military Not Doing Enough to End Insecurity Despite Logistics Provided",
          "text": "\n\n*Fears situation may linger except citizens offer information*Orders release of kidnapped Kaduna train passengers\n\n*IG justifies police presence in South-east, says attacks on officers no longer tolerated\n\nDeji Elumoye and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nIn a clear indictment, a disappointed President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, told the security agencies that they were not doing enough to end the security challenges in the country, despite enormous logistics provided by his administration.\n\nBuhari frowned on the fact that his previous directives to the military to end insecurity in the country had not yielded much results.\n\nHe directed all the operational and intelligence agencies to rescue unhurt, all persons kidnapped by terrorists, including those in the recent Kaduna-bound train.\n\nThat was as the the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, explained the basis for heavy security presence in the South-east, saying the police would no longer tolerate attacks on their men.\n\nNational Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), expressed the president\u2019s reservation while speaking with newsmen yesterday after a three-and-a-half hour meeting of the National Security Council at the State House, Abuja, presided by Buhari.\n\nMonguno said there was no way the president would be happy, when people were being killed on a daily basis. He said the last straw was the recent attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train, which led to the death of some passengers, with scores kidnapped.\n\nThe NSA added that the president was of the belief that enough was not being done by the security agencies, despite the logistics being provided.\n\nMonguno stated, \u201cWe\u2019ve just concluded a sitting of the National Security Council, a three-and-a-half hour meeting, which was presided over by the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. This meeting is the first for 2022 and the meeting deliberated on several issues, at the strategic and operational levels, as well as other issues that are broader.\n\n\u201cIn his opening remarks, he (Buhari) spoke about his sadness in respect of the recent developments in the country, the recent security challenges we\u2019ve had, in particular, the incident in which several Nigerians lost their lives and many more have been taken into captivity by criminals and bandits.\n\n\u201cIf ten times something happens, ten times (we) will be unhappy and as the leader of this country, the father of the nation, he has to express his displeasure. You know, he is just at the managerial level, he gives us instructions.\n\n\u201cAnd his displeasure is probably, because he feels enough is not being done. So, we can\u2019t put this thing on his shoulders completely. He\u2019s at the strategic level, he takes the decisions. But when these things become endless, he has to express concern. And that\u2019s just what he did.\n\n\u201cMr. President has directed all the operational and intelligence elements to rescue these innocent people immediately and unhurt. This is the basis, which other issues were discussed. Obviously, the Chief of Defense Staff, and the service chiefs, as well as the Inspector-General of Police, all briefed the President on the occurrences in their respective organisations.\u201d\n\nThe NSA stressed that the president alone could not be blamed for the insecurity in the country, saying his part is to make strategic decisions, which the NSA said he has been doing even though he said that the military has secured the nation\u2019s maritime domain.\n\nMonguno said, \u201cI submitted a memo to council and my recommendations are being looked into by the president. My recommendations are wide ranging and they touch on all aspects of security, starting with the level of security of our land borders, as well as within the country itself.\n\n\u201cIn terms of securing the nation, we\u2019ve recorded a lot of successes in the maritime domain and obviously, the problem now has shifted to our borders from outside. As a result of that, there\u2019s a need for us to configure how we\u2019re going to make our borders more secure because of the threats coming from outside the borders.\u201d\n\nMonguno said the surrendering of Boko Haram elements, especially in the North-east, had not engendered the desired result in stemming insurgency in the country, as the threat had shifted to the Northwest and North Central.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNow, the issue in the North-east, there\u2019s been a lot of improvement and that has been attested to by the governor of Borno State during our last National Council of State meeting. But, nevertheless, the fact that the North-east is becoming much more stable, more and more people from the terrorists have started surrendering to government, has not really brought to an end the way we would want the situation in the country, because the threat is now shifted from the North-east, to the North-west and to the North-central, and this threat has to be contained.\n\n\u201cIt has to be contained collectively by both the armed forces as well as the constabulary forces: the Nigeria Police, Civil Defense, but the intelligence agencies also have been directed to enhance the acquisition of intelligence.\u201d\n\nThe NSA stressed the imperative of intelligence from ordinary citizens as he noted that unless the wider society was willing to provide the necessary intelligence, the problem of insecurity would linger beyond the time frame intended to end menace.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe present situation in the country calls for collective effort by all, not just those that have been charged with the responsibility of physically securing the country, the most important thing for now is acquisition of intelligence and the type of intelligence that is needed is human intelligence and I need to make it very clear.\n\n\u201cI have to be very honest; unless the wider society, right down to the local governments, are willing to give the type of information that is needed to block the activities of these criminals, this situation will continue to linger beyond whatever timeframe we\u2019re looking at, towards ending this great problem.\n\n\u201cA lot of lives are being lost, the president is not happy about this situation, he\u2019s made it very clear. The first assignment he\u2019s given to the security agencies, especially, the armed forces and the police is to rescue those that are in captivity, not just those that were captured during the last train incident, but those that have been in captivity in other parts of the country. That is the first thing that has to be done.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, my memo dwells on the prevailing situation within the security outfits; their needs, their challenges and the President has decided to look into these things and might as well call for another meeting in the near future.\u201d\n\nOn why the country had not deplored technology to tackle the menace of terrorism and banditry, Monguno said effort was being made to deploy technology to tackle insecurity but submitted that the required technology was expensive and would take time to acquire.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe first question has to do with, why is it so difficult to deploy technology. One, technology is expensive. Technology takes time to acquire these things, since inherently we do not produce these very, very delicate equipment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if the government is not making any effort to acquire but we need to know who to acquire this technology from, where, when and there are certain processes. For now, I know we have, but the plight is that they are inadequate, so, to the government, it\u2019s a continuous process. That\u2019s what I can say about the issue of deploying technology.\u201d\n\nOn alleged sabotage within the military in the fight against terrorism, Monguno said the possibility of having rogue elements could not be ruled out.\n\nAsked whether he would draw a correlation between the threats from the border and the level of insecurity in the country and whether there was any suggestion that foreigners might have been responsible for the insecurity in the country, he said, \u201cObviously, we have very extensive borders, and I\u2019m not going to deceive anyone.\n\n\u201cAll of us know that we have problems of infiltration by virtue of the fact that we have a very large economy. It attracts a lot of people from outside and they come in illegally, not just through the land borders, but also through the maritime waters.\n\n\u201cOf course, in the case of the maritime borders, most of things have been done in the last one year, to secure the maritime domain up to the point that the International Maritime Bureau has acknowledged the fact that in 27 years, our maritime borders have not been as secure and peaceful as they were in the last one year.\n\n\u201cThat is a fact; it\u2019s not a conjecture. I didn\u2019t cook up this thing. So, we want to see how we can replicate that type of efforts to put in the maritime domain on our land borders. That is something that counsel is looking into.\u201d\n\nThe IGP addressed the question of massive police presence in South-east. Baba said, \u201cI think the question is about deployment. Deployment is being determined by a lot of issues or yardsticks.\n\n\u201cJust like two states may have different number of local governments, so also there can be different number of formations in that state or in that formation. We have formations, we have commands, we have zonal commands and so forth. So, deployment should not be based on either size or number of persons or threat assessment tool in that place.\n\n\u201cIt is all about how you police a particular place based on the number of people you have, based also on your ability to gather that manpower. If your command, for instance, Kaduna command has, let\u2019s say 3000 personnel. For now, I know already that 3,000 personnel cannot take care of Kaduna.\n\n\u201cWhat we normally do is to deploy from other states to come and complement the efforts of Kaduna by what we are calling, let\u2019s say, special duty. We can take from states, where we feel the threat is not as eminent or as bad as what they have in Kaduna, so that you can complement Kaduna. So, also you can complement Imo, Anambra. It\u2019s based on your threat analysis.\u201d\n\nTo that extent, Baba, has warned that the police high command would no longer tolerate incessant killing of police officers in the country especially, the South-east.\n\nHe condemned the recent spate of attacks on police officers, facilities and other police operational assets across the country.\n\nA statement by Force Headquarters, consequently, ordered the immediate deployment of additional operational assets to complement officers and men attached to Operation Restore Peace in the South-east and other operations launched with the aim of flushing out criminal elements, who hide under the guise of aggrieved citizens to perpetrate criminal acts.\n\n\u201cThe IG warned that attacks on police officers in the line of duty would no longer be tolerated under whatever guise as the force holds the lives of its personnel sacrosanct and such unwarranted attacks would be strictly treated in accordance with extant laws,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement also said the IG reiterated the commitment of the force to protection of lives and property, while stressing that it was vital to respect the lives and fundamental rights of police officers and other security operatives, in order to enable them advance their sacred mandate of serving and protecting the citizens better.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Mohammed Bello Koko, the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) bought a house worth \u00a31,750,000 in the United Kingdom in 2015, a document seen by SaharaReporters has revealed.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the Kebbi state-born banker was the Zenith Bank accounts officer to Rivers state government when Rotimi Amaechi was governor.\n\nMohammed Bello Koko\n\nHe had worked in the banking circles in Rivers for a long time, rising to become deputy regional manager at Zenith Bank Plc.\n\nIn 2016, the 53-year-old Bello-Koko was appointed executive Director of NPA after he proceeded on a leave of absence from the bank in 2015.\n\nHe was in charge of finance and admin under the sacked MD, Hadiza Bala-Usman.\n\nThe document seen by SaharaReporters showed that the mansion located at 2A Beech Hill, Barnet, Greater London, EN4 0JP was bought by Bello-Koko on November 06, 2015, at \u00a31,750,000.\n\nThe 7-bedroom freehold detached house is currently ranked as the 11th most expensive property in EN4 0JP, with a valuation of \u00a32,274,000.\n\n\u201cSince it last sold in November 2015 for \u00a31,750,000, its value has increased by \u00a3524,000,\u201d an estate developer website, The Move Market said.\n\n\u201c2A Beech Hill, Barnet has 3 transactions recorded with HM Land Registry - its market value today is \u00a32,274,000.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Ports Authority\u2019s Managing Director, Koko Exposed By Anti-graft Agency, EFCC For Receiving N829million As Kickbacks, Engaging In Money Laundering\n\n\u201cThe current owner bought the property in November 2015 for \u00a31,750,000 and has lived here for 5 years. Since the current owner purchased the property, its value has increased by \u00a3524,000 (29.9%).\n\n\u201cThe previous owner had the property for 4 years, having purchased it in October 2011 for \u00a31,200,000.\n\n\u201cDuring this time, the price rose by \u00a3550,000 (45.8%), which equates to it increasing in value by 9.7% each year. The property turned out to be a really good investment for the previous owner.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: How Nigerian Ports Authority Managing Director, Koko Bought \u00a31.75Million Mansion In London While \u2018S... by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nAnti-corruption Group Speaks\n\nMeanwhile, an anti-corruption group, 'Say No To Corruption In Nigeria' has asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to extend its searchlight on Bello-Koko and the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no more a secret that Bello-Koko was Amaechi\u2019s account officer for years. He has been a crony for Amaechi\u2019s corrupt practices,\u201d the coordinator of the group, Ahmed Abubakar said.\n\n\u201cHow will it be that in 2015, Bello-Koko acquired a property worth \u00a31,750,000 in the United Kingdom, a few months after Amaechi left office as governor and him being his account officer?\n\n\u201cHis last position in Zenith Bank before he went on leave was deputy regional manager, how was he able to afford a house of that amount in 2015? These are questions begging for answers.\n\n\u201cThis man was in charge of finance and admin under Bala-Usman in NPA then. Under normal circumstances, he should be the primary target for the probe that sacked the woman. After all, the allegations investigated fell directly under his department.\u201d\n\nAbubakar added, \u201cAs Nigerians prepare for the elections, it is critical that the world pays significant attention to the ongoing campaigns to determine who becomes the President of Nigeria come May 2023. While many candidates appear to have the right pedigree to be seeking this exalted office, Rotimi Amaechi stands out as too decidedly corrupt and morally bankrupt to be doing so.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmaechi served as Speaker of Rivers State (an oil-rich state in Southern Nigeria) for 8 years and went on to serve as governor of the state for another 8 years. For the past 7 years, he has been Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Transportation.\n\n\u201cDuring these 23 years, Amaechi has become a master of awarding dubious contracts to phoney companies, for non-existent jobs, often to political cronies, who it appears, served as his own purses for the proceeds of these contracts.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmaechi\u2019s pattern of corruption reared its head recently in the wake of the unfortunate attack on a train travelling between Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital city, and Kaduna, a critical metropolis in the Northwest of the country. During his inspection of the damage, he blamed the current government, of which he is a member of the Executive, for moving too slowly to award the contract he had pushed for securing the rail lines.\n\n\u201cThe very next day, minutes from that Executive Council Meeting were released to show that Mr. Amaechi had intended to award the contract worth N3.7 billion (about $8.5 million) to a company that was registered only two years ago with no prior record of security jobs, and a turnover of less than $190,000. It is on the basis of these questionable details that the proposal was denied.\n\n\n\n\u201cSad as this episode might be for Nigerians given the loss of lives on that train attack and the continuing hostage of many of the passengers on that train, this pattern of fictitious contracting is one that Mr. Amaechi appears to have unfortunately mastered to perfection. And it is one that Nigerians should be aware of and as such, not reward him with the highest office in their country.\n\n\n\n\u201cDuring his term as governor of Rivers State, Amaechi routinely broke his own procurement laws and awarded contracts involving large sums of money to many questionable causes and invisible services. Using several personal and corporate proxies, hundreds of billions of Rivers State taxpayers' monies were simply siphoned off the state\u2019s coffers by his cronies.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor example, Amaechi\u2019s government awarded a contract and paid a company named Magnum and Hunter Limited received several hundreds of millions from the Rivers State Sport Ministry Account Number 0006786960 in a leading Nigerian Bank. Yet, a search of this company in Nigeria\u2019s Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) suggests the company is not registered and has no track record upon which that contract should have been awarded.\n\n\n\n\u201cSimilarly, a few weeks after Lemaco Engineering Limited was registered in Port-Harcourt, the State capital, the government awarded it a lucrative contract for which it received almost N850 million from the Rivers State Sports Ministry\u2019s account in the same bank. A search on CAC\u2019s website indicates the current status of this company is now unknown. Unsurprisingly, and in line with Amaechi\u2019s modus operandi, Lemaco Engineering Limited was floated by his close confidant, Victor Giadom, who for several years served as a critical cabinet member in Amaechi\u2019s government.\n\n\n\n\u201cMany other contracts were awarded like Lemaco\u2019s in which the companies are formed hurriedly by apparent cronies, they receive a huge contract, monies are paid upfront, with no discernible goods supplied, services rendered or benefits received for the citizens of the State. Such companies and deals include ones given to Opriala Integrated Services which received N103 million, Faribo Nigeria Limited which got over N920 million, Klear Image Limited, which received N216 million, and Tawfik Engineering Limited which received N143 million from the River State Ministry of Works.\n\n\u201cA search of these companies in CAC\u2019s database indicates they do not exist and may have been Special Purpose Vehicles in a grand scheme of money laundering and corruption. Another pattern of transactions that pervaded his time as Governor were basically huge sums of payments in cash to individuals. These transactions appeared fraudulent because they were not only conducted in cash but with no descriptions whatsoever for their benefits to the taxpayers Mr. Amaechi swore to serve.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor example, in a single day and for no recorded purpose, a senior official of the Finance Ministry named J. P. Brown made cash withdrawals of N10 million each totalling N950 million from the Rivers State Sub Treasury Pension Account Number 6010944734 in a first-rate commercial bank. At the time of this withdrawal, the main account officer of Rivers State was a gentleman named Mohammed Bello-Koko, who was later arrested and imprisoned by Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency.\n\n\u201cOnce Amaechi became a powerful Minister, he worked out his release and made Mr. Bello-Koko an Executive Director in charge of Finance at the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), an agency under Mr. Amaechi\u2019s Transportation Ministry. As a reward for continued cooperation and connivance for such corrupt deals, Mr. Amaechi recently ensured the promotion of Mr. Bello-Koko to the post of CEO of the NPA. A forthcoming essay will expose such recent deals at the NPA.\n\n\n\n\u201cSimilar to the withdrawal above, Amaechi presided over many such cash withdrawals from the state\u2019s treasury by cronies and friends. In August 2012, an individual named Atu Komily received a cash payment of N110 million in tranches of N10 million each from the Deputy Governor\u2019s Overhead Account Number 5030000382 domiciled in a mid-level Nigerian bank. The same individual received N430 million in cash payments from the same bank a few weeks later. Similarly, cash payments of N230 million and N190 million were made from the same account to Kiri Okeanyi and Mabel Worika respectively.\n\n\u201cThese withdrawals were done in tranches of N10 million and N20 million each in July 2012. Also, cash payments in tranches totalling N350 million were made to an individual named Daobu Harry in September 2012 from the Rivers State Sports Ministry Account Number 5030032978 in the same mid-level Nigerian bank.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a brazen display of corruption, impunity and non-accountability, such transactions became the order of business throughout Mr. Amaechi\u2019s tenure as governor. Similar cash withdrawals, with no description for work done or service rendered, were made to Bright Ezebuola (N180 million), Innocent Amadi (N120 million), Abaate Godson (N110 million), Christopher Quakers (N130 million), Leyira Pyagbara (N280 million) and J.P. Brown (N1.2 billion).\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are many other such transactions that were directly ordered by Mr. Amaechi and marked \u201cExecutive Governor\u2019s Office totalling over N98 billion in one bank alone that will be the subject of another essay.\n\n\u201cDespite these and many other well-documented allegations, President Buhari, who otherwise appears not to condone corruption in any guise and from anyone, continues to tolerate Mr. Amaechi, leading many to suspect he may be doing something for the President\u2019s inner circle who are protecting him.\n\n\n\n\u201cRegardless of what the President or anti-graft agencies might do with these verifiable information, it is important that Nigerian voters are aware of Mr. Amaechi\u2019s pattern of governance, which is riddled with opacity, cronyism, and corruption.\u201d\n\n\n\nPandora Papers\n\nMeanwhile, a Pandora Papers in 2021 revealed that Bello-Koko was behind two shell companies incorporated in a tax haven to anonymously invest in the United Kingdom property market.\n\nThis potentially violates Nigeria\u2019s public service code of conduct laws.\n\nPandora Papers also disclosed that he and his wife, Agatha Anne Koko, enlisted the services of financial secrecy seller, Cook Worldwide and Alem\u00e1n, Cordero, Galindo & Lee (Alcogal), an offshore law firm, to register Coulwood Limited (reg. number: 1487897) and Marney Limited (reg. number: 1487944) in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), one of the world\u2019s most commonly used tax havens, in 2008. Both companies were registered on the same day, June 19, 2008.\n\nThough a public servant, Bello-Koko is also a director of the two companies, in violation of Nigeria\u2019s Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act (Sections 5 and 6).\n\nPandora Papers project is led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).",

          "text": "Mohammed Bello Koko, the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) bought a house worth \u00a31,750,000 in the United Kingdom in 2015, a document seen by SaharaReporters has revealed.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the Kebbi state-born banker was the Zenith Bank accounts officer to Rivers state government when Rotimi Amaechi was governor.\n\nMohammed Bello Koko\n\nHe had worked in the banking circles in Rivers for a long time, rising to become deputy regional manager at Zenith Bank Plc.\n\nIn 2016, the 53-year-old Bello-Koko was appointed executive Director of NPA after he proceeded on a leave of absence from the bank in 2015.\n\nHe was in charge of finance and admin under the sacked MD, Hadiza Bala-Usman.\n\nThe document seen by SaharaReporters showed that the mansion located at 2A Beech Hill, Barnet, Greater London, EN4 0JP was bought by Bello-Koko on November 06, 2015, at \u00a31,750,000.\n\nThe 7-bedroom freehold detached house is currently ranked as the 11th most expensive property in EN4 0JP, with a valuation of \u00a32,274,000.\n\n\u201cSince it last sold in November 2015 for \u00a31,750,000, its value has increased by \u00a3524,000,\u201d an estate developer website, The Move Market said.\n\n\u201c2A Beech Hill, Barnet has 3 transactions recorded with HM Land Registry - its market value today is \u00a32,274,000.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Ports Authority\u2019s Managing Director, Koko Exposed By Anti-graft Agency, EFCC For Receiving N829million As Kickbacks, Engaging In Money Laundering\n\n\u201cThe current owner bought the property in November 2015 for \u00a31,750,000 and has lived here for 5 years. Since the current owner purchased the property, its value has increased by \u00a3524,000 (29.9%).\n\n\u201cThe previous owner had the property for 4 years, having purchased it in October 2011 for \u00a31,200,000.\n\n\u201cDuring this time, the price rose by \u00a3550,000 (45.8%), which equates to it increasing in value by 9.7% each year. The property turned out to be a really good investment for the previous owner.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: How Nigerian Ports Authority Managing Director, Koko Bought \u00a31.75Million Mansion In London While \u2018S... by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nAnti-corruption Group Speaks\n\nMeanwhile, an anti-corruption group, 'Say No To Corruption In Nigeria' has asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to extend its searchlight on Bello-Koko and the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no more a secret that Bello-Koko was Amaechi\u2019s account officer for years. He has been a crony for Amaechi\u2019s corrupt practices,\u201d the coordinator of the group, Ahmed Abubakar said.\n\n\u201cHow will it be that in 2015, Bello-Koko acquired a property worth \u00a31,750,000 in the United Kingdom, a few months after Amaechi left office as governor and him being his account officer?\n\n\u201cHis last position in Zenith Bank before he went on leave was deputy regional manager, how was he able to afford a house of that amount in 2015? These are questions begging for answers.\n\n\u201cThis man was in charge of finance and admin under Bala-Usman in NPA then. Under normal circumstances, he should be the primary target for the probe that sacked the woman. After all, the allegations investigated fell directly under his department.\u201d\n\nAbubakar added, \u201cAs Nigerians prepare for the elections, it is critical that the world pays significant attention to the ongoing campaigns to determine who becomes the President of Nigeria come May 2023. While many candidates appear to have the right pedigree to be seeking this exalted office, Rotimi Amaechi stands out as too decidedly corrupt and morally bankrupt to be doing so.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmaechi served as Speaker of Rivers State (an oil-rich state in Southern Nigeria) for 8 years and went on to serve as governor of the state for another 8 years. For the past 7 years, he has been Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Transportation.\n\n\u201cDuring these 23 years, Amaechi has become a master of awarding dubious contracts to phoney companies, for non-existent jobs, often to political cronies, who it appears, served as his own purses for the proceeds of these contracts.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmaechi\u2019s pattern of corruption reared its head recently in the wake of the unfortunate attack on a train travelling between Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital city, and Kaduna, a critical metropolis in the Northwest of the country. During his inspection of the damage, he blamed the current government, of which he is a member of the Executive, for moving too slowly to award the contract he had pushed for securing the rail lines.\n\n\u201cThe very next day, minutes from that Executive Council Meeting were released to show that Mr. Amaechi had intended to award the contract worth N3.7 billion (about $8.5 million) to a company that was registered only two years ago with no prior record of security jobs, and a turnover of less than $190,000. It is on the basis of these questionable details that the proposal was denied.\n\n\n\n\u201cSad as this episode might be for Nigerians given the loss of lives on that train attack and the continuing hostage of many of the passengers on that train, this pattern of fictitious contracting is one that Mr. Amaechi appears to have unfortunately mastered to perfection. And it is one that Nigerians should be aware of and as such, not reward him with the highest office in their country.\n\n\n\n\u201cDuring his term as governor of Rivers State, Amaechi routinely broke his own procurement laws and awarded contracts involving large sums of money to many questionable causes and invisible services. Using several personal and corporate proxies, hundreds of billions of Rivers State taxpayers' monies were simply siphoned off the state\u2019s coffers by his cronies.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor example, Amaechi\u2019s government awarded a contract and paid a company named Magnum and Hunter Limited received several hundreds of millions from the Rivers State Sport Ministry Account Number 0006786960 in a leading Nigerian Bank. Yet, a search of this company in Nigeria\u2019s Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) suggests the company is not registered and has no track record upon which that contract should have been awarded.\n\n\n\n\u201cSimilarly, a few weeks after Lemaco Engineering Limited was registered in Port-Harcourt, the State capital, the government awarded it a lucrative contract for which it received almost N850 million from the Rivers State Sports Ministry\u2019s account in the same bank. A search on CAC\u2019s website indicates the current status of this company is now unknown. Unsurprisingly, and in line with Amaechi\u2019s modus operandi, Lemaco Engineering Limited was floated by his close confidant, Victor Giadom, who for several years served as a critical cabinet member in Amaechi\u2019s government.\n\n\n\n\u201cMany other contracts were awarded like Lemaco\u2019s in which the companies are formed hurriedly by apparent cronies, they receive a huge contract, monies are paid upfront, with no discernible goods supplied, services rendered or benefits received for the citizens of the State. Such companies and deals include ones given to Opriala Integrated Services which received N103 million, Faribo Nigeria Limited which got over N920 million, Klear Image Limited, which received N216 million, and Tawfik Engineering Limited which received N143 million from the River State Ministry of Works.\n\n\u201cA search of these companies in CAC\u2019s database indicates they do not exist and may have been Special Purpose Vehicles in a grand scheme of money laundering and corruption. Another pattern of transactions that pervaded his time as Governor were basically huge sums of payments in cash to individuals. These transactions appeared fraudulent because they were not only conducted in cash but with no descriptions whatsoever for their benefits to the taxpayers Mr. Amaechi swore to serve.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor example, in a single day and for no recorded purpose, a senior official of the Finance Ministry named J. P. Brown made cash withdrawals of N10 million each totalling N950 million from the Rivers State Sub Treasury Pension Account Number 6010944734 in a first-rate commercial bank. At the time of this withdrawal, the main account officer of Rivers State was a gentleman named Mohammed Bello-Koko, who was later arrested and imprisoned by Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency.\n\n\u201cOnce Amaechi became a powerful Minister, he worked out his release and made Mr. Bello-Koko an Executive Director in charge of Finance at the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), an agency under Mr. Amaechi\u2019s Transportation Ministry. As a reward for continued cooperation and connivance for such corrupt deals, Mr. Amaechi recently ensured the promotion of Mr. Bello-Koko to the post of CEO of the NPA. A forthcoming essay will expose such recent deals at the NPA.\n\n\n\n\u201cSimilar to the withdrawal above, Amaechi presided over many such cash withdrawals from the state\u2019s treasury by cronies and friends. In August 2012, an individual named Atu Komily received a cash payment of N110 million in tranches of N10 million each from the Deputy Governor\u2019s Overhead Account Number 5030000382 domiciled in a mid-level Nigerian bank. The same individual received N430 million in cash payments from the same bank a few weeks later. Similarly, cash payments of N230 million and N190 million were made from the same account to Kiri Okeanyi and Mabel Worika respectively.\n\n\u201cThese withdrawals were done in tranches of N10 million and N20 million each in July 2012. Also, cash payments in tranches totalling N350 million were made to an individual named Daobu Harry in September 2012 from the Rivers State Sports Ministry Account Number 5030032978 in the same mid-level Nigerian bank.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a brazen display of corruption, impunity and non-accountability, such transactions became the order of business throughout Mr. Amaechi\u2019s tenure as governor. Similar cash withdrawals, with no description for work done or service rendered, were made to Bright Ezebuola (N180 million), Innocent Amadi (N120 million), Abaate Godson (N110 million), Christopher Quakers (N130 million), Leyira Pyagbara (N280 million) and J.P. Brown (N1.2 billion).\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are many other such transactions that were directly ordered by Mr. Amaechi and marked \u201cExecutive Governor\u2019s Office totalling over N98 billion in one bank alone that will be the subject of another essay.\n\n\u201cDespite these and many other well-documented allegations, President Buhari, who otherwise appears not to condone corruption in any guise and from anyone, continues to tolerate Mr. Amaechi, leading many to suspect he may be doing something for the President\u2019s inner circle who are protecting him.\n\n\n\n\u201cRegardless of what the President or anti-graft agencies might do with these verifiable information, it is important that Nigerian voters are aware of Mr. Amaechi\u2019s pattern of governance, which is riddled with opacity, cronyism, and corruption.\u201d\n\n\n\nPandora Papers\n\nMeanwhile, a Pandora Papers in 2021 revealed that Bello-Koko was behind two shell companies incorporated in a tax haven to anonymously invest in the United Kingdom property market.\n\nThis potentially violates Nigeria\u2019s public service code of conduct laws.\n\nPandora Papers also disclosed that he and his wife, Agatha Anne Koko, enlisted the services of financial secrecy seller, Cook Worldwide and Alem\u00e1n, Cordero, Galindo & Lee (Alcogal), an offshore law firm, to register Coulwood Limited (reg. number: 1487897) and Marney Limited (reg. number: 1487944) in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), one of the world\u2019s most commonly used tax havens, in 2008.

          "text": "Kola Abiola, son of the late MKO Abiola, says he will not react publicly to the recent comment by his sister comparing their father to Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi.\n\nEarlier in April, Bello declared his intention to run for president on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and appointed Hafsat Abiola-Costello, one of Abiola\u2019s daughters, as the director-general of his presidential campaign organisation.\n\nThe Kogi governor\u2019s campaign slogan is \u2018Hope 2023\u2019, which is similar to the slogan used by Abiola during the 1993 presidential election campaign.\n\nSpeaking on her appointment, Hafsat had said she accepted it because the Kogi governor shares some qualities with that of her father.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut reacting to the development, Tundun Abiola \u2014 another daughter of Abiola \u2014 said Hafsat does not have the right to \u201cexploit\u201d their father\u2019s name for Bello\u2019s benefit.\n\nSpeaking on Friday when he featured on \u2018One on One\u2019, a programme on ARISE TV, Kola said he would rather not speak on the matter in public, adding that he doesn\u2019t know the Kogi governor \u201cwell enough\u201d to comment on if he deserves the comparison.\n\n\u201cMy late father, MKO, is a national brand that belongs to all Nigerians. We\u2019re the custodians of that brand and for me, as the head of the family, my response is a lot more mature. I\u2019d rather not discuss family issues publicly. That\u2019s my role. It\u2019s to protect that, and not just to protect that, but to protect what MKO himself stands for,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, I won\u2019t comment publicly on that. If I have my comments, when I see Hafsat, I\u2019ll make them directly to her or any family member that wants my comments. But publicly, I\u2019d never do that.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve come to me to ask and I\u2019ve told them what I think and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s family. I won\u2019t go public. I have to play the mature one here and that\u2019s always been my role even at my own expense, detriment, because that\u2019s the role I\u2019m meant to play.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve met Yahaya Bello one or twice. I don\u2019t know him to talk about him. I don\u2019t know him well enough. Also, he\u2019s a lot younger than I am anyway. I\u2019m not so old either, but that\u2019s that.\u201d",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

That was fun.\n\nAside from watching movies with your friends, you can attend an event, have an at-home spa day, play board or card games, plan a weekend trip, learn a skill online together, or make your own movie together.\n\nFinally, other than having dinner or lunch outside the house \u2013 which is okay \u2013 you can do a lot with your family this weekend. You can, for example, clean the house together, take a lot of pictures and eat home-cooked food, do a puzzle together, go to the beach or picnic together, or have a family movie night.\n\nI hope this helps you have a good time this weekend. Please, let me know if it does. So, today, I\u2019ll be talking about:\n\nKenya\u2019s tech ecosystem struggle with tech talents\n\nInstagram prioritises originality\n\nKenya\u2019s tech ecosystem could struggle with tech talents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle announced in 2021 that it would invest $1 billion in Africa over the next five years to ensure access to faster and cheaper Internet. Also, it wants to create useful, local products to support the entrepreneurs and small businesses that support Africa\u2019s economies.\n\nTo accomplish that, on Wednesday, April 19, 2022, Google announced the establishment of its first product development centre in Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital.\n\nHow does it plan to accomplish that? Over the next two years, Google plans to hire more than 100 people in software engineering, research, and design roles, joining Visa and Microsoft in establishing a presence in Nairobi.\n\nThis is incredible, but there is a catch. According to the Africa Developer Ecosystem Report 2021, Africa has 716,000 professional developers as of 2021, up from 700,000 in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you compare this to, say, California, United States \u2013 which has an estimated 630,000 developers \u2013 you\u2019ll see that this is a problem.\n\nWhile these figures demonstrate the scarcity of tech talent on the continent and Kenya, don\u2019t you think local startups will lose their best team to Google? Who doesn\u2019t want to work with Google? Do you see my point now?\n\nRemember that in 2019, following the opening of Microsoft\u2019s African Development Centre and the subsequent hiring push, some local startups lost their best employees to Microsoft.\n\nWhile this launch is a fantastic opportunity for Kenya, I believe it poses a threat to local startups due to the continent\u2019s scarcity of tech talent. What are your thoughts?\n\nBy the way, some Kenyan experts provided their perspectives on this, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy reading. Want to see it? Please check it here: Kenyan entrepreneurs welcome Google\u2019s product development center but could struggle to hold on to talent\n\nPlease don\u2019t forget to leave your thoughts.\n\nTABS Web3 Hackathon 2022: $2,500 in cash prizes to be won\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit is dedicated to making sense of the Web3 buzz, but we also want to reward Web3 solutions.

This would also help to prioritise the distribution of original content over reposted content in places like the Reels tab and feed.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means the social media giant will be less likely to recommend reposts of existing Reels and content from other social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok.\n\nAlso, accounts that aggregate and reshare other users\u2019 content will be less likely to be recommended by the company.\n\nWhy? According to Mosseri, the aim is to focus on the concept of originality. \u201cIf you create something from scratch, you should get more credit than if you are resharing something that you found from someone else. We\u2019re going to do more to try and value original content more, particularly compared to reposted content,\u201d he says.\n\nBut how can Instagram determine a post\u2019s originality? The CEO said in a tweet that they \u201ccan\u2019t know for sure\u201d how they can determine the original creator of a post. He did, however, explain that the company creates classifiers to predict how likely something is to be original. Also, Instagram considers who is in the video and whether the app has seen the video before.\n\nMoreover, the company has already implemented measures to reduce resharing. In February 2021, the algorithm began devaluing reshared Reels with the TikTok logo. The platform wanted people to stop posting recycled TikToks to Reels by 2021.\n\nBesides, Instagram announced that it was releasing new best practices on its @creators account to teach Instagram users how to create content that will be seen and shared.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mosseri mentioned two recent product launches: product tagging and enhanced tagging. Users will be able to tag products from businesses set up for Instagram Shopping with product tagging, which was launched this week. This feature is currently unavailable to African users.\n\nHowever, the company claims that the expansion will make it easier for people to discover products from people they follow and for businesses to grow their audience on the platform.\n\nAdditionally, the enhanced tags \u2013 which were introduced earlier in March 2022\u2013 will make it easier for creators to receive credit for their work. According to Instagram, the enhanced tags allow users to share and view a creator\u2019s specific contribution to a photo or video post.\n\nWhile reducing reshared content may initially harm some accounts, it is likely critical for Reels\u2019 long-term viability. Or what\u2019d you think?\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent.

          "title": "What you need to know as Google\u2019s Equiano cable lands In Nigeria",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle has announced the launch of Equiano, a state of the art submarine Internet cable, which is set to land in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nGoogle, alongside one of its major partners, West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), made this known today at a virtual launch event. Per reports from both companies, the cable is scheduled to land on Friday, April 29, 2022.\n\nThe Internet cable, named after Olaudah Equiano, a historical abolitionist, has a capacity of 144 terabits (18 Terabytes). Per the tech giant, it will be introducing 20 times more power and higher levels of durability than the last cable built to serve the West African region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, submarine Internet cables are one of the primary reasons you can seamlessly read this article, stream content on YouTube and Netflix, and upload content to WhatsApp and Instagram. A full explanation of how this works will probably require a short course, but don\u2019t worry. This piece and some of our upcoming articles should help it make sense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink back to 2003. Very few people had phones and computers, and accessing the Internet required buying time in cybercafes and making the most of it (coughs in overnight browsing). Even when phones became increasingly available, you would likely waste precious time loading a page with several pictures or trying to stream a video.\n\nAs more entrepreneurs increased their interest in Africa, technology began to improve. One of the landmark moments was in 2009, during the launch of the MainOne submarine cable, a private submarine cable that today spans Nigeria, Ghana, and Cote d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nSubsequently, companies like Glo and MTN launched their submarine cables in Nigeria.\n\nAs we explained in this piece, you can certainly draw parallels between these submarine cable launches and increased Internet speeds in Nigeria. With increased Internet speeds came the explosion of technology-enabled businesses, which, in turn, led to increased funding and job creation. See where we\u2019re going with this?\n\nHowever, Internet speeds in Nigeria, nay Africa, pale in comparison to other developed countries. When you look at the cost of purchasing data relative to the average income in Nigeria, you\u2019ll realise that there\u2019s still much work to be done.\n\nGoogle\u2019s submarine cable could change Nigeria\u2019s Internet experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your location, your current mobile download speed could be a little higher or lower than 18.7 Mbps. If you don\u2019t live in an urban area, it\u2019s likely to be much slower.\n\nInterestingly, if we believe Google\u2019s claim, Equiano could bring 6x much faster Internet, leaving you above or below 112 Mbps. A considerable leap when you consider several factors.\n\nIf you currently have a download speed of 18.7 Mbps, it will take you over 7 minutes to download a 1GB file. All things being equal, Google\u2019s Internet cable could help drop that download time to 1.2 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother major win could lie in the speed and efficiency of your financial transactions. You\u2019d experience less time waiting for your mobile banking app to load and, hopefully, less waiting time for credit and debit alerts.\n\nAlso, two out of four Nigerian telecom companies currently offer 1GB of mobile data at \u20a6666, but all things being equal, this could drop to \u20a6140.\n\nThese numbers alone may not do justice to this cable\u2019s possible benefits. Juliet Ehimuan, Director, West Africa at Google, believes we\u2019ll see the ripple effects in other sectors of the economy.\n\nPer Ehimuan, that means a $10.1 billion increase in Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 1.6 million indirect jobs.\n\n\u201cLook at the activities going on in Nigeria right now, even with the challenges of data costs, and Internet speeds, now imagine a situation where data prices come down by a factor of 20, and you have 6x the speed you have right now. People are going to be able to do more things, Ehimuan said in an exclusive interview with Techpoint Africa.\n\nShe points to the growing number of African content creators on YouTube and how this could help them monetise their content by attracting a global audience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also been talking about diversifying the economy, and technology provides an important way to do that where we\u2019re exporting creative content and getting foreign investment. Imagine the additional income and commercial success that we could have from 1.6 million jobs,\u201d Ehimuan said.\n\nThese benefits seem impressive, but you\u2019re probably asking yourself how they can be implemented?\n\nHow can Google fulfil its mission?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmarine cables have immense potential benefits, but we\u2019ll not see them if suitable measures are not in place to leverage their capabilities. As subsea cables arrive on the coast, terrestrial cables help to get the Internet capacity to our homes and offices.\n\nThere\u2019s a vast submarine cable capacity in Africa that still doesn\u2019t reflect on your download speeds or streaming quality.\n\nAs of 2020, Africa had a submarine cable capacity of 100 Tbps, but it was only using 10%. Estimates from industry insiders we spoke to have us believe that this has increased to 30%.\n\nIn a nutshell, Google\u2019s promise of faster and cheaper Internet in three years will only happen if the right parameters are in place.\n\nEhimuan hinted that Google would need the help of several stakeholders to help get this cable capacity to the people and businesses that need it.\n\n\u201cThere are issues around right-of-way, double taxation at the federal and state level, cable cuts due to construction, power, and vandalism. That\u2019s why multiple stakeholders have to play a role in infrastructure expansion. There\u2019s a role for the government to play and a role for the private sector.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s partnership with WIOCC points to some exciting developments on the private sector level.\n\nWIOCC is building a Tier 111 data centre (Open Access Data Centre) in Lekki, Lagos \u2014 another major infrastructure that amplifies all the benefits of a submarine cable we listed earlier.\n\nThe Equiano cable will be connected to that data centre, from where the company plans to spread capacity across the nation.\n\nChris Wood, WIOCC CEO, revealed that Equiano\u2019s open-access technology makes it easier for any telecom service provider to spread this capacity across the country.\n\nThe company has partnered with Phase3 Telecom and Western Telecommunications to aid capacity expansion across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPhase3 has an extensive cable network in Nigeria, so it would be critical to our expansion to cities outside of Lagos. Western Telecommunications would help us spread our presence across Lagos through their fibre ducts,\u201d he said.\n\nRecall that in 2020, the Lagos State Government introduced a dig-once policy and Western Telecommunications was one of the companies to win the contract.\n\nYou see, laying fibre cables around cities is quite cumbersome. If MTN digs today, Airtel might have to dig tomorrow and could accidentally cut MTN\u2019s cable. Lagos\u2019 dig-once policy creates a scenario where one company digs and other companies tap into that network.\n\nWood and Ehimuan agree that this launch helps shore up infrastructure for the future.\n\n\u201cMore data will be generated in the next three years than has been created in the last thirty years,\u201d Wood avered.\n\nPer Ehimuan, an enabling business environment would go a long way in helping Nigeria realise its obvious potential and fully leverage its growing technology space.\n\nStay tuned for our commentary on Airtel and MainOne\u2019s data centres and Lagos\u2019 rise into a technology hub If you\u2019re curious. Meanwhile, we can only hope for the best following Equiano\u2019s launch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator. Tech, business and policies fills my head. Looking to chat?

          "title": "Blockchain-powered insurance: Meet the decentralised insurance protocol, Etherisc, insuring Kenyan farms against bad climate",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of decentralised insurance became a theoretical possibility with the emergence of decentralised finance (DeFi). Etherisc is bringing this concept to life, helping African farmers insure their crops against bad weather.\n\nWhile DeFi platforms continue to offer borrowing, lending, and staking services, Etherisc, an open-source, decentralised insurance protocol, brings affordable insurance to African farmers away from the complex DeFi protocols.\n\nTechpoint Africa spoke to Michiel Berende, Chief Inclusive Officer at Etherisc, and he revealed how more than 22,000 farmers got access to an insurance plan without the many steps associated with conventional insurance.\n\nFrom traditional insurance to decentralised insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherisc team with Keyan locals\n\nBerende has been in the insurance space since the early 2000s. While he was an underwriter at an insurance company in the Netherlands, he was interested in information technology and eventually made the switch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, his challenges saw him develop an interest in microfinance and emerging markets.\n\nBerende\u2019s first task was to help an Indian microfinance organisation set up its activities in the country in 2005. He was responsible for setting up the organisation\u2019s financial operations and deploying the software to run those operations, and his ample experience in finance and technology came in handy.\n\n\n\nEven though Berende\u2019s assignment was similar to what he\u2019d taken on in the Netherlands, it was difficult to replicate his success putting financial operations in place in an emerging market because of limited resources and the extra creativity required to offer financial services in rural areas.\n\n\u201cIt changed my view on how things are going in the world, and it doesn\u2019t work everywhere in the world the same way it works in the Netherlands. I enjoyed it, and it moved me to go and live in India,\u201d Berende said.\n\nAfter spending one year in India, he became a consultant in 2007, focusing on technologies for microinsurance. And this allowed him to work on projects in other emerging markets such as Africa.\n\nBut Berende soon realised that insurance was not a thing in Africa; interestingly, not much has changed in 2022, 15 years later.\n\nAfrica makes up 16.72% of the world\u2019s population, but it represents less than 1% of insured losses globally.\n\nAccording to the Africa Insurance Pulse 2022, insurance penetration in Africa stood at 2.78%, a decline from 2.98% in the previous year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEunice Kinungi, a Kenyan Insurance professional and CEO of Griffin Insurance, told New African magazine that \u201cthe continent still lacks flexible, affordable, and tailored policies that will unlock insurance for the African consumer.\u201d\n\nBesides the problem of unaffordability and inflexibility of insurance, Africans view insurance through the lens of superstition. Bode Pedro, CEO of Casava, a Nigerian insurtech company, told TechCrunch that the reason for low insurance penetration is that people prefer to invest in positive rather than adverse outcomes.\n\nKinungi also believes that insurance doesn\u2019t have a good reputation in Africa. She said, \u201cinsurance, unfortunately, does not have the best reputation, and there is a general distrust of insurance companies perpetuated by poor customer service and unpaid claims.\u201d\n\nBerende agrees with Kinungi and Pedro\u2019s take on why insurance in Africa is not yet a thing, reiterating the need to create products that fit the African market.\n\n\u201cIf you have people with limited resources, the insurance products must be very cheap.\u201d\n\nHow Etherisc is creating cheaper decentralised insurance with blockchain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the statistics on insurance in Africa showing that legacy insurance systems cannot increase insurance penetration, Berende dedicated himself to finding technologies that would make insurance affordable and exciting to Africans.\n\nOn his quest, he discovered Bitcoin in 2013 and came a step closer to his goal.\n\n\u201cWhat I find interesting about Bitcoin is that it makes it easy to transfer small amounts of money from A to B without a middle-man at a low cost. I delved a little more into it and discovered the technology behind it \u2014 blockchain.\u201d\n\nBerende\u2019s blockchain discovery led to another quest to create blockchain-based solutions, most of which revolve around the one thing that has popularised the technology \u2014 cryptocurrencies. Interestingly, blockchain, which secures crypto transactions with a network of computers that record these transactions simultaneously, has not seen many applications beyond crypto.\n\nHowever, Etherisc started to infuse blockchain solutions beyond crypto in 2016, and it wasn\u2019t long before Berende found the team behind it.\n\nCombining his insurance background with his desire to create inclusive finance with modern technology, Berende was an automatic fit for Etherisc, and he joined the team.\n\nEtherisc created a decentralised open-source insurance platform on the Ethereum blockchain, called the Generic Insurance Framework. This framework allows for the easy digitisation of parametric insurance products.\n\nWhat is parametric insurance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Etherisc\n\nParametric insurance, according to Berende, is a type of insurance that executes payment based on external parameters.\n\nUsing a flight delay example, he explained that if a person insures their flight ticket against a delay, they get a payout once there\u2019s a delay.\n\nHe gave another example using a farmer. If a farm is insured against heavy rains, the farmer gets indemnified if such rains destroy their farms.\n\nInsurance companies do not dispute or investigate parametric insurance claims because the data that determines the payout is usually publicly available and unalterable.\n\nThis makes automating insurance products easy, and that is where blockchain comes into play.\n\nSmart contracts, a mechanism for carrying out blockchain actions, are a major part of Etherisc\u2019s operations. Smart contracts are programs written on a blockchain to run when predetermined conditions are met.\n\nA simple analogy to understanding how smart contracts work is automating your bank account to make a payment once you receive a specific delivery.\n\nSay you\u2019re expecting a truckload of yams but don\u2019t want to make payment until you have taken delivery. So you install devices in your warehouse that can tell when a certain number of tubers has been delivered. After which, these devices signal the smart contract, which initiates payment.\n\nHowever, the beauty of smart contracts is that no one \u2014 neither you nor the delivery company \u2014 can alter the predetermined condition.\n\nEtherisc has harnessed the trustless nature of this technology to create an insurance system that can work without many people. The zero delivery cost also means it is cheaper to run.\n\nNote: In this context, \u201ctrustless\u201d means the parties involved do not necessarily need to trust themselves to complete transactions.\n\nInsuring 22,000 farms with decentralised insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherisc partnered with Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise (ACRE) Africa, a licensed insurance intermediary that helps farmers reduce agricultural and climate risks, to provide micro-insurance at affordable terms for smallholder farmers.\n\nA blockchain solution to insurance for farmers has to be simple to get any traction; a challenge Etherisc had a simple solution to.\n\nThe product Etherisc provides for the farmers is a weather index insurance that covers farmers when the weather prevents them from having a good harvest.\n\nAccording to Berende, 22,000 farmers in Kenya have accessed this insurance product.\n\nBut how does one distribute significantly advanced tech insurance products that are automated based on climate conditions to farmers?\n\nBerende\u2019s solution is simple. The bags of seeds that farmers buy come with scratch cards. When they send the numbers on these cards via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), Etherisc\u2019s Generic Insurance Framework captures their geolocation and receives information about the area\u2019s climatic conditions with satellite data.\n\nHow do farmers pay the premium for decentralised insurance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: ACRE Africa\n\nFarmers pay the $0.5 premium when they buy their bags of seeds from ACRE at a lower price that incorporates the insurance cost. Insurance can also be paid with mobile banking.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to send an insurance surveyor into the field to monitor if something has happened. A process that would naturally cost a lot of money,\u201d Berende said.\n\nIs satellite data accurate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSatellite\n\nWhile Etherisc\u2019s insurance products reduce dependency on humans, the reliability of the non-human parts of its operation is in question.\n\nAccording to Climate analysis with satellite versus weather station data, a paper published in 2007 by Mendelsohn et al., satellite data performs slightly better than data captured from the ground.\n\nThe paper is based on a study that examines how well satellite and weather station data explain agricultural performance. It concludes that the satellite\u2019s ability to see the entirety of a landscape makes it record more accurate data when measuring temperature.\n\nHowever, satellite data is not as precise as data obtained from the ground when measuring precipitation. While Etherisc\u2019s insurance product can accurately measure droughts, it might not measure rainfall correctly.\n\nA more recent take from the communications team at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory tilts towards ground thermometers rather than satellites when measuring the earth\u2019s temperature.\n\nBerende, however, assures us that it is getting better.\n\n\u201cIn the past two seasons, the satellite data covered 10\u00d710 km. For this year, we\u2019re in the process of increasing the resolution to 5\u00d75 km,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking beyond the limitations of satellite technology, blockchain, the Internet of things (IoT), and other technologies could be a compelling solution to Africa\u2019s low insurance penetration problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

After she was hit by the terrorists\u2019 bullet, she had reached out via a tweet, requesting prayers on her behalf, the call was met with mean responses and arguments from people that had responded on Twitter.\n\nAs the service peaked amid tears and tributes by family members, relatives, as well as colleagues of the deceased, Kristilere referred to Megafu\u2019s death as avoidable, \u201cif we were in a nation where lives and properties are respected, and things are going the way they should go.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike many have said, and I agree,\u201d he continued, \u201cit has never been as bad as this security-wise in our land.\u201d\n\nHe expressed sorrow over the lack of arrest since the attack over three weeks ago as of the funeral day.\n\n\u201cHere we gather at this service, conducting her funeral because some bandits decided to attack the train she boarded. What is still paining me today is that, after that attack which will be a month old in the next few days, nobody has been arrested even concerning this very wicked event,\u201d the clergyman said.\n\nKristilere said he had not seen anything tangible the government had done since then, considering that some others are still in the captivity of \u201cthe evil men\u201d. He lamented that trade travelers are not insured against terrorists\u2019 attacks and that some top members of the military just have flowery titles attached to their names without making too much impact against insurgencies as this in the country.\n\nRead also: Train attack: Victims\u2019 families lament neglect by government\n\n\u201cIf these were foreign armies ravaging our land, do we really have an army to defend us?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI heard a doctor from Abuja said he never imagined he\u2019d be writing a tribute, he thought he\u2019d be writing a reference letter.\u201d\n\nIfeanyi Megafu, father of the deceased while talking about his late daughter, trying to hold back tears, explained that he is not a social media person, but had heard of his daughter\u2019s tweet before she passed, and the responses it met.\n\n\u201cAt first, it was that of shock, shock that our humanity is so degraded, and some people could be so demented,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI had pity on those people, and at this stage, I am saying it again that I have forgiven them all; all of them. I have also forgiven the country that enabled all these to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrankly, the past three weeks have been quite traumatic. I did tell a friend that I spoke on the phone the past three weeks more than I did in three years,\u201d Megafu added.\n\nHe said he got calls from all over the world and tried as much as possible to respond to them. He added that of the calls, two were significant, one of which was a call from a serving member of this government.\n\n\u201cHe called ostensibly to commiserate, but the next things he says were completely political. I blanked off. I do not play politics, neither did Chinelo,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an effort to speak some comfort to the bereaved, Kristilere, pastor and friend to the parents of the deceased said, \u201cI remember he (father of the deceased) told me then that their first daughter (deceased) had gone to Israel four years before that time. Now ruminating over some things, I just discovered that Chinelo had a way of becoming first in many areas. She was the first of Engr. Megafu\u2019s children, she was the first to visit the earthly Jerusalem and sadly, the first in the family to see the heavenly Jerusalem.\u201d",

We have had to depend on hydro-carbon assets, oil and gas for the last 40 years to drive our economy. This is a mono-economy and we have built our entire system of life and governance around it. Our governance structure in Nigeria relies on crude oil.\u201d\n\nHe noted that what Nigeria gets from its oil assets is not enough to sustain the country as the federal government has, in recent times, struggled to get allocation to share amongst states.\n\nObaseki added, \u201cFor us in Edo, we have come to the end of the road as we are deliberating on developing other sources to help raise revenue to develop the economy of the state.\n\n\u201cAs a state, we need to diversify our economy to a broad base. And one unique asset that we have as a state is tourism. Edo is strategically located and traffic must flow through the state and we must utilize it effectively to generate revenue for the state. Our focus is for the traffic to stop and the travelers to spend their money here in Edo to boost our revenue. We are looking for things to do to attract tourists to spend their money here.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe have a huge ecosystem to support the tourism sector in the state. Tourism is not all about culture, monuments, ecotourism and business but entails much; a whole totality, and having an ecosystem that supports it. Tourism must begin at home; it\u2019s local, and we must have strong tourism that is locally based to attract international tourists into the state.\n\n\u201cWe have so many aspects of tourism in Edo and this workshop should, in my view, enable our stakeholders to think about tourism in a much broader sense and understand the players within that ecosystem.\u201d\n\nObaseki said to boost ecotourism in the state, his administration is working with the National Park Service as it prepares to co-invest in Okomu National Park, noting that the investment will be extended to develop the state\u2019s park in Gelegele.\u201d\n\nA facilitator at the stakeholders\u2019 workshop, Salewa Akomolafe said the focus of the workshop was to facilitate the development of the tourism sector.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "The Alaafin of Oyo, His Majesty, Alaiyeluwa Oba Dr. L\u00e0m\u00edd\u00ec Ol\u00e1y\u00edwol\u00e1 Atanda Ad\u00e9yem\u00ed III , passed on, Friday night, after his 52nd-year reign.\n\nHere are 20 interesting facts about the late Monarch.\n\n1-According to him, the Old Oyo Empire existed without break for 600 years. That\u2019s quite impressive, you know. Especially when you realize that many of the most popular empires, like the famed British Empire, did not last half of that.\n\n2-He was born on 15th October, 1938, and that makes him 74 years old. He was selected among other contestants to become king in 1968 but the government of the day refused and he was not crowned until January 1971, he was working as an insurance clerk then.\n\n3-Al\u00e1\u00e0fin means one who owns the palace, a\u00e1fin. It can also mean Lord of the Palace, as it is from the aafin that he lords his authority over his people.\n\n4- In times past, the Alaafin was an absolute ruler. Other names for the Al\u00e1\u00e0fin include K\u00e1b\u00edy\u00e8s\u00ed (the King No One Can Question) Iku Baba Yeye (One Who Can Command Death or Pronounce It Upon His Father or Mother Or He Who Is Mother & Father To Death), Alashe (He Who Possesses Authority), Ekeji Orisha (Second-in-Command to the gods) NB: Translations can vary slightly.\n\n5-Whoever enters the king\u2019s courtyard must remove the shoes. Everyone except the Alaafin must have bare feet in his greeting courtyard.\n\n6-The Kabiyesi\u2019s eldest daughter is name Arewa, meaning The Beautiful One in Yoruba.\n\n7-He contested with 10 other people for the position of the Alaafin. The contest started in 1968 and did not end until 1970. That\u2019s around the time of the Nigerian Civil War. He was declared winner three times but the government initially rejected the ruling of the Oyomesi on all the three occasions. The Oyomesi advises the Alaafin and is the highest decision-making body in the kingdom.\n\n8-He is a boxer, and was a champion in those days (he still has his punching bag in the courtyard) and his favorite meals are amala (yam flour), iyan (pounded yam), abula soup and ogi (pap).\n\n9-In terms of religion, he is a practising Muslim but describes himself as being liberal and a free mixer who was raised up in a strict Christian home and also went to a Catholic school.\n\n10-He has a pond in the palace where he keeps gold fish, and there is also a tortoise in the courtyard said to be hundreds of years old.\n\n11-At 74, he still does rope skipping. Kabiyesi o!\n\n12-The Alaafin can communicate with the deities like Sango (the god of thunder) in their own language. I wonder how that is done.\n\n13-His own father, Ad\u00e9n\u00edran Ad\u00e9yem\u00ed II was the Alaafin for 10 years (1945-1955) until he was forced into exile by the political party of Chief Ob\u00e1f\u00e9mi Aw\u00f3l\u00f3w\u00f2, the Action Group in 1956. While his father was on exile, he was sent to live with the Alake of Egbaland, Oba Oladapo Ademola, the father of the former Chief Justice of Nigeria, Adetokunbo Ademola.\n\n14-He was the first Yoruba monarch to become the Chancellor of Uthman Dan Fodio University, Sokoto.\n\n15-There are 24 seats in the royal chamber of his Palace, 12 on each side.\n\n16-As at the time of writing this, 21 ancient rooms in the Palace were destroyed by fire caused by an electrical surge. Ile Alaafin to jo, ewa lo bu kun.\n\n17-On his controversial relationship with the Ooni of Ife, Oba Okunade Sijuwade, Olubuse II, he says: Let me put it this way: My relation with traditional rulers generally is cordial. But since you singled out the Ooni of Ife, you should have your reasons. I think he is in a better position to answer the question. For me, I have no problem with him at all as long as everybody knows his limit of authority.\n\nAt a point, the Alaafin delayed the appointment of a new Chief Imam for the kingdom because members of the Ajokidero family producing the new Imam were very bitterly opposed and critical of the Alaafin during the conflict between the Oro cult and Muslims in Oyo Town. He is a recipient of a national honour, the Commander of the Order of the Federal Republic (CFR). He installed the late Bashorun Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola (MKO) as the last Aare Ona Kakanfo (Field Marshal or Generalissimo) of Yorubaland on 14th January, 1988 and also the talented singer, Queen Salawa Abeni whom he crowned the Queen of Waka Music (the Golden Voice of Africa) in 1992. Both truly deserve the honours (I\u2019m actually listening to Salawa\u2019s Cheer Up writing this\u2026lol!) He was the 43rd Alaafin of Oyo. Alaafins are buried at the Royal Burial Ground called the Bara.\n\nShare this:\n\n\n\nTelegram\n\nPrint\n\nTweet\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

This is perhaps, the largest collection of bankers on the FMBN that I can remember in a long time.\u201d the Minister said.\n\nHe also advised the Board and Management to promptly engage with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and ensure FMBN\u2019s compliance with regulatory stipulations for operating as a Bank.

          "text": "By Emmanuel Obisue\n\nPresident of the World Bank Group, David Malpass has asked the Federal Government to have a rethink on its policy on fuel subsidy, stating that the huge amount being expended on the policy could be channeled into other critical sectors.\n\nMalpass noted this on Wednesday at a media briefing at the ongoing World Bank/International Monetary Fund Spring Meetings in Washington DC, United States.\n\nIt would be recalled that the Nigerian Senate last week approved N4 trillion for petrol subsidy in 2022.\n\nThe figure represented the amount contained in two separate requests by President Muhammadu Buhari to the National Assembly for approval. The President, had in a letter to the Legislature dated February 10, 2022, sought an additional N2.557 trillion to fund subsidy payments from July to December, 2022.\n\nAccording to Malpass, generalised subsidies have significant negative effects on any system. Thus, he reiterated the need for the country to do away with the multiple exchange rate system, which he said is \u201ccomplicated and is not as effective as it would be if there was a single exchange rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne is that they are expensive because they go to everyone and they are often used by people with upper incomes than by people with lower incomes so they are not targeted.\n\n\u201cSo, we encourage that when there is need for subsidy, either food or for fuel, that it should be carefully targeted at those most in need of it. And so, we have encouraged Nigeria to rethink its subsidy effort.\n\n\u201cThe most useful thing for developing countries is to have a single exchange rate that is market-based, that is stable over long periods of time as that attracts investment and so that would help,\u201d he noted.\n\nMalpass further noted that Nigeria also has trade barriers that continue to distort trade and capital flows. He urged the Nigerian Government to improve to help the country and its people move forward.\n\n\u201cI take note of the complicated situation that they face where there are weapons flowing into northern Africa that find their way into non Nigerians that create violence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is a very challenging situation that the government faces. I think all over the world, people should have an understanding of the fragility that is facing several parts of the world, but in particular, the Sahel and the Sub-Saharan Africa area where the weapons flow from outside of Africa are putting a great burden on governments around the continent.\n\n\u201cNigeria has huge opportunity because of its natural resources and because of its people, and I think I could see its growth accelerate with improvements in policy,\u201d he added while commenting on the spate of insecurity in the country.\n\nThe World Bank had in November 2021 warned Nigeria not to delay any further in removing the fuel subsidy which had been described as a major drain and waste on the economy.",

          "text": "Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has confirmed the death of the Alaafin of Oyo, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday by his Chief Press Secretary, Taiwo Adisa, the governor declared that the death of the traditional ruler was a huge loss to the state, Nigeria, and the Yoruba race.\n\nHe described Oba Adeyemi\u2019s death as a personal loss to him, adding that he was an ever-supportive royal father and a worthy leader who spared nothing in trying to make Oyo State and Nigeria greater.\n\n\u201cI have been informed about the death of our father, His Imperial Majesty, Iku Baba Yeye, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III,\u201d Makinde said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Alaafin Of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, Is Dead\n\nThe governor, who said Alaafin\u2019s words of advice and guidance were always golden and helpful, condoled with the Oyo State Traditional Council, the Oyomesi, Oba Adeyemi\u2019s immediate family, the people of Oyo Kingdom, and the entire Yoruba race and prayed to God to grant repose to the soul of the departed monarch.\n\nHe stated that apart from Oyo State losing its last man standing in the rank of experienced monarchs with long years of royal leadership, it has also lost a royal institution and an authority, which Alaafin had become by virtue of his high-octane understanding of Yoruba history, politics, and national development.\n\n\u201cI express heartfelt condolences to the Oyo State Council of Obas and Chiefs, which Oba Adeyemi chaired for decades, the Oyomesi and the entire people of Oyo Kingdom,\u201d the governor continued.\n\n\u201cI equally commiserate with the Oloris, children and entire Adeyemi family on the demise of their patriarch and worthy father. Kabiyesi\u2019s departure is a huge loss not only to Oyo State, to which he committed 52 years of his life as the Alaafin of Oyo Kingdom, but also to Nigeria and the entire Yoruba race.\n\n\u201cOba Adeyemi was our last man standing in the rank of most eminent royal fathers with long years of leadership. He became a golden king, an institution and an authority rolled into one by virtue of his immense experience, wisdom and understanding of Yoruba history, royalty, and politics.\n\n\u201cOba Adeyemi not only elevated the Alaafin throne with his knowledge and wisdom, but he also became a worthy exemplar for royal leadership in Africa and brought glory to Oyo State and Nigeria. Kabiyesi never spared anything in his strive to make Oyo State greater and to bring about the Nigeria of everyone\u2019s collective dream.\n\n\u201cPersonally, Kabiyesi\u2019s death is a great loss to me, because he proved to be a worthy father and had been ever so supportive of our government. His words of advice and guidance were always golden and helpful.\n\n\u201cIt is my prayer that God accepts Kabiyesi\u2019s soul into Aljanah Firdaus and upholds everyone and everything he left behind. Good night, Iku Baba Yeye!\u201d\n\n52-Year Reign\n\nThe news of the death of the top Yoruba traditional ruler broke on Saturday morning hours after he died at the Afe Babalola University Teaching Hospital in Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital.\n\nHe was 83 years as of the time his death was reported.\n\nAccording to reports, the body of the Alaafin was brought to Oyo town and received by his children at Idi-Igba in Oyo town while traditional rites began thereafter.\n\nAlaafin Adeyemi, who served as the permanent chairperson of the Oyo State Council of Obas and Chiefs, was reportedly sick and was scheduled to be flown abroad for treatment before he joined his ancestors on Friday.\n\nHe died months after the death of two other top traditional rulers in the state \u2013 the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji, and the Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Jimoh Oyewumi.\n\nWhile Oba Olalekan Balogun has been crowned as the 42nd Olubadan of Ibadan land, the people of Ogbomoso have yet to get a new traditional ruler.\n\nAlaafin Adeyemi, the third to ascend the throne from the Alowolodu Ruling House, ruled for 52 years \u2013 making him the longest-reigning traditional ruler in Oyo town.\n\nHe was born Lamidi Olayiwola Atanda Adeyemi on October 15, 1938, and succeeded Oba Gbadegesin Ladigbolu I, as the new Alaafin on November 18, 1970.\n\nFollowing his demise, the Bashorun of Oyo and Head of the \u2018Oyo Mesi\u2019, Yusuf Akinade, is expected to lead Oyo town before a new Alaafin would be installed.",

There is no jobs in rural areas,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 Apartheid legacy \u2013\n\nThe problem of landlessness goes back to the apartheid era that segregated black Africans and people of colour, preventing them from owning land, said Sbu Zikode, head of the land and housing activism organisation Abahlali baseMjondolo (shack dwellers).\n\nStripped of land ownership, poor blacks moved to sub-par neighbourhoods.\n\nBut nearly three decades since the apartheid system was abolished, land distribution and economic inequity remain unresolved.\n\nIn 1995, the housing backlog was estimated by a UN report to be 1.5 million units.\n\nDespite more than three million government houses being constructed since then, the shortfall has ballooned to 3.7 million homes, according to the Centre for Affordable Housing Finance in Africa.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not by our choice that we have no land, we have no homes,\u201d Zikode said.\n\nPeople have also flocked to urban centres in search of jobs and better healthcare and education. Infrastructure in municipalities like Durban haven\u2019t kept up with the influx, Zikode said.\n\nInformal settlements have mushroomed on vacant land as a result. But communities on more valuable land face eviction, Zikode said, which often turns into violent encounters.\n\n\u201cIt is this reason people will occupy land that is not safe. They will occupy land that is along riverbanks, they will occupy land that is along floodplains.\u201d\n\nThe less desirable locations on floodplains have now also brought deadly consequences.\n\nRescuers searching for the missing have said poor infrastructure with no consideration of the terrain put the houses at greater risk. Many of those still standing in eNkanini are teetering half a metre from the edge of cliffs, vulnerable to future storms.\n\nPipes were exposed, wires downed and unpaved footpaths up to houses near the top of the hill are treacherously slick with sand and debris.\n\nGovernment housing officials said this week they were beginning to clear land in the nearby Ndwedwe town to erect temporary housing for the victims of the flood, which claimed 435 lives.\n\nLonger term solutions are still being investigated.\n\nOut of the tragedy, Zikode believes it\u2019s an opportunity for government to finally address landlessness and poverty.\n\n\u201cThe country and the world is watching as to how we are going to be dealing with the current disaster,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSurely the government is now forced to act and provide alternative land.\u201d",
          "summary": "Hers was among the 87 homes \u2014 shacks made of corrugated iron \u2014 that vanished in seconds when the ground, over-saturated with flood water \u2014 crumbled at the informal settlement of eNkanini, on a hilltop residential area of central Durban.\nDespite more than three million government houses being constructed since then, the shortfall has ballooned to 3.7 million homes, according to the Centre for Affordable Housing Finance in Africa.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not by our choice that we have no land, we have no homes,\u201d Zikode said.\n\u201cIt is this reason people will occupy land that is not safe.\nThey will occupy land that is along riverbanks, they will occupy land that is along floodplains.\u201dThe less desirable locations on floodplains have now also brought deadly consequences.",

As such, these newly bred operatives would be employed as part of our offensive to ensure normalcy and calm are restored to restive communities within Nigeria.\n\n\u201cGround Training Command remains resolute in ensuring qualitative training to enable us to have the best quality, as well as the right numerical strength of personnel to prosecute the fight against terrorism and insurgency working in synergy with sister Services and other security agencies.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, in equipping them for the task ahead, some of the curricula of the Advanced Special Operations Course entailed counter improvised explosive devices training, air-to-ground integration, remotely piloted aerial systems training, close quarter battle drills, among others, emphasising that, \u201cas expected, the course was intentionally made tough to ensure that our trainees can withstand the gruelling physical conditions of ground operations.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, expressed optimism that the graduating students have imbibed the necessary skills, tactics, techniques and procedures required to conduct special operations pursuant to achieving the operational objectives of the Nigerian Air Force.\n\nAmao, who was represented by the Chief of Policy and Plan, Air Vice Marshal Charles Ohwo, said that in furtherance of his vision of enhancing and sustaining critical airpower capabilities required for joint force employment in pursuit of national security imperatives, the Nigerian Air Force has so far trained about 5,000 Regiment and 2,000 Special Operations Forces personnel.\n\nAmao said the 150 graduating students of the Advanced Special Operations Course 1/2022 are however the first set of personnel to undergo in-Country Advanced Special Operations training, adding that the NAF\u2019s ability to train this large number of personnel at a reasonable cost was possible because the training was conducted in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the Commander, British Military Advisory Training Team, Col. Rory Shannon, described the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with Nigeria and with its military as \u201cdeep-rooted and very strong.\u201d\n\nShannon said, \u201cAt the Security and Defense Dialogue that was held between the United Kingdom and Nigeria\u2019s Armed Forces and other Agencies in January of this year, our Chief of Defense Staff Spoke reiterating a desire to strengthen links between our militaries including in this particular area.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria-UK relations is hugely important.

I think that one of the most important things is that the country needs people, those who have feelings for the common person; people who deeply care about the common man.\u201d\n\nWhile praising the Olubadan for always being a lover of the common people, even before he ascended the throne, he said: \u201cno matter in whatever shape of form, even as Kabiyesi, you are still going to be the Kabiyesi of the common man, Kabiyesi of the people.\u201d\n\nAccording to the vice president, the people of Ibadan are not only blessed with an intellectual but one who cares for the people.\n\nOsinbajo said: \u201cAs the Olubadan, Your Royal Majesty, you are a great gift to the people of Ibadan and also to us as a nation. I pray that your years will be very long and that all the people of this great city, kingdom will feel the impact, and that they will all know that you are someone who cares about them.\n\n\u201cAs you know, on April 11, 2022, I declared my intention to run for the presidency of our great land under the flag of our party, the great party, the All Progressives Congress. I did so while taking into account the fact that our country needs all of those who are willing to serve it to the best of their capacity and knowledge.\n\n\u201cWith great humility and sincerity, I come to your majesty, that after serving about seven years as Vice President, and also as acting, under our President, President Muhammadu Buhari, who truly gave me every opportunity; he opened up doors in a way that most deputies may not have experienced, and entrusting a lot to my care, including very sensitive positions.\n\n\u201cAfter all of that, I felt that it would be the right thing to do, to make that experience available to the people of our country. By the grace of God and the will of the people, if I am voted in as the President come 2023, I believe that there is so much to do. The desire of our hearts is that our country will be much greater and will be able to attain all of the great potentials of our people.\u201d\n\nDescribing the monarch as a \u201cfather of all,\u201d Osinbajo thanked him for the warm reception, noting that he will always covet the Olubadan\u2019s \u201cprayers and good wishes all the time.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cYou can be sure that wherever I am and in whatever situation I am, I hold you in the highest esteem, I will always continuously support whatever it is that you want to do, either for yourself or the great people of Ibadan.\u201d\n\nThe Olubadan described the Vice President as \u201ca wonderful human being, a wonderful person,\n\n\u201cHopefully, in God\u2019s name, you will be President of Nigeria,\u201d he told the VP, adding that \u201cmay Allah grant you success on what you have in mind, may Allah support you. I can spend the next two hours just praying for you.\u201d\n\nIbadan High Chiefs present also expressed their support for the Vice President\u2019s aspirations, declaring that \u201cwe are with you.\u201d\n\nMeeting with APC Stakeholders\n\nOsinbajo later departed the palace to interact with APC leaders and delegates in Oyo State at an impressive event where his speech was often interrupted with singing as the audience kept bursting out in festive renditions of different political lyrics welcoming the VP\u2019s emergence and expressions of support for him.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the seven years that I have been involved, because the President considered it the right thing to do and, in his generosity, and openness, he gave me every opportunity to serve, including sensitive international assignments.\n\n\u201cAs you know, I also acted as President during certain periods when the President was away and everything I learnt as acting President has prepared me to run as President of our country.\n\n\u201cGod doesn\u2019t make mistakes. God is deliberate in everything He does and by giving me all of these opportunities to understand governance for myself at the highest level of our country, all of it was not just so that I can sit down and write a memoir, no, it was to come handy one day and I believe the time has come.\n\n\u201cI believe that the time has come and I have the responsibility to my country, to you, to all our children and the coming generations to give all of what I have learnt, everything I have learnt, all of the services to be able to give it to our country. To serve our country faithfully and honestly is my intention.\n\n\u201cOne advantage I would have is that on day one, I can hit the ground running because I know what it takes.\u201d\n\nOther speakers at the event included Senator Teslim Folarin, Chief Niyi Akintola, Chief Jacob Tilley-Gyado and the APC Chairman in Oyo State Hon. Isaac Ajiboye Omodewu, who all expressed support for the Vice President\u2019s aspiration.\n\nAccording to Akintola, \u201cWhen it comes to the candidacy of Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, there are no factions at all.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President, who travelled with a number of National Assembly members from Abuja, was received by the Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Engr. Rauf Olaniyan at the Ibadan airport. The Deputy Governor also joined the vice president for the visit to the Olubadan.\n\nMembers of the National Assembly with the Vice President besides Folarin, included Senator Adamu Bukkachuwa, Kola Balogun, Fatahu Muhammad, Odebunmi Olusegun, Shehu Saleh Rijau and Karu Simon.\n\nKemi Olaitan in Ibadan",
          "summary": "On arrival in Ibadan, the Vice President received a rousing reception right from the airport and on the streets by excited residents.\nComing after Osinbajo declared his intention to contest the 2023 presidential election on the platform of the APC last week Monday, the vice president intimated the Monarch of his intention to run for president.\nThe Vice President said: \u201cI have followed you very closely.\nThe Deputy Governor also joined the vice president for the visit to the Olubadan.\nMembers of the National Assembly with the Vice President besides Folarin, included Senator Adamu Bukkachuwa, Kola Balogun, Fatahu Muhammad, Odebunmi Olusegun, Shehu Saleh Rijau and Karu Simon.",

          "text": "Former President Goodluck Jonathan on Friday in Abuja came under intense pressure from his supporters, urging him to contest for president in 2023 and he did not disappoint, telling them that \u201cthe political process is ongoing; just watch out. just watch out.\u201d\n\nThe supporters, comprising largely women and youths, stormed the Jonathan Foundation\u2019s Abuja office, chanting his name, forcing him to come out to address them.\n\nThe former president acknowledged that youths wanted him to contest for President in 2023, but told the supporters that he could not, for now, tell Nigerians whether he would be contesting and that his final decision would manifest very soon.\n\nJonathan said: \u201cI cannot declare because some processes are still ongoing. Yes, you are calling me to come and declare for the next election. I cannot tell you I\u2019m declaring, the political process is ongoing. Just watch out. The key thing you must do is to pray that Nigeria gets somebody that carries young people along, somebody that can also work very hard to see that some of the problems raised are tackled.\n\n\u201cI sincerely appreciate the youths of Nigeria. For you to come this morning in this manner shows clearly that the youth are interested in politics.\n\n\u201cWe have always wanted the youth to get involved in politics. And luckily, the Not Too Young to Run Act has made it very clear that young people can contest almost every position in the country. So, we continue to encourage you to get involved in the political process.\u201d\n\nJonathan noted that the country was facing challenges, saying that some of the challenges started a long time ago, stressing that he believed in the interest of young people and that the challenges would be dealt with.\n\nThe supporters, who demanded the return of Jonathan as President in 2023, arrived in four buses and displayed placards at Jonathan\u2019s Taraba Close, Maitama office.\n\nSome of the placards read, \u201cGoodluck declare now\u201d; \u201cWe are sorry, Goodluck don\u2019t abandon us, come back\u201d; \u201cGoodluck please come\u201d; and \u201cGoodluck we love you\u201d, among others.\n\nA spokesman for the supporters, Mayor Samuel, who is also the convener of the Youth Compatriots of Nigeria, said, \u201cWe were deceived and brainwashed by those who claimed they could do it in 2015.\n\n\u201cNow, we know better, under Jonathan the minimum wage could buy one or two bags of rice. What do we have today? We are begging President Jonathan to forgive us, we have realised our mistakes, we want him back to complete what he started.\u201d\n\nSamuel admitted that they were deceived to believe that the administration of Jonathan was bad and that they were out in their numbers to seek Jonathan\u2019s forgiveness.\n\nHe noted that they had realised their mistake and that the \u201csaboteurs\u201d that came after him were empty.\n\nSamuel adds: \u201cWe are here to say sir, forgive us, come and lead us again. We are calling on you to come and take the mantle of leadership in 2023. Nigeria is in comatose. Please answer this call, the youth are here, the women are here, the children are here, pregnant women are here, please hear their cry.\n\n\u201cWe are here to call on our former president. Nigeria is in a state of no return, it is in a state of comatose, which is why we are here calling on him to declare.\n\n\u201cAll we need is a leader that will not discriminate, a Nigerian that will work for the South-South, South-east, South-west, and the north.\n\n\u201cThe Transformation agenda was working until the saboteurs came to deceive us, to brainwash us. Now we have realised that those that deceived us are empty and have nothing to offer.\n\n\u201cWe want Jonathan to run under the Nigeria Peoples Party. Any party that gives a ticket to Jonathan is a party of the masses, the party of the downtrodden and that\u2019s the party we will support.\u201d\n\nOne of the women speakers, Ms. Angela Obi said they were tired of the administration of President Buhari and called on Jonathan to come back.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe are dying, hunger wants to kill us, we are tired, please come back, we are suffering, we have no food to eat, we have no water, we need you back.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on behalf of women, Ms. Ngozi Okafor said since the former president left office in 2015, both men and women had been suffering.\n\nShe said, \u201cChildren are dying, we are tired. We have turned to beggars, women are begging, children are begging. We don\u2019t need Baba Buhari again. Our children are no longer going to school.\u201d\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja",
