They brought them to the village square led by one Obi Gika Anaekwe; unfortunately he is late now. I wish he is still alive to testify to what I am saying.\n\n\u201cSo, Gika Anaekwe led Nsugbe people to these children. Unanimously Nsugbe said that they would have no hand in it; that they should hand them over to the police.\n\n\u201cThese children were handed over to the police. This happened about 20 years ago. The police were there. These children were grown ups, not kids.\n\n\u201cTheir parents existed. It should be their duty to have asked after their children not mine. Did I ask them to go about stealing; shooting people?\u201d\n\nFor Ifeanyi Tabugbo, the spokesperson for Ifite Quarter, Nsugbe, those people were terrors in the community\n\n\u201cI was coming from Onitsha to Nsugbe. We were four in the bus. Police had a checkpoint on a section of that road. So, when we were approaching, the people on that road were flashing their torchlight.\n\n\u201cI told the driver to slow down; that they were policemen. So, when we got where they were, somebody came out from a Melina tree and pointed it at us to my surprise.\n\n\u201cHe fired gunshots and we zoomed off. While we were running, I noticed that blood was dripping from my backside. I had been shot. The driver said that bullet hit him on the leg.\n\n\u201cI went to the police station in our community and reported the matter. I was later taken to the hospital.\n\n\u201cThis happened around 8pm. From there, I was taken to a hospital in Onitsha were I was given treatment for three months until I returned to Lagos. Anyone trying to link our son to the missing persons in Nsugbe is mischievous, \u201d he said\n\nWhen contacted on phone, Senator Obi -Igbeke, said those behind such action were perceived political enemies.\n\n\u201cThey think I\u2019m interested in any political office. Their aim is just to tarnish the image that took me many years to build. They should think of another thing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve served this country as a member of the House of Representatives.

President Muhammadu Buhari got to power through a campaign of deceit, forgetting that no one can play God.\n\nGreenfield students: Pastor Giwa calls out preachers who helped Buhari in 2015\n\n\u201cThe biblical Abimelech, the son of Gideon became king of Shechem, Israel through deceit and the wicked use of force by killing his brothers. He ruled Shechem for three years before a conspiracy arose against him. He commanded by force, murdered his opposition, and led in such a manner that even his subjects sought to overthrow him.\n\n\u201cThen, God sent an evil spirit to cause problems between Abimelech and citizens of Shechem. So, the citizens of Shechem turned against Abimelech.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, a woman in Thebez killed Abimelech by throwing a small millstone that hit him on the head and cracked his skull.\n\n\u201cLet me warn President Buhari again to thread cautiously and listen to the cries of Nigerians. If not, Nigeria might witness what she never planned for. There can\u2019t be peace where there is no justice and equity.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari took the position that does not belong to him. I prefer a good name than silver and gold. The king who rules and protects his name and integrity leaves a good legacy behind.\n\n\u201cAfter Buhari\u2019s exit, can his son wake up and address Nigerians that he wants to become the president? I have never seen this kind of a government before since I was born.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari is a sociopath because of his lack of conscience. Does that make sense to you? You\u2019re empowering criminals terrorizing the innocent citizens but crucifying those who are fighting for their freedom?\n\n\u201cIt takes the heartless person to act in such a way; A good leader listens and acts on the demands of his people. Either they like or not, the will of God must prevail in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cGod hates injustice, oppression and evil leaders. Sometimes, I wonder maybe some men of God in Nigeria who have refused to speak truth to power have different bibles aside the Holy Bible that we read.\n\n\u201cThis is not the time for prophecy, but time to look at those who are in power and tell them the truth. It\u2019s time for all of us to speak in one voice and deliver God\u2019s people from the hands of the wicked.\u201d\n\nOduduwa Republic: Nothing can stop Yoruba from breaking out of Nigeria \u2013 Pastor Giwa",

          "text": "By Rosemary Nwisi,Port Harcourt and Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja\n\nThe Train 7 project of the Nigerian Liquified Natural Gas (NLNG) will raise gas production by 35 per cent and create, at least, 42,000 jobs.\n\nWith a five-year completion timeline, the project will cost $10 billion.\n\nNLNG Managing Director, Tony Attah, who spoke at the groundbreaking ceremony in Bonny, Rivers State, said the company has reduced gas flaring from 65 per cent to 12 per cent, to be further reduced when the project is completed.\n\nAccording to him, the Train 7 project will increase NLNG\u2019s overall capacity to 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) from the current 22 million.\n\nAttah noted that the project would stimulate the inflow of about $10 billion foreign direct investment, create 12,000 direct jobs in Bonny Island and additional 40,000 indirect construction jobs.\n\nHe said the project would boost the development of local capacity and businesses through the 100 per cent in-country execution of construction works, fabrications and major procurement.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria has ridden on the back of oil for over 50 years, but with this Train 7 project, Nigeria is now set and I believe it is now time to fly on the wings of gas,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari emphasised that speedy and safe delivery of Train 7 would encourage the timely take-off of the Train 8 project.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said: \u201cAs we flag off the Train 7 project, I look forward to the development and execution of more gas projects by the International Oil Companies (IOCs) and indigenous operators, and more Trains from Nigeria LNG to harness the over 600 trillion cubic feet of proven gas reserves we are endowed with.\n\n\u2018\u2019As Minister of Petroleum Resources, I kicked off our first foray in LNG Business in 1978. At the time it was already apparent that Nigeria was mainly a gas-rich country with little oil.\n\n\u2018\u2019It, therefore, gives me great joy to see the organisation transform from just a project in the early 90s to a very successful company with over 20 years of responsible operations and a steady supply of Liquefied Natural Gas, Liquefied Petroleum Gas and Natural Gas Liquids into the global market.\n\n\u2018\u2019This is proof that Nigeria has a great capacity to deliver value to the world by harnessing our natural resources.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President, who connected virtually, praised the NLNG and its shareholders \u2013 NNPC, Shell, Total and Eni for proving that a Nigerian company can operate a world-class business safely, profitably and responsibly.\n\n\u2018\u2019NLNG has generated $114 billion in revenues over the years, paid $9 billion in taxes; $18 billion in dividends to the Federal Government and $15 billion in feed gas purchase.\n\n\u2018\u2019These are commendable accomplishments by the company\u2019s 100 per cent Nigerian management team,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva described NLNG as a \u2018\u2019blessing to the nation\u2019\u2019, noting that it has positively complemented crude oil exploration by monetising flared gas and yielding huge revenue to the nation and investors.\n\nHe added that since NLNG became operational in 1999, the nation has recorded a drastic reduction in operational flare status from 65 per cent to 12 per cent.\n\n\u2018\u2019I boldly say that the groundbreaking of Train 7 is a guarantee to every stakeholder of more dividends in terms of further reduction in gas flaring, more revenue to the nation and shareholders, more job opportunities especially at the construction phase and more social investments for the society,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernor Nyesom Wike thanked the NLNG for setting up its headquarters in the state.\n\nRepresented by Deputy Governor Dame Ipalibo Harry-Banigo, the governor said: \u201cAs a government, we have deliberately taken steps to ensure that all legitimate businesses set up in the state are given the necessary support to thrive.\n\n\u201cNLNG and other multinational companies operating in the state will continue to enjoy favourable environment to operate.\u201d\n\nHe said the state has taken steps to address the issues of double taxation while making the environment safe for investments.",

          "title": "Nigeria as metaphoric Beasts of No Nation",
          "text": "By Oludayo Tade\n\nJune 12 represents the denial of the wish of the majority by the powerful holders of power in Nigeria (and their foreign collaborators) who annulled the most peaceful and free election in Nigeria\u2019s history. Moshood Abiola who dined with the military hierarchy forgot to use long spoon while eating with the \u2018devil\u2019. The resolve to pursue his mandate ended in death and since that election, Nigerians have retreated to their ethnic base, only going to the centre to collect maintenance allowances while parasitic elites across the zones harmonise against the interests of the poor majority.\n\nThe story behind June 12 is being lost and the 2021 protests were not much about June 12 of Abiola. The protesters demanded of the president to address the monsters of unemployment, poverty, and insecurity which are terrorising Nigerians. Through protest songs, the youth called out President Muhammadu Buhari demanding an end to \u2018demonstration of craze\u2019 by herdsmen, kidnappers, bandits among others.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nProtest songs have become useful in explaining the turn of events in Nigeria because they embellish the experiences of people and points direction towards ameliorating the unpleasant experiences. Through protest songs, leaders who promised but fail to deliver on those promises are called out and the breach in agreement revisited to show regret in the abuse of trust and to serve as a reminder and draw attention to pending issues. But the handlers of Nigeria\u2019s democracy barely tolerate dissenting voices. This was why Nigerians reacted against the position of President Muhammadu Buhari on his suspension of Twitter. Rather than being sympathetic to national security argument of the Buhari administration, Nigerians perceive a back-door strategy of this government to actualise their long pursued social media regulation. What kind of world could we be living at the moment? Could the converted-democrat have backslidden?\n\nThe answer to my questions was provided by Afro-beat legend and Pan-Africanist, late Fela Anikulapo-Kuti who provided experiential and theoretical explanations of two worlds which exist in his universe. It is a timely intervention because, Fela dissected Nigeria and the global politics in his song, Beasts of No Nation after he was released from prison. He had been jailed in 1984 by the General Buhari government on allegation of currency smuggling but was released by General Ibrahim Babangida after 20 months in jail. Beasts of No Nation was a vociferous protest album to end apartheid regime in South Africa under President Pieter Willem Botha who said \u2018this uprising (opposition, resistance and protest) against the apartheid will bring out the beast in us\u2019.\n\nIn Beasts of No Nation, Fela constructs prison as \u2018inside world\u2019 and outside the prison walls as \u2018outside world\u2019. To Fela, outside world is \u2018craze world\u2019, governed by wicked rulers, corrupt judges, ineffective national assembly, soldiers, magistrate and police who brutalises and extort people who are fighting for their rights and are struggling with the Nigeria\u2019s terrorising space. He says \u201cthe time wey I dey for prison, I call am inside world. The time wey I dey outside prison, I call am outside world. Na craze world, no be outside world. No be outside the police dey\u2026 Craze world. No be outside the soldier dey\u2026 Craze world. No be outside the court dem dey\u2026craze world. No be outside the judge dem dey\u2026.craze world\u201d. To Fela, all the actors who ordered his arrest and those who sentenced him live and dominate the \u2018craze world\u2019.\n\n\u201cNo be outside dem find me guilty ..craze world\u2026No be outside dem jail me five years\u2026.craze world\u2026. No be outside dem kill dem students.. Soweto, Zaria, and Ife\u201d.\n\nDo the catalogued incidents resonate anything in your mind? As it was during the military so it is during democracy because the actors are the same; they only operate under different systems of government. In this \u2018craze world\u2019, we continue to experience miscarriage of justice, extortion by the police and brutal clampdown on ENDSARS protesters ordered by government. Just like Fela explained that \u201cI no do nothing\u201d, revelations at the ENDSARS panels unveil the wasting of human lives by police operatives on trumped up charges and beastly extortion.\n\nThe de-marketing of Nigeria did not just start with this administration, during War Against Indiscipline (WAI) of Major General Muhammadu Buhari, Fela said he has never heard where a government would say \u201cMy people are useless, my people are senseless, my people are indiscipline\u2026..na Nigerian government, ee-oh\u2026.dem dey talk be that\u2026which kain talk be that\u2026.na craze talk\u201d. Fast forward to today and add \u201cfantastically corrupt\u201d with \u2018lazy youth\u2019 and the answer you get is a leopard that does not change its spot.\n\nIn this craze world are pretenders. We pretend to be good to exploit and people uncritically get trapped with the bait. In our \u2018craze world\u2019 therefore, many leaders (people) disguise as messiah or are packaged as such but show their true self once their ambition is realised. In Nigeria\u2019s political campaign, a presidential candidate in who is in Benue State will be made to wear Benue attire to portray the candidate as detribalised. He does the same thing across the states. However, the true colour is revealed when he assumes office and begin to manifest clannish mentality. The nature of our relationship which is founded on deceit and falsehood is our albatross.\n\nIn the Beasts of No Nation, Fela educates us on why ruling government clamps down on dissent. Using this song, I reasoned that treating human beings with respect begets respectful relationship while unleashing beastly behaviour against uprisings will lead to reproduction and multiplication of beasts. Through his song, Fela shows that beasts are ubiquitous from local to global and can be unleashed. In Nigeria\u2019s situation, the beastly killing of Yusuf by the Police brought out the beast in Boko Haram; the failure to provide for their kids in Almajiri system created beasts terrorising through abduction and kidnapping. The failure to allow for dialogue by government is producing beasts in southeast and the failure to suppress the uprising of the criminal herders against the farming communities is responsible for the creation of restructuring movement and self-determination agitators in the southwest.\n\nIn reading of Fela\u2019s philosophical analysis of the relationship between the rulers and the ruled embedded in the Beasts of No Nation, I extend the argument which tends to locate beastly behaviour as the preserve of those who hold levers of power. I argue that citizens are co-creating and unleashing beastly behaviour like their rulers either in reaction to the state beastly conducts or as an uprising oriented to draw attention to unmet needs in the polity. To sum up, protests and rallies are democratic rights which a government must guarantee and respect. Protest is a form of political participation in which citizens show government that they still love their country but would want certain things attended to. The Muhammadu Buhari/Yemi Osinbajo government should see the message from Fela Anikulapo as advice to pacify frayed nerves. Brutal clampdown on dissent only brings out more beasts that will terrorise the country. Moving forward, the problems of poverty, unemployment and insecurity must be addressed without prejudice to any ethnic nationality. Agitators only call attention to address injustices and must be seen as partners in the Nigerian project not enemies of the state.",

          "title": "Why Nigeria is missing on international stage",
          "text": "By Charles Onunaiju\n\nThe Group of Seven rich countries and advanced industrial economies that recently met in the United Kingdom are also foremost liberal democracies. These countries are the United States of America, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Japan. As an outreach to countries of similar liberal democratic values, the G7 invited Australia, South Korea, India and South Africa to the meeting at Carbis bay of the British Southwest city of Cornwall. If Nigeria\u2019s political elite could do a little of imaginative introspection , it should be a source of concern that at a time, they were drenched in noise about democracy and even instituted national public holiday for it, a conclave of advanced liberal democracies did not only take notice but to make a point, that ignoring the feisty rumblings of democracy\u2019s official celebration in Nigeria was deliberate, they dutifully invited South Africa, Nigeria\u2019s perpetual rival for Africa\u2019s spot on the international stage, to the meeting.\n\nThe G7 is not the only notable international forum that Nigeria has been ignored. In the early 2000, following emergence of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) later BRICS, with an addition of South Africa as emerging economies, there was a spotlight of another hopeful emerging economies. Nigeria, hopefully was among the group known as MINT-Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey. Though, this group was not formalized like the BRICS, but they along with the BRICS countries and the top industrialized nations and other emerging economies, coalesced to form the Group of 20 world brightest and respectable economies and nations. Among the MINT hopeful countries, only Nigeria dropped off from joining the global club of top performing economies with internal predictable and considerable stable political order.\n\nThe G20 are influential in setting the rules of the global economy and Nigeria is nowhere around the important platform to contribute in the global rules of economic intercourse.\n\nEven the more than the 20-year old Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, (FOCAC) which alternates its three-yearly ministerial conference and head of state summits between China and Africa, Nigeria has been bypassed. Major countries in Africa have played host to the forum, except Nigeria. When the meeting was held in East Africa, Ethiopia\u2019s as the key power in the region hosted. When it was the turn of Northern and Southern African sub-regions, Egypt and South Africa respectively hosted the forum. The 8th ministerial conference is scheduled to hold in the later part of this year, and will the first of the forum in West Africa and will be held in Dakar, Senegal.\n\nNigeria\u2019s political elite who has made the country look big for nothing as their narcissistic political brinkmanship and chicanery continue to chisel away the key fundamentals and essentials of a democratic and socially inclusive political order, robbing the country the international prestige it rightfully deserves.\n\nThe world knows that only lip service is paid to basic functional tenant of democratic process. The impunity and avarice of the elite for primitive accumulation trump all considerations of open and transparent process. The loud nose of democratic triumphalism made in the open is underwritten by the dark alley of conspiratorial transactions in which the commonwealth of the country is routinely vandalized for the pleasure of the hedonistic instincts of the insensitive clique and cabals that dot the political landscape. Despite the existence of political parties as a framework for broad aggregation and articulation of public interests in the open public space, the political elites operate and function in pockets of cliques and factions. Democracy has become increasingly a charade and hidebound, under which the worst form of social exclusion of the majority of Nigerians are practiced.\n\nBesides the traditional international organizations such as the United Nations, Africa Union, Commonwealth of Nations, ECOWAS, Nigeria has been largely absent in many of the contemporary international institutions and several of its outreaches that focuses on contemporary issues of emerging global economic and financial structures and rules. Since the return of civil rule in 1999, the country punches far below its weight in comparison to strategic endowment of human capital and material resources. Because of the nature of the opaque political process in Nigeria\u2019s democracy largely defined by clandestine trade-offs rather than open, transparent process underwritten by rules and procedure, the country has not enjoyed the international prestige it naturally deserves.\n\nKey institutions of the state and supporting public bureaucracy are riddled with debilitating cronyism and therefore incredibly low in service delivery.\n\nIt is hard for the world to understand how a key crude oil producing country does not have a functionary refinery and how the turn-around maintenance of the existing old ones became a nestle of open corruption. It confounds the rest of the world that more than two decades of supposedly elected, accountable and responsible government, the output of energy or electricity is far below what is generated to power some international airports of several countries and yet billions upon billions naira have been pumped into the sector.\n\nThe abuse of public office by elected officials in creating phantom positions to accommodate cronies and frit away public funds to maintain ludicrous opulence is typical affront on democratic accountability. The world is aware of the debilitating and crushing poverty that exists among majority of Nigerians and the revolts of the largely excluded youths resulting in unending insurgency, banditry kidnapping and even campaign of secession.\n\nThe political class routinely punches holes in the national treasury through massive expansion of governance without corresponding output in terms of service delivery. Nigeria has unique notoriety of the most expansive and expensive governance structures and institutions, but Nigerians are among the least recipients of any dividends of diligent governance. Under the system of liberal democracy in Nigeria, its key pillar of periodic elections is the equivalent of periodic war-fare. Parties function like Mafia organizations especially during elections and extant rules are trampled without consequences. Naturally, a democratic process, even flawed ones bring state officials closer to the domain of accountability and this in turn energizes public enthusiasm which keys into a shared vision of progress and development even, at a modest pace. In the case of Nigeria, no such social compact exists and the disconnect between the formalistic of democracy and democratic practice has widened to irreparable gulf.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAppointments into public offices and even of strategic ones that require a high degree of competence are routinely doled out for patronage.\n\nAs a rule, the integrity and credibility of institutions of the state in Nigeria are under routine assault by battery of abuses by that make them increasingly hollow by the political elites who define their power only in the context of being above the law, including rudimentary traffic rules\n\nAs the world largely knows that beyond lip service, democracy in Nigeria at least in the past 21 years is in chains.",

          "title": "Creativity as new superpower without borders",
          "text": "By Taiwo Akerele\n\nTransiting through North Africa, on my way to the United States in the early summer, gave me an opportunity to digest a non-fiction book, titled the Silk Road: A new History of the World written by John Koparkan, a renowned historian at the Worcester College Oxford, published in 2015.\n\nThe summary of the book is that for thousands of years, the world has been ruled and dominated by very powerful individuals who built empires and conquered kingdoms. Territories and treaties were either peacefully signed or cities were violently taken over. Millions of people were forced to pay taxes and royalties to those who have more power and exert influence rather than those who should legitimately do.\n\nThe book also tried to explain, that outside of Europe, there was a significant trading and buoyant economic system, that existed in the Persia Empire which in turn spurned the economic and industrial growth in Europe centuries later.\n\nIt depicted the very powerful Persia \u2013 the present day Iraq, the Roman Empire, the Portuguese conquest of the East Atlantic, the exploits of the Mongolian war lords, under Ghenkis Khan and his very powerful successors such as Ogedei that ruled between 1221 and 1241, the role of Christopher Columbus in the discovery of the new world and the very innovative Spanish Kingdoms that established forts and military bases in Southern America.\n\nThe conquest of China, and the rise and fall of Constantinople present day Istanbul.\n\nI was proud as an African, reading about the Songhai Empire and the rich gold of Mali and the generosity of King Mansa Musa who \u2018literally dashed\u2019 gold to everybody on his trip to Mecca and Medina. This book also painfully detailed how slavery started with millions of Africans forcefully sold into slavery in far flung places such as Spain, North and South America.\n\nThe inspiration, one got from this very inspiring and well researched book, is that for centuries, the world has been shaped to be ruled and governed by those who have the instrument of force and power, of cohesion, this has later been reduced to a few persons coming together to draft a document on behalf of others and call it the constitution. Such is the new world order, that has replaced the use of force and physical conquest, which has seemingly brought relative peace to the world as against the old order of wars and warlords and the medieval era that was described by the English Philosopher Thomas Hobbes as short, nasty and brutish etc.\n\nWhile it is instructive to note that, yes, the world may have moved from the era of physical warfare rulership, to colonialism and now to constitutionalism, self-rule, sovereignty and independence, territorial integrity and institutional order. A vast majority of government and people across the world are yet to wake up from their slumber that a new world order has emerged albeit without territory or physical government and a capital devoid of the different arms of government as evidenced in the era that is gradually going obsolete.\n\nThe era of government of creativity and innovation has gradually crept in without the shot of a bullet, chaos and wars as often witnessed during violent change in the society. Yet, it has conquered the world. The influence and power of the innovation government didn\u2019t dawn on the world and its people until December of 2020, when Facebook and Twitter deleted the posts of the President of the United States Donald Trump. Till date, the ex-president is still on suspension by Facebook.\n\nFunny enough, as recently as June, the all-powerful Twitter also deleted the tweet by Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari which was considered as offensive and violating the policies and ethics of the organisation. Trust my country, we quickly suspended the operations of twitter in Nigeria amidst huge outcry of some segment of the Civil Society and youths across Nigeria. Twenty years ago, whoever thought that the Nigerian president will depend on twitter to address citizens? Not only that, whoever thought that there will be an organisation that will dare suspend the president of the United States from using its platform to share his views?\n\nAre we still debating that power has indeed changed hands in the 21st century and the world affairs are no longer being influenced by the United Nations or the G7 or China alone, but by young boys and girls sitting down behind their laptops in San Jose and San Francisco and in the Silicon valley deploying useful applications and re-writing the whole concept of human rights, governance, technology, determining trade volumes and financial systems, balance of trade, maritime and services worth billions of dollars on a daily basis across the globe.\n\nAre we still in denial that there is a new government and power in our hands other than the conventional government? This is government of technology, innovation and creativity. When will Africa key into the evolving new world order and invest in its own future influenced by technology and creativity? How much of our annual budget goes into research and development?\n\nAre our youths still regarded as lazy? Do we still rely on oil to fund our whole existence? Are we going to continue with poverty alleviation programs as against wealth creation programs? Are we still going to continue with the culture of \u2018empowerment\u2019 where billions are wasted purchasing Keke NAPEP, sewing machines and grinding machines for a group of people that could be deployed into commercial agriculture and its value chain? what is happening to the small and medium scale sector of the economy?\n\nIt was widely reported in October 2020 that Paystack, a startup built by Nigerians was purchased for $200m (approximately N85b) by an American technology firm, Stripe. You would think that the Nigerian government should be interested in this business that has made a foreign firm commit such a huge amount of resources into purchasing it, but I guess we are not there yet. You would think that the Nigerian government will conduct a follow up mechanism with those talented young men and others scattered across Lagos and other cities to ensure their knowledge is further tapped for the development of the nation.\n\nIn context, how many Nigerian government owned agencies or parastatals can boast of generating N85bn in a year? Rather, 70% of these agencies including the almighty Nigerian National Petroleum Cooperation (NNPC) run at a loss and they are subsidised by the government at huge cost to the already overburdened taxpayers. The records are there.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHow many potential Twitter and Facebook developers do we have in our country that will be so powerful and influential to the extent of deleting our president\u2019s post without showing some form of respect for \u2018Baba\u2019?\n\nThe world has evolved. What is confronting us today is innovation and creativity arrogance. They are knowledgeable; they are dynamic; the world depends on them for business and communication. Their annual profits run into billions of dollars more than the size of most African countries combined.\n\nThey are the new Roman Emperors of the 21st century; they represent present day Buddha as millions of young people across the world will rather literarily worship Facebook and Twitter and WhatsApp rather than go to church or any place of worship, after all, the Bible is on google and religious leaders tweet sermons on a daily basis. They remind one of the biblical Pharoah who may never allow \u2018our people\u2019 to go except we develop and invest in our own platforms that could compete with others globally.\n\nThe new sheriffs of Twitter and Facebook are more than the anti-ballistic missiles that we heard was deployed during the Operation Desert Storms in the 90s, their decisions or indecisions could send capital markets crashing, the price of gold and crude oil and cocoa could be determined by what is allowed to be posted or tweeted, fake or real news.\n\nIn the same vein, wars could be ignited and indeed many crises have erupted across some countries in the past, due to what was posted on social media. And peace accords have also been reached via these platforms in the recent past. What else can we say? Do we still have a choice other than the choice of confronting the obvious, to avoid social collapse, embrace the new King, technology, research and data mainstreaming, invest in young persons, and an open university system that prioritises academic freedom, open learning, scholarship and global competitiveness?\n\nIn a recent report by the Debt Management (DMO) office, the Nigerian government is said to be exposed to both local and foreign lenders to the tune of USD$84bn. In the detailed analysis of the sectoral distribution of the credit/loans, zero dollars was committed to funding research and development in any of the Nigerian universities, zero naira was committed towards the funding of start-ups scattered across the country, same with funding of exchange programs for young persons, same was observed for biotechnology and allied activities. These trends can be reversed within the next five years and the country will be on its path of growth and development so that those \u2018small small\u2019 boys sitting down in Silicon Valley will not delete the president\u2019s post at their whim. \u2019Who dem be\u2019 is a question we can only ask \u2018if we get ourselves right\u2019",

          "title": "Uproar over plan to reopen grazing route",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu Noah Ebije, Kaduna and Paul Osuyi, Asaba\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s pronouncement last week that his administration would reinstate cattle routes and grazing areas across the country to ensure herders have free access for their animals have continued to generate flaks\n\nIn apparent response to the ban on open cattle grazing by the 17 Southern governors, the president said when the governors gave the directive that open grazing would be banned, he referred them to the gazette that makes provisions for cattle routes and open grazing areas. He then said he has resolved to revive those routes and grazing areas in the country to resolve the issue.\n\n\u201cWhat I told the governors was to ask them to go and dig up the gazette. There are certain routes and grazing areas so that when cattle rearers were moving from the north to the west, they were allowed to go through there. But if you allow your cattle to stray into any farmer\u2019s farm, you are arrested and the farmer is invited to submit his claims. Those who encroach on these cattle routes and grazing areas would be dispossessed.\u201d\n\nHowever, in separate reactions, Arewa, Igbo and Yoruba groups roundly condemned the statement saying the move rather than resolve the issue would exacerbate it.\n\nAs far as the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) is concerned, reactivating open grazing routes may cause legal and security problems.\n\nSpokesman forf the group, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, in a telephone interview, reminded the president that the 1999 Constitution gives state governors powers cover land and to even revoke federal land.\n\n\u201cThe reactivation of open grazing routes in southern part or any other parts of the country is problematic both in legal terms and security. I would have said the best way to go is for us to seek legal interpretation beyond the Office of the Attorney General. The Federal Government can actually sue governors that ban open grazing and the court will rule whether they are right or wrong.\n\n\u201cI will reserve final judgment on the president\u2019s position. We caution that there is more to open grazing than availability of land and routes. It is not about opening the grazing routes, it is also about the security of the cattle and herders, and getting the support of communities that they will go through. Our open grazing requires political will. The Federal Government has already adopted the National Livestock Transformation programme to equip the Fulani. We, in the North, are in favour of ban of open grazing but we want it to be done in phases, in an orderly manner that does not harm the cattle and the Fulani. We also support the active intervention of the Federal Government, the northern governors and everybody to make sure that in the next one year or two, open grazing is abolished completely. I think this is the way to go.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Association of South East Town Unions (ASETU) in collaboration with other respected Igbo groups, including Nzuko Umunna, Aka Ikenga, Igbo World Assembly (IWA), World Igbo Congress (WIC), Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), Ekwe Nche, European Igbo Communities, Igbo Board of Deputies, Council of Igbo States in America, Nkata Ndi Inyom Igbo and South East Community Youth Leaders, rose from a one-day emergency security meeting with a vow to resist open grazing in the region.\n\nThe coalition warned that governors in the zone who fail to implement the ban would be treated as foes.\n\nNational President, ASETU, Chief Emeka Diwe who made their position known, said the meeting totally condemned the continued attacks by killer herdsmen in Igbo communities and urged governors to rise to the occasion and protect their people.\n\nStressing that the primary purpose of political governance was the security of lives and property, the Igbo groups charged governors who had not kick-started the processes of enacting anti-open grazing laws, to as a matter of urgency, send Executive Bills to their respective Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cOur position is very clear, which is the stand of Ndigbo; we say no to open grazing and are not making any pretences about that. We insist that any cattle in the South East must be ranched. So, we urge all nomadic herders to leave our land. We also urge our governors to do everything possible to implement the ban on open grazing. In fact, Ndigbo will treat any governor who fails to carry out this heartfelt desire and demand as an enemy. We equally urge each state to have forest guards with legal backing to ensure that our forests do not harbour terrorists and criminals,\u201d Diwe said.\n\nThe groups regretted that President Muhammadu Buhari who had never spoken strongly against the atrocities of Fulani herdsmen and bandits was threatening to visit another festival of blood on the Igbo.\n\nADF recalled that it had been in the forefront of the agitation for the banning of open grazing in Igboland since 2015, hence its insistence on the enactment of anti-open grazing laws as the most potent strategy to prevent armed Fulani herdsmen from overrunning the Southern states.\n\nIts spokesman, Abia Onyike, said the law to be passed in the State Houses of Assembly should be accompanied by clear modalities, instrumentalities and machineries for their enforcement. He added that the effectiveness of this move depended on the synergy between the governors, the legislators and the people, including the civil society organisations.\n\nSimilarly, the pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, said the president\u2019s pronouncements fell far short of what was expectation.\n\n\u201cWe have some questions for Mr. President and the Attorney General in this respect. One, who created the so-called grazing routes? At what time in our history did our founding fathers gather to designate specific routes from the north to the south as \u2018grazing routes\u2019? Two, assuming without conceding, that there were so-called grazing routes, what would now happen to structures that have been built in areas where the so-called routes are to be re-opened? Would such structures, including residences and factories be pulled down so that cows would have places to graze? Compared to what would be lost economically, socially, politically and in security terms if these structures are to be pulled down, is it not better to encourage the building of ranches? We can go on and on.\u201d\n\nAfenifere claimed President\u2019s pronouncement on open grazing and his confession on how he determines who occupy positions at the national level seems to indicate that Buhari\u2019s government is operating a constitution that is different from the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Section 2 of the Land Use Act, the law governing land matters in the country, vests the administration and control of lands in a given state in the hands of the governor of the state. It is such that even when the Federal Government wants to use a portion of land, it has to seek the consent of the governor of the state concerned. Since most governors in the country have outlawed open grazing in their respective states, on which land does the Federal Government want to \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018re-open\u2019 its vaunted grazing routes? Why talking of grazing routes in this age when ranching is the fad in all civilised climes?\u201d\n\nThe group claimed President Buhari seems to derive pleasure in shifting blames and responsibilities when pressed on what his government ought to do.\n\nUnknown persons threaten mayhem in Delta\n\nMeanwhile, unknown persons, yesterday, raised the tension in Delta State as they threatened to attack Asaba, the state capital, and Agbor, if Governor Ifeanyi Okowa does not withdraw his support for the ban on open grazing within 72 hours.\n\nAn unsigned letter containing the threat was pasted in strategic locations in Asaba including the fence of the Living Faith Church (Winners Chapel) at Infant Jesus Road.\n\nThe letter titled \u2018Fulani Jihadist Warning: An Open Message of 2 Paragraphs to Delta State\u2019 dated June 13, 2021 warned that \u201cfailure to adhere to this demand for been the host of the 17 governors, Delta State, most likely the city of Asaba and Agbor, shall encounter severe consequences than that of Bornu, Kebbi, Kastina, Kaduna, Enugu, Benue, Oyo and many more that will not respect the Fulani\u2019s heritage, as we take responsibility for the detonate explosive uncovered in the state capital secretariat, which should serve as warning to the Delta State Government for what is to come, should the governor fail to abide to our demand.\u201d",

          "text": "From Agaju Madugba, Katsina\n\nKatsina Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has faulted President Muhammadu Buhari on reasons for worsening insecurity in the country.\n\nThe president had during a television interview last week attributed the menace to failure of states and local governments across the country to manage security issues in their respective domains.\n\nBut citing Constitutional provisions, Masari said it was wrong for anybody to blame states and local governments.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the Federal Government to ensure protection of lives and property of citizens in all nooks and cranny of the country. When you look at the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the issue of security is under the Exclusive List. So, it is the responsibility of the Federal Government and states can only complement and that\u2019s what we have always done and are still doing.\n\n\u201cFrom the local governments, we assist the police, the DSS, the NSDC. There may be states that do not complement efforts of the security agencies and perhaps those are the states that the president was referring to.\n\n\u201cBut sincerely speaking, based on provisions of the Constitution, the blame should go to the Federal Government for the general state of insecurity in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMasari said he was 100 per cent in support of the clamour for restructuring and devolution of more powers to states which should also entail enhanced revenue to the tiers of government to enable them adequately perform their constitutional roles.\n\nAccording to him, the establishment of a state police would enhance general security as the personnel will be expected to perform their defined roles without infringing on duties of the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cThe issue of a state police is part of what we are talking about and I am for it. All we need to do is to formalise activities of the vigilance groups and community policing and give them clear definitions on their limits and those of the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cWe have the Nigerian police and the NSDC that we currently support their operations and nothing stops a state police from coexisting side by side with the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cThe issue of security is actually the responsibility of everybody as we all have roles to play. It\u2019s not about the president or the governor or local government chairman or a legislator or minister.\n\n\u201cThese bandits and their informants have addresses. They live within the communities and the people know them and security has no colorations in terms of political party affiliations or religion.\n\n\u201cI am also 100 per cent for restructuring and devolution of powers or whatever you call it. If you devolve, states and local governments will have more financial independence. We should earn resources according to the size and economy of our states.\n\n\u201cDuring the First Republic, Emir of Kano was the highest paid because of the state\u2019s revenue base. What we have today as Katsina State was a province made up of Katsina and Daura emirates. They ran their civil service and police and prisons and judiciary then were under the Native Authority and they did well.\n\n\u201cThey built and managed schools. If it was done successfully then, who says it cannot be done today? We ought to take another look at the Constitution. With the right leadership and proper arrangement, these things are still possible.\n\n\u201cThere are some federal ministries with so many parastatals under each one. How can one person as minister provide effective oversight for these parastatals?\n\n\u201cWe should devolve more power to the states but in such a way that we don\u2019t have to weaken the authority of the Federal Government in terms of performing its constitutional responsibilities.\u201d",

Lukman, in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nThe former Edo governor said the earlier the APC-led government addressed the escalating agitations, the better to diffuse the kind of stresses the nation is passing through.\n\n\u201cLet me refer to just one aspect of what Governor Atiku Bagudu said. That is the document on true federalism which the party put together that passed through all the organs of the party. The executive of the party, the NWC, the Caucus, the NEC which is the highest organ of the party.\n\n\u201cWhy did we do it at that time? We did it because like, it is happening today, there was this cacophony of voices. Two people in the party could not agree on what they meant by restructuring. So, the party needed to take control of the debate, define the issues, proffer solutions and went so far as to have some drafts legislation. It is not by any chance a perfect document.\n\n\u201cBut it reflects then the thinking and the desires of the Nigerian people. Everybody kept quiet after we brought that document out, publicised it, held press conferences over it and most Nigerians were very, very happy. But once again, we did not make the kind of progress that we could have made and it has become once more, the topical subject in the Nigerian polity.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it has gone beyond us, we now have one or two things that did not happen before, people now wanting to disengage from the federation, which did not happen before and that is a warning sign. If a child ask for garri today you don\u2019t give him, tomorrow he may decide it\u2019s cake he wants and we must not, as political party, we must not as the government of the federation, give the impression that only military governments can fundamentally tamper with the basic structure of this nation.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Says reforms needed to reduce inflation, accelerate recovery\n\n\u2022Blames lack of economic opportunities for insecurity, criminality in Nigeria\n\n\u2022Moderation in food prices slows inflation to 17.93%\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe World Bank has stated that inflationary pressure in Nigeria has pushed about seven million Nigerians below the poverty line in 2020 alone.\n\nThe World Bank gave the data in its latest Nigeria Development Update (NDU), released yesterday, a few days after President Muhammadu Buhari in his Democracy Day broadcast claimed on Saturday that his administration had lifted 10.5 million Nigerians out of poverty in the past two years.\n\nThe bank\u2019s Country Director for Nigeria, Mr. Shubham Chaudhuri, while speaking on \u2018The Arise Xchange,\u2019 a programme of ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, also said lack of economic opportunities was contributing to the rising crime cases and insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nThe multilateral institution also reiterated the need for the federal government to set policy foundations for a strong recovery as well as to tame inflation.\n\nThe report was released on a day the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) announced that Nigeria\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures inflation dropped to 17.93 per cent (year-on-year) in May compared to 18.12 per cent in the preceding month.\n\nBesides, the World Bank also attributed the deteriorating security situation in Nigeria and rising criminality to a lack of economic opportunities in the country.\n\nThe NDU, titled: \u201cResilience through Reforms,\u201d stated that in 2020, the Nigerian economy experienced a shallower contraction of 1.8 per cent than had been projected at the beginning of the pandemic (3.2 per cent).\n\nIt said: \u201cAlthough the economy started to grow again, prices are increasing rapidly, severely impacting Nigerian households. As of April 2021, the inflation rate was the highest in four years. Food prices accounted for over 60 per cent of the total increase in inflation. Rising prices have pushed an estimated seven million Nigerians below the poverty line in 2020 alone.\u201d\n\nThe report acknowledged notable government\u2019s policy reforms aimed at mitigating the impact of the crisis and supporting the recovery, including steps taken towards reducing gasoline subsidies and adjusting electricity tariffs towards more cost-reflective levels, both aimed at expanding the fiscal space for pro-poor spending.\n\nIn addition, the report highlighted that both the federal and state governments cut non-essential spending and redirected resources towards the COVID-19 response.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, public-sector transparency has improved, in particular around the operations of the oil and gas sector,\u201d it added.\n\nThe report, however, said despite the more favourable external environment, with recovering oil prices and growth in advanced economies, a failure to sustain and deepen reforms would threaten both macroeconomic sustainability and policy credibility, thereby limiting the government\u2019s ability to address gaps in human and physical capital, which is needed to attract private investment.\n\n\u201cNigeria faces interlinked challenges in relation to inflation, limited job opportunities, and insecurity,\u201d Chaudhuri, said during the virtual presentation of the NDU.\n\n\u201dWhile the government has made efforts to reduce the effect of these by advancing long-delayed policy reforms, it is clear that these reforms will have to be sustained and deepened for Nigeria to realise its development potential,\u201d he added.\n\nThe latest Nigeria Development Update proposed a near-term policy option organised around three priority objectives: reduce inflation by implementing policies that support macroeconomic stability, inclusive growth, and job creation; protect poor households from the impacts of inflation, and facilitate access to financing for small and medium enterprises in key sectors to mitigate the effects of inflation and accelerate the recovery.\n\n\u201cGiven the urgency to reduce inflation amidst the pandemic, a policy consensus and expedite reform implementation on exchange-rate management, monetary policy, trade policy, fiscal policy and social protection would help save lives, protect livelihoods, and ensure a faster and sustained recovery,\u201d World Bank Lead Economist for Nigeria and co-author of the report, Marco Hernandez said.\n\nIn addition to assessing Nigeria\u2019s economic situation, the NDU discussed how the COVID-19 crisis has affected employment, how inflation is exacerbating poverty in Nigeria, how reforming the power sector can ignite economic growth and how Nigeria can mobilise revenues in a time of crisis.\n\nLack of Economic Opportunities Fuelling Insecurity, Criminality in Nigeria, Says W\u2019Bank\n\nWhile speaking on \u2018The Arise Xchange,\u2019 a programme of ARISE NEWS Channel, Chaudhuri said lack of economic opportunities was contributing to the rising crime cases and insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, due to the level of poverty, many people will try to find a way to getting by however they can, and if criminality offers an option, then they will embrace it.\n\nThis, he stated, in turn, makes it difficult for businesses to operate and has a multiplier effect on the country\u2019s economic growth potential.\n\nResponding to a question on at what point he thinks the country would begin to lift its citizens out of poverty, he said: \u201cThe simple and complicated answer to that question is as soon as Nigeria chooses to. It really is Nigeria\u2019s choice. The potential is there and the resources can be directed towards that effort.\n\n\u201cUltimately, it would be the private sector that would create the jobs by investing and it is the government that invests in the people by making sure that every Nigerian child has education and the right healthcare. So, these are the things that lead to sustained poverty reduction. In any way, these are simple things in terms of what needs to be done and what is often complicated is generating the consensus around them and actually implementing it.\n\n\u201cSo, we believe Nigeria has the potential to lift 100 million of its citizens out of poverty by 2030 as President Buhari has said. But that decision has to be Nigeria\u2019s choice right now.\u201d\n\nHe, however, commended Nigeria\u2019s fiscal and monetary authorities for undertaking \u201cbold reforms in the face of vocal opposition.\u201d\n\nHe cited the reforms to include the central bank\u2019s recent adoption of the NAFEX rate, which is the rate at the Investors and Exporters\u2019 Window.\n\n\u201cWe believe that would help to boost investor\u2019s confidence, boost the competitiveness of the economy and if combined with other measures, would add more flexibility on the rate. That I think would set the foundation for a strong economic recovery.\n\n\u201cIn collaboration with everything, the fiscal authorities are doing both in terms of mobilising domestic revenue and rationalising expenditure at a time when much-needed resources are needed to combat the pandemic, that coordination would be critical,\u201d he said.\n\nChaudhuri also stressed the need for establishing a more systematic coordination mechanism between fiscal and monetary policy managers, as is being done in a range of countries around the world.\n\nHe stated that in such coordination, communication would be critical.\n\n\u201cWe are in a situation that is unprecedented across the world and it would require support from all members of the society. That is why we believe that communication is essential in anything that the government does,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his contribution, World Bank Lead Economist for Nigeria and co-author of the NDU, Marco Hernandez said: \u201cTo achieve Nigeria\u2019s potential is not up to one government.\u201d\n\nThis, according to the economist, will require sustained action from subsequent governments.\n\n\u201cSo, it is important that the citizens take part so that they can monitor progress and make suggestion going forward,\u201d he added.\n\nModeration in Food Prices Slows Inflation to 17.93%\n\nMeanwhile, the CPI, which measures inflation, dropped to 17.93 per cent (year-on-year) in May compared to 18.12 per cent in the preceding month, according to the NBS.\n\nThe 0.19 per cent decline in the headline index, makes it the second consecutive month that the rate has sustained its downward trajectory after 18 months of inflationary pressures on the economy.\n\nAccording to the CPI figures for May, food inflation dropped to 22.28 per cent from 22.72 per cent in April.\n\nPrice moderation was recorded in bread, cereals, milk, cheese, eggs, fish, soft drinks, coffee, tea and cocoa, fruits, meat, oils and fats and vegetables.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, the food sub-index declined to 1.05 per cent in May from 0.99 per cent recorded in the preceding month.\n\nOn the other hand, core inflation, which excludes the prices of volatile agricultural produce rose to 13.15 per cent from 12.72 per cent in the review period.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, the core sub-index increased by 1.24 per cent, the NBS stated.\n\nThe highest increases were recorded in prices of pharmaceutical products, garments, shoes and other footwear, hairdressing salons and personal grooming establishments.\n\nOthers are furniture and furnishing, carpet and other floor covering, motor cars, hospital services, fuels and lubricants for personal transport equipment, cleaning, repair and hire of clothing, other services in respect of personal transport equipment, gas, household textile and non-durable household goods.\n\nThe NBS said core inflation was highest in Kogi with 25.13 per cent; Bauchi, 23.02 per cent and Sokoto 20.11 per cent. Katsina, with 15.69 per cent; Imo, 15.52 per cent and Delta, 14.85 per cent recorded the slowest rise in headline year-on-year inflation.\n\nSimilarly, food inflation was highest in Kogi 32.82 per cent, Kwara 26.02 per cent and Enugu 25.43 per cent. Akwa Ibom, at 20.06 per cent; Bauchi, 18.65 per cent and Abuja 16.91 per cent recorded the slowest rise in year-on-year inflation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "CBN Seeks to Slash Importation by 35%",
          "text": "James Emejo\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday said efforts are ongoing to reduce the country\u2019s import bill by about 35 per cent.\n\nHe said President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s insistence about five years ago on the diversification of the country\u2019s economic base had already started to yield positive results.\n\nThe CBN governor, while receiving a delegation from the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG), led by its governor, Mr. Buah Saidy, on a two-day working visit to the country, stated that the country currently has the potential to export and earn foreign currency from the production of urea for local production of fertiliser as well as petroleum product as soon as the Dangote refineries goes into operation by the first quarter of next year.\n\nThis, he said would help to reduce importation by about 35 per cent.\n\nHe said a country with a population of over 200 million should have food security, pointing out that this was why the CBN was aggressively looking into the area of food and, \u201cwhere we can use our own available raw materials to produce what we need in our country\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd we believe with time Nigeria will really be a greater country than it is today. We don\u2019t think we are great yet because we have a high import dependence in the country and we are doing everything possible to reduce imports.\n\n\u201cBut like you know, when we are able to reduce imports, encourage exports and encourage consumption spending and investment, those are some of the parameters that will ultimately boost our economy so that we can continue to see rapid growth in our GDP and see prosperity for our people.\u201d\n\nHe also told the visiting team that the apex bank has vast experiences in IT and cybersecurity, adding that its infrastructure had been proven to be impregnable to hackers.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere were some protests sometime last year and when the protest was going on we saw that people were trying to hack into systems and they tried to hack into the CBN systems.\n\n\u201cI got a message that the CBN system had been hacked into and I said the CBN system cannot be hacked into. I called our director in charge of IT and she responded that we have enough firewall that prevented the hack into our system. So those are the kinds of experiences we can share with you though expensive but will share then with you and think of how to work together to collaborate with yours.\u201d\n\nHowever, Saidy, who also said the CBG was having a difficult time regulating the banks in the Gambia especially in the areas of meting out sanctions to erring financial institutions had further sought to know the magic which the CBN had adopted to sanction banks\u2019 executives without repercussions.\n\nResponding, however, Emefiele attributed the successes to the support which the apex bank had enjoyed from the National Assembly.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the issue of the CBN independence, I thank you for the kind words. But I think the point is that we thank our own parliament. Our parliament has been extremely supportive of the CBN.\n\n\u201cThey put in place a central bank Act that grants independence to the CBN and we have our Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act that also grants a lot of power and authority for the CBN to bite when we find people who want to take advantage of the system for their own personal benefit and we don\u2019t breed any nonsense about people who try to take advantage of our system for their personal benefits.\n\n\u201cEverything must be done keeping in mind the overall national goals and objectives and that is why the CBN will act very fast on any economic agent that tries to undermine our policies and that\u2019s why we are very firm on them.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWorking with your parliamentary I believe you can have laws that can give you the kind of independence that you need in any, practically most of the central banks in the world today have independence that gives them the power to be able to manage monetary policy in a way that is beneficial to their countries and economy.\u201d\n\nEmefiele also said the apex bank was doing everything possible, apart from looking at currency adjustment when necessary, to confront issues of supply management and ensure that economy grows.\n\nHe said the CBN had adopted demand management strategies that will help to curtail imports and ensure that some of those goods that can be produced locally are not imported.\n\nMeanwhile, there are strong indications that CBN may seal an agreement with the Central Bank of the Gambia (CBG) to undertake the printing of legal tender for the latter.\n\nThis followed a request by the CBG for a possible collaboration as it seeks to address acute currency shortages in the country.\n\nAlready, Emefiele, while receiving a delegation, assured that the CBN has extremely competitive advantage to manage the currency printing job for The Gambia.\n\nHe said the Nigerian Security Printing and Minting Plc which was established in the early 1960s had been printing currency for the country, adding that the facility has a lot of idle capacity to satisfy the demand of the CBG.\n\nAmong other considerations, Saidy had informed the CBN governor that it is currently costly and unsustainable for the Gambia to continue to rely on its printer \u2013 De La Rue of London \u2013 for its currency needs.\n\nHe added that the distance coupled with some logistics and resource constraints had partly led to a current situation whereby the country had witnessed acute shortage of currency with the attendant implications for the economy.\n\nEmefiele, nevertheless, said: \u201cI note your point on currency management. The Nigerian mint was set up in the early 1960s and we\u2019ve been producing our currency since the early 60s and we have a lot of idle capacity to ensure that instead of you going to Europe or other countries, you will be able to benefit from our ideas.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cOur colleagues will take you to the security printing facility. Our colleagues that came in from Liberia two months ago were fascinated by the kind of facilities, we have at our Nigerian security printing and minting facility and I am sure that you will also enjoy them.\n\n\u201cAnd I am sure they will follow you back to the Gambia to see how they can help you to structure your economic order quantities so we can also be of assistance in printing your currency.\n\n\u201cAnd I can assure you that we can be extremely competitive if only from the stand point of logistics and freight from Europe but it\u2019s just going to be a few hours from here to the Gambia and the rest of them.\u201d\n\nThe CBG governor had further explained that it costs the bank about \u00a370,000 to lift printed currencies from Sri Lanka to the Gambia.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe also need assistance in currency management. Right now we have a situation where we are running very low on currency and at some point I get scared because we cannot at the central bank run out of currency completely as that will be a disaster.\n\n\u201cSo we want to learn from your estimate. We have a model but we have not looked at it yet \u2013 given to us by our printers \u2013 De La Rue. How they estimate the currency need of the country on yearly basis.\n\n\u201cBut I think it has some defects otherwise, the acute shortage we have currently would not have happened.\u201d\n\nSaidy said: \u201cWe placed an order for three years of currency to be printed but again, the contract with De La Rue since independence they have been printing our currency.\n\n\u201cYesterday in my interaction with the Deputy Governor, Mr. Kingsley Obiora, we realise that you print your own currency and I asked about security and he assured me that you have top of the line security features.\n\n\u201cSo this is another area I would want us to exchange ideas and have discussions on how possibly if we decide to go with you we can collaborate with your assistance to be printing our currency.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cAgain, it is closer, De La Rue is in London but they do the printing in Malta and also Sri Lanka. The last one was done in Sri Lanka.\n\n\u201cLifting those things all the way to the Gambia is costly because we had to do some emergency order and that cost was going to be on CBG but with negotiations and assuming then that we will give them this contract of three years of printing our currency, they now paid for the flight \u2013 about \u00a370,000 to lift those currencies to the Gambia.\u201d\n\nHe also said the CBG was in the country to benefit from the CBN\u2019s vast experiences on how it had successfully regulated the financial system and sought assistance in the areas of information technology, modernisation, cybersecurity, forex shipping and management, among others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Army chief says synergy now better among service chiefs\n\nDeji Elumoye and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday called for unity among West African States and those in the Sahel to deal with security challenges in their respective nations.\n\nAlso, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya, has said service chiefs now work in synergy, debunking insinuation that they failed in curbing the worsening insecurity in the country due to inter-agency rivalry.\n\nBuhari, while receiving the new Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for West Africa and the Sahel, Mahamat Annadif, at the State House, Abuja, said the security challenges were enormous and, there, required concerted efforts to tackle them.\n\nThe president, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, said: \u201cYou are our neighbour. You have vast experience on matters affecting the Sahel, having served for five years in Mali. I hope you will get the countries to work together to confront the issues affecting them.\n\n\u201cI hope under the auspices of UNOWAS, you will help get the problems sorted out. Most of them have to do with the instability in Libya, and it affects all of us.\u201d\n\nWhile describing the security challenges as \u201cenormous,\u201d Buhari added that the Boko Haram insurgency has ravished the lives and resources of Nigerians and inhabitants of some neighbouring countries while large swathes of Mali remain occupied by militants.\n\nHe promised Nigeria\u2019s support to Annadif to aid his new assignment.\n\nIn his remarks, Annadif said he was visiting shortly after his appointment because he recognised Nigeria\u2019s crucial role in West Africa.\n\nHe said the problems of the Sahel region were not new to him, which is why more than ever, he would depend on the help of Nigeria to succeed.\n\nSynergy Now Better among Service Chiefs, Says COAS\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya, has debunked the insinuation that the service chiefs failed to curb the worsening insecurity in the country due to lack of synergy among them.\n\nYahaya, who spoke while fielding questions from members of the House of Representatives Committees on Defence and Army at his screening, said there was synergy among the service chiefs.\n\nBuhari had appointed Yahaya to replace former COAS, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, who died in a plane crash in Kaduna.\n\nThe president consequently wrote to both chambers of the National Assembly, urging them to confirm Yahaya\u2019s appointment.\n\nAddressing the lawmakers, Yahaya said the job of securing the country was not a one man\u2019s job, adding that the service chiefs have always operated together, hence the composition of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Police, DSS and Civil Defence.\n\nHe said: \u201dAs we know, internal security is intelligence-driven operation. So we need others, including communities, including traditional rulers and all others who can provide information. We work together. At the army headquarters level here, all the service chiefs now luckily we were all mates in the academy. So there\u2019s not much gap. The CDS (Chief of Defence Staff) is a member of 34 regular course; we met him there.\n\nSo, at one time or the other, all of us were members of that academy together. The chief of naval staff and I were one time members of battalion. So, the synergy cannot be anything better now that we\u2019re brought up together; we have trained together.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on his plans to curb the worsening insecurity, the COAS said he would use his experience in the field over the years to make Nigeria safer.\n\nHe added: \u201dI joined the military 36 years ago, so, I brought along with me 36 years of military experience. I\u2019m abreast with the security requirements. I was involved in several security operations. The challenges we are facing now, all are characterised by these areas I mentioned, where I have first-hand information and have commanded troops and I administered them in achieving what we\u2019ve done.\n\n\u201cI believe I have the requisite requirements by the grace of God to now provide my services in this office of the Chief of Army Staff, if confirmed. What I brought is a wealth of experience and commitment. So I\u2019m committed and determined to provide my best and also having known what\u2019s required to achieve results.\u201d\n\nHe also appealed to all citizens for their support, adding that with the support of the people, Nigeria will win the fight against insecurity.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman, House Committee on Defence, Hon. Babajimi Benson, had said the insecurity bedeviling the country had cost it a lot both financially and in terms of human lives.\n\nHe tasked the COAS to bring to strive to end it.\n\nBenson said: \u2018This exercise comes at a very challenging time in the history of our dear country, Nigeria.\n\nOur nation has been besieged by several security issues across all the geopolitical zones with banditry, militancy and self-secessionists stretching our military to the extreme. The worst is the lingering insurgency in the North-east. This war has cost the country a lot both financially and in terms of human lives. This must stop. The Armed Forces of Nigeria needs to adopt innovative measures to curb the killings and wanton destruction of property as a result of these cases of insecurity.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, hope that, if confirmed, the new chief of army staff will do everything possible, working with other service chiefs, to bring this to an end.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says reforms needed to reduce inflation, accelerate recovery\n\n\u2022Blames lack of economic opportunities for insecurity, criminality in Nigeria\n\n\u2022Moderation in food prices slows inflation to 17.93%\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe World Bank has stated that inflationary pressure in Nigeria has pushed about seven million Nigerians below the poverty line in 2020 alone.\n\nThe World Bank gave the data in its latest Nigeria Development Update (NDU), released yesterday, a few days after President Muhammadu Buhari in his Democracy Day broadcast claimed on Saturday that his administration had lifted 10.5 million Nigerians out of poverty in the past two years.\n\nThe bank\u2019s Country Director for Nigeria, Mr. Shubham Chaudhuri, while speaking on \u2018The Arise Xchange,\u2019 a programme of ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, also said lack of economic opportunities was contributing to the rising crime cases and insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nThe multilateral institution also reiterated the need for the federal government to set policy foundations for a strong recovery as well as to tame inflation.\n\nThe report was released on a day the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) announced that Nigeria\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures inflation dropped to 17.93 per cent (year-on-year) in May compared to 18.12 per cent in the preceding month.\n\nBesides, the World Bank also attributed the deteriorating security situation in Nigeria and rising criminality to a lack of economic opportunities in the country.\n\nThe NDU, titled: \u201cResilience through Reforms,\u201d stated that in 2020, the Nigerian economy experienced a shallower contraction of 1.8 per cent than had been projected at the beginning of the pandemic (3.2 per cent).\n\nIt said: \u201cAlthough the economy started to grow again, prices are increasing rapidly, severely impacting Nigerian households. As of April 2021, the inflation rate was the highest in four years. Food prices accounted for over 60 per cent of the total increase in inflation. Rising prices have pushed an estimated seven million Nigerians below the poverty line in 2020 alone.\u201d\n\nThe report acknowledged notable government\u2019s policy reforms aimed at mitigating the impact of the crisis and supporting the recovery, including steps taken towards reducing gasoline subsidies and adjusting electricity tariffs towards more cost-reflective levels, both aimed at expanding the fiscal space for pro-poor spending.\n\nIn addition, the report highlighted that both the federal and state governments cut non-essential spending and redirected resources towards the COVID-19 response.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, public-sector transparency has improved, in particular around the operations of the oil and gas sector,\u201d it added.\n\nThe report, however, said despite the more favourable external environment, with recovering oil prices and growth in advanced economies, a failure to sustain and deepen reforms would threaten both macroeconomic sustainability and policy credibility, thereby limiting the government\u2019s ability to address gaps in human and physical capital, which is needed to attract private investment.\n\n\u201cNigeria faces interlinked challenges in relation to inflation, limited job opportunities, and insecurity,\u201d Chaudhuri, said during the virtual presentation of the NDU.\n\n\u201dWhile the government has made efforts to reduce the effect of these by advancing long-delayed policy reforms, it is clear that these reforms will have to be sustained and deepened for Nigeria to realise its development potential,\u201d he added.\n\nThe latest Nigeria Development Update proposed a near-term policy option organised around three priority objectives: reduce inflation by implementing policies that support macroeconomic stability, inclusive growth, and job creation; protect poor households from the impacts of inflation, and facilitate access to financing for small and medium enterprises in key sectors to mitigate the effects of inflation and accelerate the recovery.\n\n\u201cGiven the urgency to reduce inflation amidst the pandemic, a policy consensus and expedite reform implementation on exchange-rate management, monetary policy, trade policy, fiscal policy and social protection would help save lives, protect livelihoods, and ensure a faster and sustained recovery,\u201d World Bank Lead Economist for Nigeria and co-author of the report, Marco Hernandez said.\n\nIn addition to assessing Nigeria\u2019s economic situation, the NDU discussed how the COVID-19 crisis has affected employment, how inflation is exacerbating poverty in Nigeria, how reforming the power sector can ignite economic growth and how Nigeria can mobilise revenues in a time of crisis.\n\nLack of Economic Opportunities Fuelling Insecurity, Criminality in Nigeria, Says W\u2019Bank\n\nWhile speaking on \u2018The Arise Xchange,\u2019 a programme of ARISE NEWS Channel, Chaudhuri said lack of economic opportunities was contributing to the rising crime cases and insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, due to the level of poverty, many people will try to find a way to getting by however they can, and if criminality offers an option, then they will embrace it.\n\nThis, he stated, in turn, makes it difficult for businesses to operate and has a multiplier effect on the country\u2019s economic growth potential.\n\nResponding to a question on at what point he thinks the country would begin to lift its citizens out of poverty, he said: \u201cThe simple and complicated answer to that question is as soon as Nigeria chooses to. It really is Nigeria\u2019s choice. The potential is there and the resources can be directed towards that effort.\n\n\u201cUltimately, it would be the private sector that would create the jobs by investing and it is the government that invests in the people by making sure that every Nigerian child has education and the right healthcare. So, these are the things that lead to sustained poverty reduction. In any way, these are simple things in terms of what needs to be done and what is often complicated is generating the consensus around them and actually implementing it.\n\n\u201cSo, we believe Nigeria has the potential to lift 100 million of its citizens out of poverty by 2030 as President Buhari has said. But that decision has to be Nigeria\u2019s choice right now.\u201d\n\nHe, however, commended Nigeria\u2019s fiscal and monetary authorities for undertaking \u201cbold reforms in the face of vocal opposition.\u201d\n\nHe cited the reforms to include the central bank\u2019s recent adoption of the NAFEX rate, which is the rate at the Investors and Exporters\u2019 Window.\n\n\u201cWe believe that would help to boost investor\u2019s confidence, boost the competitiveness of the economy and if combined with other measures, would add more flexibility on the rate. That I think would set the foundation for a strong economic recovery.\n\n\u201cIn collaboration with everything, the fiscal authorities are doing both in terms of mobilising domestic revenue and rationalising expenditure at a time when much-needed resources are needed to combat the pandemic, that coordination would be critical,\u201d he said.\n\nChaudhuri also stressed the need for establishing a more systematic coordination mechanism between fiscal and monetary policy managers, as is being done in a range of countries around the world.\n\nHe stated that in such coordination, communication would be critical.\n\n\u201cWe are in a situation that is unprecedented across the world and it would require support from all members of the society. That is why we believe that communication is essential in anything that the government does,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his contribution, World Bank Lead Economist for Nigeria and co-author of the NDU, Marco Hernandez said: \u201cTo achieve Nigeria\u2019s potential is not up to one government.\u201d\n\nThis, according to the economist, will require sustained action from subsequent governments.\n\n\u201cSo, it is important that the citizens take part so that they can monitor progress and make suggestion going forward,\u201d he added.\n\nModeration in Food Prices Slows Inflation to 17.93%\n\nMeanwhile, the CPI, which measures inflation, dropped to 17.93 per cent (year-on-year) in May compared to 18.12 per cent in the preceding month, according to the NBS.\n\nThe 0.19 per cent decline in the headline index, makes it the second consecutive month that the rate has sustained its downward trajectory after 18 months of inflationary pressures on the economy.\n\nAccording to the CPI figures for May, food inflation dropped to 22.28 per cent from 22.72 per cent in April.\n\nPrice moderation was recorded in bread, cereals, milk, cheese, eggs, fish, soft drinks, coffee, tea and cocoa, fruits, meat, oils and fats and vegetables.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, the food sub-index declined to 1.05 per cent in May from 0.99 per cent recorded in the preceding month.\n\nOn the other hand, core inflation, which excludes the prices of volatile agricultural produce rose to 13.15 per cent from 12.72 per cent in the review period.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, the core sub-index increased by 1.24 per cent, the NBS stated.\n\nThe highest increases were recorded in prices of pharmaceutical products, garments, shoes and other footwear, hairdressing salons and personal grooming establishments.\n\nOthers are furniture and furnishing, carpet and other floor covering, motor cars, hospital services, fuels and lubricants for personal transport equipment, cleaning, repair and hire of clothing, other services in respect of personal transport equipment, gas, household textile and non-durable household goods.\n\nThe NBS said core inflation was highest in Kogi with 25.13 per cent; Bauchi, 23.02 per cent and Sokoto 20.11 per cent. Katsina, with 15.69 per cent; Imo, 15.52 per cent and Delta, 14.85 per cent recorded the slowest rise in headline year-on-year inflation.\n\nSimilarly, food inflation was highest in Kogi 32.82 per cent, Kwara 26.02 per cent and Enugu 25.43 per cent. Akwa Ibom, at 20.06 per cent; Bauchi, 18.65 per cent and Abuja 16.91 per cent recorded the slowest rise in year-on-year inflation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The federal government says Nigeria is scheduled to receive 3.92 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine by August.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking at a press briefing in Abuja on Tuesday, Faisal Shuaib, executive director of the National Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), said the federal government is working on ensuring that more people are vaccinated.\n\nHe said 1,978,808 first doses and 680,345 second doses of the vaccine have been administered across Nigeria, adding that due to requests, vaccination of the first dose which had been closed has now been reopened.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, urge all Nigerians who have received their first dose at least six weeks ago to visit the nearest vaccination site to receive their second dose, for full protection against COVID-19 on or before 25th June when we shall close the administration of the second dose,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRecall that we officially closed the vaccination for the first dose on 24th May, 2021. Since then, we have been inundated with request by Nigerians to be vaccinated. In response, we have decided to reopen vaccination for the first dose from today. For such persons, their second dose will be due in 12 weeks and by then we would have received the next consignment of vaccines.\n\n\u201cWe now have information that Nigeria will get 3.92 million doses of Oxford/Astrazeneca by end of July or early August. As we receive additional information on the exact dates in August, we will provide an update regarding timelines and details of this.\u201d\n\nShuaib noted that COVID-19 cases are on the rise in some African countries, and asked citizens to adhere to the safety protocol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWearing a face covering over your nose and mouth in public spaces can save lives. A curfew remains in place from midnight until 4am every day. Indoor gatherings must be limited to 50 people, and are only permitted if all attendees abide by social distancing and wear face masks,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, expressed delight that \u201crecent research from Public Health England (PHE) shows that the Indian (Delta) variant B.1.617.2 is 92% susceptible to Oxford/Astrazeneca\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore comforting to know that the vaccine used in Nigeria can protect against this variant that caused high morbidity and mortality in India,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers state, says it is wrong for President Muhammadu Buhari to abandon his constitutional responsibility of securing Nigerians for governors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring an interview with Arise TV on Thursday, Buhari said he told two south-west governors, who came to meet him in Abuja, to return to their states and tackle the security challenges their people are facing.\n\n\u201cI told them you campaigned to be elected and you are elected. I told them (to)go back and sort out themselves,\u201d the president had said.\n\nBut while inaugurating a road project in Etche LGA of Rivers on Tuesday, Wike said Buhari cannot shift the responsibility of securing Nigerians to governors when he is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement issued by Kelvin Ebiri, his spokesman, the governor was also quoted as saying that the Buhari administration lacks the strategy to restore peace across the country.\n\n\u201cMr President, you\u2019re the Commander- in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. You appoint Inspector General of Police (IG), you appoint the Chief of Army Staff, Chief of Naval Staff, the Commissioner of Police (CP), Director of Department of State Service (DSS) and other heads of security. Which one do we appoint? How can people appointed by Mr. President be under me?\u201d Wike asked.\n\n\u201cIt is not only to borrow money for Nigeria that you\u2019re in charge. You must also be in charge in other things including security. Who signed order 10? Is it the governors?

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s sole trade union in the telecommunications industry, the Private Telecommunications and Communications Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PTECSSAN), has threatened to go on a nationwide three-day warning strike over alleged violation of national labour laws by employers. This could result in a disruption to cellular and data services, and potentially affect the broader economy.\n\nIn a statement reported by local media, the association said it was embarking on the strike from June 16 to protest against \u201carbitrary sackings and casualisation\u201d as well as disregard for decent conditions of employment, among other allegations.\n\nAccording to reports, less than 5% of workers in the telecoms industry are hired on a permanent basis with most companies relying on subcontracting and outsourcing, a practice that shortchanges workers. Meanwhile, big telecom operators are reportedly laying off their managerial staff for reasons tied to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe association\u2019s president, Opeyemi Tomori, and General Secretary Okonu Abdullahi cited increasing precarious working conditions in the sector, such as disregard for occupational health and safety, lack of hazard allowance and poor remuneration, and the abuse of national laws and institutions by employers.\n\nPTECSSAN also alleged breaches of the freedom of association, the right of workers to organise, victimisation of union members, poor and discriminatory remuneration, abuse of the expatriate quota, intimidation, harassment and verbal assaults of employees, among other anti-labour practices.\n\nTelecom operators reportedly do not allow trade unionism and deny workers\u2019 rights to collective bargaining as spelled out in International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions.\n\nPTECSSAN demanded that HUAWEI Technologies Nigeria Limited, ATC, 9mobile, Globacom, Smile, IHS, Airtel, IPNX Nigeria, Spectranet, MAINONE, Ntel, Swift and other companies that have not allowed their employees to join labour unions should respect the right of the workers to freely associate with the association.\n\nLast year, the association clashed with MTN Nigeria over similar allegations, having accused the South African telco of discrimination against Nigerians and disregard of workers\u2019 rights. The Nigerian government had to step in to avert a strike action planned by the union.\n\nThe state might have to intervene in this case again due to the magnitude. If embarked on, the planned industrial action would be the first nationwide strike by workers in the telecoms industry. It is sure to disrupt services across the country, with potential huge losses for businesses and individuals.\n\nAffiliated with the National Labour Congress, PTECSSAN is one of the largest trade associations in Nigeria being the only union in the telecommunications sector. It has as members all the employees in the industry.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your whatsapp groups and telegram channels.",

          "text": "Fatura, a Cairo-based tech startup that connects wholesalers and manufacturers with retailers through a mobile application, on Monday said it has raised $3 million in pre-Series A funding. The round was co-led by Sawari Ventures and Arzan Venture Capital with participation from Egypt Ventures, EFG-EV, Cairo Angels, and Khwarizmi Ventures.\n\nThe company was founded in late 2019 by Hossam Ali, Ahmed Anwar, and Abdallah Moheb El-Din, and had previously raised an undisclosed amount of money in a seed round in July.\n\nFatura sells inventory to grocery retailers using a network of manufacturers and wholesalers in different industries. It has been operating in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector since its launch.\n\nThe startup uses an asset-light approach, which means it doesn\u2019t own any inventory and, through its mobile app, simply shares orders with producers and distributors who fulfil them.\n\nThere are currently over 500 sellers on the marketplace who have served 25,000 retailers through Fatura\u2019s platform in 20 governorates across Egypt. More than 10,000 stock keeping units (SKUs) are exchanged on the business-to-business (B2B) platform, which has already crossed 1 billion Egyptian pounds (about $64 million) in yearly gross merchandise value (GMV).\n\n\u201cThere is a great opportunity in the B2B space in Egypt that is growing as the players are becoming digitally mature and ready. Collectively, the digital B2B players in the FMCG space capture less than five percent of the market and there is a long way to go,\u201d Hossam Ali said in an official press release announcing the latest funding.\n\nAfter recording significant success in the consumer goods sector, Fatura is now running a pilot in other industries.\n\nIt has already introduced a digital lending service with a focus on retail financing and aims to add more services in that area in the near future. Beyond e-commerce and lending, the startup expects the investment to help it extend its services with a view to optimising the exchange of goods, money and information in the B2B context while focusing on convenience and user experience.\n\nThe startup plans to use the new funds to introduce services that support the different players in its ecosystem, offer several digitisation initiatives with a focus on digital payments, and expand to other countries in the North African region.\n\nOn the company\u2019s future expansion plans, the CEO said Fatura\u2019s conviction is to \u201cstay asset-light, be inclusive to all the industry stakeholders and to attract the best on-ground acquisition force across the country.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your whatsapp groups and telegram channels.",

          "text": "Ethiopia has announced a tender process for the sale of a 40% stake in state-owned telecommunications company, Ethio Telecom. That means potential investors can now register their interest starting Tuesday. This is the first stage in a lengthy process that will lead to the selection of a successful bidder.\n\nThe proposed minority sale of Ethio Telecom \u2013 the sole mobile services provider in a country of over 100 million people \u2013 is part of a broader plan to liberalise the country\u2019s monopolistic telecoms sector. In addition, two foreign carriers are to be granted licenses to operate in the hugely untapped market.\n\n\u201cThe government wants state-owned enterprises to be competitive and productive, the authorities\u2019 motivation for selling a part of Ethio Telecom to private operators,\u201d Deputy Director of Public Enterprises, Holding and Administration Agency, Zinabu Yirga, said at a press conference in the capital Addis Ababa on Monday. \u201cAs part of the broader opening up of the sector, Ethiopia is also moving to license private operators to compete with Ethio Telecom.\u201d\n\nAnnounced in 2019 and driven by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, the liberalisation plan has been met with several delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic and an internal crisis in the Tigray region.\n\nHowever, the plan has gathered pace over the past six months. In May, the government awarded one of the two available private operating licences to break up Ethio Telecom\u2019s monopoly on the sector.\n\nThe Global Partnership for Ethiopia, a telco-consortium led by Kenya\u2019s Safaricom, was announced as the winner after a successful bid of around $850 million. Meanwhile, a second offer of around $600 million from South Africa\u2019s MTN Group was deemed too low by the regulator, which is now preparing to reauction the final licence.\n\nAccording to Brook Taye, a senior advisor at the finance ministry, the 40% in Ethio Telecom will be sold as a single stake to a single investor. It is however unclear how much the stake would be worth but the tender process is sure to attract significant interest from many telcos around the world.\n\nThis is due to the attractiveness of Ethiopia\u2019s untapped telecoms market. In a population of over 100 million people, only about 20% have access to the Internet, less than 40% have a mobile phone and only 5.8% of the people use social media, according to a report from DataReportal.\n\nFounded in November 2010, Ethio Telecom currently has around 53 million subscribers and has since December generated a revenue of around $600 million. According to reports, the government plans to retain a 55% stake in the operator while the remaining 5% will be offered to domestic investors through an initial public offering.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your whatsapp groups and telegram channels.",

          "text": "A new online conversation App, tribe naija has berthed in the Nigerian online space. The App is a community-based platform specifically developed for Nigerians to network and have conversations on issues of common interest.\n\nThe tribe naija App was launched in Abuja on June 12, 2021 during the Fireside Chat event held at the Sheu Musa Yar\u2019Adua Centre in commemoration of Democracy Day.\n\nThe App, which is currently available for download on the Google Apps store and IOS for iPhone users is a brainchild of the Advocacy for One Nigeria Initiative, The Advocacy for One Nigeria Initiative\n\nSpeaking during the launch of the App, the founder, Advocacy for One Nigeria Initiative, Chief Kola Abiola, son of Late Chief MKO Abiola, winner of the June 12, 1993 election described the platform as a \u2018child of necessity\u2019 that has come to give Nigerians the opportunity to bring their voice together especially as it relates to issues that affect them.\n\nAccording to him, the creation of the App was informed by the need to use technology to promote cohesion and inclusion among Nigerians using some of the knowledge or lessons gained from political leaders and thinkers such as Moshood Abiola and Shehu Yar\u2019Adua among others while they were alive.\n\nAbiola noted that the tribe naija App, developed and designed by Mewa international LLC, is expected to serve as a safe haven for Nigerians to talk and be heard. He stressed that the platform would offer Nigerians regardless of age a forum to discuss and chat about all the issues affecting their well being as citizens.\n\nHe disclosed that the app is meant to drive like-minded conversations geared towards the improvement of the country and create a platform for them to prepare for a better future.\n\n\u201cBy speaking, we would erase the divide and understand each other better. I think to a great degree we would see that we have a lot more than we think we have in common and that is why this app has been developed. We have been working on the development of the app for more than 2 years even though I have been nurturing this idea ten years ago. On this app, there is a voice note. You can leave messages through voice notes. We are going to have language variations as we go along which I think is enormous\u2019 he added.\n\nAlso speaking, the technical consultant, Tribe Naija, Mr. Fady Khatib explained that the app is unique considering the value it is bringing to the table for Nigerians.\n\nHe stressed that the platform remains open to a wide range of matters for discussion including both cultural and scientific, adding that it is an ecosystem where one can come to a group and discuss mainstream and unconventional ideas.\n\nCommenting on the features of the platform, he disclosed that the application has many pockets and is designed to accommodate all methods of communication including voice chat adding that users can take part in any discussion without having to type.\n\n\u201cYou are in the comfort of your living room and would like to be part of the discussion, you can contribute using voice chat. Even while debating, you don\u2019t need to type. It is also a platform that enables users to dislike, like or get a reply on any topic under discussion\u201d, he added.\n\nHe further noted that the app has been built with user-generated pockets that allow each of the users to become the moderator of its own topic. He stated that though the platform was open to all classes of people, the conversation that goes on in the platform is guided by rules and regulations which every user must comply with.\n\n\u201cIt does not come without proper monitoring, When you are on such platform, you are guided by the rules and regulation of its operations,\u201d he said.\n\nThe technical consultant revealed that the platform precludes users from the opportunity to buy and sell but rather to pitch ideas or innovation.",

          "title": "Tips to help you stay safe online when transferring funds to & from Nigeria",
          "text": "Gbenga Okejimi, Country Manager for Nigeria and Ghana, WorldRemit\n\nNigeria remains the largest recipient of diaspora remittance in Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 in 2019, it received nearly half of the remittances sent to the region at $23.8 billion. Money transfers sent from Nigerians living and working in the diaspora have always been an important source of income for families and the Nigerian economy. According to PWC report titled \u201cStrength from Abroad\u201d, remittances can have a strong impact on development because of the ripple effect on consumption, investment and economic growth.\n\nTechnological innovations continue to ease the process of sending and receiving money, thus facilitating growth. Digital money transfer methods have made cross border financial transactions, and now, a process that could otherwise take days has been reduced to just a few minutes. The uptake of digital financial services at home means that more Nigerians can send and receive money from across the world. The process has been supported by favourable regulations from the Central Bank of Nigeria to boost remittances inflow.\n\nAs online payments continue to get faster and more convenient, and as Nigerians pivot to digital channels for remittance transfer, service providers must deliver secure connections for these digital transactions and reduce the risk of cybercrime.\n\nAt WorldRemit, we take very seriously the privacy and security of our customers. Our website and apps are designed to prevent accounts from unauthorized login attempts; we have strict verification processes to ensure that we correctly identify all of our customers and have a team of dedicated analysts who monitor transactions for signs of unusual activity.\n\nWe have provided a secure platform and developed a robust verification model but as a company that goes the extra mile we want our customers to stay aware of the following tips to avoid wahala:\n\nBeware of fake brands and businesses. A common trick involves impersonation, a user behind a fake social media account may attempt to convince you that they\u2019re someone they\u2019re not to gain your trust. Look out for catchphrases like \u2018invest and reap 10x return\u2019, once you\u2019ve parted with your money you\u2019re unlikely to be able to contact the fake account again. Verify users, brands and businesses before transacting with them. Where possible contact the brand directly via their website and ask for recommendations from trusted parties before making transactions or investments.\n\nDownload apps only from reliable sources. Make sure that you only download apps from reliable sources, make use of verified links from the organizations\u2019 websites and official social media accounts. Use your app store on Apple devices, or the google play store on Android devices, etc. Take extra care before downloading an app, confirm that it provides a service that is recognized by local and international financial services authorities.\n\nNever share your passwords and token codes. Legitimate financial services providers will never ask you to share your passwords, token codes or any other private information. While your credit or debit card pin can be used to complete payments online, and your Bank verification Number (BVN) might need to be submitted within an app or website, to digital financial services providers, in the process of setting up your personal account, you must never share these details via message requests from supposed providers. Go the extra mile and make sure the money transfer service is committed to protecting your personal data. At WorldRemit, our payment partners in recipient countries will verify your identity, while ensuring your data is protected at all times. We also respect privacy policies in line with the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) requirements and will never share data with any third party.\n\nConfirm the recipient\u2019s identity and channel. Always confirm the identity of your recipient, this is anyone seeking financial assistance from you or offering unsolicited investment opportunities. If you suspect that your emails have been hacked, confirm the transaction directly, or through a regulatory authority before completing the process. For transactions via WorldRemit, confirm the recipient\u2019s identity and how they will receive the money, whether it is cash pickup, mobile money, or bank transfer. Make sure you are using the beneficiary\u2019s full legal name, as the bank in the receiving country will match their identification with the transfer information.\n\nSpeed is of the essence. Pick a service that ensures your money reaches its intended destination quickly and securely. 90% of transfers made with WorldRemit are authorized within minutes. Also, check if the platform has a 24-hour customer care service that is operational. At WorldRemit, our customer service is available 24/7.\n\nTrack your money transfer. The part of the operation where most safety is required is in the monitoring of the transaction. When sending money, WorldRemit enables users to monitor the status of their transactions, providing senders as well as recipients with status updates along the way for peace of mind. Last year, WorldRemit launched a Transfer Tracker App which allows recipients of money transfers to track their funds. The app is free to download through the Google app store in a number of countries including Nigeria.\n\nDisclaimer: WorldRemit and its affiliates do not provide financial advice. This article has been prepared for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide, and should not be relied on for financial advice.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "On Monday, June 14, 2021, the Private Telecommunications and Communications Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PTECSSAN) \u2014 a union that protects the rights of telecom workers in Nigeria \u2014 announced plans to embark on a three-day warning strike.\n\nThe industrial action will start today, Wednesday, June 16, 2021. Reportedly, users may be unable to conveniently use data and call services during the three days as the strike is likely to disrupt these services.\n\nAccording to The Punch, PTECSSAN is embarking on the strike to express their concerns against what the General Secretary, Okonu Abdullahi, calls \u201carbitrary sackings and casualisations\u201d.\n\nAbdullahi said that workers are usually outsourced, which has caused a significant problem in the industry. And since it\u2019s a continual problem, workers are always shortchanged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent times, PTECSSAN has made demands and even threatened to go on strike regarding this problem. However, none of their demands has been met.\n\nIn August 2020, PTECSSAN threatened to go on a two-week warning strike over the remuneration of workers, employee relations practices, exit packages for long-term staff, and alleged abuse of expatriate quota, among others.\n\nMoreover, in March 2021, the telecom association planned to embark on industrial strike action against Huawei Technologies Nigeria Limited, a telecom equipment company. They kept denying workers the right to unionise.\n\nHowever, following the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami\u2019s intervention, that strike action was suspended. In a statement, he said that the telecom equipment company was ready to address the concerns PTECSSAN raised.\n\nThe strike action reportedly commencing today is against the precarious working conditions in the telecom sector like ignoring occupational health and safety, lack of hazard allowance and poor remuneration, and the abuse of national laws and institutions by employers.\n\nWhile the association may be protesting for its rights, the disruptions of data and call services may affect the Nigerian economy.\n\nYesterday, Tuesday, June 15, 2021, MTN reportedly said that due to insecurity in the country, service in Nigeria might be disrupted.\n\nWhat this means is that MTN\u2019s technical support team, in some cases, may not get to the site and achieve an optimum result timely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecall that we wrote that the Nigerian telecom lost 15.5 million mobile subscribers between December 2020 and March 2021 following the SIM registration ban. Therefore, this won\u2019t be the first disruption to the telecom sector in recent months.\n\nIn 2020, Internet shutdowns cost sub-Saharan Africa $237.4 million.\n\nAccording to Statista, as of January 2021, there were 4.66 billion active Internet users globally. In Nigeria, as of January 2021, there were 187.9 million mobile connections and 104.4 million people connected to the Internet, per Data Reportal.\n\nDeloitte\u2019s 2016 The Economic Impact of Disruptions to Internet Connectivity Report shows that in a low connectivity country, with a GDP per capita of $6,000, a population of c. 40 million people, and fixed broadband penetration of c. 5%, a temporary Internet shutdown could have an estimated GDP impact of c. $3 million per day of disruption, amounting a 0.4% of daily GDP.\n\nThis reveals the importance of the Internet to business today.\n\nWe reached out to MTN and Airtel, but as of press time, we are yet to receive a response.\n\nIt\u2019s not certain if Pantami will intervene this time, neither is it known if the industrial strike action will aid the association\u2019s demands.",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nFatura\u2019s latest funding round\n\nEthio Telecom\u2019s 40% stake sale\n\nYouTube\u2019s latest ad ban\n\nEgypt-based Fatura raises $3m pre-series A\n\nFatura Co-founders. Source:MENAbytes\n\nEgypt-based Business to Business (B2B) e-commerce platform, Fatura, announced a $3 million pre-series A round on Monday, June 14, 2021. Sawari Ventures and Arzan Venture Capital led the round.\n\nOther investors in the round include Egypt Ventures, The Cairo Angels, Saudi Arabia-based VC, Khwarizmi Ventures, and fintech-focused accelerator, EFG-EV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, a pre-series A round is fundraising done by a startup in the interim between the seed round and the series A round. In July 2020, the startup raised an undisclosed seed round, and this is their second funding round since then.\n\nFatura is a platform that sells grocery inventories to Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) retailers via a mobile application. With a network that connects manufacturers with wholesalers, the startup can meet those inventory needs. On the app, sellers can manage their pricing lists, manage stocks, and receive orders.\n\nThis latest funding will be used to expand to more cities in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The startup also plans to go beyond meeting retailers\u2019 need for FMCGs and create additional services like a digital payment platform to foster ease-of-business for retailers.\n\nCo-founded by Hossam Ali, Ahmed Anwar, AbdAllah Mohebeldin, and Ahmed Al Bakary \u2014 who joined the team later \u2014 Fatura launched in Cairo, Egypt, in 2020. So far, the startup has 500 sellers, wholesalers, distributors, and manufacturers on the marketplace, having provided service to 25,000 retailers across Egypt.\n\nThings have been quite interesting, as the MENA region\u2019s e-commerce sector has experienced steady growth. According to a Bain & Company report, it was worth $8.3 billion as of 2017, with an average annual growth rate of 25%, most of which Egypt accounts for.\n\nWith such significant growth, we could witness the rise of more startups with product offerings geared towards boosting Egypt\u2019s e-commerce sector.\n\nEthiopian government to sell 40% stake of Ethio Telecom\n\nThe Ethiopian Communications Authority (ECA) has launched a tender to aid the partial privatisation of state-owned telecommunication operator, Ethio Telecom. With this in place, interested private investors can apply, and the chosen bidder will own a 40% stake in Ethio Telecom.\n\nProspective investors have to go through a few stages, the first being submitting a special form-like request called Expression of Interest (EOI). Other stages in the process will be revealed later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthiopia is one of the few countries globally to have a monopoly on telecom providers. However, this move is part of plans to open up the country\u2019s largest and most lucrative sector to private investors.\n\nIn February, we reported that Kenyan telecom giant, Safaricom, was one of the final six companies shortlisted for bids on two telecom licences in Ethiopia. And they got it in May, alongside Sumitomo Corporation and the CDC Group.\n\nThis move to sell off a 40% stake to private investors further shows the country\u2019s commitment to encouraging healthy competition in the region, as shielding the sector from competition might slow down innovation.\n\nHowever, we shouldn\u2019t be quick to forget Ethiopia\u2019s erratic approach to Internet censorship,\n\nYouTube to ban certain topics from its masthead ad banner\n\nGoogle-owned video-sharing platform, YouTube, has made some updates to its masthead ad placement policies.\n\nBeginning from Monday, June 21, 2021, YouTube will not allow ads about alcohol sale, gambling, prescription drugs, elections, and politics to run on its homepage \u2014 the platform\u2019s biggest ad unit.\n\nPer Axios, this move is a part of Google\u2019s commitment to \u201cminimize confusion, misinformation and manipulation, especially surrounding sensitive events.\u201d\n\nOne might wonder if YouTube isn\u2019t too late to the party, as giant social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have since placed bans on ads related to political topics. This story gives further context to how these bans took effect during Nigeria\u2019s general elections in 2019.\n\nYou might want to make some excuses for YouTube. Perhaps, the platform wasn\u2019t as strongly exploited as Facebook and Twitter, so the need for permanent restriction measures didn\u2019t arise. However, they placed a temporary ban on political ads following the January 6 Capitol Insurrection.\n\nBut then, the best-performing videos on YouTube are usually longer than 10 minutes, enough time to capture nuance and context that Twitter and Facebook inherently can\u2019t.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\n#WorldBloodDonorDay: 5 startups improving access to safe blood in Africa.

          "text": "You don\u2019t need to be a medical expert to know the value of blood to humans. At a basic level, most people understand that the absence of blood in a human is fatal, yet blood donation rates in most African countries are low.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), about 112.5 million blood donations are collected worldwide. Still, more than half of this number is gathered in high-income countries \u2014 home to only 19% of the world\u2019s population.\n\nWorryingly, the United Nations estimates that more than 536,000 women die during childbirth, with 99% of them living in developing countries. Postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of deaths, responsible for 40% of maternal deaths in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nBlood donation and supply remain major challenges in Africa as health officials battle logistical problems and cultural barriers. Consequently, family and friends donate most of the blood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not sustainable as family and friends of accident victims, for example, may not be readily available to donate blood. Worse still, they may not be matching blood donors.\n\nSolving Africa\u2019s blood donation problem requires more than calling for voluntary donors. In most places, officials have to contend with superstitions or cultural limitations that make people unwilling to donate.\n\nAlso, the infrastructure needed to transport the blood is often absent in most parts of the continent. With Africa\u2019s infrastructure challenges, it is difficult to say how many lives have been lost because they lacked access to blood.\n\nWHO advises that most of the blood donated come from voluntary donors, but that is not the case in all countries, especially in developing ones.\n\nIn Nigeria, the National Coordinator of the National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS), Dr Omale Amedu, revealed that only 5% of the blood collected in the country were from voluntary donors, with the remaining 95% commercially provided.\n\nMost African countries can\u2019t meet their annual blood requirements and increase millions of women, children, and accident victims\u2019 risk of mortality (ROM). In 2016, WHO estimated that Africa only covered 50% of its blood requirements.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Ministry of Health, for example, reports that the country needs 2 million units of blood annually but only collects 60,000 units. Cameroon, on the other hand, needs about 400,000 units of blood but collects only 90,000 units. The trend of supply failing to meet demand is common across Africa.\n\nThe startups below are using technology to solve the problems blood banks and hospitals face and close the gap between supply and demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLifebank\n\nTemie Giwa-Tubosun founded Lifebank in 2016. After suffering complications during pregnancy and needing a blood transfusion in the United States, she began to think of the millions of women back in Nigeria who could have lost their lives if they had been in her shoes.\n\nIn a 2019 interview with CNN, the entrepreneur said, \u201cI realised after I had my son that the highest cause of maternal mortality is postpartum haemorrhage. The most important thing you can do when a mum is haemorrhaging is replacing the blood she has lost, even if you can\u2019t stop the bleeding.\u201d\n\nThis epiphany was all she needed to start Lifebank to connect blood banks with hospitals and their patients. Since its inception, the startup has reportedly served over 500 hospitals while maintaining a presence in Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nIt has also expanded its operations from moving only blood to other medical supplies like oxygen and blood products.\n\nThe startup has gained global recognition, with Facebook Founder, Mark Zuckerberg, commenting on the startup.\n\n\u201cThis is a thing [Lifebank] that needs to exist. If she can actually pull it off, she\u2019ll show a model that will impact not just Lagos, not just Nigeria, but countries all around the world.\u201d\n\nInfiuss\n\nWhile Cameroonian entrepreneur, Melissa Jane Bime, was in nursing school, a young girl at the hospital where she worked who had come down with malaria could not get a blood transfusion. She died as a result. Plasmodium falciparum is the most common malaria parasite in Africa accounting for 99.7% of estimated malaria cases in 2018. It multiplies very quickly, causing serious blood loss.\n\nBime would later ascertain that a hospital 20 minutes away had the right blood all along. That was all the motivation she needed.\n\nIn 2016, Bime started Infiuss, a blood bank management system that connects hospitals with blood banks with hospitals without a blood bank. The startup is the recipient of the 2018 Cartier Women\u2019s Initiative Award and was the grand prize winner of the 2018 Anzisha Prize.\n\nDamu-Sasa\n\nAfter Nairobi\u2019s Westgate terror attack in 2013, the government appealed for blood donations to save survivors. And thousands of Kenyans turned up, but there was a problem. Although many people around the country were willing to donate, logistical challenges meant that only those in Nairobi could.\n\nThis led Francis Kilemi and Aaron Ogunde to create a solution that leverages technology to solve the problems of sourcing and donating blood.\n\nWith help from Kenya\u2019s Information and Communication Technology Authority, the startup piloted the project in Kenyatta Hospital in 2017. Since then, their reach has spread to over 100 hospitals across Kenya.\n\nDamu-Sasa is a Kenyan healthtech startup that works across the blood ecosystem. It connects hospitals with blood banks or donors and assists in screening, tracking, storage, distribution, preparation of blood products, and inventory management.\n\nRedbank\n\nRedbank homepage\n\nFounded in 2014 by Francis Adereti, Toluwanimi Adeyanju, and Tunde Ojediran, Redbank functions quite similarly to Lifebank.\n\nHowever, in addition to a mobile app, blood requests can be made via SMS and voice calls. The startup matches received requests with the appropriate blood banks. And according to the company, people can expect responses within 30 seconds of making their requests.\n\nUnlike other startups in the space, Redbank does not handle deliveries. It only provides information on which blood banks have the blood that is needed.\n\nThe startup has increased its reach by striking partnerships with the Nigerian Red Cross Society and the Blood Bank Society of Nigeria.\n\nHaima Health Initiative\n\nHaima Health Initiative homepage\n\nBukola Bolarinwa is a lawyer and a recipient of the Queen\u2019s Young Leader Award. As a child, her parents often told her there were things she could not do. But it was not until she was older she learnt why \u2014 she had sickle cell disease.\n\nWhile in law school, she became friends with Nkechi Azinge, who would go on to found the Sickle Cell Aid Foundation (SCAF). During this time, Bolarinwa volunteered at hospitals and discovered that sickle cell patients frequently needed blood transfusions.\n\nHowever, the hospitals often lacked sufficient blood. This led her to start Haima Health Initiative, which has evolved into an online voluntary blood donor register. It organises blood drives and educates people on the benefits of blood donation.\n\nWhile these startups are doing their part in ensuring that blood and blood products are available to those who need them, the success of their efforts depends on regular voluntary donors. According to WHO, 90% of people eligible to donate blood aren\u2019t doing so.\n\nResearch shows that one donated unit of blood can save up to three lives. We can\u2019t all build startups that save lives, but we can donate blood regularly and save lives in our little way.\n\nHappy World Blood Donor Day.",

Lately corps members are being deployed to meet the needs of the health care system in the region, owing to the state government\u2019s failure to employ more doctors and nurses.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cHow do the NYSC authority want us to work and contribute our quota to the development of our mother\u2019s land in an areas that are not safe, where kidnappers on daily basis invade the areas, even with the presence of security operatives\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to the presidency and the National Assembly to intervene and reason along with us because It\u2019s just a sucide mission\u201d, he said.\n\nHe also noted that there were hardly any provisions made for the corps members in terms of accommodation and security.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe country\u2019s insecurity has affected various states in Nigeria, and it is becoming alarming. This is to the Director-General of NYSC; please allow all corps members to relocate or redeploy to their states of choice.\n\n\u201cWe expect that when posted to a camp, and after you manage to spend three weeks in camp, you should be able to relocate to your state of choice irrespective of your state of origin or course of study because the country is unstable right now.\n\n\u201cThe NYSC DG has made relocation difficult for doctors, nurses, medical laboratory scientists and pharmacists and people who studied some other courses.\n\n\u201cWe observe that some failed State governments are using these sets of people in place of doctors and nurses that ought to be in the system. The government has refused to employ workers, so corps members in the medical profession are used in hospitals as the major staff members instead of a support system.\n\n\u201cThey have refused to relocate us to where we want to go because it feels safe for us. At a time like this, we need to be around our family or relatives and not just in any state, so it is so wrong to disapprove our relocation requests.\n\n\u201cI believe we have just one life to live and our lives are more important than where we are posted to work. I am a medical doctor, posted to Jos, Plateau State, but due to the insecurity, we decided to redeploy from there and some of my colleagues used medical reports, which showed they were not OK. The criteria for leaving were medical reasons or insecurity, or marriage, so we submitted our relocation form. I left the orientation camp because I was not too fine; I wanted to go back to Delta.\n\n\u201cIn my camp, only about two persons were allowed to relocate out of about 33 doctors and those who got theirs were seriously connected. Should we go to the North and die because I am a government child?\n\n\u201cOf all my friends who are also medical practitioners, only about four were posted to Ekiti, Osun and other southern states; the rest were taken to Sokoto and Kaduna. One of us encountered bandits on his way to Sokoto; he escaped, though and we had to ask him to put on his WhatsApp location to know wherever he was going.\n\n\u201cThe accommodation they give corps members is not befitting. My friend in Borno told me they lost a corps member, a pharmacist, during the camp. She was 24 years old and she had started panting after they played volleyball. They rushed her to the clinic but in less than 10 minutes, she died. The clinic had no oxygen. It was after she died that the oxygen arrived. So the official there told them to lie that the lady died at the referral hospital. You can imagine this\u201d, the corper disclosed\n\n...",

          "text": "The new Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Farouk Yahaya, says addressing security challenges in Nigeria required joint efforts of all.\n\nMr Yahaya, a major general, said this when he appeared before the joint House of Representatives Committees on Defence and Army for screening in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nHe said he hopes to bring his 36 years experience in the army to bear and work with other chiefs to address security challenges in the country.\n\n\u201cFrom my experience, this job cannot be done by a single service or entity, the army itself is a group work not individual and that is why we are arranged in sections, companies, battalions and brigades.\n\n\u201cCaptured in the vision of the last COAS and in my vision too is the mention of a joint environment in what we do, having realised that this job is not a one service job.\n\n\u201cIt also requires other agencies and stakeholders and as we speak, the former chief had already gathered these as a cornerstone for the achievement of his mandate, you see the composition of the Army, Navy and Air Force and including the Police, DSS and Civil Defence and all other stakeholders.\n\n\u201cAs we know, internal security is intelligence driven operation and so we need others including communities, opinion leaders, traditional rulers and all others who can provide information.\n\n\u201cBecause the enemy hides within us, so it is they who should provide information, we should support this and work together,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMr Yahaya said he had all it takes to do the job to address security challenges in the country, given his wealth of experience.\n\nHe said he had served in all geo-political zones of the country and had fought in various wars abroad with the U.N and ECOMOG in Liberia.\n\n\u201cWhat I will bring is my experience and commitment; I am committed and determined to provide my best, having known what is required to achieve results,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe promised to work with members of the National Assembly and to leverage on their offices to get information from the grassroots to address security challenges in the country.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman, House Committee on Defence, Benson Babajimi (APC-Lagos), said the country was bedevilled by security challenges and secessionist agitations.\n\nHe said the worst was the lingering insurgency in the North-east that had claimed so many lives and property and had cost the country a lot financially.\n\n\u201cThis must stop, the Armed Forces of Nigeria must adopt innovative measures to curb the killings and wanton destruction of property as a result of these cases of insecurity.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, my hope that the new COAS, if confirmed, will do everything possible, working with other service chiefs to bring this to an end.\n\n\u201cYou will agree with me that Nigeria needs a reinvigorated Armed Forces that is robust, well-trained, adequately equipped, efficient and fully motivated to protect Nigerians from the devastating effects of terrorism and other security challenges in the country,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n(NAN)\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

          "text": "Adebayo Obajemu\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo has launched the Dash Me Store, an outfit of the Dash Me Foundation founded by the immediate past Minister of Finance, Mrs Kemi Adeosun.\n\nThe store is established to mobilise resources for onward distribution to vulnerable people in the society via grassroots charities.\n\nThe Vice President during the opening on Sunday said, \u201cI am excited to be here for several reasons, but most of all because of Mrs Adeosun\u2019s commitment to the notion that all service to man is actually service to God, and she took that very seriously.\n\n\u201cThis is why, as Minister, she prioritized the Social Investment Programmes, when for the first time, the country voted almost N500B of our annual budget to welfare programmes which are called the Social Investment Programmes, which involved engaging 500,000 young men and women and also giving microcredit to about 2 million traders and also a home-grown school feeding programme for 9.5 million children daily in public schools across the country.\n\n\u201cI am therefore really not surprised that she has decided to use some of her enormous talent and influence to establish an organization that raises funds and provides resources for indigenous grassroots charities working with orphaned and vulnerable children, disadvantaged youth, and victims of domestic violence,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on the establishment of Nigeria\u2019s first thrift-for-charity online store, Prof. Osinbajo said adding social enterprise to philanthropy with a structure that allows for resource mobilization for charity as well as creates the opportunity for people to earn a living in the process, should be the way to go.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is happening here is that philanthropy is not like it used to be when all you needed was a good and kind heart and you didn\u2019t need to plan or organize as you would a business for-profit\u201d.\n\nAccording to the Vice President, one of the factors responsible for the impactful implementation of the Social Investment Programmes of the Buhari administration over the years is the realization that \u201cyou can\u2019t reach Nigerians if you don\u2019t have a plan for the grassroots\u201d.\n\nHe said the realization has influenced the structure designed for the SIP and is largely responsible for the successes of the programme (which is now regarded as one of the biggest social welfare schemes in the continent).\n\n\u201cWhat Kemi and her team have done is to bring the new notion of social enterprise to this project. Philanthropy run with the discipline, attention to detail, and financial prudence of a successful business, and she can do all of that, and I am sure her team is imbibing that, given her background in finance in both the private and public sector.\n\n\u201cThe idea of this thrift-for-charity store is brilliant and the first of its kind in Nigeria. It is a unique model which does not just give to the needy in the conventional way of merely handing out donations.\n\n\u201cIt is an innovative and structured way of aggregating donations to earn income to transform the lives of the vulnerable and needy while creating jobs in the process.\n\n\u201cI must say that your focus on funding grassroots charities is so crucial and I know that, having campaigned with you on behalf of our party, the APC all around Ogun and in every part of Nigeria, it is clear that you can\u2019t reach Nigeria and Nigerians if you don\u2019t have a plan for the grassroots\u201d, Osinbajo added.\n\nIn her response, the former Finance Minister, Kemi Adeosun said the idea of the store is to aggregate donations of different kinds for charitable causes, noting that Nigerians from different fields of endeavour and from across the country would be enabled via the online store to contribute to supporting the needy in the society.\n\nShe said the organisation would work closely with charitable organisations in the grassroots to ensure that funds and other materials donated via the Dash Me Store get to actual beneficiaries",

          "text": "The apex Igbo sociocultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, has said not less than 513 Igbo people, mostly youth, have been killed by Nigerian Army and other security agents in the past 160 days, even as residents say young men are routinely arrested and killed.\n\nIn a statement signed on Tuesday by its Secretary-General, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, Ohanaeze condemned President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s dot-in-a circle comment targeted at Igbo people.\n\nLast Thursday, Buhari had threatened that his government would mobilise the military and the police to go after the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) accused of disturbing the peace in the South-East region, while suggesting that every Igbo person is IPOB.\n\nHe had said IPOB is \u201cjust like a dot in a circle and they have nowhere to turn to. They are spread everywhere and they have investments and properties everywhere and in other areas.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know what they are doing. How we will handle them is to mobilise the police and the military to go after them.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze described the President\u2019s comment as disastrous, noting that \u2018no damage control or image laundering will assuage this collective assault on Ndigbo\u2019.\n\nThe group stated that the silence of Northern leaders is proof that they are happy over the position of President Buhari on Southeastern Nigeria.\n\nIsiguzoro noted that Igbo people are emergency experts in all situations and will be a dot in the circle that will swallow nepotistic anarchists and anti-Igbo exponents.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide had charged the leadership of the North to speak out against discrimination against Igbos and divisiveness being created by disastrous declarations of President Muhammadu Buhari describing how the southeast is landlocked and no damage control or image laundering will assuage this collective assault on Ndigbo,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cIt appears that there are chains of crafted skirmish programmed to either aggravate the traumas of Ndigbo or remind them of the sordid past a few years ago, and with \u2018a dot in a circle\u2019 slogan that was used to pulverize Igbos during the Biafra war that left 3 million people dead, especially women and children. Right now in 160 days, 513 Igbos had been killed, 2,436 arrested and 854 missing in the ongoing \u2018imported\u2019 insecurity challenges in the southeast.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018dot in the circle\u2019 is a new signal to point out that Ndigbo are surrounded or should be taught in the language they should understand, but the fact remains that, the silence of Northern leaders shows that they are happy over the position of President Buhari on Southeastern Nigeria. We have seen the direction of events and Igbos are not noisy anymore, we are emergency experts in all situations, \u2018a dot in a circle\u2019 remains the Bermuda triangular point that will swallow nepotistic anarchists and anti-Igbo exponents.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some residents of Umuahia, Abia State and Owerri, Imo State, have told our correspondents that Nigerian soldiers now routinely arrest people, brand them members of IPOB, kill them and take their corpse away.\n\nAn Umuahia resident who did not want his name in print, narrated how soldiers intercepted a bus load of traders travelling from the Abia State capital last week, and killed all occupants of the vehicle.\n\n\u201cLast week, the Army stopped a bus carrying traders from Umuahia. They arrested all the occupants of the vehicle and wasted them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey arrest people, mostly young men everywhere and kill them. If they see a group of young men talking, they will arrest all of them.\u201d\n\nIn Owerri, Imo State capital, the story in the same. Residents say people are still being arrested and taken away.\n\n\u201cThey (security agents) are still arresting people here and there,\u201d a resident told our correspondent on Monday. \u201cPeople are afraid to go out.

          "text": "As Nigeria seeks alternative sources of energy to power its economy, President Muhammadu Buhari has pledged Federal Government\u2019s commitment to focus more on the development of its vast gas resources to transform the country.\n\nSpeaking at the ground breaking ceremony of Train 7 of the Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas (NLNG) project, in Bonny Island, Rivers State, on Tuesday, President Buhari said the focus of his administration would be to \u201dboost the development of Nigeria\u2019s abundant gas resources, strengthen the gas value chain, develop the much needed infrastructure and enhance safe operations in the sector as contained in the National Gas Policy of 2017\u201d.\n\nThe Train 7 project will be financed partly from NLNG balance sheet and partly through a $3 billion multiple sourced deal with 30 reputable institutions.\n\nThe President who spoke virtually, at the ground breaking ceremony, said \u201cthrough the Decade of Gas initiative, which I recently launched, we will transform Nigeria into a major gas and industrialised nation with gas playing the key role as revenue earner, fuel for industries and necessary feed for petrochemicals and fertiliser plants.\u201d\n\nBuhari who said he was proud of the feat achieved by the NLNG as the pioneering LNG company in Nigeria, noted that the achievements by the gas company \u201chas proven the viability of the gas sector over the years\u201d adding that currently gas has contributed \u201cabout one percent to our country\u2019s GDP with payment of dividends to the Federal Government and other shareholders without fail.\n\nThese are indeed commendable accomplishments by the company\u2019s 100 percent Nigerian management team.\u201d\n\nThe President said with the level of performance by the NLNG, \u201cI can only hope that the company continues to grow starting with this Train 7 project but also positioning Nigeria to thrive through the energy transition.\u201d\n\nHe therefore, urged the board of directors, management and staff of NLNG, the host communities, the Rivers State Government and agencies of the Federal Government to continue to collaborate to ensure the completion and eventual commissioning of the Train 7 project safely and in record time, so that Train 8 can also follow.\n\n\u201cAs we flag off the Train 7 project today, I look forward to the development and execution of more Gas Projects by the IOCs and Indigenous operators, and more Trains from Nigeria LNG to harness the 203 trillion cubic feet of proven gas reserves thus opening the door of opportunities to further unlock our country\u2019s huge gas reserves estimated at more than 600 trillion cubic feet.\u201d\n\nHe congratulated the shareholders of NLNG, the Federal Ministry of Petroleum, NNPC and indeed the NCDMB and other stakeholders for very exemplary collaboration which has culminated in this great opportunity for Train 7.\n\nIn his address, Minister of State Petroleum Resources Chief Timipre Sylva said the coming on stream of the NLNG has helped to cut down gas flaring from 65% to a mere 12% in the last decade.\n\nAccording to Sylva \u201cone of the remarkable benefits is that the nation\u2019s operational flare status has reduced drastically from 65% when Nigeria LNG came into operation to about 12% today.\n\nThis is evidence that Nigeria LNG is a blessing to the nation as it positively complemented crude oil exploration by monetizing flared gas, today yielding huge revenue for the nation and the investors.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cthe jobs created and the business opportunities realized since the inception of the LNG operations in Bonny Island is also remarkable.\n\nIndeed, the impact of Nigeria LNG\u2019s operation has been positive both for the company\u2019s host communities and for Nigerians who are now enjoying the impactful social investment that Nigeria LNG sponsors at the national and the regional levels in the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore very reassuring to support the expansion of Nigeria LNG\u2019s operation with the addition of one more train to its already thriving six- train plant complex here in Bonny Kingdom, to make it a seven-train LNG complex,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister said the ground-breaking ceremony \u201cis a guarantee to every stakeholder of more dividends in terms of further reduction in gas flaring, more revenue for the nation and the shareholders, more job opportunities especially at the construction phase and more social investments for our society.\u201d\n\nHe noted that \u201cunlike the previous trains, the Nigerian Content level in the Train 7 project is at a record-breaking level of 55% Nigerian Content for a midstream project covering engineering, fabrication, construction, manufacturing, logistics, and many other areas\u201d, stressing that the \u201cprovisions have been made for the Community Content aspects of the Train-7 project as contained in the NOGICD Act.\n\nThis is the first time that the NCDMB Community Content guidelines is being deployed on a mega project like this to ensure massive community participation.\u201d\n\nSylva said as Nigeria consolidates it\u2019s status \u201cas a gas exporting nation, we are also rolling out policies to ramp up our domestic utilization of gas.\n\nThe year 2020 as the Year of Gas was a remarkable success.\n\nWe have shifted our focus to years 2021 to 2030 as the Decade of Gas wherein we will deepen LPG and CNG penetration across the country for domestic cooking, power generation, and Autogas for vehicles.\u201d\n\nHe said the coming on stream of Train 7 \u201cwill enable the increase of LNG exports to markets that have growing demand for LNG as a preferred fuel for industrialization and power generation; similar template to utilize LNG will be replicated in Nigeria to further hasten our industrial development.\u201d\n\nIn his brief remarks, the Group Managing Director (GMD) Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari said the coming on stream of Train 7 would create job opportunities and expand investments opportunities in the gas sector.\n\nHe thanked President Buhari for his commitments in helping to resolve all uncertainties that delayed the final investment decision on the project adding that \u201cToday history is made. Mr President today is your day.\u201d\n\nKyari said that the expectations of the president in respect of more LNG Trains is assured with the ground breaking ceremony of the Train 7 project.\n\nThe NNPC boss said with the realization of the multi billion naira NLNG Train 7, the confidence of \u201cour shareholders have been assured. We are confident that more investments will come\u201d.\n\nIn his welcome remarks, Managing Director of NLNG Mr Tony Attah said the project would stimulate inflow of more than $10 billion Foreign Direct Investment to Nigeria create 12,000 direct and over 40,000 indirect jobs stressing that the decision to begin the Train 7 project was to improve on domestic gas utilization and investments in the sector in the country.\n\nAttah said that despite the uncertainties that surrounded the initial takeoff of the project \u201cour shareholders stuck to their guns and with enormous support from the Federal Government through engagements,\u201d stressing that \u201cthe benefits to our people will definitely increase on the back of this Train 7 Project which will expand our capacity by 35% from 22MTPA to 30MTPA\u201d.\n\nAttah added that the development of Nigerian local capacity and businesses through the 100% in-country execution of Construction works, Fabrications and major procurements would also be enhanced with the coming onboard of Train 7 project.\n\nHe noted that \u201cthe global energy demand is set to increase by more than 40% by year 2050 and we strongly believe that this project is timely as gas will continue to play a major role as the preferred energy of choice in the current and future energy mix\u201d.\n\n\u201cGas is readily available in Nigeria, it is cleaner and very affordable; hence a massive opportunity for our dear country. With 206TCF of proven gas reserve and a potential additional 600TCF!\n\nI believe that Train 7 will be an inspiration and catalyst for Trains 8, 9, 10 and even to15 in line with the recent declaration of \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d by Mr President,\u201d he further stated.\n\nPresent at the ground breaking ceremony were the deputy governor of Rivers State Dr (Mrs) Ipalibo Banigo who represented Governor Nysome Wike, members of the National Assembly, board members of NNPC, NLNG, Managing Director of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB),Engr. Simi Wabote, first class traditional rulers in Rivers State, members of the diplomatic community among others.",

          "text": "Doosuur Iwambe, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government disclosed on Tuesday that it has received confirmation that about 3.92 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines will arrive Nigeria by the end of July or early August.\n\nSpeaking while addressing journalists in Abuja, the Executive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) Faisal Shuaib, noted that the vaccines will be delivered through the COVAX facility.\n\nGiving a detailed update on the COVID-19 vaccine exercise, Shuaib said, \u201cWe now have information that Nigeria will get 3.92m doses of Oxford/Astrazeneca by the end of July or early August.\n\n\u201cAs we receive additional information on the exact dates in August, we will provide an update regarding timelines and details of this.\n\n\u201cThe last time I spoke we were not certain about when the next batch of vaccines will be coming, but we have received official communication that Nigeria will get 3.92m doses of Oxford/AstraZeneca by the end of July or early August.\n\n\u2018\u2019COVAX will only communicate when the vaccines are secured and our partners have validated that the vaccines have been secured\u2019\u2019.\n\nShuaib also disclosed that recent research from Public Health England (PHE) shows that the Indian (Delta) variant B.1.617.2 is 92% susceptible to Oxford/AstraZeneca.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore comforting to know that the vaccine used in Nigeria can protect against this variant that causes high morbidity and mortality in India. However, it underscores the need for us to ramp up our vaccination to more Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs you all are aware, hesitancy towards the second dose is very tied to the continued misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19 and the vaccination program globally and locally.\n\n\u201cThis is especially prevalent on social media. While I commend the patriotism of a multitude of our social media influencers, I must say that I profoundly appreciate the contributions our professional media community has been making towards the progress of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the challenge is upon us to go beyond straight news and do more in educating Nigerians through interpretative stories, promotional exclusives, features and special broadcast programs on the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n\u201cIt is important to emphasise the need to be fully protected with the second dose, and the socio-economic and health risks of refusing to be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nShuaib further reiterated on the recent concluded G7 summit as the World leaders addressed the issue of vaccine inequities supply particularly for developing countries to get the vaccine.\n\n\u201cWhile we are working with our international partners to confirm the next shipment of vaccines to Nigeria, I wish to speak about the G7 summit that occurred over the weekend.\n\n\u201cThe topic of global inequities in the vaccine supply was a significant focus of the G7 meeting.\n\n\u201cRightfully so. Leaders of major, rich countries are becoming increasingly aligned with the thinking that the inequities cannot continue, not only because it is a moral failure but because it is strategically unwise for their own efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cOn the final day of the summit, leaders committed to delivering at least 1 billion coronavirus vaccine doses to the world over the next year.\n\n\u201cWhile this will not close the enormous gap that exists today, it is a positive step and we welcome the new focus.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, President Biden announced on the eve of the summit that the US will purchase 500 million doses of the Pfizer-bioNTech vaccine and donate them to low- and middle-income countries through the next year.\n\n\u201cThis pledge is by far the largest yet by one country. These doses will be distributed via Covax. We welcome this announcement and encourage other nations with the means to follow the US\u2019 example so that we, as a global community, can move forward from COVID-19 swiftly\u2019\u2019.",

Nigeria is a strong country but we are almost on the precipice, it is almost midnight in our country.\n\n\u201cIf we do not take these tough measures that we will have to live with, then we will have to deal with the consequences,\u201d he said.\n\nFayemi said that more collaboration was needed between the Federal Government and the states to convince Nigerians that subsidy is no longer sustainable.\n\nThis, he said, would eradicate the trust deficit between the people and the government and ensure a smooth ride into the subsidy removal regime.\n\nMr Clem Agba, Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, gave reasons why some of the reforms like the removal of petroleum subsidy were suspended.\n\nAccording to him, it is because the government is looking for alternatives to ensure that when the programmes continue, Nigerians do not suffer.\n\n\u201cTo follow up with these reforms, we are working on the strategic revenue initiatives and we are beginning to see some improvements in revenue.\n\n\u201d I dare say that the country is no longer so much of a mono dependent economy because of the reforms that are ongoing.\n\n\u201cIn the past, oil used to be the main driver of the economy in terms of revenues, oils was giving us about 70 per cent of revenue and about 90 per cent of foreign exchange.\n\n\u201cToday oil is only contributing about 45 per cent while non-oil sector is contributing about 55 per cent.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to Nigerians to understand that the reforms were necessary to achieve the desired growth.",

          "title": "Industrialization: The Governor Udom Emmanuel magic formula",
          "text": "Industrialization, the development of industries on a broad scale, is one policy vigorously pursued and strategically implemented by the Deacon Udom Emmanuel led administration in Akwa Ibom State that has left many astonished. In just six years, the advantage of the policy has not only changed the status of the state from a core civil service state but a bubbling industrial hub within the South South region.\n\nUnarguably, industrialization plays a vital role in the economic development of underdeveloped countries through job creation, poverty eradication and mass production of goods and services. Industries no doubt plays a complex role in economic development, but these are some of its most important effects as we have witnessed in Akwa Ibom.\n\nEven though not on a massive large scale yet, it has increased the revenue base of the state. Yes, we are not there just yet but the journey is on course. The standard of living of many Akwa Ibom households have increased due to the multiplier effect of the industrial revolution ongoing, while economic stability is more sustainable with increased employment opportunity for the many unemployed youths.\n\nThe Industrialization policy has promoted the advent of specialized labor as division of work increases the marginal value product of labor, thus enhancing the profitability of the average Akwa Ibom worker. One area of interest is that the Industrial revolution has no doubt brought about a rise and growth in the agricultural sector with increased savings and investments for wealth creation.\n\nThe Governor\u2019s industrialization drive, has increased workers\u2019 income, enhances their capacity to save and invest. Akwa Ibom today presents an industrialization success story. From the 2015 to 2021 alone, the basic foundation that will propel greater economic prosperity has been laid with it\u2019s attendant consequences of urbanization and population growth. Uyo is fast growing and expanding due to influx of people and companies.\n\nThe Governor brought his visionary mindset to bare in policy formulation and project conceptualization which birthed the 21-Storey \u201cDakkada Tower\u201d which stands as a testament to Akwa Ibom\u2019s increasing profile as a fast industrializing State. As the Governor himself noted recently, the central focus of government\u2019s initial Five Point Agenda which have now condensed into the 8 Point Agenda, was to rapidly industrialize the State and change the narrative as a purely civil service orientated State to an industrializing one with robust manufacturing base.\n\nThe fruits have been massive. From the Syringe factory, to the Metering company, to the Flour Mill company, to the Coconut Virgin Oil Refinery to the plywood manufacturing company to the signing of the MoU for the commencement of the Liberty Oil and Gas Free Zone, to the Ground breaking ceremony for the construction of Sterling petrochemicals and Fertilizer production factory, to the several industrial clusters which produce such items as pencils and toothpicks, plastics, tissue papers etc, to the rice mills in Ini Local Government Area, and several cassava processing mills, the narrative is indeed changing in Akwa Ibom.\n\nThe $1.4 billion Ammonia and Fertilizer plant alone is one investment that will fetch the state revenue apart from Oil while the St Gabriel Coconut Factory alone will generate over 1300 direct job and 3000 indirectly employment opportunity by September 2021. The Coconut factory has a capacity of processing 300,000 coconuts per shift which will produce 66 tons in a day from three shift of production, while employing 300 people to work in a shift.\n\nAlso, the much anticipated Liberty Oil and Gas Free Trade Zone in Ikot Abasi Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, has taken off with the signing of a memorandum of understanding, MOU, between the Akwa Ibom State Government, AKSG and Oil and Gas Free Zone Authority, OGFZA. The commencement of operations follows the receipt of the first cargo components, establishment of an Immigration office and setting up of a dedicated Customs command, in the free trade zone. This will be another stimulant for Industrial revolution, while the Aluminium Smelter Company of Nigeria, ALSCON located in Ikot Abasi, is on the verge of being resuscitated following a partnership between the Akwa Ibom State Government will partner with the federal government.\n\nThe Governor Udom Emmanuel industrialization drive is aimed at ensuring a process by which the state economy is transformed from a primarily agricultural/Civil service one to one based on the manufacturing of goods and services with individual manual labour replaced by mechanized mass production. This will trigger an industrial revolution with more efficient division of labor, the use of technological innovation to solve problems and inspire creative ingenuity.\n\nAlready, in just six years, Akwa Ibom is witnessing an Industrialization policy whereby a transformation is taking the state away from an agricultural- or resource-based economy, toward an economy based on mass manufacturing with increases in total income and living standards of the people, and a diversified economy. The policy is all embracing, with land, air and sea components which is why the Ibom Deep Seaport, the Ibom Air and the massive infrastructural expansion are geared towards boosting the pillars needed for it\u2019s viability and sustainability.\n\nIbom Air for instance is today a success story that continues to astonish many. It started like an abstract vision, with a hypothesis that was yet to be ever tested by any state government in the West African region. Critics called it a scam, friends were doubtful about it\u2019s viability, and fans were skeptical about it\u2019s possibility of becoming a reality.\n\nEven when no one else saw the vision, Governor Udom Emmanuel saw ahead and realised that a viable aviation sector anywhere promotes an improved quality of life and helps to improve living standards. By facilitating tourism, he believed air transport also helps generate economic growth and alleviate poverty \u2013 providing employment opportunities, increasing revenues from taxes and fostering the conservation of protected areas.\n\nTo the Governor, commercial aviation has a direct impact on our nation\u2019s economy, creating both direct and indirect jobs as air transport is an important enabler to achieving economic growth and development because air transport facilitates integration into the global economy and provides vital connectivity on a national, regional, and international scale while also helping generate trade, promote tourism, and create employment opportunities.\n\nNo doubt air transport generates wider catalytic benefits, with ability to serve larger markets, impact positively on business operations, influence investment, impact on the labour market, boast tourism and contributes to world trade.\n\nExperts are quick to agree that an efficient air transport system allows people to have adventures in new countries, to relax on tropical beaches, to build business relationships and to visit friends and family. As global economy grows ever more linked, aviation is the factor that brings people together. Aviation brings together a world of facts and figures to give policymakers and the industry the important global view of how air travel creates jobs and drives economic growth.\n\nIt impacts on the labour market helps improves the labour market by making it easier for companies to attract high quality employees from around the globe. This is important for senior staff and professionals for whom\n\naccess to good international links\n\ninfluences their decision on where to\n\nlive and work.\n\nSimilarly, high quality employees may find it easier to commute by air on a weekly basis or to be based in two locations; the headquarters and regional office. It improved access to a wider pool of appropriately skilled labour will improve productivity leading ultimately to higher employment in the local economy.\n\nGovernor Udom Emmanuel saw when others were doubting that air transport\u2019s influence on investment is key as good air transport links influence where companies choose to invest. Many companies consider international transport links to be an essential factor for locating businesses. This makes Air transport one of the world\u2019s most important industries. Its development and its technical and service achievements make it one of the greatest contributors to the advancement of modern society.\n\nAn effective air transport system improves quality of life by broadening people\u2019s leisure and cultural experiences. It provides a wide choice of holiday destinations around the world and an affordable means to visit distant\n\nfriends and relatives and may provide the only transportation means in remote areas, thus promoting social inclusion.\n\nBy facilitating tourism and trade, it generates economic growth, provides jobs, increases revenues from taxes, and fosters the conservation of protected areas and it\u2019s network facilitates the delivery of emergency and humanitarian aid relief anywhere on earth, and ensures the swift delivery of medical supplies and organs for transplantation.\n\nOn February 20, 2019, Akwa Ibom witnessed the inaugural landing of IbomAir when Flight IA200219 torched down at Victor Attah International Airport, an event that marked the genesis of a remarkable adventure that has stood of Akwa Ibom State as an entity with creative ingenuity that continues to baffle the rest of the country.\n\nOn May 24, 2019, IbomAir left Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja back to Akwa Ibom International Airport, Uyo after a successful round of test flights while on June 7, 2019, history was made again when Ibom Air inaugural flight Z4102, took off from Uyo enroute to Lagos, a journey that opened the floodgate of several other flights that has revolutionalize air travel in Nigeria.\n\nOn Tuesday 10th September 2019, exactly three months and a day since the company began commercial flight operations, Ibom Air carried her 50,000th passenger during the boarding of flight Z4100 from Uyo to Lagos. The spice of this feat is that passenger number 50,000 turned out to be first time Ibom Air traveler, Ms Ruth Nsaka.\n\nOn March 26 2020, Ibom Air was forced to suspend operations due to the Covid19 pandemic that ravaged the world. Recognizing the serious implications of the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus around the country, the Management of Ibom Air announced the suspension of all scheduled flight services as of midnight on Friday 27 March, 2020, as her own way of identifying with the Akwa Ibom State Government and the Federal Government of Nigeria\u2019s efforts to bring this pandemic under effective control.\n\nTuesday May 19, 2020, saw Ibom Air\u2019s 4th aircraft, 5N-BXP joining its \u2018senior\u2019 colleagues in Uyo after completing all regulatory requirements with the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority in Lagos. 5N-BXP was warmly welcomed by her sister aircraft, 5N-BWK, 5N-BWL and 5N-BWM. It\u2019s was a beauty to behold as they stood all together in front of the hangar at Victor Attah International Airport, Uyo, bonding with each other.\n\nOn July 20th, 2020, the company\u2019s expansion policy to link many cities in Nigeria continued as Ibom Air received a warm welcome at Margaret Ekpo International Airport, Calabar, a new route it added to her area of operation. The growth and expansion has never compromised it\u2019s signature of schedule reliability, on-time departures and superior service that has become the envy of other airlines. Ibom Air score card includes over 96% schedule reliability & 94% on-time performance, unparalleled in Nigeria\u2019s Aviation history.\n\nOn August 1, 2020, after delays occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic, Ibom Air finally receive it\u2019s fifth Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, the second of the two additional aircraft purchased in December 2019. The aircraft, with registration number 5N-BXO, arrived Lagos from Calgary, Canada at 00:05 am local time, Saturday morning, (1st August, 2020).\n\nWith the arrival of this aircraft, its modern and efficient fleet grew to five aircraft as the airline continues to operate the youngest fleet amongst Nigeria\u2019s airlines in line with it\u2019s vision to be a world-class African regional airline.\n\nA key benefit of Ibom Air\u2019s very modern fleet of Bombardier CRJ 900 aircraft is that they all come factory-fitted with High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters. HEPA filters are high-intensity filters that do not just filter dust, but effectively capture greater than 99.97% of the airborne microbes in cabin air, including microscopic particles such as bacteria and viruses. Cabin air in HEPA equipped aircraft generally pass through the filters every 2-3 minutes, removing contaminants and greatly enhancing the quality of air in the cabin.\n\nOn September 2, 2020, the company had a new addition to the fleet, when it took procession of her 5N-BXO, which touched down at Victor Attah International Airport for the very first time. Despite the minor setback the aviation industry had as a result of Covid19, Ibom Air came back on it\u2019s wings on Wednesday, October 28, 2020, after months of inactivity.\n\nOn September 14, 2020, Ibom Air touched down for the first time at Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu with direct daily flights from Lagos and Abuja in it\u2019s effort at extending it\u2019s service to the Southeast geopolitical area.\n\nJust when other airlines are complaining of how difficult it is for them to launch back after months of Covid19 induced inactivity, Governor Udom Emmanuel just announced that Ibom Air is set to boost it fleet with two additional aircrafts in June 2021.\n\n\u201cTwo new A220 300 series ought to have arrived before now but assured that the aircrafts would be in Uyo in the next two months\u201d, the Governor announced during the recent 2021 Easter retreat in Uyo.\n\nFor effective service delivery and conscious of the need to offer quality service to its teaming customers, the company launched a new City Travel Centre located in the foyer of the Akwa Ibom State Secretariat Annex on Udo Udoma Avenue, Uyo, to ease the burden of flights bookings and a bus service to convey Ibom Air passengers to and from Victor Attah International Airport.\n\nOn Monday, March 1, 2021, Ibom Air carried its 500,000th passenger since commencement of operations on the 7th of June 2019, a key milestone the airline would have clocked earlier but for the three and a half months Covid-19 lockdown of 2020 but still, an indication of steady customer uptake, and validation of the airlines services.\n\nGiving his scorecard in the aviation sector while addressing the state to mark his sixth anniversary, an elated Governor Udom Emmanuel said, early in the life of his administration, he gathered some stakeholders in the aviation industry and revealed to them his plans to establish a thriving airline.\n\n\u201cWe went to work quietly and once I made our plans public, the usual naysayers said the project couldn\u2019t be done; that if countries in Africa couldn\u2019t set up an airline, how then could we, a State achieve such a feat. We ignored their pessimism and went to work. Today, Ibom Air has become a national sensation. The colours of Akwa Ibom State now dominate the Nigerian aviation space. We were recently named the Best Airline in the Nation\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe started with three CRJ 900 series, later added two more CRJs bringing the total aircrafts in its fleet to five. In the next few days, we will commission two newly acquired brand new Airbuses (A220-300 series) bringing the total fleet of aircrafts to seven. We are not just concentrating only on Ibom Air, ours is a total dedication to aviation development. Our international terminal once completed, would be the best in the nation and you can quote me on this. It would also be the smartest. Our MRO is on-going; the pace of work only got slowed down, due to the restrictions placed on international travels due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Our taxiway, the new Category 2 runaway, these are huge investments that prime our State as an emerging industrial hub. Fellow Akwaibomites, this huge achievement in aviation should gladden the hearts of everyone, irrespective of one\u2019s political affiliations. Ibom Air carries the collective pride of Akwa Ibom people and we should all celebrate it. God is indeed doing great things here!\u201d, he noted.\n\nIf all these benefits could be derived from the Industrialization policy in just six years, one can only imagine what Akwa Ibom will look like when the Ibom Deep Seaport comes on board, when the Liberty Free Trade Zone begins to flourish, when the multiplier effect of the numerous companies and factories begins to flourish. Indeed, as Vice President Yemi Osinbajo once confessed, under the Udom Emmanuel led administration in the state, Akwa Ibom remains Nigeria\u2019s best kept secret.",

          "text": "Nyesom Wike, the governor of Rivers State, believes it is unlawful for President Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) to delegate his constitutional powers of protecting Nigerians\u2019 lives and property to state governors.\n\nIn a statement released by his media aide, Kelvin Ebiri, the governor stated that the President is the Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces and that governors cannot declare themselves in command of security in their respective states.\n\nWike, who spoke at the commissioning of the 21-kilometer Odufor-Akpoku-Umuoye Road in Etche Local Government Area of the State on Tuesday, said that such a position indicates that the APC-led federal government has lost control of its strategy for dealing with the country\u2019s troubling security issues and making it safe for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cMr. President, you are the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. You appoint Inspector-General of Police, you appoint the Chief of Army Staff, Chief of Naval Staff, the Commissioner of Police, Director of Department of State Service, and other heads of security.\n\n\u201cWhich one do we appoint? How can people appointed by Mr. President be under me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not only to borrow money for Nigeria that you\u2019re in charge. You must, also, be in charge of other things including security. Who signed order 10? Is it the governors?\u201d he asked.\n\nGovernor Wike admonished the APC-led federal government to own up that it can no longer fulfill promises made to Nigerians and also lead the country out of its present predicament, saying when there is a failure, what makes leadership respectable is that such leader is able to accept its weakness publicly.\n\nThe governor pointed out that it was time Nigerians begin to compare the performances of PDP and APC governors in office.\n\nHe said, \u201cMr. President was short of calling names of those governors who run to Aso Rock when they are supposed to stay in their states to see the needs of their states and people.\n\n\u201cMr. President should have come out openly and said, my APC governors, stop worrying me. Go back to your states and do your work. On that, I support him.\n\n\u201cThank God, Mr. President knows that I am not one of those that go to visit him over one problem or the other. I, as the governor of Rivers under PDP, you\u2019ll never find me there,\u201d Wike said.\n\nFormer Senate President, Senator David Mark, who performed the commissioning of the 21 kilometres Odufor-Akpoku-Umuoye Road, noted the excitement expressed on the faces of the locals who are directly impacted by the project.\n\nHe noted that even those in opposition in the state have become so weak to have anything more to say against Governor Wike who is not only performing but has remained a strong pillar of the PDP.\n\n\u201cI told him I\u2019ll be here because he loves his people. Politics and democracy are not about enriching one or two persons within a community. The Odufor-Akpoku-Umuoye Road is a project that will outlive everybody in this place. The legacy you\u2019re leaving behind, Rivers people will not forget you. They will defend you, they\u2019ll protect you and they will stand by you always.\n\n\u201cThat is why you can walk tall. That is why you can jump into your car and go anywhere because you\u2019ve shown them love. You\u2019ve brought democracy to the people. PDP as a party is happy to have you. You\u2019re one of the pillars of our great party,\u201d Mark said.\n\nProviding the description of the project, Rivers State Commissioner for Works, Elloka Tasie-Amadi said Odufor-Akpoku-Umuoye Road connects part of Etcheland to Omerelu, Apani and Omademe communities in neighbouring Ikwerre Local Government Area, and onwards to Imo State.",

Local production of hitherto imported products is beginning to gain grounds that I make bold to say that the materials produced locally can compete favorably with the imported ones.\n\n\u201cNigerians now proudly use products branded made-in-Nigeria. This development will no doubt attract several benefits to the country including increase in its Gross Domestic Product, generation of employment opportunities and reduction in the cost of production.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that the government was beginning to show more interest in and provide more assistance for local production in order to stimulate the expansion of local industry, noting that it was a 10% contributor to the GDP.\n\nMustapha tasked regulatory bodies with ensuring that local products met international standards.\n\nHe said, \u201cManufacturing is part of the economic sector in Nigeria that contributes approximately 10 per cent of its Gross Domestic Product each year. The production activity centres on the production of household goods, consumer products, agriculture, mining, cement, building materials, chemicals and so on.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to note that three sectors namely food & beverages, cement, and textile account for 77 per cent of the manufacturing output generating value in the country.\n\n\u201cThe government is beginning to show greater interest and provide more support for local production in order to encourage the growth of local industries.\n\n\u201cOur economic diversification strategy would rely heavily on the extent to which we create globally competitive products. Therefore, we have to take the issue of standards seriously and I implore all our standards regulatory agencies to provide all the necessary guidance to local producers to ensure they meet global standards.\u201d\n\nIn his address, the Minister of Industry Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo, said that the purpose of the event was to promote local content and showcase Nigeria\u2019s rich cultural heritage.",
          "summary": "As a result, he added, Nigerians now proudly consume products labeled \u201cMade in Nigeria,\u201d adding that this would have an impact on the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product, the creation of jobs, and the cost of production.\nMustapha made the remarks while giving the keynote presentation at the opening of a Nigerian-made products show in Abuja.\nLocal production of hitherto imported products is beginning to gain grounds that I make bold to say that the materials produced locally can compete favorably with the imported ones.\nMustapha tasked regulatory bodies with ensuring that local products met international standards.\nHe said, \u201cManufacturing is part of the economic sector in Nigeria that contributes approximately 10 per cent of its Gross Domestic Product each year.",

          "text": "Politicians within government corridors have been releasing strategic planning to bandits as informants in order to make money, Governor Abubakar Sani-Bello of Niger state has said.\n\nGovernor Sani-Bello stated this Tuesday when he commissioned 161 Special Vigilante Corps established to curb youth restiveness and street fighting in Minna.\n\n\u201cThere are politicians and others in government corridors who give out information to these criminals. Even when we hold meetings, few moments later, the bandits will be saying the governor has said this and that. I cannot trust anybody anymore,\u201d the governor declared.\n\nHe expressed concern that some people were eager to make money while children within ages three and 11years were in captivity.\n\n\u201cThey said I should bring money so that they can bring the children and I asked them, \u2018where will they find the children\u2019,\u201d the governor said.\n\nThe governor also decried media reportage which bandits got to know classified information about government actions, saying \u201cyou may think that the bandits are illiterates but they are very intelligent in processing information.\u201d\n\nDonating 10 operational vehicles and 20 motorcycles to the Special Vigilantes Corps, Governor Sani-Bello implored them to clear the miscreants that had disturbed residents of Minna for months.\n\nHe said unlike their counterparts in bandits-affected areas, the corps was not trained to engage in exchange of fire. \u201cThey are for now restricted to Minna by working with the police to identify and arrest the boys causing crisis in our streets, destroying property and injuring passers-by,\u201d the governor said.\n\nPresenting the special vigilantes, the state Commissioner of Police, Adamu Usman explained that the creation of the corps became necessary in order to keep peace in Minna while conventional security agencies fight bandits in other parts of the state.\n\nHe said the vigilantes had undergone two-week training and ready to work with police in curbing activities of street urchins in Minna.\n\nThe police boss assured that the vehicles and motorcycles donated by government would be judiciously used.\n\nGodogodo community cries out\n\nIn a related development, the people of Godogodo community in Jema\u2019a local government area of Kaduna state have expressed concern over the increasing security challenges bedevilling the area, and leading to loss of several lives and property.\n\nThey alleged that suspected herdsmen have killed many innocent people, including the head of vigilante group, Frank Zakiri, in Godogodo village.\n\nZakiri was known for leading other vigilantes in protecting his community and environs against invaders that killed and destroyed properties.\n\nThe increasing spate of killings in the area has caused fear among the people who could not sleep with their two eyes closed for fear of the unknown.\n\nA source who craved anonymity explained that the Chief of Godogodo, Iliya Ajiya, received the killing of the head of the vigilante with great shock, assuring the villagers would continue to fight against invaders for the protection of their community.\n\nHe said as a community, they had resolved, irrespective of any differences, to continue to protect one another against what he called \u201cenemies of progress especially during the rainy season when majority of the people who are peasant farmers will go out every day to farm for their survival.\u201d\n\nThe chief called on government at all levels to ensure proactive measures were taken to checkmate the activities of criminal elements in the society in order to allow people go about their lawful activities for a peaceful and harmonious society.\n\nResident want additional troops\n\nMeanwhile, a resident of Gwashi village in Bukkuyum local government area of Zamfara state, Yusha\u2019u Mohammed Gwashi, has appealed to the federal government to urgently deploy additional 200 troops to their area to fight the bandits terrorising their area.\n\nGwashi made the plea Tuesday in a telephone interview with Blueprint in Gusau, the state capital.\n\nHe said the bandits, in their large numbers, besieged their area between Sunday and Monday with sophisticated weapons on their way to Birnin Gwari Forest, and killed three locals while many others scampered for their safety.\n\nHe expressed worry that the bandits could warn them not to their farms as they threatened to kill anyone who acted contrary to the order.\n\n\u201cThe troops attached to our area are not up to one unit and the bandits use to come in their hundreds with heavy fire arms more than that of the troops, so we need more additional reinforcement of the troops to forestall insecurity challenges we are facing to bandits attacks on daily basis,\u201d Gwashi further pleaded.\n\nGwashi further hinted that as a result of Banditry in their area, many women and their childrens have left the area in fear of the Bandits attack, calling on federal and Zamfara state governments to take urgent steps in tackling the trend.\n\nGovernor Bello Mohammed Matawalle had last week, directed communities across the state to go on self-defence whenever bandits strike.\n\nFurther to this and other measures taken to halt banditry, the governor also suspended the Emir of Dansadau Alhaji Hussaini Umar and District Head of Nasarawa Mailayi Alhaji Bello Wakkala and the Emir of Zurmi,Alhaji Abubakar Atiku Muhammad for allegedly aiding and abetting the criminals in their jurisdictions.\n\nLawmaker pledges grazing field\n\nIn a related development, a lawmaker representing Zamfara North, Senator Sahabi Ya\u2019u, has promised to construct grazing grounds for herders in his constituency to complement government efforts at tackling insecurity in the state.\n\nSenator Ya\u2019u, who made this known while speaking to journalists in Gusau Tuesday, said the project would be established on grazing routes in the state.\n\nThe senator blamed alleged injustice meted out to the herders for the security challenges in the state, which he noted began with cattle rustling before degenerating to banditry.\n\n\u201cI think this (project) is in line with what Governor Bello Matawalle is doing to provide `RUGA\u2019 settlement for the herders.\n\n\u201cThis year (2021), part of my constituency projects, I intend to provide grazing grounds for herders so that they can be contained in one place.\n\n\u201cAfter identifying the location, securing it, we are going to plant the grass that will be harvested into belts for use every season of the year,\u201d he said.\n\nSenator Ya\u2019u said tackling insecurity is a collective responsibility, adding \u201cat the National Assembly level, we are doing our best to address the insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cThe insecurity we are facing is very disturbing. We have realised that we are in danger; it requires collaborative effort to address it. Everyone\u2019s support and contribution is needed not only state or federal government.\u201d",

International Day of the African Child commemorates children killed protesting in Soweto in 1976. The day was first celebrated by the Organisation of the African Unity (now African Union, AU) in 1991. On 16 June 1976 in Soweto, South Africa, thousands of black school children took to the streets to protest about the inferior quality of their education and to demand their right to be taught in their own language.\n\n\u201cHundreds of them were killed and in the spaces of two weeks of protest, more than a hundred people were killed and a thousand more injured. To honour their courage and in memory of those killed, in 1991 the Organisation of African Unity (now the African Union) established the Day of the African Child to draw attention to the plights of the African child today. The international day of the African Child also aims at creating awareness on the plights of the African children, with a call for an urgent need for improved and equal education space as well as encourages the culture of sharing something special with a child in Africa\u201d.\n\nHe further explained that in Nigeria, the Child Rights Act is the policy framework that exists to provide and protect the rights of a Nigerian child; and other related matters.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the domestication of this act in various states of the country, the wellbeing of children is not adequately protected as there are gaps in the implementation of the act. Current situation of out-of-school children in Nigeria, the Ministry of Education said the number of out-of-school children stands at 10.1 million. It is an increase of more than 3 million from last year, implying that out of school children figure in Nigeria as of June 2021 stands at 13.3million,\u201d he added.\n\nProgram Officer Education and Girl-Child Literacy Youthhub Africa, Mr Agboola Afees said that in 2003, the Child Rights Act was passed into law adding that presently only 25 states or so had domesticated it.\n\nAfees said the child right act in Nigerian was designed to address the triple issues of child labour, child abuse as well as out-of-school challenge.\n\nHe lamented that the remaining states yet to domesticate it were mainly from the north and the impediments included political issues and the fact that the Act was religious and culturally sensitive.\n\nSenior Programme Coordinator, Christian Aid, Mr Victor Arokoyo, said that not having the Act in place has adverse effects on children.\n\nArokoyo said that most public schools were bedevilled by dilapidated buildings with children in tattered clothes.\n\nHe added that the economic situation had forced many children into becoming providers, hawking to cater for families, adding that out of school children were poor kids who could not cope with education conditions.\n\nOn his part, a development activist, Mr. Emmanuel Tagwai said that in Kaduna State, NGOs gave technical support on the domestication of the Child Rights Act and carried children along in the journey of domestication.\n\nTagwai said that there was need for continued sensitisation and frequent mention of the Act and the need for the law to be fully domesticated and implemented.",

As we have always maintained, the door is not locked and we are open-minded but Twitter must work towards it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said Twitter and other platforms must also register as a Nigerian company, obtain a license from the National Broadcasting Commission, NBC and be guided by the rules of the licensing as well as pay taxes.\n\nAccording to the minister, regulation of social media platforms is becoming a global practice.\n\nHe however added that most countries were just waking up to the fact that the platforms were becoming more powerful than even government and needed to be regulated.",

          "text": "Europeans champions Portugal kicked off their Euro 2020 title defence with a 3-0 win over Hungary on Tuesday as captain Cristiano Ronaldo made history at the Puskas Arena.\n\nRonaldo became the first man to play in five European Championship tournaments, and his two goals in the victory took him to 11 \u2014 the most scored in the tournament\u2019s history.\n\nBorussia Dortmund\u2019s Raphael Guerreiro broke the deadlock after 84 minutes with a shot from the centre of the box, while Ronaldo scored from a penalty three minutes later.\n\nThe Portugal forward then superbly added a second in injury time, dancing through a string of challenges to slot home his second of the match.\n\nAmid a backdrop of around 60,000 fans at the Puskas Arena, Hungary held firm in a low-key first half that had little incident.\n\nRonaldo, who overtook Michel Platini as the Euros\u2019 leading scorer of all-time, was relieved to see the offside flag raised as he missed early on. The Juventus striker grew increasingly frustrated towards the end of the first half when his effort from close range sailed over the bar when he really should have scored.\n\nBoosted by vociferous support at the Puskas Arena, Hungary threatened sporadically, with Adam Szalai causing Portugal the most problems.\n\nPortugal\u2019s frustration grew in the second half, as Manchester United\u2019s Bruno Fernandes went close with an effort from outside the box, but Hungary goalkeeper Peter Gulasci did well to tip it round the post. But just as it looked as if Ronaldo would have to settle for one record and a disappointing draw, Portugal turned on the style late on.\n\nFirst Guerreiro broke the deadlock with a deflected finish, before Ronaldo took centre stage. After dispatching a clinical penalty, sending Gulasci the wrong way, he added a superb second with a fine finish.\n\nHungary\u2019s next game is against France on June 19, in Budapest, while Portugal face Germany in Munich on the same day in Group F.",
