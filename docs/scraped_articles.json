          "text": "Governor of Cross River State, Ben Ayade, has stated that the Peoples Democratic Party, which he dumped for the All Progressives Congress on Thursday, stood by him during his political travails.\n\nAyade recalled how he rose politically on the platform of the opposition party to become a governor.\n\nThe governor, who featured on Politics Today, a current affairs programme on Channels Television, on Thursday attributed his defection to the leadership attributes of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and his relationship with Cross River.\n\nAyade also said more governors in the opposition PDP would soon join the ruling APC. He, however, failed to name them.\n\nHe said in part, \u201cMy decision to move has nothing to do with my relationship with the PDP, it has everything to do with my understanding of the challenges of this nation at this time. My respect for the integrity, character and quality of leadership that President Muhammadu Buhari has brought. I feel depressed when the nation is challenged with security issues. Instead of us rising as an orgasmic whole to see how we can support the President to deal with these foreign herders that are colonising our various roads and farms, we rather sit back; we tend to create an impression as if the government is not doing well.\n\n\u201cSo, it is therefore not driven by a mere political ideology but the philosophical point that this nation is tending toward the brink of collapse and we must support the President. The reality is that there is a reason for which I have moved is what I have analysed for you\u2026because of my personal relationship with Mr President. The relationship is so strong that, don\u2019t forget, the President\u2019s first working visit was to Cross River State. I am not from the North. I am not a Muslim. I was not in APC. But the President chose my state to visit. I owe him that sense of duty, relationship, that fatherly respect. I have related closely with him and I can see his heart and soul. He is a good man in all total sense.\n\n\u201cEssentially speaking, I am one of those whose political slogan is very clear\u2026Politics with Ethics. I am from Cross River State and Governor of Cross River State. Cross River has been reduced to worse in body, in spirit and in the soul; a state that has lost her territory and oil wells; a state that is among the lowest, 35th out of 36 states, in terms of federal allocation. The only state in the South-South that is completely dislocated from the comity of the oil-producing states. A state that does not get 13 per cent derivation. A state that its monthly income is far less than its cumulative monthly salary. I was hit elected to practise politics but to bring value to my society; to the people who elected me.\u201d\n\nAyade added, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that by this decision, it is disloyal to the party (PDP). Even all through the time I spoke about my defection, I never spoke about PDP. So, for me, APC is the party to go to at this point in time because if this nation does not have a smooth transition in 2023, what we talk about Somalia will be like a child\u2019s play.\n\n\u201cThe choice to join APC at this point is based on a nationalistic approach and my commitment to my state; nothing to do with morality or the issue of whether I\u2019m loyal or not to the PDP. Besides, as many people as you see in the PDP, have defected at one time or the other. And many people that you are talking to in APC, who are so committed to this nation, were at some time in PDP.\n\n\u201cAs to whether there are issues in the PDP, no. The party stood by me all through the way. In any other legal issue that I have had, PDP had stood with me. PDP gave me the opportunity to be a senator; PDP gave me the opportunity to be governor. I would never have any time to pull down PDP. I have integrity, character and honour. My politics have ethics. My decision to join APC is to join the President to reduce the tension in the country.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigeria Union of Journalists has honoured the Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, with a distinguished Role Model Award in education, for what it described as his outstanding achievements in education in his state in the last five years.\n\nThe National President, NUJ, Chris Isiguzo, said the governor was given the award Committee after a painstaking assessment of each state in the education sector.\n\nAccording to him, the Role Model in Education Award is a special category award, given to Bello for bringing revolution to education in Kogi State.\n\nIsiguzo stated, \u201cThe award we are presenting to him (Bello) today is a special category award in education. Apart from recognising political actors that have done well in press freedom, we also take time out to single out political leaders that have by their own actions made enormous contributions across sectors.\n\n\u201cFor Governor Yahaya Bello, today, we singled him out because of the massive transformation he has brought to the education sector and we are giving him the role model award in education. Governor Yahaya Bello started a university from scratch, and today, that university is set to kick off. He has transformed the state polytechnic and other institutions.\u201d\n\nHe said these were among many other achievements of the governor, which the award committee took into consideration, including the fact that the teaching staff in Kogi State stood out clearly among their colleagues in other states.\n\nThe NUJ President added, \u201cIf you look at the teaching staff in Kogi State and compare them with their contemporaries in other states, the difference is clear. Oftentimes, political actors tend to confuse the role of the media. They see us from the point of view of antagonists.\n\n\u201cWe are institutional partners. Where a government has done well, it is our responsibility to acknowledge such achievement; where the government has also not done very well, it is also our responsibility to challenge the same government and say, in this same area, you have not done well.\u201d\n\nResponding, Bello said his administration identified the development of the education sector as the key to capital development needed for the emancipation of the people of the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cI did not know that in carrying out my constitutional responsibilities to the best of my ability and within the limited resources available, I was making a serious impact in the educational sector and paving the way for awards.\n\n\u201cThe transformed education system is the reason our youth are no longer taking to crime.\u201d",

          "title": "Restructuring Call: Ned Nwoko writes Buhari, wants President to grant full autonomy to LGA, State Assemblies, Judiciary",
          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n.asks Ohanaeze, Afenefere, Arewa, PANDEF, Other groups to give total support\n\n\u2026calls on NASS to give legal backing to Southern Govs\u2019 resolutions\n\nBy Levinus Nwabughiogu-Abuja\n\nBillionaire Lawyer and former member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ned Nwoko has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to grant full autonomy to the local government councils to facilitate their revenue allocation directly from the federation accounts.\n\nHe also asked that the same treatment be given to state houses of assembly and the judiciary just as he called on the national assembly to enact laws to legal backing to the recent resolutions of the southern governors.\n\nNwoko in an open letter to Buhari, a copy of which he made available to Vanguard in Abuja on Thursday said giving heed to the issue was the only to bring peace, unity, progress, security, and sustainable development to the country.\n\nHe also called on the socio-political regional bodies such as Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Afenefere, Arewa, PANDEF to give their total support to the call.\n\nAccording to him, the autonomy would signal the commencement of the restructuring Nigerians were hearing for.\n\nNwoko lauded Buhari for his many populist and people-oriented programmes and policies, declaring support for the President.\n\nHe said that a situation where state Governors muzzle the local government and the Houses of the assembly was highly defective to the ideals of democracy.\n\nThe letter read in parts: \u201cToday, Nigeria as a developing nation is faced with a myriad of social, economic and political challenges which have been endemic and long drawn transcending successive governments. But even with the hydra headed constraints, you have continued to stand firm in your faith and hope in the survival and growth of the nation, especially with your anti-graft crusade and selfless leadership style.\n\n\u201cI share your good vision that Nigeria must overcome her problems, rise above her inhibitions and move forward for the well-being of her over 200 million people.\n\n\u201cIn recent times there have been growing interest and anxiety in the affairs of Nigeria against the backdrop of corruption, socio-economic difficulties and insecurity by bandits across the country.\n\n\u201cI particularly share your concerns for the necessity of one Nigeria,that would guarantee peaceful coexistence, equity and social justice among the diverse inhabitants.\n\n\u201cMr. President, I am elated that you have championed this move with your policy thrust of granting autonomy to local governments as well as ensuring independence of State Assemblies and the judiciary.Your quest remains a bold patriotic template that would strengthen separation of powers among the executive, judiciary and legislature,for the benefit of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency , I join you and other well meaning Nigerians, as an impassioned citizen and concerned stakeholder in the Nigerian project to make a clarion call for the sustenance of these institutions .I specifically call for full autonomy for the local government administration in Nigeria as the bedrock of restructuring,true federalism and genuine democracy.\n\n\u201cI make bold to assert that lack of independence in local government leadership has over the years produced a weak structure that could not safe guard lives and inspire good governance at the grassroots.\n\n\u201cMy firm belief is that local government autonomy and direct funding from the Federation allocation account would embolden elected chairmen and councilors to work effectively with divisional police officers and traditional rulers to manage security as every crime is local.\n\n\u201cThe prevailing situation where most state governors control local government funds through the federation allocation account, leaving the councils as appendages of the states, is grossly defective. Local governments deserve independence to attract experienced technocrats and successful business men who have the latitude and wealth of experience to perform as chairmen.\n\n\u201cI am convinced such arrangement would herald real democracy as elections would be fought locally and popular candidates would emerge regardless of political parties and godfather phenomenon.\u201d\n\nGo beyond rhetorics on restructuring call by Southern Govs\n\n\u201cThe recent resolution by Southern governors for restructuring should go beyond rhetorics and be matched with action. What is required urgently is for the National Assembly to ensure implementation of administrative and financial autonomy in favour of democratic institutions in Nigeria especially the local governments.\n\n\u201cElections will be free and fair if local governments are independent.This will usher in the much needed election of credible aspirants. Council chairmen will be effective while Councilors will take charge of their wards. Also the kings will be held responsible for their towns and villages.\n\n\u201cIt has been generally observed that most Governors don\u2019t know what goes on in local governments areas.They rely on advisers who are most times not resident in the LGAs. Majority of the Governors control elections because they control local government executives. Free these executives and empower them through direct allocations and see what will happen with elections and security.\n\n\u201cMr. president,the restructuring we need should start from the grassroots because it is the foundation of democracy.Happily you have been in the vanguard of this campaign and I wholeheartedly support your efforts so far.\n\n\u201cI also call on Ohaneze, Afenefere, Arewa, PANDEF and other groups to give total support. I believe that if this is achieved before the next general elections in 2023, everything will change for good, to the delight of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe need strong democratic institutions at the various levels in Nigeria for the good of all. We need rule of law and social justice much more than ever before. The strike by judicial workers under JUSUN demands this reasonably. Judges deserve financial and administrative autonomy to function freely. State legislators should not be subservient to state Chief executives. Local governments must stand alone to drive effective governance at the grassroots.\n\n\u201cIt is a welcome development that public hearing on the review of the 1999 Constitution is holding simultaneously across the six geo political zones from May 26 to 27, 2021. Local government officials in collaboration with traditional rulers must mobilize their people to participate massively. Political parties, civil society organizations, human rights groups, youths and women bodies and indeed all Nigerians irrespective of tribe, religion and social status must ensure full participation in the constitutional review process.\n\n\u201cThe needed and achievable restructuring is autonomy of local governments and independence of state Assemblies and the judiciary.\n\n\u201cMy inner conviction is that such proper framework of institutional reforms will lead to the birth of a new Nigeria rooted in a glorious culture of self belonging, justice and fairness, peace and unity, political stability, economic prosperity and general fulfillment. A new Nigeria where democracy would live up to its true meaning as government of the people ,by the people and for the people, propounded by the 16th President of the United States of America, Abraham Lincoln. True democratic independence at the local governments, state assemblies and the judiciary represents the trajectory of our search for a better Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMr. President, I resolutely trust and have the confidence that you will do your utmost best as a consummate patriot and exemplary leader to bequeath a legacy of viable democracy to the present and future generations of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency,may God continue to guide you in good health and wisdom to lead Nigeria towards the attainment of the positive goals and dreams of the founding fathers.\u201d\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nLagos State Government said it contributed N428.98 billion (32.08 percent) of the N1.3 trillion total IGR generated by states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in 2020.\n\nCommissioner for Economic Planning and Budget, Sam Egube, disclosed this on Thursday, during a ministerial press briefing to mark the second anniversary of Governor Bababjide Sanwo-Olu-led administration in the state, held in Alausa, Ikeja.\n\nThis, he said, was according to April 16, 2021, the report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). This makes Lagos the highest contributor to the federal purse.\n\nEgube said: \u201cThis report shows that we are on course. It is clear proof that the \u2018THEMES AGENDA\u2019 of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu-led administration is an operational tool that is correctly aligned to our long-term development plan, and hooked up into our Medium Sector Strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe THEMES AGENDA remains strong, and all its elements remain relevant. Even in the heart of the pandemic, the pillars held through. It was like Mr. Governor saw the future, despite the headwinds that came against the pillars, such as the health pandemic and the economic downturn, which lead to a revised budget and other tactical maneuvers against the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner added that the Lagos State Development Plan (LSDP), which encompasses the State Economic Development Policy and guided by the State Development Plan (2012-2025), has been improved on and expanded to a 30-year Development Plan (2021-2051).\n\n\u201cThis new perspective plan is necessary to \u2018encourage citizens participation (Build Team Lagos); develop our people to drive productivity and protect the vulnerable (Building our Future); drive Lagos readiness and openness for Business (Building our Economy); optimising relevant infrastructure to support our growth (Building our 21st Century Mega-City) and engaging intergovernmental partnership; all these are aimed at improving the quality of lives of Lagosians.\n\n\u201cThe LSDP sits at the apex of the planning and budgetary system of the state. The document provides an overall direction for the growth and development of Lagos State. It also provides a framework through which all sectors of the economy can direct their energies and contribute to the improvement of the quality of life of people,\u201d Ebube stated.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "The Director-General of Voice of Nigeria (VON), Osita Okechukwu, has disclosed the rationale behind the defection of the Governor of Cross Rivers State from the Peoples Democratic Party to the governing APC.\n\nDAILY POST reports that Governor Ben Ayade formally declared for the ruling party at the Cross River State Executive Council Chamber, Governor\u2019s Office in Calabar after a two-hour meeting with seven APC governors led by the party\u2019s interim chairman and governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nBut, speaking in a telephone interview with DAILY POST, on Thursday, Okechukwu, a chieftain of the All Progressive Congress, pointed out that Ayade\u2019s defection was necessitated by the agrarian revolution of President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal government going on nationwide.\n\nHe added that cross river had benefited handsomely from the revolution and further posited that Ayade\u2019s entry into the All Progressive Congress would give the latter the mileage in attracting more infrastructural amenities from the center.\n\nThe VON DG commended Ayade for his wisdom in pitching tent with the progressive party, urging the Cross River State Chief Executive to study the APC manifesto carefully, as he stated that the governing party believes in Infrastructure and projects.\n\nHis words, \u201cGovernor Ayade is welcomed onboard. I think, is of the interest of his state that he wants to join the majority party. I think it is a wisdom, because, he is one of the foremost beneficiaries of President Muhammadu Buhari agrarian revolution.\n\n\u201cHe has benefited handsomely, and he knows. Now he is in APC, he has great mileage in attracting more amenities from the center. I think, the governor is in order.\n\n\u201cLet him carefully go through our manifesto so that he would understand where we are coming from. That APC socially believe in infrastructure and projects. Like the PDP that share the money, so, he has alot to learn as pertaining to infrastructure.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on why he was joining the APC, Governor Ben Ayade highlighted the character attributes of President Muhammadu Buhari and the realisation that Cross River, which has been emasculated economically following the ceding of its oil wells, needed to be in sync with the party at the center, as the main reasons for moving.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201chaving seen and known the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and his commitment to this country, his nationalistic disposition and all the efforts he has made to bring Nigeria to where we are today, it is obvious that at this point, we needed to join hands with him to build a Nigeria that we can be proud of.\u201d",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nNigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) has bestowed a \u2018role model in education\u2019 award on Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State for his \u2018outstanding achievements in education\u2019 in the last four years.\n\nDuring the presentation of the award in Abuja on Wednesday, May 19, the National President of NUJ, Chris Isiguzo, said Governor Bello was singled out by the award\u2019s committee out of the 36 state governors after a painstaking assessment of the education sector in each state. According to him, the award is a special category award given to Bello for bringing revolution to education in Kogi State.\n\nIsiguzo said this is among many other achievements of the governor, which the award Committee took into consideration, including the fact that the teaching staff in Kogi State stood out clearly among their colleagues in other states.\n\n\u201cThe award we are presenting to Governor Bello today is a special category award in education. Apart from recognising political actors that have done well for press freedom, we also take time out to single out political leaders that have by their own actions made enormous contributions across sectors.\n\n\u201cFor Governor Yahaya Bello, we singled him out because of the massive transformation he has brought to the education sector and we are giving him the role model award in education. He started a university from the scratch, and today, that university is set to kick off. He has transformed the state polytechnic and other institutions.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the teaching staff in Kogi State and compare them with their contemporaries in other states, the difference is clear. Oftentimes, political actors tend to confuse the role of the media. They see us from the point of view of antagonists.\n\n\u201cWe are institutional partners. Where a government has done well, it is our responsibility to acknowledge such achievement; where the government has also not done very well, it is also our responsibility to challenge the same government and say, in this same area, you have not done well,\u201d Isiguzo said.\n\nThe NUJ President added, \u201cSo many people may not understand what we are doing today, but it is something that we must have to do because we must encourage the shining examples we have in the present democratic experiment. This is why we have gathered here together with my colleagues, and with the endorsement of the national leadership of the union, we have come to present this special recognition to Governor Bello.\n\n\u201cI must also point out that in arriving at this conclusion, it was not something that one or two persons sat down to do. The Managing Director, Enentis Communications, Dr. Peter Ademu, led the team of people that went through and screened the nominations. At the end of the day, they informed me that they had selected Governor Bello after thorough screening, that he stands out of the governors of the 36 states.\u201d\n\nResponding, Bello said his administration identified the development of education sector as the key to high level human capital development needed for the emancipation of the people of the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cI did not know that in carrying out my constitutional responsibilities to the best of my ability and within the limited resources available, I was making serious impact in the educational sector and paving the way for awards. The transformed education system is the reason our youth are no longer taking to crime.\u201d",

          "text": "From Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu\n\nThe Global Society for Anti-Corruption (GSAC) yesterday alerted that no fewer than 500 Nigerian citizens were languishing in various prisons in Togo.\n\nConsequently, it has called on the federal government to intervene on behalf her citizens and ensure that they get justice.\n\nGSAC\u2019s President, Mr Frankline Ezeona who briefed newsmen in Enugu on a recent fact-finding visit his organisation made to Togolese prisons, disclosed that a good number of the Nigerians in the said Togo prisons had spent more than 10 years awaiting trial.\n\nEzeona who decried the inhuman treatment being meted to the Nigerians by officials of the Togolese prisons, stressed that their situation had been compounded by the fact that they no longer have access to certain relief materials due to the ravaging COVID-19.\n\nFederal government intervention he said was needed because most of the Nigerians found themselves in prison out of ignorance, while others were victims of cyber crimes.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat we discovered is that many of them got into businesses like network marketing and didn\u2019t know they were banned in that country. Some of them are genuine businessmen and women, who got into trouble with indigenous and what have you. None was discovered to have committed any capital offence. But they got them and threw them into the prison and for years, they don\u2019t have dates in courts.\n\n\u201cSo we think that the federal government should intervene in their matter. Let some of them be released or extradited to face their prison terms in Nigeria. We are asking the Nigerian government to see how some of them can be released and granted amnesty based on stipulated law \u2013 on age, pregnancy, health and what have you.\n\n\u201cFor some released, we are asking that they be provided with relief materials or compensation because, it was discovered that, many of them are not guilty from the offences they were charged.\u201d\n\nHe commended the newly posted Nigerian Ambassador to Togo, Adebowale Adesina for the interest he had shown on the plight of the Nigerians in Togolese prisons.\n\nThe GSAC\u2019s legal team on the fact-finding tour led by Chidinma Udegbunam, disclosed that the organisation intervened following several distress messages it received from Nigerian prisoners in Togo.\n\nAccording to her, of the 13 prisons in Togo, the one in Lome alone was housing 300 Nigerian prisoners, noting that their situation was pitiable as they were lumped in already congested facilities.\n\nShe said, \u201cThere are ones that have spent nine years in prison for misdemeanor. We wanted to look at their flies but were not allowed to do so. The legal system operation in Togo is different from that of Nigeria. There, when one is accused of crime, he is being taken as guilty until proven otherwise. Anyone arrested is treated as convict. It is there system and their people know it is working for them. The administrative system is centralized.\u201d\n\nNarrating the ordeal of one Jerry Odiesa, a Nigerian from Delta state, whom she said had served 11 of his 20 years conviction over cyber related crime, Udegbunam stated that what took him to prison was ignorance.\n\nShe further said, \u201cWe think the Togolese government should speedy up trial of these Nigerians and not allow one who is a suspect stay more years than they could have spent, because justice delayed is justice denied.",

          "title": "FBN CRISIS AND THE FINANCIAL SECTOR",
          "text": "CBN should be vigilant and take prompt actions to prevent financial risks\n\nThe recent boardroom crisis in the 127-year-old First Bank of Nigeria Ltd (FBN) which culminated in the intervention of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has again raised corporate governance concerns in the financial sector. The country is replete with relics of failed institutions both in the public and private sectors, occasioned by sundry ills, such as poor corporate governance, mind-boggling corruption, gross negligence, incompetence and insider abuses, among others. It is not a road we should travel again.\n\nTrouble started when the CBN dissolved and reconstituted the boards of FBN and those of its parent company, FBN Holdings Plc. The FBN Managing Director earlier removed by the former board was reinstated by the apex bank. With what has played out in the last few weeks, the issues at stake are clearly in the public domain and need not be over-flogged. The place of the FBN in the financial sector cannot be overstressed. CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele put it rather succinctly: \u201cBy our last assessment, First Bank has over 31 million customers, with a deposit base of N4.2 trillion, shareholders\u2019 funds of N618 billion and NIBSS instant payment (NIP) processing capacity of 22 per cent of the industry.\u201d\n\nAvailable records indicate that the FBN maintained healthy operations until the 2016 financial year when the CBN\u2019s target examination revealed that the bank was in grave financial condition with its capital adequacy ratio (CAR) and non-performing loans ratio (NPLs) substantially breaching acceptable prudential standards. The problems at the bank were attributed to bad credit decisions, significant and non-performing insider loans and poor corporate governance practices. The bank would probably have been in serious trouble were it not for CBN regulatory forbearance, a financial term for softening some of the strict rules that banks must comply with if they are to avoid being taken over by the regulator.\n\nIncidentally, the financial sector has had more than its fair share of this malaise. Between 1989 and December 2019, the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation NDIC) had liquidated 425 financial institutions, including 51 Deposit Money Banks (DMBs), 325 Micro Finance Banks (MFBs), and 51 Primary Mortgage Banks (PMBs) largely due to the above ills. Bank failures come with a lot of ripple effects on the economy, including job losses and loss of depositors\u2019 funds, among others. Which is why efforts by the CBN to ensure that FBN does not only recover from the rather unsavoury corporate governance misdemeanours and insider abuses that characterised its operations in the last couple of years, are commendable.\n\nWith the level of CAR at the FBN, recapitalisation has become the only option to return the banking giant on a sound footing. Everything should be done to secure investor confidence as the bank now needs to raise fresh capital and also decide, quite urgently, where to raise it from. Fortunately, the recent boardroom crisis and the ensuing disclosures have not triggered a run on the bank. But beyond the fate of one bank, pertinent questions that arise include: At what point did the CBN uncover FBN investments in Honeywell and Bharti Airtel? What measures are being considered to ensure that the level of alleged insider abuses in FBN are stamped out in the financial sector? Has the CBN consistently adhered to its circular which requires that insider-related facilities must not exceed 10 per cent of paid-up share capital?\n\nWe urge the CBN to take cognisance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommendations of December 2020. The Fund had urged vigilance and corrective actions to prevent an increase in financial stability risks arising from increasing NPLs. In this connection, it noted that debt relief measures should remain time-bound and limited to clients with good pre-crisis fundamentals, in line with existing regulations.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The First Bank drama has turned out to be much more exciting than expected. After the tango with the Central Bank of Nigeria, one could argue that only one individual emerged victorious without suffering any setback. Who would this be if not Sola Adeduntan?\n\nHistorians talk about footballers who can change the momentum of a game, excite an entire stadium of committed and neutral spectators, and even snatch the adulation meant for all eleven players of his team. In a way, this is what has happened with Sola Adeduntan and the First Bank Board of Executive Directors. For those who are still behind on recent happenings, the entire executive board of First Bank was sacked by the CBN after the board\u2014for lack of a better phrase\u2014retired Adeduntan from his position as Group MD/CEO. Adeduntan was chased out on April 28 but was reinstated by the CBN on April 29, less than 24 hours later.\n\nFolks have attempted to analyse the entire drama from different perspectives. One narrative supposed to have originated from the CBN is that First Bank had given out several loans to its customers, loans that have not been paid back. Another narrative is that Adeduntan was sacked without regard for the due process. The latter narrative is the more popular. Initially, the former executive directors reported that Adeduntan had completed his four-year tenure since he assumed the MD/CEO position in 2016. Thus, they ushered him out and announced that his deputy, Gbenga Shobo, will replace him. And then CBN arrived on the scene.\n\nIn the eyes of the apex bank, Adeduntan\u2019s sack was reminiscent of a coup that might have set a bad precedent for other banking institutions in the country. Thus, to salvage the situation, Adeduntan was reinstated. However, whether he will continue for another four years is yet to be known. In short, the man is the luckiest fellow out there in the Nigerian corporate yard.\n\nIt could even be said that he has nine lives, and the old executive directors could not extinguish even one.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nigerians are making history within the country and beyond, no doubts about this. This generation, it seems, will be remembered for breaking the many limitations that stagnated their forebears. Taiwo Afolabi, the super businessman, founder and Chairman of SIFAX Group and SAHCOL, is at the frontline in this endeavour. With his Marriott Hotel at grand completion, the man has shot ahead of his peers in Nigeria and the rest of Africa.\n\nThe magnificence of Afolabi\u2019s Marriott Hotel is a cause for celebration in the grand scheme of things, but this has left other business people and corporate leaders with similar statuses to Afolabi tearing out what little hair they have left. In a short time, Afolabi managed to break the mould in West Africa with a multi-billion-Naira 5-star monster hotel, the first of its kind in the region.\n\nMarriott Hotel has demonstrated that the SIFAX conglomerate is not the height of Taiwo Afolabi\u2019s abilities. Then again, this is not altogether surprising about a man who started SIFAX (a massive multinational with active interests in all things maritime and nautical, oil and gas, aviation, finance, and hospitality) before he clocked 27.\n\nEven with an LLB from a more prestigious institution, how many have reached this height? But in Afolabi\u2019s case, it was only a matter of time. That\u2019s an eonic genius for you.\n\nBorn in Ogun and educated in Ondo, Oyo, and Lagos, Taiwo Afolabi essentially walked the lengths of the South-West in his youth. Perhaps it is on account of this that he has climbed outside of the traditional boundaries of success and paved a new path for others to follow.\n\nIn the years to come, history will be kind to Afolabi for spending more than 10 billion to put Nigeria on the map of Africa\u2019s best and most luxurious hotels and accommodations. May 19, 2021 \u2014 the day Marriott Hotel will be opened to all and sundry, and Taiwo Afolabi establishes himself as a super corporate leader in West Africa. This is the true corporate spirit: onward and forward.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Federal Government on Thursday convened a conciliatory meeting with the Kaduna State government and the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) to resolve the impasse that has grounded labour activities in the state.\n\nMr Chris Ngige, who is the Minister of Labour and Employment, presided over the meeting while NLC National President, Ayuba Wabba, led other labour leaders to the discussion.\n\nBut the Commissioner of Local Government Affairs in Kaduna, Jaafaru Sabi, represented Governor Nasir El-Rufai and the state government.\n\nOn the deliberations at the end of the meeting, Ngige told reporters that the state government delegation disagrees with the labour leaders.\n\nHe noted that the meeting, thereafter, resolved to constitute a 10-man committee comprising six state government officials and three NLC representatives to discuss and resolve the impasse.\n\nThe minister stated that the committee chaired by the Head of Service in Kaduna State was given a mandate of up to Tuesday next week to report to him.\n\nAccording to him, the meeting agreed that no person shall be victimised for participating in the industrial action in Kaduna after which both parties appended their signature to the documents.\n\nAttempt To Shut Down Kaduna\n\nGiving his opening remarks shortly after the meeting began, Ngige had said that the Federal Government was very concerned about developments in Kaduna due to insecurity.\n\nHe decried that the situation was further compounded by the strike, which was already crippling economic activities in the state, noting that this informed the intervention of the Federal Government.\n\nThe minister believes the labour issues could have been avoided and all parties to the negotiation are products of the Nigerian Constitution, hence the need to work together for the well-being of the people.\n\nHe stressed the importance of dialogue and the need for restraint in trying to enforce one\u2019s rights, after which he laid the ground rules for the discussions and appealed to the parties to give peace a chance while negotiations continued.\n\nNgige had, however, warned that he would not hesitate to invoke relevant sections of the Trade Dispute Act and escalate the situation to the National Industrial Court if the intervention efforts fail.\n\nIn his remarks, Jaafaru stated that the state government was very displeased and condemned the actions of the NLC in its attempt to shut down the state.\n\nHe outlined some of the efforts of the state government to promote the welfare of civil servants, including the implementation of the N30,000 minimum wage.\n\nThe Last Resort\n\nThe commissioner disclosed that the state government had employed 25,000 primary school teachers and 1,700 science teachers in secondary schools, besides other employment processes that were already in the advanced stage.\n\nAccording to him, the public service consumes four out of every five naira the state has while salaries and allowances take a huge chunk of revenue allocations to the local governments.\n\nWabba, on his part, thanked the Federal Government for its intervention, saying the issue that brought the parties to the meeting was because of the state government\u2019s policy to downsize its workforce.\n\nHe explained that the crux of the issue was the payment of emoluments to affected staff during redundancy, stressing that this was never done.\n\nThe NLC president stressed that the state government never engaged with the workers before disengaging them, insisting that the right thing was never done.\n\nHe accused the state government of ignoring the series of letters sent to it requesting that the workers should be engaged before being disengaged from service.\n\nThe decision to protest and to go on strike, according to him, is the last resort and labour never went to any office to disrupt any service during the protest in Kaduna.\n\nWabba informed the meeting that all that the labour wanted was transparency in the process of disengaging the workers.",

Security Council was due to meet later on Sunday to discuss the worst outbreak of Israeli-Palestinian violence in years.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas have insisted they would continue their cross-border fire, a day after Israel destroyed a 12-storey building in Gaza City that had housed the U.S. Associated Press and Qatar-based Al Jazeera media operations.\n\nThe Israel military said the al-Jala building was a legitimate military target, containing Hamas military offices, and that it had given warnings to civilians to get out of the building before the attack.\n\nThe AP condemned the attack, and asked Israel to put forward evidence. \u201cWe have had no indication Hamas was in the building or active in the building,\u201d the news organisation said in a statement.\n\nIn what it called a reprisal for Israel\u2019s destruction of the al-Jala building, Hamas fired rockets at Tel Aviv and towns in southern Israel early on Sunday.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late on Saturday that Israel was \u201cstill in the midst of this operation, it is still not over and this operation will continue as long as necessary.\u201d\n\nIn a burst of air strikes early on Sunday, Israel targeted the home of Yehya Al-Sinwar, who since 2017 has headed the political and military wings of Hamas in Gaza, the group\u2019s TV station said.\n\nAnother air strike killed a Gaza neurologist and wounded his wife and daughter, Palestinian medics and relatives said.\n\nHamas began its rocket assault on Monday after weeks of tensions over a court case to evict several Palestinian families in East Jerusalem, and in retaliation for Israeli police clashes with Palestinians near the city\u2019s Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam\u2019s third holiest site, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\nSpeaking to crowds of protesters in the Qatari capital of Doha, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said late on Saturday that the underlying cause of the hostilities was Jerusalem.\n\n\u201cThe Zionists thought \u2026 they could demolish Al-Aqsa mosque. They thought they could displace our people in Sheikh Jarrah,\u201d said Haniyeh.\n\n\u201cI say to Netanyahu: do not play with fire,\u201d he continued, amid cheers from the crowd. \u201cThe title of this battle today, the title of the war, and the title of the intifada, is Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jerusalem,\u201d using the Arabic word for \u2018uprising\u2019.\n\nHamas, Islamic Jihad and other militant groups have fired around 2,300 rockets from Gaza since Monday, the Israeli military said on Saturday. It said about 1,000 were intercepted by missile defences and 380 fell into the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsrael has launched more than 1,000 air and artillery strikes into the densely populated coastal strip, saying they were aimed at Hamas and other militant targets.\n\nEarlier this week, the International Criminal Court\u2019s chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, told Reuters the court was \u201cmonitoring very closely\u201d the latest escalation of hostilities, amid an investigation now under way into alleged war crimes in earlier bouts of the conflict.\n\nNetanyahu accused Hamas of \u201ccommitting a double war crime\u201d by targeting civilians, and using Palestinian civilians as \u201chuman shields.\u201d\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reminded \u201call sides that any indiscriminate targeting of civilian and media structures violates international law and must be avoided at all costs,\u201d UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nThere has been a flurry of US diplomacy in recent days to try to quell the violence.\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s envoy, Hady Amr, arrived in Israel on Friday for talks. Biden spoke with both Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas late on Saturday, and updated them on US diplomatic efforts, the White House said.\n\nBut any mediation is complicated by the fact that the United States and most western powers do not talk to Hamas, which they regard as a terrorist organisation. And Abbas, whose power base is in the occupied West Bank, exerts little influence over Hamas in Gaza.\n\nIn Israel, the conflict has been accompanied by violence amongst the country\u2019s mixed communities of Jews and Arabs, with synagogues attacked and Arab-owned shops vandalised.\n\nThere has also been an upsurge in deadly clashes in the occupied West Bank. At least 12 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank since Friday, most of them during clashes.",
