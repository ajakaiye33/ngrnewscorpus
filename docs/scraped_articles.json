          "text": "The Academic Staff Union of Universities has threatened to embark on an industrial action if the 13 months\u2019 salaries of over 1,000 of its members across the country were not paid.\n\nDr. Lazarus Maigoro, Chairman, University of Jos chapter of the union, who stated this in a statement on Saturday, in Jos, added that the Federal Government had also withheld the check-off dues of the affected members.\n\nHe accused Ahmed Idris, the Accountant General of Federation (AGF), of systematically denying the lecturers their remuneration, even after government and the union had reached an agreement on non-victimisation of its members following their last strike.\n\nThe chairman alleged that the affected members were being threatened to either enrol into the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) platform or have their salaries withheld.\n\nHe explained that despite the directives of President Muhammadu Buhari, that members of the union be paid their full remuneration, the AGF had denied the affected union members their pay, in complete violation of the terms of the agreement signed between the union and government.\n\nMaigoro said that the office of the AGF had continued to feed the public and some sections of government with false reasons over the matter, such as incorrect BVN numbers, incorrectly spelt names and their sequential arrangement, among others.\n\nHe, however, added that such excuses were not tenable, because the bursary departments of their various institutions had submitted the names severally to the authorities, but the problem had continued to persist.\n\n\u201cASUU wants to bring to the attention of the Nigerian public the deliberate, systematic and unpatriotic actions of the Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, on the future of education in Nigeria.\n\n\u201d Idris, from all intent and purposes, is bent on withholding the salaries of over 1,000 members of ASUU spread across the country, with more than 100 of such lecturers being members of our branch at the University of Jos.\n\n\u201cThis is simply because they participated in the last strike and refused to enrol in the much discredited IPPIS, despite the non-victimisation clause signed in the Memorandum of Action (MoA) that led to the suspension of the strike in December 2020.\n\n\u201cDespite the directive given by Mr President to pay the salaries of all lecturers, the AGF has refused to pay their salaries, for periods ranging from four to thirteen months, respectively.\n\n\u201dMore worrisome is the fact that while the AGF is refusing to pay the salaries, his staff are busy calling the affected lecturers and insisting they have to register with IPPIS before they are paid; some are even asked to forfeit a part of their salaries in order to be paid. So, it is very clear that this is a deliberate act on the part of the AGF and his staff.\n\n\u201cMany of our members at the University of Jos have not been paid salaries from February 2020 to date. How they are expected to go to the classroom and teach beats my imagination.\n\n\u201cIt is not news, that our union have vowed to fight back at any cost in order to salvage our colleagues from his tyranny and unpatriotic act against not just ASUU members, but the future of education in Nigeria and so, if nothing is urgently done, we will be forced to take action,\u201d Maigoro said.\n\n\u201cThe union has gotten to a stage where it may be forced to take drastic measures to save the lives and families of its members because their despair is also our collective despair.\n\nMaigoro also said that the inability of government to pay other allowances, such as sabbatical, visiting, part-time and contract staff was also destroying the university system in the country.\n\n\u201cApart from the refusal to pay the salaries of our members, the lack of payment of allowances of sabbatical, visiting, part-time, contract staff is further killing the federal universities in Nigeria, and this is all because of IPPIS.\n\n\u201cWe hope that whatever decision the union takes, will not be misconstrued by the Nigerian public, especially seeing the seeming silence of the public and the government over the complete violation of our 2020 MoA,\u201d he said\n\nMaigoro called on President Buhari to wade into the matter, in order to save the affected members, as well as the future of education in Nigeria.

          "text": "The Director-General, Centre for Justice on Religious and Ethnicity, Rev. Kallamu Musa Ali Dikwa, has said that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government from 2015 to date, has introduced some policies that are detrimental to the peace, unity and the future development of Nigeria.\n\nAddressing newsmen in Kaduna on Sunday, the Director-General, said, \u201cI will want Nigerians to critically look at since the inception of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government from 2015 to date, there are some policies that are detrimental to the peaceful, unity and the future development of this great country called Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that since the inception of the present government, it has not been business as usual, stating that terrorism, kidnapping, banditry and other forms of criminality have become the order of the day.\n\nAccording to him, the appointment of security chiefs to pilot the affairs to safeguard the territorial integrity of the country have woefully failed, adding that many Nigerians have left their ancestral homes to other places for safety which is not there for them.\n\nBiafra: Nigeria\u2019s days of existence are numbered \u2013 MASSOB\n\nRev. Dikwa is of the view that many Nigerians have become Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in their motherland due to lack of focus and direction by the present government and its failure to put things right for the country.\n\nHe added that the appointment of Dr Isah Ibrahim Ali Pantami as Minister of Communication and Digital Economy is a real slap to the integrity of the country, alleging that real investigation has shown that he is a member of Al qaeda, Boko Haram, who is known to have terrorised the former President Goodluck Jonathan-led government for his boss, General Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cFor a man to have fully informed Nigerians of what he did in the past is a strong submission that having his type as the minister in the present government is a serious danger to the future existence of the country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis goes to shows that President Muhammadu Buhari-led government has a hidden agenda against the good people of Nigeria and for the presidency to have defended the minister of what he did in the past, one would have expected that as a true Nigerian who is confessing what he did in the past, he would have denounced such practices long ago but for Dr Pantami to have forcefully said he regretted what he did in the past is not accepted after the outcry of Nigerians against who they know him with.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cDr Isah Ibrahim Ali Pantami is known to have done his evil practices against the corporate existence of the country around 2009 to 2011 and then he was above 30 years and for Sheikh Ahmad Gumi to have defended the minister that even at the age of 40, Islamically, one is still a child. One would ask, is Nigeria practising Islamic constitution? However, after the age of 18 and above, one is considered an adult.\u201d\n\nRev. Dikwa stressed that imposing of RUGA which is being practiced by the Fulanis to be a national issue should be wiped out completely, pointing out that by ordering the Attorney General to gazette the issue of Fulani settlements in every part of the country is a pure agenda by the present administration which it has in mind before coming to power that is not known by many Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe plan is to use the RUGA project to ensure the jihadist war continue and captured every part of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe expressed concern that while the lgbos are seeking for Biafra, the President has threatened them which he deliberately refused to warn and seriously fight the Fulanis and Boko Haram with the way he threatens the Igbos, saying that they are demanding for their rights but the Fulanis who are all over the country killings, kidnapping and destroying the corporate existence of this great country.\n\nHe lamented that President Buhari has finally divided the country based on religion and tribe, stressing that the recent appointment of the Chief of Army Staff after the death of General Attahiru is a clear manifestation of the President\u2019s plan for deliberately sacking of about 29 Generals who are competent and have received all training to be able to defend the territorial integrity of the country from the hands of the insurgents.\n\nHe called on the attention of Nigerians not to view what is happening in the country on religious, tribal or sectional views but must honestly and sincerely look at the corporate existence of the country by insisting that the right thing must be seen to have been done for the country to move forward as an entity.\n\nHe also called on the 9th National Assembly to do justice to Nigerians by immediately impeaching President Muhammadu Buhari if he fails to sincerely address serious National issues that require his attention for different sections of the country that keep on insisting on secession as the only solution.\n\nISWAP fighters die as troops foil Dikwa attack",

Dare Kadiri, once accused Oluomo of shrouding the house financial records in secrecy.\n\nWhile accusing Oluomo of masterminding his removal, Kadiri said, \u201cThe Ogun State Assembly is not supposed to be a cult where you cannot ask for financial information of the house. How can I, at this level of mine, be in a place and I don\u2019t know the financial report of the house? That\u2019s what caused all this mess.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the letter from the EFCC on radio, Oluomo stated: \u201cWe have an issue in the house, somebody, a member of the house wrote a letter through his lawyer asking that we give him some information. And we told the lawyer that you\u2019re not EFCC, you don\u2019t have the right to ask that question. Our account is being audited.\n\n\u201cProbably the person is not satisfied and he wrote a letter to the EFCC. The EFCC wrote to us. Unfortunately, the letter came during the strike. But in my own stride, I just called the clerk of the house to reply to them that our staff are on strike and immediately they resume, we will give them all the information required.\n\n\u201cThey are asking for information from 2015, I wasn\u2019t at the helm of affairs from 2015 to 2019.\n\n\u201cThere is one piece of information I want the people of Ogun State to know, Ogun State House of Assembly is not autonomous. We are given a specific amount of money, which is our salaries and allowances. We don\u2019t take anything more than that. And it is the same amount which the house had been collecting since 2015 that we are still collecting now, the same with allowances. We don\u2019t have the money to squander in the house.\n\n\u201cThe money that is given to us is our allowance and running cost, which is already templates. This template I am talking about was there before I even thought of coming to the house. There is no way you will take one Kobo from one item to another.\n\n\u201cThat is why when they said the EFCC wrote to us, I said good for us. Write them back that our staff are on strike and they are the custodian of all the documents.\n\n\u201cThe moment they resume, they are working day and night. I have even approved money for them to buy stationeries and repair photocopiers to put everything together and send to EFCC. I challenge the EFCC to do their job thoroughly in the Ogun State House of Assembly. We don\u2019t have anything to hide. We are not thieves,\u201d Oluomo submitted.\n\nAttahiru: Probe, reveal finding of plane crash that killed Army Chief, others \u2013 Arewa youths",

          "text": "By Damilola Fatunmise\n\nFor Titi Adeoye, acting is her second nature. She can play any role spontaneously having been acting in school and church before going professional.\n\nIn this interview, she narrated her journey into the movie industry, her heartbreak experience and greatest fear. Enjoy it.\n\nTell us about yourself and how you came into acting?\n\nI am Titilayomi Adeoye. I hail from the city of Ibadan. I studied Mass Communication at the Polytechnic, Ibadan and after my Industrial Training at Ogun State Television (OGTV); I proceeded for my HND also in Mass Communication. For me, acting is a natural talent from God, it is my second nature and I can play any role spontaneously having been acting in school and church before going professional. I joined Mr. Latin Theater Group in 2007. Mr. Latin gave me the opportunity to act as an agent in the movie titled, Baba Eleran in London. It was a big deal for me at that time.\n\nHow many movies have you featured in till date?\n\nSincerely, I have lost count.\n\nWhat\u2019s your greatest challenge in the movie industry?\n\nFor me, the only challenge is lack of opportunities to prove my abilities. But as I persevered and turned up at locations on time, each role assigned to me was done perfectly; confidence in me built up and that is how I get other opportunities to showcase my God-given talent.\n\nHave you produced any movie of your own?\n\nYes. I have produced over 10 home movies both in English and Yoruba. I am the producer of Pero, Scuffle, So Far So Close, Okanran, Tewe Tegbo, Eje, Ahon Mi, Omo Mala, Mojere, Ojo Ife Bere and many more.\n\nWhat part of your body do you consider your selling point?\n\nMy pointed nose and boobs.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt\u2019s because I get compliments a lot about them from people.\n\nWhat has fame stolen from you?\n\nI am still myself. I promised myself not to let anything take who I am away from me.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about Titilayomi?\n\nComing out of my shell gradually to do something different.\n\nAside acting, what else do you do for a living?\n\nAside acting, I\u2019m also a realtor. I sell properties\u2026.\n\nAre you in any relationship at the moment?\n\nI would rather not say anything about that. I want to keep my private life private.\n\nWhat\u2019s your greatest fear in life? My greatest fear is failure. So many people look up to me that I can\u2019t afford to let them down.\n\nDo you believe in scandal for fame?\n\nNo. I guide against scandal in all parts. I don\u2019t need to be involved in scandal before I become popular. I love to keep my nose clean always.\n\nWhat\u2019s the highest thing you\u2019ve ever done for your man?\n\nI got him a job, fed him and even clothed him, but the relationship didn\u2019t work out. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t ignore the signs.\n\nWhat is your turn off in a man?\n\nLies and deceits. I can\u2019t stand a man who lies.\n\nCan you have sex on a first date?\n\nNo! Sex is a bond. I need to be connected to you before I can have sex with you.\n\nCan you recount the happiest day of your life?\n\nAnytime I witness the breaking of a new day is my happiest. I don\u203at joke with that great opportunity at all.",

          "title": "Dot-in-circle: Amechi lambasts Buhari",
          "text": "From David Onwuchekwa\n\nFirst Aviation Minister in the First Republic, Chief Mbazulike Amechi has tackled President Muhammadu Buhari for describing Ndigbo as a dot-in-a- circle, condemning the wrong choice of words and lack of diplomacy on the part of Mr President.\n\nHe also talked about agitation for self-determination and revealed what he would have done, if he were in President Buhari\u2019s shoes. Chief Amechi who has just clocked 92 years looked at other national issues. Excerpt:\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari recently called the Igbo a dot in circle. What is your reaction to that?\n\nBuhari\u2019s deep-rooted hatred for Ndigbo is not a new thing. Buhari\u2019s lack of diplomacy even in government and use of diplomatic language or the language that fits a president is well known in Nigeria because as at today, even though Buhari is not wearing a military uniform, he is still the same soldier who overthrew a Fulani-led government in 1983 because the constitution of the then National Party of Nigeria (NPN) said that the next president of the country will be an Igbo man and Buhari swore that an Igbo will never be a president of the country. So, his hatred for Ndigbo and everything Igbo is not a new thing to me. And then his poor choice of language as a president, a real president would have found better words to use than that expression that Ndigbo are a dot in a circle. That is a poor choice of words, very unpresidential. That is all I can say about it. Now, yes, he said that the Southeast, that Igbo do not have access to the sea. There are many countries of the world that have no access to the sea yet they function. I have said it personally that I believe in a bigger country, Nigeria that I fought for. I dedicated my entire youth to the struggle for independence of Nigeria, a big country. And up till today I don\u2019t believe that Nigeria should break. But if Nigeria breaks, Buhari is responsible for the breaking of the country. If this country disintegrates, Buhari should accept total responsibility for it because it is his actions and inactions that have brought the whole thing in Nigeria to the level we are now.\n\nWhat is your opinion about the President\u2019s plan to return grazing routes and open grazing even when the Southern governors have banned it?\n\nThis question of Fulanis and cattle herders and all that is a new language and it only came up in Buhari\u2019s regime. There have been governments in Nigeria. There were NCNC and AG in Nigeria as political parties. There have been military regimes in Nigeria. The Fulanis were bringing their cattle to the East, West and South to sell. Buhari is the only president who wants to equate Fulani economy and empire with his attempt to Fulanize Nigeria and to Islamize Nigeria. That is what is causing the whole trouble. That is for allowing the Fulanis to be armed and allowing his government, people inside his government to arm the herders and they come down here, they shoot people, they damage crops, they rape women, kidnap people and not one of them has been arraigned in any court of law even though those who are arrested and handed over to the police are released the following day. What kind of president is that? The younger elements who are agitating for separation, agitating for Biafra or even the Yoruba now apart from the South-south which is another question which will be dealt with later. Will the South-south talk, are they free to talk?\n\nLet\u2019s leave that. Those who are free to talk are talking. Now, the younger elements say instead of being slaves to Fulanis after coming out from British imperialism to Fulani Empire, the Igbo say we don\u2019t support that. My own case is that the younger elements who did not see how we ran the country before they were born, how there was equity and balance in the country grew up to see themselves marginalized in their own country, rendered poor in the midst of plenty in their own country, and they said no, the system has to be changed because we have never been slaves in our lifetime. Our history shows we have never been slaves, let us go. A human president, a president with human feelings would not have stopped them of that. All he has to do is to conduct a plebiscite and ask Igbo to come and vote whether really they should go based on what these younger elements are saying or remain. How is he (Buhari) sure, in any case that if a plebiscite is called the majority will say we will go. Igbo have so many investments in other parts of Nigeria and West Africa. Igbo abroad are more in population and richer than Igbo at home. And so, they would certainly want that spread to be. The only thing they want is freedom, give us equity and balance that is all they are asking for in the affairs of the country. Let us compete with others, but you cannot come and take our general wealth and deny us our fair share. That is what they are saying. So, the proper thing would have been let\u2019s go and do the plebiscites, if the majority says we will go, let them go in peace. If the majority says we will not go, no we are not going, then they will remain and negotiate and find out what is their anger, what is the problem and all that and then solve them. That is the way I should have handled it, if I were in the position of the president. If the man is the kind of man who would listen to advice, that is what I would have advised him to do. He doesn\u2019t take good advice and always being misled by the cabals around him. He is not free again. Have you seen a president who has never made a speech himself except occasionally when he reads what is written for him by his speech writers and they pass it on to him, which he revises a number of times and then come to read it. After reading it, have you ever seen him take any question from the press? You are a pressman find out.\n\nLet\u2019s return to grazing routes and open grazing.\n\nDespite the ban placed by the Southern Governors, Mr President insists that the ban will not hold.\n\nWhat is your take on that?\n\nThe president has no such power even under the military constitution we are operating in Nigeria. He has no power to decide on land matters in the states. The states have the powers to decide on what to do with land in the individual states not the Federal Government. He cannot implement it, he cannot exercise it, although as a dictator, he can send soldiers to go and show force and all that. But the question is, it is all the same illegality that is going on otherwise he has no powers at all to do that. The presidency has nothing to say about this is a grazing ground, this is not a grazing ground, no. Only states governments have that right.\n\nWhat was the relationship like with nomadic Fulani herders in your days and at what point did we get it wrong?\n\nIn my days, I belonged to a political party that did not discriminate. The Fulanis were bringing their cattle. Those who lived permanently bought the cattle and the cattle were escorted on the roads. There were no so many trailers in our days. They were taking them along the road, but they were not allowed into farms. There was discipline then. Allowing them into farms is to provoke crisis to kill the people and that is what they are doing now. And that is what they continue to do. So, in our own time they mixed up well with our people. There was peace and harmony. One of the Fulanis, Alhaji Umaro was elected a member of Eastern House of Chiefs. Another young Fulani man was made the Mayor of Enugu, a Fulani man from Sokoto. He was elected two terms as a Mayor of Enugu because he was a President of Enugu youth branch of NCNC which I was serving as Secretary General. So, they were just part of us. They had absolute freedom and we were all living in peace and harmony. Nobody disturbed them. They were not particularly educated, but if we found any of them showing interest in education, we encouraged them to embrace education. The point we got it wrong is at the point of Muhammadu Buhari as the president of Nigeria. That was when the whole thing started. It didn\u2019t start in Shagari\u2019s time, it didn\u2019t start in Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s time, it didn\u2019t start in Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s time. It started with President Buhari because of his other ambition of colonizing Nigeria, that Nigeria is a property bequeathed to them by Uthman Dan Fodio. That is the point we got it wrong.\n\nAnambra governorship election will come up on November 6 as scheduled by the INEC. What are your expectations, advice to political parties and Anambra people?\n\nThe individual political parties are doing their game. Some of the aspirants have come to me to inform me they are interested in the election. They asked for my prayer and I prayed that God may make the best among them to lead Anambra for the next four or eight years. It won\u2019t be said that the present government we have is any of the best. That thing there is a one-man show. So, he is going out next year, let him go out. Whosoever wins, let him know that Anambra State has wise men. Anambra has great names and great men in Nigeria. Let him realize that Anambra is full of hard-working men and women. And let him know that Anambra State is a state where people know their rights and are not prepared to shy away from them and then they should stop stealing from government. My doubt about free and fair election is on the interference of Abuja, otherwise if it is a question of voting I have no doubt that there will be free voting. But then manipulating the result is what I don\u2019t know because the constitution is such now that the military in their desire to promote military government in Nigeria concentrated all powers in Abuja. So, Abuja can still interfere, but I do hope they will not. I have not heard that the IPOB said there will be no election. If the election is going to be disturbed it will come from the Federal Government in order to create the atmosphere for a state of emergency in Anambra State. The Federal Government through their secret service, through their Gestapo could or may do it in such a way that it will be said based on this we can declare state of emergency and so forth. So, voters and politicians should be weary of that. They should not give them the chance. I advise Anambra people to do a peaceful election.",

He holds the traditional title of Dallatun Laduga in Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nSalisu is currently the Public Relations Officer (PRO), Livestock Breeders Association of Nigeria (LIBAN), Kaduna State chapter.\n\nIn this interview with Sunday Sun, he said that Nigerian politicians should stop saying that foreign Fulani are behind kidnapping and banditry in the country, warning that such remarks may provoke Fulani in neighbouring countries to launch attacks on Nigeria.\n\nSalisu also spoke on other national issues. Excerpts:\n\nBy way of introduction, are you a herdsman?\n\nI am the Dallatun of Laduga in Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State. I am a rice farmer. My parents live in the bush. We farm and rear cattle. We have farmers and cattle rearers whose occupations are being threatened by insecurity, particularly kidnapping and banditry. And the only way out of this insecurity is for the government to be realistic and non-partial in ensuring that peace is restored. Fulani people have been threatened by insecurity and their cows rustled over the years. Now, the government is trying to protect the farmers so that they can work on their farms without fear of being kidnapped. But nobody is talking about protecting the Fulani herdsmen who are rearing cows. They need to be protected too. We Fulani have been cheated, myself in particular, all my cows have been rustled, and I cannot also go to the farm. And somebody will say there will be peace?. I know many people will say Fulani are the bandits, kidnappers, this is how they have been frustrated. If you continue to talk about Fulani this way, they will not have peace and if they don\u2019t have peace, you cannot have peace yourself.\n\nWhat is the implication of farmers not going to the farms because of insecurity?\n\nFood scarcity will continue because the government says it will not import food, and now insecurity does not allow farmers to go to the farms to work. And the little farm products are being bought off by urban traders who travel to the village in search of food. So, urban dwellers rely on rural communities for food. The rural farmers and herders were living peacefully before now until city dwellers brought calamity to them by way of divide and rule in order to buy off their goods at cheaper rates. My parents were the pioneer owners of grazing reserves in Kachia, Kaduna State. My parents sponsored me to school from proceeds realised from the sales of thier cattle. Up till today my parents are in the bush rearing their cattle. But their 5,000 cattle have been reduced to 1,000 now as a result of rustling by criminal elements.\n\nWhat exactly are the causes of farmers/herders clashes in Nigeria?\n\nWhat used to cause farmers/herders clash was due to laying of claims to ownership of land because after the herders have penetrated thick forests and cleared the ways, the farmers would turn round to claim the areas. So, it resulted to clashes between them. But nowadays, there is no farmers/herders clashes. What we have now is communal clashes going on everywhere. Unfortunately, Fulani are the most hated people in Nigeria despite thier desires to live in peace with everybody. You cannot hate Fulani because we are hardworking people. We provide milk for the country, we provide meat for the country, and even the shoes you are wearing are made of cow\u2019s skins. Yet we are being frustrated.\n\nSome of our political leaders said most of the kidnappers and bandits are foreign Fulani. Do you agree?\n\nThose causing kidnapping and banditry are not foreign Fulani. If you say they are foreign Fulani, you are implicating Nigeria because Niger Republic or Burkina Faso and any other neighbouring countries will say you are accusing them unnecessarily. They will hate Nigeria, and you are implicating the country. The Fulani in Nigeria are the most populous in Northern Nigeria. So, if you say there are foreign Fulani in Nigeria, how do you confirm they are foreigners. It is very easy and simple to identify a Fulani man. But to us, any Fulani man you see with cattle, he is of benefit to Nigeria, he is not a foreigner. If we continue to call them foreigners, we are telling the rest of the world that they are criminals. We are implicating Nigeria. This is very unfortunate. Well, if you insist that they are foreigners, you have to identify them. After all Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa are foreigners, everybody comes from somewhere. The world started from somewhere. But if you keep on saying they are foreigners, you are encouraging them to come to Nigeria to join in the fight. When you keep on blackmailing them as foreigners they will come to Nigeria to help Fulani in Nigeria to fight.\n\nHow can kidnapping and banditry be brought to an end?\n\nThose who are into kidnapping are angry and they want to brutalise you because you have taken their products; they have nothing to rear, they have been frustrated, and they are taken to prisons because people believed that they are the bandits. Kidnapping and banditry are being tended towards the Fulani man. I can be innocently picked as bandit and be sent to prison because I am Fulani. Whatever is bad you label it against Fulani man. Fulani people have never committed crime, but you are now forcing them to commit crimes because their means of livelihood have been stolen. Their cows are being rustled. Their houses burnt, our people are killed.\n\nWhat happened to nomadic education put in place for the Fulani herders by previous government?\n\nNobody supported nomadic education to stand the test of time since it was established 35 years ago. Government and the general public did not support nomadic education. It is still at the primary level. It is not supposed to be at the infancy level after 35 years of its foundation. It should be well funded for the betterment of the society. If you are educated you cannot be engaging in criminal activities. The Fulani participated in the nomadic education, but the government did not motivate the school. Most of the classes were under the trees. How can you study under trees in this modern age of Nigeria\u2019s history. They are supposed to build functional schools for them.\n\nDon\u2019t you think dialogue is the way out of the present situation of insecurity between government and bandits?\n\nIs government ready to dialogue with anybody. The government is fighting those who are aggrieved. The government should bring them closer and negotiate with them. Look at what Sheik Ahmed Gumi did, he went to bandits\u2019 enclave, even while all of them were holding gun, trying to negotiate with them. This means that they can be negotiated with. You cannot go closer to any other tribe with gun, but you can go closer to a Fulani man with a gun and tell him to drop the gun, and he will drop it. Yet nobody did that with them. You want to have peace with this people and yet you refused to support Sheik Gumi who told Nigerians that these bandits are ready to make peace, but nobody supported Gumi. How can peace reign when you don\u2019t support somebody who is making the move.\n\nAre you saying that this government does not believe in negotiations with bandits?\n\nAsk yourself, you are a journalists, have you heard where the government is negotiating with them? There is nowhere that negotiation is going on. We have many political associations among the Fulani, nobody is negotiating with them. People who are making room for negotiation are being criticised, they are being called criminals too.\n\nFederal Government has recently resolved to reopen grazing routes across the country. What is your reaction to this?\n\nThat is what President Buhari said, not the government. And what did the southern governors say, they said no to open grazing. Every other Nigerians said no. And they want to have peace. You cannot have peace when you don\u2019t want me to survive. The government should be allowed to create grazing reserves. But animals need to move about because they are not like pigs or goats that you can tie them in one place. You cannot keep 1,000 cows in one place. They cannot survive without moving about. The government is not helping the Fulani if it keeps the cows in one place.\n\nThe argument here is that the era of cows moving about is gone in this modern age and time. Don\u2019t you think so?\n\nThe whole system of Nigeria is not operated in a modern way. When the president wants to make speech he uses microphone; who created the microphone, it is the European. All the technology is from the European people, and yet you said you want to modernise grazing, what are you modernising. Then go ahead and modernise the economy so that everybody becomes rich. If you create grazing reserves for the Fulani, you can then arrest them if they go out of their ways to destroy anything. Take a look at the Kachia grazing reserves, we are living peacefully with the communities and our neighbours, there is no fight between us. They are on their own, we are on our own.\n\nFor some Nigerians who were born and grown in rural communities, they often tell peaceful and cordial relationship with nomadic Fulani. But all of a sudden there was mistrust and suspension between the Fulani and the people in the host communities. What went wrong?\n\nIt is the urban people that brought this disaffection to the Fulani and the local people in the rural communities. The urban people brought calamity to them. They have made them to fight one another.\n\nHow?\n\nLook at the farming system in the country, the farming system is collapsing, rearing is collapsing and the urban people want to survive from the farm produce of the rural dwellers. Now, the local people cannot farm again because of the calamity from the city. For instance, there is a town called Zangon-Kataf in southern Kaduna when the Fulani have been living with the natives for over 300 years until Hausa people from urban areas caused fight for them.\n\nHow did the urban Hausa caused the fight?\n\nThe Hausa urban are traders, they are not farmers. So they manipulate the native farmers, bought off their farm produce at a cheaper price. So also they manipulated the Fulani herders, picked up cows, the meat at cheaper rate. And before you know what was happening, crisis stepped in between the native and the Fulani.\n\nDo you see an end to this crisis?\n\nFrom the beginning of the world crisis was in place. It can never stop, but it can be minimised. However, bombs are being thrown at our cattle.\n\nIn the Southeast, some groups of Igbo are agitating for Biafra republic, and in the Southwest, similar groups are asking for Oduduwa republic. What is your reaction?\n\nWhen such republics are created there will never be peace in Nigeria because we will continue to fight with our former brothers. We will not want to see one another because we were once together as brothers and now you don\u2019t want to see me. They will even fight each other over land because there will not be enough land for them. And whenever they want to travel to any part of the world they must pass through Nigeria. But if they want to separate, let them go. We the Fulani people will survive if the country breaks up because we are the most populous in the North. We are the pioneer rulers of northern Nigeria. All the northern rulers are Fulani from inception.\n\nWhy are you addressed as Hausa/Fulani?\n\nWell, if they want to benefit from us, they address us Hausa/Fulani. We are Fulani, so you cannot call us Igbo/Fulani. If Hausa want to benefit from us they hide under our name. If it is a wrong thing, they say they are Hausa. If it is a right thing, they will say they are part of the Fulani. Once you are a Muslim from Niger Republic and enter Nigeria you become an Hausa man. Even as a Nigerian once you are a Muslim people tend to call you Hausa.",

But the news has been circulating amongst certain class of people, who were confident that the students had been released,\u201d the source stated.\n\nBandits, on Thursday, kidnapped at least 80 students and five teachers from the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State, killing a police officer in the process.\n\nA teacher from the school, Usman Aliyu, said the gunmen took more than 80 students, most of them girls.\n\n\u201cThey killed one of the (police officers), broke through the gate and went straight to the students\u2019 classes,\u201d the teacher reportedly told Reuters, a foreign news medium.\n\nKebbi State police spokesman Nafiu Abubakar, confirmed that the gunmen killed one of their officersduring an exchange and also shot a student, who had since been receiving medical treatment at an undisclosed hospital.\n\nThe Kebbi State Police Command further claimed that the vehicle used to convey the kidnapped students and teachers belonged to an unnamed High Court judge in the state.\n\nA resident, Atiku Aboki, who went to the school shortly after the gunfire stopped, said he saw a scene of panic and confusion as people searched for their children.\n\n\u201cWhen we got there, we saw students crying, teachers crying, everyone is sympathising with people,\u201d he also said to Reuters.\n\nThursday\u2019s kidnapping at the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi, marked the third mass abduction from a school in Northwestern part of Nigeria in some weeks, with armed gangs carrying out the kidnappings for ransom.

          "title": "Bawa: EFCC Won\u2019t Hand over Cases of Interest to any State",
          "text": "\u2022Says commission as a creation of N\u2019Assembly supersedes states\u2019 establishments\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nChairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa, has declared that the commission, under his leadership, would not hand over cases of interest to any state government. Bawa spoke against the backdrop of the setting up of anti-corruption agencies by some states.\n\nLagos, Kano, and Bayelsa states have, recently, set up anti-graft agencies. Some of the states envisage that the EFCC would hand over corruption cases concerning their states to the local anti-corruption commissions.\n\nThe EFCC chairman also denied asking the management teams of banks to declare theirs assets to the commission. He insisted his pronouncement was merely for purposes of eliciting information, as the agency was not empowered to dish out such an order.\n\nSpeaking in an exclusive interview with THISDAY, the EFCC boss stated that as a creation of the National Assembly, the federal agency superseded any similar agency set up by the states.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI am aware that Kano and Bayelsa have started their own anti-corruption agencies. But those laws do not contain anything that says that EFCC has nothing to do with investigating their states, they would rather be complementing what the EFCC is doing.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of Supreme Court decided cases on this particular issue. From the briefing that I have received, those things are already there. The EFCC is a creation of the National Assembly, which, of course, supersedes, when it comes to that. So, there\u2019s already a federal legislation.\n\n\u201cWe are yet to see how the EFCC is going to hand over cases that they are interested in to any state government or see any correspondence to that effect. We are investigating our matters. In that regard, we are making progress.\u201d\n\nBawa also expressed doubt over the capacity of states to handle certain investigations in view of the capital-intensive nature.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhat I can say is that law enforcement is a very, very expensive venture and requires a lot of training and retraining, with trends of crime developing everyday, every second, and you need to catch up with people doing that.\n\n\u201cTake, for instance, issues of money laundering, where, maybe, somebody somewhere has laundered the proceeds of crime, let\u2019s say somewhere in Sokoto and you are in Oyo State or you have property, a lot of things will come up.\n\n\u201cMaybe he has property in America, you need to carry out request, involving mutual legal assistance treaty between, let\u2019s say, Nigeria and America, whether or not the American government will recognise that.\n\n\u201cSo, a lot of things left, right and centre are at play regarding it. It is very, very expensive.\n\n\u201cThen, the issue of capacity. Yes, anybody can develop a capacity to do that. But let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d\n\nAddressing the alleged demand for declaration of assets by bankers, Bawa said it was within the powers of the agency to make such demands.\n\nHowever, he said, \u201cI did not say banks will come and declare their assets to us. It is not within our powers to demand for that. But it is within our powers to demand for information. You and associate (s) without any hindrance or failure must give us information on demand.\n\n\u201cIf you are an individual or corporate entity or company, it is an offence not to comply. That is why we write to individuals, politicians to submit to us so that we will compare, because if you are a suspect, before us, you are expected to even fill our own declaration of assets form here.\u201d\n\nHe explained further, \u201cWe write to CCB, for instance, to furnish us what you declared. Yes, we write them to give us information on what you declared so that we can make comparison.\n\n\u201cWe have our reason for saying that come June 1st, we are going to demand for the declaration of assets. That\u2019s what I said. So, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you have not declared, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you have done anything, but what we said is that we are going to demand for it.\n\n\u201cYou understand this? This is in a 1986 law. It was passed when I was just six years old. Yes, it\u2019s an old law and they are expected to declare their assets annually. So, what we said is that we just need copies of those things, we have already demanded. On June 1st, we wrote to all the banks, the MDS and DMDs should submit copies of their declaration of asset form.\n\nOn accusations that the agency had engaged in media trial of suspects, the EFCC chairman said the commission on his watch had not only conducted diligent investigations but had also contributed significantly to the development of law in Nigeria in the last 15 years.\n\nBawa stated, \u201cNow, rightly or wrongly, the media, once matters are in court, you have the right to go and get the facts \u2013 reporters are always in court to report what has happened. So, you have been accusing us wrongly of this.\n\n\u201cYou did mention something that we do media trial, and then we rush to court. There is no agency of government that has worked and contributed to the development of law in this country in the last 15 years than the EFCC. Nobody has challenged me on that.\n\n\u201cWe go to court. We love going to court. We have 90 per cent to 95 per cent success rate in court on the cases that we have charged. So, it is not about stating the facts and losing cases. Assuming we have 70 per cent success rate in court, is it not an A that you will give us, but as you know, we have over 90 per cent success rate in court.\n\n\u201cBut, of course, we have changed our strategy in that regard as well. And that is why maybe you are not seeing people under investigation being mentioned in the media.\n\n\u201cBut there was never a deliberate attempt, anyway, to do that (media trial). We are just trying to do things by the book but maybe that is the change of strategy that you people have observed. We are working quietly and diligently on cases without necessarily drawing public attention.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Reaffirm commitment to one Nigeria\n\nChristopher Isiguzo and Gideon Arinze in Enugu\n\nLeaders from the South-east zone, yesterday, announced the setting up of different committees to engage agitating youths in the area as part of new initiatives for a lasting peace. This followed a meeting in Enugu State.\n\nThe leaders, who met for the second time in two weeks, reaffirmed their commitment to a united Nigeria, and rejected the agitation by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) for a Republic of Biafra.\n\nAccording to a communiqu\u00e9 read by the chairman of South-east Governors Forum and Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, the South-east leaders said in order not to manage the situation in the zone, they \u201chave set up a committee to engage such youths to stop and allow elders speak to address such fears\u201d.\n\nRegarding the safety of the Igbo in other parts of the country, and the newly established regional security outfit, the communiqu\u00e9 said the \u201cmeeting directed our governors and Ohaneze Ndigbo to liaise with indigenes from the northern part of Nigeria and indigenes of other regions to assure the nation, Nigeria, and their people of their safety in South-east.\u201d\n\nThe committees set up, according to the communiqu\u00e9, were those on \u201cagitation; engagement with other regions; those of our people in the North, South-east, South-south and South-west; IPOB, MASSOB, youths and market people, Okada and Keke; diaspora; advocacy; and diplomatic engagement with foreign missions.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was a follow-up to the one the leaders held with the presidential delegation, led by the Minister of Defence, Maj.Gen. Bashir Magashi (rtd), on June 11, in the wake of the rising insecurity in the region.\n\nUmahi, who read from the communiqu\u00e9 said, the leaders had reaffirmed their commitment to one nation built on fairness, love and respect for one another. He added that the committees were to help articulate the demands of the region, particularly as it relates to insecurity, and meet with the federal government.\n\nThe governor regretted that although leaders in the South-east had reassured people from other regions of their safety, Ndigbo were still being threatened, especially, in the north.\n\n\u201cWe call on leaders in other regions to take note of the threats and take proper action,\u201d he said, adding that the leaders condemned the killing of security operatives and destruction of security facilities in the zone.\n\nHe maintained that the impression that leaders in the zone were silent over the rising wave of agitation was, wrong as they had come out publicly to speak against the agitations.\n\nUmahi said, \u201cWe have again endorsed Ebubeagu and asked them to work with security agencies to ensure the protection of lives and property of the people in the South-east.\u201d\n\nHe called on security operatives working in the region to operate within the confines of the law.\n\nThose present at the meeting included the host, Governor of Enugu State, Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi; Abia State Governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu; Deputy Governors of Anambra and Imo states, Dr. Nkem Okeke and Prof. Placid Njoku, respectively; Senate Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe; Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige; and Minister of State for Mines and Steel Development, Hon. Uchechukwu Ogah.\n\nOthers were President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Ambassador George Obiozor; former President of the Senate, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim; former Governor of old Enugu State, Dr. Okwesilieze Nwodo; former Governor of Ebonyi State, Senator Sam Egwu; former Governor of Imo State, Chief Ikedi Ohakim; and former Military Administrator of old Anambra State, Rear Admiral Allison Madueke.\n\nIn attendance also were Speaker of Enugu State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Edward Ubosi; Senator Ike Ekweremadu, Deputy Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Toby Okechukwu; Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyawu; Catholic Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Most Rev. Callistus Onaga; Archbishop of Enugu Ecclesiastical Province, Most. Rev. Dr. Emmanuel O.

          "text": "Human rights as a social fact can be viewed as normative responses to expressions of oppression and domination. They represent the minimum living standards for civilized humanity, to wit: they are the morality of the depth rather than the morality of the heights. They are won through struggles of the oppressed against their oppressors. Human rights remains a valid intention of self expression.\n\nThe congregation of multi-ethnic groups, tribes and race into nationhood by a treaty influenced by colonial or imperial concepts is common in Africa, dates back to history and traceable to the Berlin conference of 1884.\n\nHowever, when nationhood fails, people recline to their tribes and the tribe is a natural enemy of the state. The state by its natural reaction and coercive tendencies often strive to keep all ethnic divides in a nation together but not in the absence of equity and justice. Where some tribes or ethnic groups are forced to be in a union that has failed them in all ramifications agitations will always become inevitable.\n\nBy international law a people can by their majority resolve, decide to secede from a nation to pursue their common aspiration just like the people of Biafra in Nigeria are making frantic agitations to leave Nigeria to be on their own with the belief that this movement holds a better promise for them.\n\nI must say that while their agitations are valid for whatever reasons they broach it from, it must be tailored within the bounds of law and not violence or war. The last attempt to achieve the objectives under reference, between 1967 to 1970 resulted in the loss of many lives. It is therefore not safe or practicable, if you like, to continue in that line of action when there are legal routes to achieve this objective.\n\nBiafra can be achieved through article 19 and 20 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (Ratification and Enforcement Act (CAP 10) LAWS OF THE FEDERATION OF NIGERIA 2004, which provides as follows : All people shall be equal. They shall enjoy the same respect and shall have the same rights. Nothing shall justify the domination of a people by the other.\n\nArticle 20 says, All people shall have right to existence. They shall have the unquestionable and inalienable right to self-determination. They shall freely determine their political status and shall pursue their economic and social development according to the policy they have freely chosen. Subsection 2 says, colonized or oppressed people shall have the right to free themselves from the bond of domination by resorting to any means recognised by the international community.\n\nWith the aforementioned provisions of law, Biafra is achievable by undertaking procedures laid down by law without necessarily resorting to violence that will lead to casualties and the wanton destruction of lives and properties.\n\nMy advocacy therefore is that if violence and/or peaceful agitations could not grant Biafra its request in the past it is time to change the approach. The laws earlier cited had been long domesticated and now form part of our laws and so let the proponents of Biafra leverage on the law to clinch onto their collective aspiration and objectives.\n\nLet the leaders of the group collaborate with the international communities, presenting the law as the bases of their agitations and with this, the legal process for self-actualization can be properly instituted.\n\nThis applies to other groups that desire the same objective.\n\nI shall go to Rabbi again.\n\nEvans Ufeli Esq is a Lagos based Lawyer and Executive Director Cadrell Advocacy Centre.",

In doing so, we must take realistic and practical decisions which will positively impact our citizens,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSome of those decisions, necessarily will have to do with evolving political and security situations in our sub-region as well as evaluate the health of our organisation with the hope of repositioning to serve our people and sub-region better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile democracy continues to develop in our sub-region, recent events in Mali are sad reminders that vigilance remains a crucial imperative to protect people\u2019s aspirations to freely choose the form of Government they want.\n\n\u201cPressures are needed to ensure that the transition process in Mali, which is half-way to its conclusion, is not aborted. A further slide in Mali could prove catastrophic to the Sub-region, considering that about half of that country is unfortunately under the grip of terrorists.\u201d\n\n\u201cI urge our organisation to remain engaged with all stakeholders in Mali through our astute Mediator, former President Goodluck Jonathan, who, I congratulate warmly, for his untiring efforts thus far. I encourage him to sustain these efforts to ensure that the transition is completed as scheduled.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the effects of COVID-19 on the sub-region, Buhari called for more efforts to ensure that West African countries prevent a spike in infections and deaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe region has experienced two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the second wave being more prevalent with higher death rates,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlthough we appear to have come out of the second wave, there is a very strong possibility that we may experience a third wave similar to what is going on in other parts of the world, particularly as vaccination levels are still very low.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore critical to maintain vigilance and deploy smart non-pharmaceutical public health measures as necessary.\u201d",

          "text": "The Buhari administration has stepped up efforts to regulate the online media in Nigeria in what is seen by many as attempts to further stifle the civic space in the country.\n\nTwo weeks after blocking Twitter\u2019s operations, the federal government has asked the House of Representatives to enact a law that will empower the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to control all forms of internet broadcasting and social media.\n\nThe request was made on Wednesday by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, during a public hearing organised by the house committee on information, national orientation, ethics, and values on a bill to amend the NBC Act.\n\nThe commission already controls television and radio broadcasting in Nigeria, based on provisions in Section 2(b) of the NBC Act. It states that \u201cthe Commission shall have [the] responsibility of receiving, processing and considering applications for the establishment, ownership or operation of radio and television stations including cable television services, direct satellite broadcast and any other medium of broadcasting.\u201d\n\nLai Mohammed now wants the commission to also regulate the online media, in addition to other channels of broadcasting. \u201cI want to add here specifically that internet broadcasting and all online media should be included in this because we have a responsibility to monitor contents, including Twitter,\u201d the minister told lawmakers.\n\nBefore Lai Mohammed\u2019s proposal, the broadcasting regulator had asked all social media platforms and service providers in the online broadcasting space in Nigeria to apply for a broadcast licence.\n\nPossible clampdown on freedom of expression\n\nWidespread criticism has trailed the proposal by the Nigerian government, which has only further stoked concerns over a possible clampdown on free speech and internet freedom by the Buhari administration.\n\nMedia stakeholders at the public hearing kicked against the inclusion of online media under NBC\u2019s mandate, asking the panel to instead make the commission more independent of the Minister of Information.\n\nOver time, the NBC has acted as an extension of the Ministry of Information and Culture, which rarely acts independently, and thus, the commission\u2019s operations have often been subject to political interference. This was condemned by the International Press Centre (IPC) and the Centre for Media Law and Advocacy in a joint statement that called for the neutrality of the commission.\n\nAccording to Akin Akingbulu, executive director of the Institute for Media and Society, the commission should not receive directives from the information minister. \u201cThe power to give directives to the commission, vested in the minister of information in section 6 should be removed and replaced with powers which include policy formulation for the broadcasting sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial media bill through the backdoor\u201d\n\nDespite the ban on Twitter, Nigerians continue to use the platform thanks to virtual private networks (VPNs) that help bypass the suspension. Many have taken to Twitter to express criticism over the proposed regulation of online media.\n\nBREAKING: NBC Amendment Bill Is Social Media Bill Through The Backdoor \u2014 SERAP (@SERAPNigeria) June 17, 2021\n\nAmendment of the NBC act;grafting the shoot of autocracy. \u2014 Senator Shehu Sani (@ShehuSani) June 17, 2021\n\nNigeria Govt is asking House of Reps to amend the NBC Act and include \u201cinternet broadcasting\u201d.\n\n\n\nThat means all online radio/TV stations must register with NBC and Lai Mohammed.

          "text": "Facebook, this week, said it has removed fake accounts, pages and groups that posted about news and politics ahead of Ethiopia\u2019s general election scheduled to hold next week.\n\nIn a statement published on its website, the social media giant reportedly took down 65 Facebook profiles, 52 pages, 27 groups and 32 Instagram accounts for violating its rules against misleading others about their purpose and identity.\n\nThe fake accounts mainly posted in Amharic about topics that include the Prosperity Party and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. They also criticised opposition politicians and groups in Ethiopia, such as the Oromo Liberation Front, Ethiopian Democratic Party, and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front.\n\n\u201cThe people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts as a central part of their operations to mislead people about who they are and what they are doing, and that was the basis for our action,\u201d Facebook said.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, the fake accounts posted the same content across multiple pages and groups to grow their following, and targeted domestic audiences in its own country.\n\nRoughly 1.1 million accounts followed one or more of the Facebook pages, about 766,000 accounts joined one or more of the groups, and around 1,700 people followed one or more of the Instagram accounts.\n\n\u201cGiven the upcoming election and the ongoing tensions in Ethiopia, our teams moved as quickly as possible to complete the investigation and disrupt this operation,\u201d Gleicher said.\n\nFacebook also linked the fake accounts to individuals associated with the Information Network Security Agency (INSA) in Ethiopia.\n\nA brutal war erupted in the country\u2019s Tigray region after which the United States restricted visas for government and military officials of Ethiopia and Eritrea over allegations of human rights violations.\n\nPro-government demonstrators in Ethiopia had criticised the move by Washington and Gleicher added that the fake accounts were critical of the sanctions as well. Although they did not directly focus on the conflict in Tigray.\n\nFacebook\u2019s move comes after severe criticism it has faced in the past for not doing enough to tackle fake accounts during national elections, including in the U.S. The social network has outlined plans in preparation for the Ethiopia vote, including ways to combat misinformation and hate speech.\n\nThe June 21 general elections will see Ethiopians elect members of the House of Peoples\u2019 Representatives.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Netflix on Sunday, June 13, commenced its first 3-month Episodic Lab (EPL) and Development Executive Traineeship (DET) programmes in Africa. This is in partnership with the Realness Institute, a South Africa-based Centre for African film-makers.\n\nOver 500 applications were received from Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe for the inaugural development lab for African writers and DET initiatives. However, only twelve professionals were selected to take part in both trainings.\n\nTwo Nigerians, Ayoade Adeyanju and Kehinde Joseph, selected to take part in EPL based on their story ideas, will get to develop their concepts with help from expert story consultants and creative producers. Other participants are Andile Ngcizela, Dominique Jossie and Kudakwashe Maradzika from South Africa and Mary Waireri from Kenya.\n\nThe lab participants will receive about $2,000 monthly stipend to enable them to focus entirely on their training, which will run remotely till September 5, 2021. At the end of the lab, each writer will have an opportunity to pitch their incubated concept to Netflix and could see their series further developed for production.\n\nMeanwhile, Ololade Okedare is the only Nigerian selected to participate in the DET, in addition to South Africans Anneke Villet, Antionette Engel and Thandeka Zwane, Damaris Irungu Ochieng\u2019 from Kenya and Lara Sousa, a Mozambican.\n\nThe executive trainees will get to immerse themselves in the story development process and receive technical training by partnering with the EPL writers to develop story concepts into quality productions.\n\nImproving storytelling in Africa\n\nThe Netflix programme is being held to strengthen the foundation of quality storytelling in Africa and is part of efforts by the global streaming giant to produce more original local content from creative writers on the continent.\n\n\u201cWithout the existence of our storytellers, our favourite Netflix stories wouldn\u2019t be possible,\u201d Alison Triegaardt, Netflix manager for Grow Creative in Africa, said. \u201cAfrica has an amazing pool of talent \u2013 both in front and behind the camera \u2013 hence Netflix is committed to investing in African stories and talent long-term.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a 5-day workshop focusing on post-production organised by Netflix is scheduled to be held later this month. The APost Lab is aimed at training film & television professionals from across Africa on technical best practices, technical and creative support methods, and methods to facilitate the best creative process.\n\nThirty-two participants have been invited to participate in the workshops while more than 100 film & TV professionals from across the continent will be part of the Masterclasses.\n\nPotential boost to subscriber base\n\nIn addition to improving quality storytelling in Africa, Netflix would most likely be looking to grow its relatively small subscriber base in the region by producing more relatable, original local content with the help of the development lab.\n\nAccording to a Digital TV Research study, Netflix currently has about 2 million subscribers in Africa, which is half of the continent\u2019s total streaming subscriber base.\n\nThere is a chance having more relatable original African content could lure more viewers on the continent to use the streaming service particularly as the London-based industry researcher estimates streaming subscriptions in Africa will reach 13 million by 2025, up from over 3.9 million in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re energised and excited by the many opportunities that lie ahead for us to help strengthen the quality of African storytelling and to bring fresh voices to our members in Africa and around the world\u201d, Triegaardt concluded.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "How tech tools create a safe space for sexual violence survivors in Nigeria",
          "text": "Kiishu* was still running her undergraduate course when she decided to explore other parts of the country for her six-month internship program. Miles away from home in South-southern Nigeria, she was having an enjoyable learning experience, but with two months to go, she had an awful experience.\n\nShe was sexually assaulted by her host\u2019s friend, who visited, knowing his friend was away on a trip.\n\n\u201cIt was a cold and sad evening,\u201d she recounts, \u201cbut help came, albeit late.\u201d\n\nA trip to the police station provided no succour, even though they knew the culprit. She would eventually be bullied by the perpetrator\u2019s influential family to agree to arbitration outside court \u2014 presided over by her workplace\u2019s governing authority \u2014 with the culprit having only to sign an undertaking to stay away from her after admitting to the crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was hard, but I agreed to take it because I had a short time to spend there.\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides, neither my sponsors nor I could think of any other channel to get help.\u201d\n\nThat was in 2014.\n\nIt\u2019s 2021, but unfortunately, varying degrees of sexual offences are still perpetrated daily, with statistics confirming an increased incidence of the global crime. The United Nations (UN) affirms that the COVID-19-induced lockdowns in 2020 exposed vulnerable people to more risk of sexual violence.\n\nDespite the Nigerian Federal Government launching its first sexual offender register in November 2019, there were so many cases of sexual violence in 2020. Consequently, all 36 state governors declared a state of emergency on rape, agreed to set up a sex offender register, and sign laws to punish the crime.\n\nIn May 2021, Lagos State \u2014 one of the few with an active online sex offender register \u2014 disclosed that it added 206 names to its list of sexual offenders between 2020 and 2021.\n\nHighlighting existing response channels\n\nJust like Kiishu, most sexual assault survivors don\u2019t bother to report their experiences. Their overriding emotion is often fear that their complaints won\u2019t get the required attention, and they\u2019d either be blamed or stigmatised. There is also the possibility that the perpetrator would not be brought to book, further putting them in harm\u2019s way.\n\nHowever, the number of channels currently available to report such cases have increased compared to recent years. Victim support groups, activist movements, non-profit establishments, government-owned humanitarian agencies, and global organisations like the UN are just a few of the options available to victims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA friend introduced me to this support group that helped me talk about my experience. Even though it was years after the incident, I experienced closure and felt I could properly get justice if I wanted to,\u201d Kiishu relays.\n\nApart from support groups, there is the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), a government-owned organisation that monitors trafficking and sexual-based violence cases.\n\nInterestingly, they have multiple channels \u2014 one of which I tried during my investigation \u2014 for receiving and addressing complaints.\n\nI called the conspicuously written toll-free number on the NAPTIP website and got through to a representative in less than 60 seconds; receiving a response redirecting me to the office closest to me took less than 120 seconds. While the response time was quick, I have no idea how long it would have taken to dispatch help to my location had I been in danger.\n\nThe Agency\u2019s impressive setup is the result of deliberate work done over time.\n\nMr Ganiu Aganran, NAPTIP Zonal Commander for Lagos State, who leads the Sexual and Gender-based Violence unit, tells Techpoint Africa that different tech-enabled channels have made it easier to access help.\n\n\u201cAt the headquarters, we have a 24-hour monitoring centre. When a call is put through, whatever is said is recorded and sent to the appropriate command that will handle it in real-time. We also receive SOS through the website and emails.\u201d\n\nThough he cannot speak to the number of reported cases and prosecuted offenders, he says that \u201cin the Lagos Zonal Command, sometimes, in a week, we have nothing less than 35 cases coming in, including those that come from sister law enforcement agencies through referrals.\u201d\n\nAganran says that social media has been a great tool, and with action taken to address the many cases reported on social platforms, his claim appears to be true.\n\nBetween March and June 2020, several campaigns aimed at getting justice for rape victims trended on social media.\n\nHowever, Aganran submits that the same channel is also responsible for the increasing cases of sexual violence and human trafficking.\n\nHe admits that the Agency would have been able to do more if it has more tools to work with. There are limitations apart from funding,\n\n\u201cThe issue of tracking could come in, but we do tracking through our partners, especially the DSS or the police. These are some of the law enforcement agencies that have this technology, which may not be available when we have to check the environment well to respond promptly.\u201d\n\nHowever, with relevant partnerships, he concludes that the agency can cover more ground.\n\nMore hands at work\n\nAganran attests that the Agency usually looks to partner with private organisations \u2014 for public awareness campaigns, information gathering, and referrals, among others \u2014 so it does not get overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cWe can never have it enough; there are challenges. The issue of logistics is key. You need to be able to move your victims when you rescue them. There are other things like going to court, going to arrest, and going for surveillance; all these demand a lot. But the truth is that working closely with partners, they also come to our aid.\u201d\n\nApart from NAPTIP partners, there are platforms operating in Nigeria that do the same thing.\n\nWhat survivors want: Enter WARIF\u2026\n\nWARIF Webpage\n\nFor obvious reasons, what a survivor wants is to be heard, cared for, and defended. The Women at Risk International Foundation (WARIF) is a non-profit organisation launched in 2016 to respond to and care for young girls and women who are victims of rape.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s website serves as a channel for anonymous reporting, legal and health assistance, and evidence gathering for the police. It also has a feature that allows survivors to have virtual group therapy.\n\nDuring the lockdown in 2020, it improved the platform\u2019s live chat feature and looked for cases on social media.\n\nGovernment-owned agencies also refer cases to WARIF\u2019s rape crisis centre. And Kemi DaSilva-Ibru, WARIF Founder, disclosed that the centre received up to 300 cases between March and April 2020 in Lagos State.\n\n\u2026 and Helpio app\n\nHelpio App About Page\n\nIn August 2020, Kano-based Android developer and women-in-tech advocate, Sa\u2019adat Aliyu, launched Helpio app, a platform for reporting sexual abuse cases in Nigeria.\n\nAvailable in both Hausa and English languages, users can sign up either as an emergency help centre, report anonymously, share a story, render legal assistance, or provide counselling.\n\nAliyu informs Techpoint Africa that she was inspired to build the platform during the lockdown to remove the hindrances to reporting cases of sexual and gender-based violence and get survivors closer to help.\n\nShe believes that many rape cases are unreported because of the associated stigma. History also plays a part as there are fewer cases of victims getting justice than perpetrators going scot-free.\n\nThis can be put down either to inadequate legal representation or poverty. However, there are non-governmental organisations set up solely to fight against SGBV, which provide financial, legal, medical, or even socio-psychological support to victims of sexual abuse.\n\nWithin the first ten months of launch, the platform already has support groups and certified organisations \u2014 for confidentiality \u2014 signed up to help with reported cases and emergency calls. And for cases requiring counselling, there are experts available for live chats.\n\nStill in its early stage, Aliyu says the platform undergoes regular changes to improve user experience. Subsequently, the platform will reflect real-time statistics of cases and include more localised languages.\n\nShe hopes to get more people to use the platform and render more help.\n\n\u201cThrough the app, over 50+ cases were reported, and the \u201ctalk to experts\u201d feature was among the most-used in the application.\u201d\n\nAganran explains that having recognised their reach, the government wants to take advantage of the opportunities created by platforms like WARIF and Helpio.\n\nWith more tech tools in place, there\u2019s no telling how many cases will be reported, and perpetrators brought to book.\n\nAganran believes that doing nothing isn\u2019t an option as everyone must intervene, show support, or help survivors get what they want.\n\n* \u2013 Not real name",

          "text": "Former Andela Community Manager, Babajide Duroshola, has stepped down as Safeboda\u2019s Country Director for Nigeria. Duroshola made this announcement today via his Twitter handle and in a Medium post.\n\nI came, I saw and conquered!!! https://t.co/vtdlgCWknP \u2014 Bab\u00e1j\u00edd\u00e9 D\u00far\u00f3sh\u1ecdl\u00e1 (@Babajiide) June 18, 2021\n\nDuroshola took over as Country Manager in 2019. This came after months of speculation regarding the Uganda-founded ride-hailing startup\u2019s launch in the country. During his tenure, the company introduced its finance offerings with users able to purchase airtime on the platform.\n\nThe startup initially announced plans to launch in Lagos following a Series B round, but that never happened. Although not the stated reason, the okada ban in Lagos meant that Safeboda had to launch in Ibadan, where ORide and MAX.ng were already present.\n\nThat decision seems to have paid off, with the company claiming to have completed 1.5 million trips and onboarded over 5,000 drivers. These appear to be impressive figures, especially when you consider that the startup said it had onboarded 2,500 riders and completed 1 million trips on the anniversary of its first year in operation.\n\nAt the time of its launch in Nigeria, there were predictions of bike-hailing wars with ORide and MAX.ng. However, in an interesting turn of events, as Safeboda launched in Ibadan, ORide exited the ride-hailing market.\n\nPerhaps to justify their decision to launch in Ibadan, Safeboda has regularly publicised the number of rides made on the platform. And with MAX.ng not doing the same, it is difficult to say if Safeboda is the dominant player in the ride-hailing industry.\n\nFounded in 2014 by Ricky Rapa Thompson, Maxime Dieudonne, and Alastair Sussock in Uganda, the startup soon spread to Kenya in 2018. However, by 2020, it announced that it was moving out of Kenya, having been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile no announcements have been made regarding Duroshola\u2019s replacement, he hinted that the startup had found a replacement internally.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has announced plans to restructure the country\u2019s current licensing structure to bring it in line with global standards in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ecosystem.\n\nThe current structure has served the industry for 18 years since its publication, and as NCC CEO, Umar Danbatta, says, it is due for an \u201curgent review\u201d.\n\nHe also set up a standing committee that would prepare reports and recommendations on existing licences, consultative fora, new licence undertakings, amendment to licence fees and durations, benchmarking of licences with similar jurisdictions, and the impact of certain licences on other licence holders.\n\nThe committee is also expected to recommend solutions and develop an updated regulatory framework for new and amended licences with a final report on the project with all recommendations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanbatta, while inaugurating the committee, said the need for the review of the existing licence structure was informed by the wide range of technological advances and the convergence of technologies and services which have characterised the global telecoms space over the years, and whose impact is increasingly being experienced in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria\u2019s licence structure\n\nNigeria currently favours a two-category regime \u2014 individual and class \u2014 for general and specific services.\n\nClass licences have a flat fee of \u20a610,000 ($24.39), while individual licences are within the range of \u20a6250,000 ($609.76) and \u20a650,000,000 ($121,952.22).\n\nThere will be amendments to fees as the committee is expected to give recommendations based on a comparative analysis of countries with similar jurisdiction.\n\nIn comparison with Nigeria, South Africa also operates a two-category licence structure, but its fees are more expensive. For class licences, they have a flat fee of R13,721 ($971.73), and for individual licences, application costs are determined by the Information Technology Association (ITA).\n\nKenya also operates the same licence regime with prices ranging from Ksh 1000 ($9.28) to Ksh 15 million ($139,146.57).\n\nConsidering all that the committee has to deliberate on, we might see significant changes such as increased licencing fees based on fees in other African countries, new licences relating to 5G implementation, mobile virtual network operators, or over-the-top licences.\n\nGlobal ICT standards\n\nAccording to the International Telecommunication Union\u2019s (ITU) 2020 Global ICT Regulatory Outlook, Nigeria is a third-generation (G3) country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo put this in context, the ITU ranks countries into five generations using Regulatory Tracker indicators divided into four pillars: Regulatory Authority, Regulatory Mandate, Regulatory Regime and Competition Framework. The Regulatory Tracker is an evidence-based tool to help decision-makers and regulators make sense of the rapid evolution of ICT.\n\nWith an overall score of 78.3, Nigeria barely passes the benchmark above G2 countries where basic reform \u2014 partial liberalisation and privatisation across all layers \u2014 occurs.\n\nThe Ethiopian government\u2019s bid to sell off its stake in Ethio Telecom gives more clarity. Before the sale of its first private national telecoms licence to Safaricom\u2019s consortium, the country ranked as a G1 country \u2014 government-owned and controlled industry.\n\nAfter the sale, it was bumped up to a G2 country because the industry had been privatised.\n\nAs a G3 country, Nigeria\u2019s ICT ecosystem enables investment, innovation and access \u2014 dual focus on stimulating competition in service and content delivery, and consumer protection.\n\nKenya is the only African country to rank as a G5 country. According to ITU\u2019s ranking, the East African nation\u2019s ICT Regulatory Framework fosters vibrant markets and is also key to finding market solutions. It also means that Kenya\u2019s ICT regulator plays a leadership role.\n\nIt\u2019s been 18 years since the last licence review. In that time, we\u2019ve seen Glo\u2019s famous per second billing that blew the market wide open, competition leading to reduced \u2014 but still expensive \u2014 data prices, 4G coverage, MainOne\u2019s fiber cable\n\nWill the door be open to new players? Will a new entrant come to break MTN\u2019s dominance? We will have answers when the review is completed.\n\nWhile this move by the NCC shows progressiveness \u2014 especially in light of recent policy amendments \u2014 it appears there are still some ways to go before Nigeria attains global ICT standards.",

          "title": "When two years seem like eternity",
          "text": "Looking at where Nigeria is today, in terms of worsening insecurity, poverty, economic malaise, among other ills, many Nigerians are wondering what the state of the nation will look like in the next two years when the current administration is expected to come to an end.\n\nSome have described the next two years as an \u201ceternity\u201d, saying that to endure the \u201csuffocating air\u201d for the next two years would be the worst punishment for Nigerians.\n\nDuring the 2015 general election campaign, the then ruling party and the main opposition party promised Nigerians a lot of goodies.\n\nThe campaign afforded the then opposition the platform to blame the insecurity, economic woes, and every other problem in Nigeria on the failure of the then ruling party.\n\nBut as much as Nigerians quickly concluded that the messiah has come, they seemed to have never enjoyed any relief since the then opposition party came to power.\n\nFor many, the situation has degenerated from bad to worse in all fronts; from economy, social life, healthcare, and especially tackling insecurity, which many considered as reason the opposition won in 2015.\n\nInflation, unemployment rate, death rate, debt profile among other negative trends have more than quadrupled in the last six years of this administration and the remaining two years may likely make no difference.\n\n\u201cIt is no longer Boko Haram and North East. Now bandits, kidnapers, and herdsmen have taken the war to all parts of the country. There are killings every day and the government, which promised to tackle insecurity keeps doing little or nothing to tackle it,\u201d Yohanna Bulus, a lawyer and an aggrieved indigene of Borno State, decried.\n\n\u201cHow can Boko Haram hoist its flag in Nigeria and nothing is happening, government negotiates ransom with bandits and kidnapers take a whole school or town hostage without challenge. Nigeria is in a war situation now,\u201d Bulus observed.\n\nFor the Lagos-based maritime lawyer, the country is fast drifting apart and the principals and political actors are not keen on saving the situation because it is going according to their long-hatched plans.\n\n\u201cIf government wants to calm the situation and restore peace across the country, it will do it. But it does not want for obvious reasons; instead, it is threatening to roll out tanks in some parts of the country. You heard what they reeled out as achievements since gaining power; in sincerity, have there been achievements in a country where government is witnessing ethnic cleansing and wanton killings every day and keep silent? For me, safeguarding the lives of the citizens is far better achievement, which this administration has failed to do\u201d, Terhumba Tor, a senior lecturer at a federal university said.\n\nFor him, the principles of democracy and ideals of civil living are not upheld by the present administration and Nigerians are not expecting any positive change in the remaking two years of the present administration.\n\nOkwui Duruike, director, Centre for African Leadership Ideals, an Abuja-based African economy and politics research outfit, which has relocated to Cotonou in Benin Republic, noted that Nigerians should not expect miracle in the remaining two years of this administration as the country has been falling in development, human right and democracy indices in the last five years.\n\n\u201cWe have conducted several researches on development, good governance and security in collaboration with international agencies across 30 African countries. Nigeria is among the worst in Africa, while Ghana, Seychelles and Gaborone are leading across many fronts. The Nigerian case is lack of will power by government to tackle insecurity, enforce necessary actions, restore peace, woo back investors and boost the economy. Stability of a country and economic development go hand in hand but that will not happen in the remaining two years,\u201d Duruike said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn one of our reports on the worsening insecurity, we advised one of our foreign partners to inform the Nigerian government that all they needed was sincerity of purpose, boosting morale of its security operatives, fishing out sabotage, working with locals and collaboration with foreign governments.\u201d\n\nConsidering the huge damage done across the country due to the inaction of government, Tor thinks that two years will not be enough to rebuild the country.\n\n\u201cWhere do you want to start, or what are you going to promise that has never been promised in the past. I don\u2019t expect any relief in the remaining two years of this administration because the thousands killed will not come back, houses burnt, farms destroyed and hopes dashed cannot be restored. I expect the worst in two years,\u201d Tor said.\n\nFor Bulus, the change we desire cannot come now or within the remaining two years because the recent actions of this administration point to a people that are running against time.\n\n\u201cThis is six years after taking over from Goodluck Jonathan, who was regarded by many as a weakling. One former governor of Lagos State even said during campaign that a serious government will fix electricity issue in one year. So, they have been there for six years now and the trouble is quadrupling, so where is their magic wand?\u201d Bulus asked.\n\nOn his part, Ademola Fadahunsi, a political analyst, noted that though South West is clamoring to take over from President Buhari in 2023, the damage done so far is huge and will take almost the whole tenure of an incoming president to restore.\n\n\u201cIt is sad that we don\u2019t value human lives again. The killing is much, the country is soaked in blood and no matter how much infrastructure you put in place, you need living humans, peaceful country and stability for such infrastructure to be meaningful. They flagged off Lagos-Ibadan rail, but Abuja-Kaduna rail is besieged by bandits. Why not tackle insecurity first before investment that is already threatened by current realities in the country?\u201d Fadahunsi said.\n\nHowever, observers note that insecurity is the biggest issue in the country today and that every effort of this administration should be channeled to address it. Yet, they don\u2019t see any difference in the current situation within the remaining two years of this administration.\n\n\u201cYou cannot fool Nigerians by promising them a quick fix of insecurity in two years when since Jonathan\u2019s tenure, the country has been spending on security without result. We have witnessed change of security chiefs and increased budgets on security, yet no result. It will definitely get worse in the remaining two years of Buhari,\u201d Angwe Yakubu, a retired senior security personnel, said.\n\nSpeaking further, the Shamdam Plateau State-born retiree and now poultry farmer, said the fight against insecurity does not require huge spending on heavy armament, but will power and sincerity on the part of government, better treatment for soldiers, welfare for families of dead soldiers, empowerment of locals and collaboration with foreign countries to win.\n\nDon\u2019t listen to rhetoric that Boko Haram and bandits carry more sophisticated weapons. Can\u2019t such weapons be bought by Nigeria? All we need is sincerity of government to fight these terrorists, military to fight sabotage in its midst, locals to help with useful information and foreign partners to be given required information and free hand to work,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nAccording to him, this is the only way the remaining two years of this administration will make a difference, but he does not see them toeing the solution line.\n\nTunde Daramola, a politician, is not optimistic about a turnaround in the next two years.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe ship of the state has been grounded by the present administration of Muhammadu Buhari. The first responsibility of a reasonable government is the security of lives and property. Presently, no Nigerian is safe; people are scared to go out and work or even travel. This APC- led government is a failure.\u201d\n\nAccording to Daramola, \u201cThe President is clueless on providing security for Nigerians not to talk of foreigners. No foreigner would come into Nigeria and invest with the level of insecurity today.\n\n\u201cNobody is happy and Nigerians are disappointed. It is a shame. I think the situation will get worse before 2023, or is it not getting even worse? Is the sign not there?\u201d\n\nBe believes that \u201cThis government appears overwhelmed with the situation; even the President confirmed it in the interview. I think these terrorists have some form of support, or how would you explain the situation now in the North where terrorists write letters to a community and come the same day to carry out an operation without any form of resistance?\n\n\u201cNigerians want this government to end today, not even tomorrow or 2023. Except for divine intervention, I don\u2019t see the situation improving. On the way forward, I am of the view that the President should urgently seek foreign help and intervention since he has admitted that the situation has overwhelmed him.\u201d\n\nAdelaja Adeoye, a political analyst, said there was nothing more to expect from Buhari\u2019s remaining two years than what Nigerians have experienced in the last six years.\n\n\u201cThe government has lost touch with the people and they are even sinking deeper with their attempt to stifle media and social media. It is only when a government feels terribly defeated due to bad governance that they tend to clamp down on media and other forms of communication used by citizens to express their displeasure,\u201d Adeoye said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe level of insecurity is getting worse by the day, as you can see; another set of students has just been kidnapped in the Northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is worrisome that people are now hired to welcome or protest in favour of Buhari; a truly performing government will not hire people; this goes to show that Buhari is not popular among Nigerians.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is left for the government to review its actions and activities or continue to allow citizens to suffer, first time ever where Nigerians now buy yam pieces due to food inflation and increased poverty rate,\u201d he added.",
          "summary": "Some have described the next two years as an \u201ceternity\u201d, saying that to endure the \u201csuffocating air\u201d for the next two years would be the worst punishment for Nigerians.\nDuring the 2015 general election campaign, the then ruling party and the main opposition party promised Nigerians a lot of goodies.\nYet, they don\u2019t see any difference in the current situation within the remaining two years of this administration.\nIt will definitely get worse in the remaining two years of Buhari,\u201d Angwe Yakubu, a retired senior security personnel, said.\nThis APC- led government is a failure.\u201dAccording to Daramola, \u201cThe President is clueless on providing security for Nigerians not to talk of foreigners.",

          "title": "Is Nigerian Senate playing politics with PIB, Electoral Act and Constitutional Amendment?",
          "text": "On Wednesday, June 9, 2021, the 9th Senate had a special session to celebrate its anniversary. The occasion afforded the senators the opportunity to sing their praises and what they said they have been able to achieve individually and collectively within the last two years.\n\nDespite being seen as a \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 Senate, one acclaimed major achievement of the 9th Senate was the interventions in restoration of the national annual budget to the January-December cycle.\n\nAnalysts have said the measure has made the nation\u2019s fiscal plans more predictable and boosted the confidence of local and foreign investors in the economy.\n\nThe federal lawmakers also mentioned the passage of the Deep Off-Shore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contracts Act CAP D3 LFN 2004 (Amendment Bill, 2009). The senators passed the important law to increase Nigeria\u2019s share of revenue from its crude oil.\n\nFor ease of doing business, the Finance Bill 2019 (Nigeria Tax and Fiscal Law) (SB.140), which amended seven existing tax laws and Companies and Allied Matters Act, Cap C20 LFN 2004 (Repeal and Reenactment) Bill 2019 (SB.270) were also passed by the lawmakers.\n\nHowever, the current Senate headed by Ahmad Lawan has not gained the confidence of majority of Nigerians, who have continued to criticise the upper chamber and indeed the National Assembly of always doing the bidding of the executive, thus ignoring proper oversight and legislation.\n\nHaving learnt their lessons from the frosty relationship that played out between the executive and legislative in the 8th Senate, President Muhammadu Buhari and the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) had to ensure that someone loyal to the president and the ruling party emerged as the President of the Senate. So, the emergence of Senator Ahmad Lawan from Yobe North Senatorial District and Ovie Omo-Agege from Delta Central Senatorial District as president and deputy Senate president, respectively, was largely seen as mission accomplished.\n\nThe usual bickering commonly displayed by both arms of government and the rejection of Mr. President\u2019s nominees in the 8th Senate led by Senator Abubakar Bukola Saraki has since been buried. Two years in the life of the current Senate, the relationship between the executive and legislature has been cordial.\n\nUnlike the 9th Senate, the 8th Senate always did their due diligence and oversight before passing anything from the executive, be it a bill or confirmation of a nominee(s). For instance, one case that stood out and has continued to be applauded by Nigerians was the rejection of Ibrahim Magu as the substantive Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). He was rejected by the lawmakers on two different occasions based on a security report against his nominee from the State Security Service (SSS).\n\nSimilarly, the $30 billion loan request of the president to the 8th Senate was also rejected to save the country from sinking deeper into indebtedness. In his letter, Buhari explained that the amount was Federal Government\u2019s 2016 to 2018 external borrowing plan meant to execute key infrastructural projects cutting across all sectors with special emphasis on infrastructure, agriculture, health, education, water supply, growth and employment generation.\n\nBut the Senate Committee Chairman on Loan and Foreign Debt in the 8TH Senate, Shehu Sani, explained that they rejected the loan request from Muhammadu Buhari to save Nigeria from \u201csinking into the dark gully of a perpetual debt trap.\u201d\n\nHe further argued that the lawmakers did not want the country to be re-colonised by creditor banks.\n\nUnfortunately, it is no longer the case under the current leadership as majority of the senators, especially in APC, are hitherto seen as willing tools in the hands of the President.\n\nAs a way of returning back the favour done to him,November 2019, expressedwillingness to approve all requests that come to the Senate from President Muhammadu Buhari when the Chairman, Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption, ItseSagay (SAN), paid him a courtesy visit in Abuja.\n\nHe quickly backed up the statement by saying that \u201cany request that comes from Buhari is good for the nation and the Senate will take immediate action on them.\u201d\n\nHe further said: \u201cI want to assure you that any request that comes from Mr. President is a request that will make Nigeria a better place in terms of appointments or legislation and the Senate will act expeditiously to ensure that we play our part in the confirmation or passing of legislation appropriately.\u201d\n\nTherefore, it did not come as a surprise when the President\u2019s $30bn loan request was approved by the Lawan-led Senate. Additionally, in April 2021, the Senate approved the sum of $1.5bn and \u20ac995 million external borrowings for the Federal Government.\n\nThe loans were part of the $5.5 billion and \u20ac995 million external borrowings Buhari had, in May 2020, asked the Red Chamber to approve to finance various priority projects of the Federal Government and to support the state governments facing fiscal challenges.\n\nAgain, the Senate on June 1, 2021 referred President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s loan request to borrow N2.343 trillion from external source to the Committee on Local and Foreign Debt.\n\nBesides, on May 18, 2021, Buhari had sought the approval of the Senate to borrow a fresh N2.343 trillion ($6.18bn) external loan. The committee was subsequently mandated to look into the request of the President on Donor Fund Projects under the 2018-2020 Federal Government External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan and submit its report within two weeks.\n\nMore worrisome is the fact that the 9th Senate has not been able to pass the much-awaited Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) despite assurances of early passage.\n\nThe bill was passed into second reading in October 2020 and in January 2021, there was a public hearing on it where the President of the Senate said by May 2021, they would pass the bill. But sadly, that has not been the case. He has back-tracked to say that the PIB will now be passed by June 2021 as both committees in the upper and lower chambers are now writing the final report.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe National Assembly was to pass the PIB in May, however, there was need to put in place a legislative framework to further encourage foreign investments and development in the industry.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, I think they (Joint Committee of the two chambers of the National Assembly on PIB) are about to start writing the report, which they will lay before the two chambers of the National Assembly, probably by the middle of June.\u201d\n\nIt is indeed a sad commentary that a bill of such nature, capable of entrenching transparency and accountability in the oil sector, has not been pass into law after about 20 years it was first. introduced.\n\nNonetheless, the Electoral Act Amendment bill is one bill Nigerians are calling the 9th Senate to also expedite action on in view of the 2023 general election. In fact, INEC, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), political parties, the media and other stakeholders have been voicing out, even protesting on the need to pass and sign the bill into law.\n\nAs violence and all manner of rigging have continued to blight the electoral process, the passage and signing of the bill into law now becomes imperative in view of the Anambra gubernatorial election coming up on November 6, 2021.\n\nLawan has again promised Nigerians that the Electoral Act Amendment bill and the Constitutional Amendment bill will the passed by mid July 2021 before going on recess.\n\nThe lawmakers are currently on a two-week break and will resume on June 22, 2021. Therefore, between June 22 and July 15, 2021 when they are expected to go on their summer break, the question is: can they pass these bills within 23 days?\n\nSpeaking on an interview session on Channels Television Sunrise Daily, Friday, June 18, 2021, AjibolaBashiru, Chairman, Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, expressed the optimism that the PIB, Constitutional Amendment Bill and Electoral Act Bill would be passed before the legislators proceed on their summer break.\n\n\u201cI am particularly optimistic that we will meet the expectation of Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 109 senators should bear in mind that history bacons on them at this critical time to always do the right thing by enacting and passing laws that would stand the text of time.\n\nIn their oversight function, they must carry out thorough screening and confirm only qualified nominees of Mr. President, and not all manner of persons sent to them just to please the Presidency.\n\nThey should serve Nigeria and Nigerians as their priority, not sycophantic allegiance to the President, to the detriment of the country.",

          "text": "The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has threatened to embark on an industrial action if the 13 months\u2019 salaries of over 1,000 of its members across the country were not paid.\n\nLazarus Maigoro, Chairman, University of Jos chapter of the union, who stated this in a statement on Saturday, in Jos, added that the federal government had also withheld the check-off dues of the affected members.\n\nHe accused Ahmed Idris, the Accountant General of Federation (AGF), of systematically denying the lecturers their remuneration, even after government and the union had reached an agreement on non-victimisation of its members following their last strike.\n\nThe chairman alleged that the affected members were being threatened to either enrol into the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) platform, or have their salaries withheld.\n\nHe explained that despite the directives of President Muhammadu Buhari that members of the union be paid their full remuneration, the accountant general had denied the affected union members their pay, in a complete violation of the terms of the agreement signed between the union and government.\n\nMr Maigoro said that the office of the accountant-general had continued to feed the public and some sections of government with false reasons over the matter, such as incorrect BVN numbers, incorrectly spelt names and their sequential arrangement, among others.\n\nHe, however, added that such excuses were not tenable, because the bursary departments of their various institutions had submitted the names severally to the authorities, but the problem had continued to persist.\n\n\u201cASUU wants to bring to the attention of the Nigerian public the deliberate, systematic and unpatriotic actions of the Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, on the future of education in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIdris, from all intent and purposes, is bent on withholding the salaries of over 1,000 members of ASUU spread across the country, with more than 100 of such lecturers being members of our branch at the University of Jos.\n\n\u201cThis is simply because they participated in the last strike and refused to enrol in the much discredited IPPIS, despite the non-victimisation clause signed in the Memorandum of Action (MoA) that led to the suspension of the strike in December 2020.\n\n\u201cDespite the directive given by Mr President to pay the salaries of all lecturers, the AGF has refused to pay their salaries, for periods ranging from four to thirteen months, respectively.\n\n\u201dMore worrisome is the fact that while the AGF is refusing to pay the salaries, his staff are busy calling the affected lecturers and insisting they have to register with IPPIS before they are paid; some are even asked to forfeit a part of their salaries in order to be paid. So, it is very clear that this is a deliberate act on the part of the AGF and his staff.\n\n\u201cMany of our members at the University of Jos have not been paid salaries from February 2020 to date. How they are expected to go to the classroom and teach beats my imagination.\n\n\u201cIt is not news, that our union have vowed to fight back at any cost in order to salvage our colleagues from his tyranny and unpatriotic act against not just ASUU members, but the future of education in Nigeria and so, if nothing is urgently done, we will be forced to take action,\u201d Mr Maigoro said.\n\nALSO READ: ASUU elects new president\n\n\u201cThe union has gotten to a stage where it may be forced to take drastic measures to save the lives and families of its members because their despair is also our collective despair.\u201d\n\nMr Maigoro also said that the inability of government to pay other allowances, such as sabbatical, visiting, part time and contract staff was also destroying the university system in the country.\n\n\u201cApart from the refusal to pay the salaries of our members, the lack of payment of allowances of sabbatical, visiting, part-time, contract staff is further killing the federal universities in Nigeria, and this is all because of IPPIS.\n\n\u201cWe hope that whatever decision the union takes, will not be misconstrued by the Nigerian public, especially seeing the seeming silence of the public and the government over the complete violation of our 2020 MoA,\u201d he said\n\nMr Maigoro called on President Buhari to wade into the matter, in order to save the affected members, as well as the future of education in Nigeria.

          "text": "Despite having more than 100 different taxes with less than 10 of them actually generating about 98 per cent of the country\u2019s tax revenue, indeed, there is need for Nigeria to review its tax laws, abolishing many that do not conform to current realities, tax practitioners told LEADERSHIP yesterday.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of such that was canvassed for by the analysts is the stamp duty act which was introduced into the country by the British in the 1890s and was made into law in 1939.\n\nAccording to the tax practitioners, while the government is looking at introducing more taxes to generate revenue, there is need for a review of the tax laws, more accountability on the part of the government and an overhaul of general tax administration in the country.\n\nThe practitioners believe that with this, the nation\u2019s tax law would be compliant with current realities, more effective and generate the much needed revenue for the country.\n\nData from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) showed that tax-to-GDP ratio in Nigeria increased by 0.6 percentage points from 5.7 per cent in 2017 to 6.3 per cent in 2018. In comparison, the average for 30 African countries increased by just under 0.1 percentage points over the same period, and was 16.5 per cent in 2018.\n\nSince 2010, the average for the 30 African countries has increased by 1.4 percentage points, from 15.1 per cent in 2010 to 16.5 per cent in 2018. Over the same period, the tax-to-GDP ratio in Nigeria has decreased by 1.0 percentage points, from 7.3 per cent to 6.3 per cent. The highest tax-to-GDP ratio in Nigeria was 9.6 per cent in 2011, with the lowest being 5.3 per cent in 2016.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nIn 2020, the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) said it pulled in N4.952 trillion in non-oil revenue, lower than N5.076 trillion which it projected to make in the year and much lower than N5.261 trillion it made in the same period of 2019.\n\nThe FIRS, like in years past, had fallen short of its N8.802 trillion projections in 2019. Between 2015 and 2018, the country had recorded N16.395 trillion revenue as against N20.408 trillion that was projected during the period.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Nigeria\u2019s non-oil revenue mobilization has been one of the lowest worldwide, reflecting weaknesses in revenue administration systems and systemic noncompliance.\n\n\u201cFor corporate income tax, less than six percent of registered taxpayers are active. Estimates on payment compliance in the case of value added tax (VAT) vary between 15 and 40 percent, and Nigeria raises less than one percent of GDP in VAT revenue, compared to almost four percent of GDP in the countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Tax exemptions and incentives are narrowing the base.\n\n\u201cInternational evidence shows that a minimum tax-to-GDP ratio of 12.75 percent is associated with a significant acceleration in growth and development of state capacity. It would allow increased expenditure for economic development and reduce budget exposure to oil revenue volatility,\u201d the IMF said.\n\nSpeaking with LEADERSHIP, Fiscal Policy Partner and Africa Tax Leader at PwC, Taiwo Oyedele, noted that tax morale is low in Nigeria because \u201cpeople don\u2019t trust the government as transparency and accountability are very poor. This combination, unfortunately, means Nigeria is unable to generate enough revenues to take care of governance and the people.\u201d\n\nHe also said that there are three major factors that hinder effective taxation in Nigeria. He listed legislation, administration and policy.\n\nOn tax administration, Oyedele of PwC noted that the administration of taxation in Nigeria hasn\u2019t impacted revenue growth in the economy. He said, \u201cWe find a lot of things done manually paying taxes, filling forms, filing returns are cumbersome and a lot of untrained people who are collecting taxes, harassing business owners and a whole lot of others. Some of those taxes end up in private pockets and because they are being collected in very manual, crude and unrefined ways gives way to corruption.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on legislation, Oyedele said, \u201cOur laws are obsolete in many cases, it is just too ambiguous and complicated for those doing business in today\u2019s world. There are many tax laws we inherited from the British laws before our independence, and we haven\u2019t done much to improve them since then.\n\n\u201cTo think about the stamp duty law of 1939 or thereabout long before our independence and apart from changing pounds to naira and kobo, there hasn\u2019t been any major improvement. If you think about the personal income tax, there used to be a time when it was exempted for poor people and that was people earning N30,000 per annum and that is N2,500 per month, but that is completely ridiculous because no one earns N2,500 per month now. So, because we haven\u2019t been doing reviews of our laws, they are very much out of date.\u201d\n\nIn addressing this, Oyedele said apart from simplifying the tax law, \u201cwe need to repeal so many of them, harmonise them so that we have fewer laws. That way, we do not have over 100 different taxes when indeed more than 98 per cent of revenue comes from less than 10. Why don\u2019t we repeal all those taxes that create troubles for everyone and interpret the tax laws into the main languages Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo in addition to pidgin and then simplify them? We have a law of 1939 which was before I was born which means it is very old, that means we are trying to tax transactions now that never existed at that time. We didn\u2019t even have the internet then and now we are trying to impose stamp duties on money transfers. Electronic money transfer wasn\u2019t in existence when this law was made so we are now trying to force a square peg into a round hole. There would be a lot of scars.\n\nOyedele also listed policy as a hindrance to effective taxation in Nigeria. According to him, the policy direction in different areas of tax collection sometimes are unclear, inconsistent and sometimes they are not well harmonised between the levels of government. He said, \u201cThat is why we see a lot of multiple taxation everywhere which affect particularly Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), some of them are taxed to death. There is also the problem of overregulation.\n\n\u2018\u2018The starting point of what Nigeria needs to do is to look at the tax policy framework. The National Tax Policy of 2017 hasn\u2019t been implemented and now it is due for review. The government needs to review that, look at what it is that we want, who do you want to tax, how do you want to tax them, who should bear the incidence. So that shows the kind of tax system that needs to happen and I hope it can start with the tax recommendation sent to the National Assembly as part of the constitution review. In the area of administration we need to use a lot of intelligence, data and technology, a lot of what we do manually today is making our cost of collection to be extremely high.\u201d\n\nAlso, the immediate past president of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN), Dame Jumoke Simplice, called for a review of the tax laws in the country.\n\nAccording to her, there is need for political autonomy as well as capacity building for revenue collecting staff. She suggested that qualified tax practitioners be employed into the tax system to ensure effective collection, rather than using political affiliations to appoint tax officers.\n\nSimplice also explained that the level of corruption in the system discourages the citizens from paying taxes. \u201cPeople get disenchanted when they see in the news that government officials are stealing billions of naira and there is no real consequence because no one has been jailed. So, it will not encourage voluntary compliance. We cannot continue to pay lip service to anti-corruption and then do plea bargaining with corrupt persons, it does not work. People will be discouraged when government takes so much and people can\u2019t see what the money is being used for,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has threatened to embark on an industrial action if the 13 months\u2019 salaries of over 1,000 of its members across the country were not paid.\n\nDr. Lazarus Maigoro, Chairman, University of Jos chapter of the union, who stated this in a statement on Saturday, in Jos, added that the Federal Government had also withheld the check-off dues of the affected members.\n\nHe accused Ahmed Idris, the Accountant General of Federation (AGF), for systematically denying the lecturers their remuneration, even after government and the union had reached an agreement on non-victimisation of its members following their last strike.\n\nThe chairman alleged that the affected members were being threatened to either enrol into the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) platform, or have their salaries withheld.\n\nHe explained that despite the directives of President Muhammadu Buhari, that members of the union be paid their full remuneration, the AGF had denied the affected union members their pay, in complete violation of the terms of the agreement signed between the union and government.\n\nMaigoro said that the office of the AGF had continued to feed the public and some sections of government with false reasons over the matter, such as incorrect BVN numbers, incorrectly spelt names and their sequential arrangement, among others.\n\nHe, however, added that such excuses were not tenable, because the bursary departments of their various institutions had submitted the names severally to the authorities, but the problem had continued to persist.\n\n\u201cASUU wants to bring to the attention of the Nigerian public the deliberate, systematic and unpatriotic actions of the Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, on the future of education in Nigeria.\n\n\u201d Idris, from all intent and purposes, is bent on withholding the salaries of over 1,000 members of ASUU spread across the country, with more than 100 of such lecturers being members of our branch at the University of Jos.\n\n\u201cThis is simply because they participated in the last strike and refused to enrol in the much discredited IPPIS, despite the non-victimisation clause signed in the Memorandum of Action (MoA) that led to the suspension of the strike in December 2020.\n\n\u201cDespite the directive given by Mr President to pay the salaries of all lecturers, the AGF has refused to pay their salaries, for periods ranging from four to thirteen months, respectively.\n\n\u201dMore worrisome is the fact that while the AGF is refusing to pay the salaries, his staff are busy calling the affected lecturers and insisting they have to register with IPPIS before they are paid; some are even asked to forfeit a part of their salaries in order to be paid. So, it is very clear that this is a deliberate act on the part of the AGF and his staff.\n\n\u201cMany of our members at the University of Jos have not been paid salaries from February 2020 to date. How they are expected to go to the classroom and teach beats my imagination.\n\n\u201cIt is not news, that our union have vowed to fight back at any cost in order to salvage our colleagues from his tyranny and unpatriotic act against not just ASUU members, but the future of education in Nigeria and so, if nothing is urgently done, we will be forced to take action,\u201d Maigoro said.\n\n\u201cThe union has gotten to a stage where it may be forced to take drastic measures to save the lives and families of its members because their despair is also our collective despair.\n\nMaigoro also said that the inability of government to pay other allowances, such as sabbatical, visiting, part time and contract staff was also destroying the university system in the country.\n\n\u201cApart from the refusal to pay the salaries of our members, the lack of payment of allowances of sabbatical, visiting, part-time, contract staff is further killing the federal universities in Nigeria, and this is all because of IPPIS.\n\n\u201cWe hope that whatever decision the union takes, will not be misconstrued by the Nigerian public, especially seeing the seeming silence of the public and the government over the complete violation of our 2020 MoA,\u201d he said\n\nMaigoro called on President Buhari to wade into the matter, in order to save the affected members, as well as the future of education in Nigeria.

          "text": "The amount of heat trapped by Earth\u2019s land, ocean, and atmosphere doubled over the course of just 14 years, a new study shows.\n\nTo figure out how much heat the earth was trapping, researchers looked at NASA satellite measurements that tracked how much of the Sun\u2019s energy was entering Earth\u2019s atmosphere and how much was being bounced back into space.\n\nThey compared this with data from NOAA buoys that tracked ocean temperatures \u2014 which gives them an idea of how much heat is getting absorbed into the ocean.\n\nThe difference between the amount of heat absorbed by Earth, and the amount reflected back into space is called an energy imbalance.\n\nIn this case, they found that from 2005 to 2019, the amount of heat absorbed by Earth was going up. Their results were published in Geophysical Research Letters this week.\n\n\u201cThe two very independent ways of looking at changes in Earth\u2019s energy imbalance are in really, really good agreement, and they\u2019re both showing this very large trend, which gives us a lot of confidence that what we\u2019re seeing is a real phenomenon and not just an instrumental artifact,\u201d said Norman Loeb, a NASA researcher and the lead author for the study in a press release. \u201cThe trends we found were quite alarming in a sense.\u201d\n\nThe researchers think that the reason the Earth is holding on to more heat comes down to a few different factors. One is human-caused climate change. Among other problems, the more greenhouse gases we emit, the more heat they trap.\n\nIt gets worse when you take into account that increasing heat also melts ice and snow. Ice and snow can help the planet reflect heat back into space \u2014 as they disappear, more heat can be absorbed by the land and oceans underneath.\n\nThere\u2019s another factor at play too \u2014 natural changes to a climate pattern called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Between 2014 and 2019, the pattern was in a \u2018warm phase\u2019 which caused fewer clouds to form. That also meant more heat could be absorbed by the oceans.\n\nMore than likely, it\u2019s the combination of climate change with those natural shifts that made such a big difference to Earth\u2019s energy balance, Loeb says. \u201cAnd over this period they\u2019re both causing warming, which leads to a fairly large change in Earth\u2019s energy imbalance. The magnitude of the increase is unprecedented.\u201d\n\nFourteen years isn\u2019t a long time compared to Earth\u2019s long climate history \u2014 researchers will have to keep gathering data to get more information about how this fits into the complete picture of the planet\u2019s energy imbalance.\n\n\u201cMy hope is the rate that we\u2019re seeing this energy imbalance subsides in the coming decades,\u201d Loeb told CNN. \u201cOtherwise, we\u2019re going to see more alarming climate changes.\u201d",

          "title": "Opinion: The Dignity of Labour \u2013 By DANIEL IGHAKPE",
          "text": "\u201cThere is benefit in every kind of hard work . . . \u201d -Proverbs 14:23.\n\nA talented Nigerian musician, Adekunle Gold, in one of his popular songs titled \u2018WORK,\u2019 encouraged people to work hard. This is in harmony with what God\u2019s Word, The Bible, recommends at Ecclesiastes Chapter 9, Verse 10: \u201cWhatever your hand finds to do, do with all your might . . . \u201d\n\nWork \u2013 whether paid or unpaid, is good for our health and well-being. It contributes to our happiness, helps us to build confidence and self-esteem, and can reward us financially. Work is an essential tool through which individuals can achieve their goals, flourish, and live happy, meaningful lives.\n\nWork has different dimensions, such as work for making a living and work for developing one\u2019s talent and potential. For example, a little girl in one of the corners of the world who goes to the kindergarten and learns how to count, draw or write, is working. Likewise, an adult, who goes to his/her job every day, and gets paid for that, is also working. Thus based on the age, circumstances, needs and desires of individuals, work, or labour, takes different shapes.\n\nWork is a virtue and necessity, which requires the utilization of time and energy. Man is in control of his time and energy when he voluntarily and constructively works. The Bible emphasizes the importance of work when it says at 2 Thessalonians, Chapter 3, Verses 10 to 12 that: \u201d . . . if anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat. . . . \u201d This scripture condemns laziness. We need to work to make a living and provide for our families. Work provides the individual with the ability to be independent, to flourish, to develop, and most importantly, to find a meaning to life.\n\nHowever, there are many issues seriously affecting work and workers in Nigeria today. These include: unemployment, poor remuneration/wages, poor working environment and conditions, casualisation of workers, among others. Many people experience poverty and unemployment through no fault of their own. Many who are able to work, willing to work hard, and even actively searching for work, are still unable to find work \u2013 they are unemployed!\n\nUnemployment and poverty are two of the major issues currently plaguing Nigeria\u2019s economy and its society. According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the population of the unemployed in Nigeria during Q4 2020 rose to 33.3 percent from the 27.1 percent of Q2 2020. This placed Nigeria in the number three position among countries with the highest number of unemployed people in the world! Also, according to data from the World Poverty Clock (a Web tool produced by World Data Lab), the number of people living in extreme poverty in Nigeria rose from 86.9 million in 2018, to 93.7 million in 2019, thus Nigeria stands as the nation with the highest number of people living in extreme poverty across the world!\n\nNevertheless, despite the high rate of unemployment and poverty, the situation is not necessarily hopeless. People can still find some meaningful work to engage in, even though it may be small. If you are unemployed, or cannot find a job in your area of particular interest, it is wise to consider looking for a job in other areas, even if the job is considered \u2018menial\u2019 by the standards of some people. Do not allow false pride to let you look down on a job \u2013 as beneath your dignity. Any legitimate service that can benefit others, and that people are willing to pay for, can be considered as an alternative job opportunity when jobs are scarce.\n\nPeople differ in terms of many characteristics such as intelligence, talents, academic levels, etc. Therefore depending on human potential and the specific working environment, work can be equally beneficial to the person or demeaning. For example, prostitution, gambling, and drug dealing constitute work, as you get a kind of remuneration for the service you provide. But the money you get out of these kinds of work becomes useless, as it neither contributes to human flourishing, nor is the basis of a meaningful life. Work should be the key to human survival and flourishing, and not to degradation of the individual and his moral values.\n\nOn the other hand, no matter how honest, working from dawn to sunset does not make your life flourish either. \u201cAll work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,\u201d goes the popular saying. Workaholics, the people whose only purpose in life is work, impinge themselves from other activities. Productive work is not an end-in-itself, but a means of flourishing. If one pursues productive work to the exclusion of everything else in one\u2019s life, so that it becomes one\u2019s only purpose in life, this will undermine one\u2019s flourishing. On the other hand, those who keep their life balanced are likely to enjoy their work even more.\n\nSo, whether your work is mostly mental, mostly physical, or somewhere in between, recognize that there is dignity in labour. Hard work helps us to care for our material needs. Moreover, it contributes to our self-respect, after all, hard work is just that \u2013 hard. When we discipline ourselves to stick with our work \u2013 even if it seems boring or difficult \u2013 we can have the satisfaction of knowing that we held ourselves to a high standard. We have won the victory over the inclination to take the easy way out. In that sense, work brings an intense feeling of satisfaction.\n\nGod wants us to enjoy the fruitage, or reward, of our hard work. His Word, The Bible says: \u201cThere is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink and find enjoyment in his hard work. This too, I have realized, is from the hand of the true God.\u201d -Ecclesiastes 2:24.\n\nNB: Some of the content of this article was sourced from ukessays.com.\n\nDaniel IGHAKPE.\n\nFESTAC Town, Lagos.\n\n[email protected]; 0817 479 5742.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

These range from pain, swelling at the site of the inoculation, to body pains and nausea.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, 52 cases of moderate to severe incidents of AEFI have been reported. These presented as fever, vomiting, diarrhea headaches, dizziness and allergic reactions.\n\n\u201cFive states have the highest records of the AEFI namely: Kaduna (970) Cross River (859), Yobe (541), Kebbi (511), and Lagos (448),\u201d he disclosed.\n\nAccording to Shuaib, as of today, April 16th, 1,071,346, representing 53.2% of the eligible persons targeted with the AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered their first dose in this vaccination phase.\n\nHe said the data were based on reports received from states through the Electronic Management of Immunization Data (EMID) system only and did not take into account vaccinations that were not yet captured in the system.\n\n\u201cWhat this number means is that these are the people who have their information already uploaded on our data base, while others are awaiting upload, potentially due to network problems and the high traffic of those coming in to take their shots at the same time.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to optimize our registration and immunization data system, we also encourage the state teams to deploy the most suitable internet service for their locations in order to speed up the data entry process, so that we can have the actual number of vaccinated people at any given time,\u201d he said.\n\nShuaib added that in many states, the inoculation of frontline health workers had been completed and that they had begun offering vaccination to the elderly, particularly those that were 65 years and above.\n\n\u201cWe are glad to be able to progress quickly offer immunization to more members of the community.\n\n\u201cOur rollout has been marked by safety, efficiency, best practice, and speed. The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and its development partners, have a platform of Senior Supervisors that engage in daily evening review meetings to determine the status of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation in all States & the FCT.\u201d",

          "text": "Babatunde Fashola, the Minister of Works and Housing, has defended the Federal Government\u2019s use of loans to build the country\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nFashola told the Nigerian News Agency (NAN) that the country would not make significant progress until it took loans to improve infrastructure.\n\nHe stressed that borrowing is not a sin, and that it is necessary for the economy to flourish.\n\n\u201dIt is in our own interest that the government does some borrowing and spends it on investment because that sector contributes to the Gross Domestic Products (GDP) and contributes to employment.\n\n\u201cI do not support irresponsible borrowing so let us be clear; there has to be some sense to this.\n\n\u201cSo long as you are borrowing to invest and you are investing in assets then we can have this debate from morning till night and I don\u2019t think I will come out unsuccessful.\n\n\u201cI agree everybody must keep their eyes open about how money is being borrowed, what it is being used for and whether the debt is sustainable.\n\n\u201cWe just delivered a rail programme through the Ministry of Transportation; that is a 100-year asset that you have got now.\n\n\u201cSo some economists say wait until you gather the money, that\u2019s bad economics,\u201d the minister said.\n\nWhile pointing out that many developed countries created super economies through borrowing, Fashola said that the recent loans obtained by the Federal Government would not mortgage the future of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe came from a background of colonialism where we were told that if you go borrowing you go sorrowing, so, my parents and their generation told us never to borrow.\n\n\u201cBut while we were not borrowing, those who laid the rules started borrowing.\n\n\u201cThe largest debtors in the world today are from the West. But with borrowing they have created super economies, built massive train terminals, massive airports, schools and hospitals.\n\n\u201cAnd you know what is happening, we go to use them and they charge us, so who is paying?\n\n\u201cI have heard people say they are mortgaging the future of people, as we are holding this meeting, one new baby has arrived, if you don\u2019t prepare for him you make that future bleak.\n\n\u201cAs at the time we were building Lekki Bridge in Lagos, it was N29 billion, the child that was born then in 2010 is going to be 11 this year.\n\n\u201cIf his mother carrying his pregnancy had crossed that bridge at any time, he used that bridge before he was born and we had secured that asset for him before he arrived.\n\n\u201cIf we wait until he is about 30 to build that bridge, we can\u2019t buy it at N29 billion anymore.\n\n\u201cSo, if he contributes to paying it so be it because he started using it before he even arrived.\n\n\u201cSo, those who said don\u2019t borrow have changed their minds, they have set parameters of debt to GDP and within those parameters you play very well.\n\n\u201cAnd those who say so now, where were they in 2005 or 2006 when the government paid out 12 billion dollars in cash to go and buy a tent when the house is flooding, who does that?\n\n\u201cThey took 12 billion dollars in cash to go and write off debts that have been classified.\n\n\u201cThe roads were bad then, the rail was not built, airports needed expansion, Lagos-Ibadan (express way) needed to be built.\n\n\u201cBut since the aftermath of going to write off that debt we started borrowing again, so this administration did inherit all the debt.\n\n\u201cThere is a sector of our economy called the financial services sector, if all of us put money in a bank and nobody is borrowing, that bank is going to fold up.\n\n\u201cSo, if you have anybody in any venture capital, finance house, mortgage bank, it is because the government is borrowing that they can pay their salary.\n\n\u201cBorrowing is not a sin, it is part of the essence of keeping the economy growing and the armchair economists talking about public expenditure for example who have never run a government must be careful what they feed to the public,\u2019\u2019 Fashola added.",

SERAP and concerned Nigerians frequently rely on the Twitter handles of many broadcast stations as sources of information for our activities in the promotion of transparency and accountability in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigeria is a state party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which impose legal obligations on the government of President Buhari to ensure that the rights of Nigerians to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom are respected, promoted, protected, fulfilled, and not unlawfully restricted.\u201d\n\nRead Also\n\nAssist my govt fight corruption, Buhari tells Appeal Court president\n\nMy 1981 encounter with Buhari showed he\u2019s tribalistic \u2013Ex-Man O\u2019War leader\n\nA few questions for Buhari\n\n\u201cThe NBC and Mr Lai Muhammed have not shown any law breached by journalists, broadcast stations and media houses in Nigeria, and the government of President Buhari cannot use any disagreement with Twitter as a ploy to violate Nigerians\u2019 rights and undermine their individual businesses and professional duties.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe drafters of the Nigerian Constitution well knew the danger inherent in special executive and legislative acts which take away the life, liberty, or property of particular named persons. They intended to safeguard the people of this country from punishment without trial by duly constituted courts. These principles are so fundamental and must be respected.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe directive to broadcast stations has seriously undermined the ability of Nigerians and other people in the country to freely express themselves in a democracy, and undermined the ability of journalists, media houses, broadcast stations, and other people to freely carry out their professional duties.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Twitter accounts by broadcast stations and media houses are their own properties acquired upon privity of terms and conditions formulated by the Twitter Inc. and accepted by the stations and media houses.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also asking the Federal High Court for the following reliefs:\n\n\u201cA DECLARATION that the directive by the NBC and Mr Lai Muhammed to broadcast stations in Nigeria to deactivate their Twitter handles and desist from using Twitter as a source of information gathering is unlawful, and amounts to a breach of the principles of legality and no punishment without law, and violation of the rights to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom guaranteed under sections 39 and 22 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 [as amended], Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n\u201cA DECLARATION that the acts of the NBC and Mr Lai Muhammed in relying on the National Broadcasting Act and the Nigeria Broadcasting Code to unilaterally direct broadcast stations to delete their Twitter handles and desist from using Twitter without recourse to the court amount to infringement on sections 6[1] & [6][b], 36 and 44[1] of the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended], Articles 1 and 7 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n\u201cA DECLARATION that the provision of section 2[1][r] of the National Broadcasting Act and sections 5.6.3, 5.11.3 of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code being inconsistent and incompatible with sections 36[1], 39 and 22 of the Nigerian Constitution, Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are null and void to the extent of their inconsistency and incompatibility.\n\n\u201cA DECLARATION that the NBC and Mr Lai Muhammed lack the power and authority to unlawfully impose penalty such as fines and other sanctions on any journalists and broadcast stations for using Twitter, and refusing/failing to deactivate their Twitter handles.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

Here is one creeping serpent that is eating up the destinies of many individuals.\n\n\u201cWe must wake up from our slumber to deal with this monster. Young people, beware! Addiction to social media is like addiction to drugs. It can render a whole destiny useless.\n\n\u201cThis social media saga has eroded the substance of destiny of most youths today. What is supposed to be a plus has suddenly become a major minus, because everything of value delivers through investment of time.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, we are faced with a generation on the wrong side of history; the honour of this generation has been wiped off \u2014 chatting all day with no time left to think, plan, programme and engage productively in the pursuit of any task.\n\n\u201cMany youths spend less than 10 to 20 percent of their time on their tasks per day. They can never match a generation that spends 70 percent to 80 percent of their time on their tasks.\n\n\u201cWe must devise means to put a check on free access to social media, particularly those that are not adding values. Life is a race. Everyone should get on the track, ready for the run of their lives.\u201d",

Our various scriptures as Muslims and Christians allow us to put our lives at risk in defence of our honour, property and our faiths.\u201cIn what the bandits are doing, they have challenged all of us, so, we can\u2019t let them.\u201dBagudu asked the hunters to go back and fully mobilise, pending when he gets the necessary clearance from the security agencies, adding, \u201cwe will meet in the field.\u201dThe governor maintained that governors were not sworn in only to sit down in the office and work.\n\nHe stated that they are aware that one day they would be required to lead in the field, even though they are not military or police personnel.He said that if hundreds of thousands of people can be mobilised during campaigns, same should be done now to join the search party.He said: \u201cWhat happened in Birnin Yauri should be the last straw.

Aminu Bello Masari, has said that banditry in Katsina State and environs was peculiar as it does not represent any ideology, doctrine, religion, or political party.\n\nThis is even as he commended the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) for its responsiveness in the fight against armed banditry and other forms of criminality in Katsina State and other states in Northwest Nigeria.\n\nGovernor Masari gave this commendation when he paid a courtesy call on the CAS at NAF Headquarters, Abuja.\n\nDirector of Public Relations and Information Nigerian Air Force, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet in a statement noted that Governor Masari said that banditry in Katsina is pure criminality.\n\nThe Governor also revealed that the Katsina State Government have made several efforts to engage the bandits, but the moves have yielded little or no result as each group operates independently.\n\nThe security situation in the state, he said, was compounded by the vastness of the Katsina open border with Niger Republic as well as the huge ungovernable spaces in the State which gives the bandits freedom of movement.\n\nHe expressed sadness that the activities of these miscreants which was associated with wanton destruction of lives and properties, kidnapping, rape and arson has greatly affected the progress of the State.\n\nEven more worrisome, according to the Governor, was the sad fact that these bandits attack the same locality they reside in and people they have lived with for years.\n\nNoting that the primacy of governance can only be felt when peace and security is achieved, Governor Masari noted that all efforts must be made to root out banditry to restore sanity and normalcy in the entire North-western Nigeria.\n\nHe expressed happiness with the level of synergy among the various security agencies and stated that the result of the new level of cooperation has started yielding the requisite outcome with some level of normalcy being felt in some areas of the State.\n\nHe therefore called on the collective support of Nigerians as the military work round the clock to ensure the protection of lives and properties.\n\nHe also noted that the glaring commitment and dedication of the Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, as well as the efforts of NAF personnel at the forefront of on-going operations in the Northeast has significantly curtailed the activities of the bandits and limited their scope of operation.\n\nThe Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao thanked Governor Masari for his support to the NAF and other security agencies in Katsina State.\n\nHe also informed the Governor of NAF\u2019s firm support for the Governor\u2019s stance of not negotiating with bandits, while assuring him that in no distant time, the security situation would take a turn for the better.\n\nAir Marshal Oladayo also used the opportunity of the visit to inform the Governor that the mandate given the service chiefs by President Muhammadu Buhari was clear and unambiguous: \u201cDeal decisively with all bandits and other criminal elements in the country\u201d.\n\nAccording to the CAS, \u201cWith the induction of new platforms including the Super Tucanos and other platforms in the next month or 2, there will be no hiding place for these bandits\u201d.\n\nOn ongoing NAF operational projects in Katsina State, Air Marshal Amao assured Governor Masari that when completed, the projects would enhance the operational capabilities and reach of NAF platforms in the State.",

          "title": "SERAP Sues FG, Lai Mohammed Over Repressive Directive Asking Broadcasters To Stop Using Twitter",
          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a lawsuit asking the Federal High Court in Abuja \u201cto stop the Federal Government and the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed from using their patently unlawful directive to all TV and radio stations not to use Twitter, and to delete their accounts as a pretext to harass, intimidate, suspend or impose criminal punishment on journalists and broadcast stations simply for using social media platforms.\u201d\n\nThe suit followed the order by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) asking TV and radio stations to \u201csuspend the patronage of Twitter immediately\u201d, and telling them to delete \u2018unpatriotic\u2019 Twitter after the social media giant was banned in the country for deleting President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet.\n\nIn the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/496/2021 filed last Friday, SERAP is seeking: \u201can order of perpetual injunction restraining the government of President Buhari, the NBC, and Mr Lai Muhammed and any other persons from censoring, regulating, licensing and controlling the social media operations and contents by broadcast stations, and activities of social media service providers in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: South East Governors Condemn Violent Secessionist Groups, Back United Nigeria\n\nIn the suit, SERAP is also seeking \u201can order setting aside the directive by NBC and Mr Lai Muhammed asking broadcast stations to stop using Twitter, as it is unconstitutional, unlawful, inconsistent and incompatible with the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended], and the country\u2019s obligations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\u201d\n\nSERAP is arguing that \u201cThe government of President Buhari, the NBC and Mr. Lai Muhammed have consistently made policies and given directives to crack down on media freedom, and the rights of Nigerians to freedom of expression and access to information, and to impose crippling fines and other sanctions on broadcast stations without any legal basis whatsoever.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP: \u201cThe court has an important role to play in the protection and preservation of the rule of law to ensure that persons and institutions operate within the defined ambit of constitutional and statutory limitations.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also arguing that \u201cWhere agencies of government are allowed to operate at large and at their whims and caprices in the guise of performing their statutory duties, the end result will be anarchy, licentiousness, authoritarianism and brigandage leading to the loss of the much cherished and constitutionally guaranteed freedom and liberty.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP: \u201cBy using the National Broadcasting Act and the Nigeria Broadcasting Code to stop broadcast stations from using Twitter without recourse to the court, the NBC and Mr Lai Muhammed have contravened the right to access to justice and fair hearing guaranteed under sections 6[1] & [6][b] and 36[1] of the Nigerian Constitution 1999, and articles 1 and 7 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights.\u201d\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare, Kehinde Oyewumi, and Opeyemi Owolabi, read in part: \u201cThe directive by the NBC and Mr. Lai Muhammed to broadcasters to delete their Twitter accounts is unlawful, as it amounts to a fundamental breach of the principle of legality, the rights to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom, and incompatible with the country\u2019s international human rights obligations.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP and concerned Nigerians are entitled to the rights to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom subject only to lawful restrictions. SERAP and concerned Nigerians frequently rely on the Twitter handles of many broadcast stations as sources of information for our activities in the promotion of transparency and accountability in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigeria is a state party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which impose legal obligations on the government of President Buhari to ensure that the rights of Nigerians to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom are respected, promoted, protected, fulfilled, and not unlawfully restricted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe NBC and Mr. Lai Muhammed have not shown any law breached by journalists, broadcast stations and media houses in Nigeria, and the government of President Buhari cannot use any disagreement with Twitter as a ploy to violate Nigerians\u2019 rights and undermine their individual businesses and professional duties.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe drafters of the Nigerian Constitution well knew the danger inherent in special executive and legislative acts which take away the life, liberty, or property of particular named persons. They intended to safeguard the people of this country from punishment without trial by duly constituted courts. These principles are so fundamental and must be respected.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe directive to broadcast stations has seriously undermined the ability of Nigerians and other people in the country to freely express themselves in a democracy, and undermined the ability of journalists, media houses, broadcast stations, and other people to freely carry out their professional duties.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Twitter accounts by broadcast stations and media houses are their own properties acquired upon privity of terms and conditions formulated by the Twitter Inc. and accepted by the stations and media houses.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also asking the Federal High Court for the following reliefs:\n\n1. A DECLARATION that the directive by the NBC and Mr. Lai Muhammed to broadcast stations in Nigeria to deactivate their Twitter handles and desist from using Twitter as a source of information gathering is unlawful, and amounts to a breach of the principles of legality and no punishment without law, and violation of the rights to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom guaranteed under sections 39 and 22 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 [as amended], Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n2. A DECLARATION that the acts of the NBC and Mr. Lai Muhammed in relying on the National Broadcasting Act and the Nigeria Broadcasting Code to unilaterally direct broadcast stations to delete their Twitter handles and desist from using Twitter without recourse to the court amount to an infringement on sections 6[1] & [6][b], 36 and 44[1] of the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended], Articles 1 and 7 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n3. A DECLARATION that the provision of section 2[1][r] of the National Broadcasting Act and sections 5.6.3, 5.11.3 of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code being inconsistent and incompatible with sections 36[1], 39, and 22 of the Nigerian Constitution, Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are null and void to the extent of their inconsistency and incompatibility.\n\n4. A DECLARATION that the NBC and Mr. Lai Muhammed lack the power and authority to unlawfully impose penalties such as fines and other sanctions on any journalists and broadcast stations for using Twitter, and refusing/failing to deactivate their Twitter handles.\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday called on West African leaders to exert pressure on the military leadership in Mali to ensure that the transition process in the country is not aborted.\n\nHe made the call in his statement delivered at the 59th Ordinary session of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS in Accra, Ghana.\n\nThe Nigerian leader spoke on the situation in Mali which was recently suspended from the regional bloc due to a military coup.\n\n\u201cAt this Summit today, we are expected to review a number of important reports dealing with various issues of concerns to our organisation and people. In doing so, we must take realistic and practical decisions which will positively impact our citizens,\u201d he was quoted as saying in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu.\n\nPresident Buhari added, \u201cSome of those decisions, necessarily will have to do with evolving political and security situations in our sub-region as well as evaluate the health of our organisation with the hope of repositioning to serve our people and sub-region better.\n\n\u201cWhile democracy continues to develop in our sub-region, recent events in Mali are sad reminders that vigilance remains a crucial imperative to protect people\u2019s aspirations to freely choose the form of government they want.\n\n\u201cPressures are needed to ensure that the transition process in Mali, which is halfway to its conclusion, is not aborted.\n\n\u201cA further slide in Mali could prove catastrophic to the Sub-region, considering that about half of that country is unfortunately under the grip of terrorists.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: South East Governors Condemn Violent Secessionist Groups, Back United Nigeria\n\nThe Nigerian leader, therefore, appealed to the military leadership in Mali to understand the critical state of their country, which he described as being \u2018clearly under siege\u2019.\n\nNoting that the principal responsibility of the military must be to protect and guarantee the sovereignty of the West African country, the President cautioned them not to perpetuate acts that would facilitate the destabilisation and destruction of Mali.\n\n\u201cI urge our organization to remain engaged with all stakeholders in Mali through our astute Mediator, former President Goodluck Jonathan, who, I congratulate warmly, for his untiring efforts thus far.\n\n\u201cI encourage him to sustain these efforts to ensure that the transition is completed as scheduled,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Libya, President Buhari faulted the recent United Nations Resolution to expel all foreign fighters in Libya, without first ensuring that they were disarmed.\n\nHe lamented that while the decision was aimed at bringing about sustenance of peace in Libya, non-collaboration with regional stakeholders has created newer threats to peace, security and stability in the region.\n\nThe President warned that this could lead to lack of coordinated management of huge humanitarian crisis across the Sahel, North, Central and West Africa, including the Lake Chad region.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is imperative that ECOWAS leaders, at this Summit, decide how the UN-Sub-regional organisations partnerships should be reviewed to address the dangers that this UN Resolution poses to the region.\u201d\n\nThe statement by the Nigerian leader at the Summit also addressed other pertinent issues of concern in the organisation, including the ongoing institutional reforms in ECOWAS.\n\nDeclaring Nigeria\u2019s unequivocal support to the reforms process, he said he looked forward to an ECOWAS that would be \u2018fit for purpose\u2019, delivering services to the satisfaction of the community citizens.\n\nHe commended the President of the Commission and his team, the Ad-hoc Ministerial Committee on Institutional Reforms as well as the Council of Ministers for the excellent report presented to the Authority of Heads of State.\n\nIn his capacity as the ECOWAS champion on the fight against COVID-19, President Buhari also drew attention to the need for more citizens in the region to be vaccinated, stressing the need for adherence to other non-pharmaceutical interventions.\n\nHe said the West African region was in the grip of a third wave, warning against complacency in national and regional initiatives to address the pandemic.\n\nPresident Buhari reaffirmed Nigeria\u2019s commitment to the noble objectives of the organisation, saying, \u201cI encourage us to take bolder steps towards ensuring that the organisation fulfils the aspirations of its founding fathers, which include a truly integrated sub-region, economically, politically, socio-culturally united and secured to permit its sustainable development and growth.\u201d",

          "text": "Emirates Airlines will resume flights to Nigeria from June 23, five months after it banned outbound flights from Abuja and Lagos. This followed the withdrawal of the Rapid Antigen Test the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had insisted passengers from Nigeria travelling to Dubai must take four hours before boarding their flights.\n\nIn another development, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) confirmed it had fixed the airfield light at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos, Runway 18R, to enable flights land in the night. Regional Terminal Manager in charge of MMIA, Mrs. Victoria Shin-Aba, stated this on Saturday in an interview with THISDAY.\n\nThe UAE antigen test requirement was against Nigeria\u2019s policy that passengers travelling out of the country should conduct Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test 72 hours before their flight.\n\nBut on Saturday, UAE issued a statement conceding that Nigerian passengers that wished to travel to Dubai \u201cmust have received a negative test result for PCR test taken within 48 hours before departure.\u201d\n\nThe statement posted on Instagram by the Dubai media office also said passengers travelling from Nigeria should present a negative PCR test certificate with a QR Code from labs approved by the Nigerian government. It stated that all passengers must undergo a PCR test on arrival in Dubai, adding, \u201cTransit passengers should comply with entry protocol of final destination.\u201d\n\nThe media office said the new regulation was part of measures aimed at easing inbound travel restrictions by Dubai\u2019s Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management. The committee introduced new entry protocols for passengers effective June 23.\n\nBesides the new condition for Nigerian travellers, UAE has new regulations for passengers travelling from South Africa and India to Dubai.\n\nFor South Africa, the new rules stipulate that passengers should have received two doses of a vaccine approved by UAE authorities.\n\n\u201cPassengers must present a negative test result for a PCR test taken within 48 hours before departure; UAE citizens are exempted. All passengers must undergo a PCR test on arrival at Dubai airport. Transit passengers should comply with entry protocols of final destination,\u201d the statement said.\n\nFor travellers from India, UAE said passengers should have received two doses of a vaccine approved by UAE authorities and passengers must have received a negative test result for PCR test taken within 48 hours before departure, in addition to the other conditions given to Nigeria and South Africa.\n\nConfirming the withdrawal of the antigen test, Emirates Airlines issued a statement signed by its management, which said, \u201cEmirates welcomes the latest protocols and measures announced by Dubai\u2019s Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management to allow the safe resumption of passenger travel from South Africa, Nigeria and India to Dubai. We look forward to facilitating travel from these countries and supporting various travellers\u2019 categories.\n\n\u201cWe will resume carrying passengers from South Africa, Nigeria and India in accordance with these protocols from 23rd June. We thank the Supreme Committee for their continuous efforts in monitoring the development of the situation and announcing the appropriate guidelines and protocols to protect the community and safeguard travel sector.\u201d\n\nReacting to the new development, President of the National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA), Mrs. Susan Akporiaye, said UAE had done what the Nigerian government wanted. Akporiaye said the new development had shown that no country could rubbish Nigeria if it insisted on a position popular with its citizens.\n\nThe NANTA president said there would be a price to pay if a country stood its ground, regretting that Nigeria had often tended to shy away from the reality of that price.\n\nAkporiaye stated, \u201cSome of the prices include the fact that many Nigerian students studying overseas that were due to travel back found it very difficult doing so without Emirates flights from Nigeria. We travel agents also paid a huge price because if Emirates flights were operating, we would have made money; we wouldn\u2019t have been at the state we are now financially.\n\n\u201cWe give kudos to the federal government and travel agencies. We will now wait for the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to lift the ban on Emirates.\u201d\n\nUAE had made the Rapid Antigen Test compulsory for Emirates Airlines, which was to start administering the test on Nigerian passengers from February 4, 2021.\n\nIn response, the federal government temporarily banned the Middle East carrier, insisting passengers travelling out of Nigeria are only required to have PCR test 72 hours before their flight. The government said it did not have the facilities for the antigen test demanded by Emirates.\n\nFollowing Nigeria\u2019s insistence, Emirates banned its outbound flights from Nigeria and later its in-bound flights, which it had operated for several weeks after the ban on outbound flights.\n\nMeanwhile, for over one week the centre lights at the MMIA runway were unserviceable, prompting the agency to issue Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and provide bar stopper light at each end of the runways to guide pilots to land after dusk.\n\nShin-Aba told THISDAY that the airfield lighting on the runway had been fixed and all airlines could now land their planes at the airport.\n\nHowever, insider sources at FAAN told THISDAY that a temporary measure was put in place to enable flights land, as the second runway, known as Runway 18L (domestic runway), had no airfield lighting for years since its rehabilitation in 2008.\n\nThe status of the runway lighting before it was fixed on Saturday might have prompted British Airways to divert its Lagos flight to Abuja on Friday, but other airlines landed their flights at the airport in Lagos.\n\nThe FAAN regional manager stated, \u201cThe runway lights had been bad since over a week, but FAAN issued NOTAM to notify airlines and pilots globally, so any airline coming to Nigeria knew the problem with the runway.\n\n\u201cBut FAAN installed bar stopper light at the two ends of the runway to guide pilots that wish to land at the runway in the night. This is a big challenge for us because it is not about getting the airport certified; it is about sustaining the standard achieved to earn the certification.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why BA diverted its flight to Abuja, but the airline was aware of the status of the airport even before it left London to Lagos.\u201d\n\nChinedu Eze and Michael Olugbode",

In doing so, we must take realistic and practical decisions, which will positively impact our citizens.\n\n\u201cSome of those decisions, necessarily, will have to do with evolving political and security situations in our sub-region as well as evaluate the health of our organisation with the hope of repositioning to serve our people and sub-region better.\n\n\u201cWhile democracy continues to develop in our sub-region, recent events in Mali are sad reminders that vigilance remains a crucial imperative to protect people\u2019s aspirations to freely choose the form of government they want. Pressures are needed to ensure that the transition process in Mali, which is halfway to its conclusion, is not aborted.\n\n\u201cA further slide in Mali could prove catastrophic to the Sub-region, considering that about half of that country is, unfortunately, under the grip of terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe president appealed to the military leadership in Mali to understand the critical state of their country, which he described as \u201cclearly under siege\u201d.\n\nNoting that the principal responsibility of the military must be to protect and guarantee the sovereignty of the West African country, Buhari cautioned them not to perpetrate acts that could destabilise and destroy their country.\n\n\u201cI urge our organisation to remain engaged with all stakeholders in Mali through our astute mediator, former President Goodluck Jonathan, who, I congratulate warmly for his untiring efforts thus far. I encourage him to sustain these efforts to ensure that the transition is completed as scheduled,\u201d the president added.\n\nOn Libya, Buhari faulted the recent United Nations resolution to expel all foreign fighters in Libya without first ensuring that they were disarmed.\n\nHe stated, \u201cOn the security situation in the region, our organisation must note with serious concern the recent decision by the United Nations and its Resolution to expel all foreign fighters in Libya without, first, ensuring that they are disarmed and that neighbouring countries and the Sub-regions were engaged, to put in place modalities for containing or managing the movement of these fighters.\n\n\u201cWhile this action was aimed at bringing about sustenance of peace in Libya, non-collaboration with regional stakeholders on this critical decision has now created newer threats to peace, security and stability in the region, which could lead to lack of coordinated management of huge humanitarian crisis across the Sahel, North, Central and West Africa, including the Lake Chad region.\u201d\n\nThe president said these regions faced a clear possibility of instability with the invasion of the fully armed foreign fighters.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that ECOWAS leaders, at this Summit, decide how the UN-Sub-regional organisations partnerships should be reviewed to address the dangers that this UN Resolution poses to the region,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe speech by the Nigerian president at the Summit also addressed other issues of concern in the organisation, including the on-going institutional reforms in ECOWAS. He declared Nigeria\u2019s unequivocal support to the reform process, saying he looks forward to an ECOWAS that is \u201cfit for purpose\u201d, delivering services to the satisfaction of the community citizens.\n\nBuhari commended the President of the Commission and his team, the Ad-hoc Ministerial Committee on Institutional Reforms, as well as the Council of Ministers for the excellent report presented to the Authority of Heads of State.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have clearly realised that operating a bloated administration with the current global economic collapse occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic will be to the detriment of services to our people, which is not sustainable. This positive action will certainly enable our organisation move on and deliver services to the satisfaction of our Community citizens.\n\n\u201cLet me remind us that this is only the beginning as the responsibility of streamlining operational costs as well as the modalities for the appointment of statutory positions of the incoming management are still outstanding. It is my view that paying attention to existing regulations that guide the appointment of statutory appointees will further guarantee the efficiency and sustainability of the organisation.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "title": "Nigeria: Anti-graft Chair Bawa Says EFCC Won\u2019t Hand Over Cases to States",
          "text": "Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa, has declared that the commission, under his leadership, would not hand over cases of interest to any state government. Bawa spoke against the backdrop of the setting up of anti-corruption agencies by some states.\n\nLagos, Kano, and Bayelsa states have, recently, set up anti-graft agencies. Some of the states envisage that the EFCC would hand over corruption cases concerning their states to the local anti-corruption commissions.\n\nThe EFCC chairman also denied asking the management teams of banks to declare theirs assets to the commission. He insisted his pronouncement was merely for purposes of eliciting information, as the agency was not empowered to dish out such an order.\n\nSpeaking in an exclusive interview with THISDAY, the EFCC boss stated that as a creation of the National Assembly, the federal agency superseded any similar agency set up by the states.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI am aware that Kano and Bayelsa have started their own anti-corruption agencies. But those laws do not contain anything that says that EFCC has nothing to do with investigating their states, they would rather be complementing what the EFCC is doing.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of Supreme Court decided cases on this particular issue. From the briefing that I have received, those things are already there. The EFCC is a creation of the National Assembly, which, of course, supersedes, when it comes to that. So, there\u2019s already a federal legislation.\n\n\u201cWe are yet to see how the EFCC is going to hand over cases that they are interested in to any state government or see any correspondence to that effect. We are investigating our matters. In that regard, we are making progress.\u201d\n\nBawa also expressed doubt over the capacity of states to handle certain investigations in view of the capital-intensive nature.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhat I can say is that law enforcement is a very, very expensive venture and requires a lot of training and retraining, with trends of crime developing everyday, every second, and you need to catch up with people doing that.\n\n\u201cTake, for instance, issues of money laundering, where, maybe, somebody somewhere has laundered the proceeds of crime, let\u2019s say somewhere in Sokoto and you are in Oyo State or you have property, a lot of things will come up.\n\n\u201cMaybe he has property in America, you need to carry out request, involving mutual legal assistance treaty between, let\u2019s say, Nigeria and America, whether or not the American government will recognise that.\n\n\u201cSo, a lot of things left, right and centre are at play regarding it. It is very, very expensive.\n\n\u201cThen, the issue of capacity. Yes, anybody can develop a capacity to do that. But let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d\n\nAddressing the alleged demand for declaration of assets by bankers, Bawa said it was within the powers of the agency to make such demands.\n\nHowever, he said, \u201cI did not say banks will come and declare their assets to us. It is not within our powers to demand for that. But it is within our powers to demand for information. You and associate (s) without any hindrance or failure must give us information on demand.\n\n\u201cIf you are an individual or corporate entity or company, it is an offence not to comply. That is why we write to individuals, politicians to submit to us so that we will compare, because if you are a suspect, before us, you are expected to even fill our own declaration of assets form here.\u201d\n\nHe explained further, \u201cWe write to CCB, for instance, to furnish us what you declared. Yes, we write them to give us information on what you declared so that we can make comparison.\n\n\u201cWe have our reason for saying that come June 1st, we are going to demand for the declaration of assets. That\u2019s what I said. So, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you have not declared, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you have done anything, but what we said is that we are going to demand for it.\n\n\u201cYou understand this? This is in a 1986 law. It was passed when I was just six years old. Yes, it\u2019s an old law and they are expected to declare their assets annually. So, what we said is that we just need copies of those things, we have already demanded. On June 1st, we wrote to all the banks, the MDS and DMDs should submit copies of their declaration of asset form.\n\nOn accusations that the agency had engaged in media trial of suspects, the EFCC chairman said the commission on his watch had not only conducted diligent investigations but had also contributed significantly to the development of law in Nigeria in the last 15 years.\n\nBawa stated, \u201cNow, rightly or wrongly, the media, once matters are in court, you have the right to go and get the facts \u2013 reporters are always in court to report what has happened. So, you have been accusing us wrongly of this.\n\n\u201cYou did mention something that we do media trial, and then we rush to court. There is no agency of government that has worked and contributed to the development of law in this country in the last 15 years than the EFCC. Nobody has challenged me on that.\n\n\u201cWe go to court. We love going to court. We have 90 per cent to 95 per cent success rate in court on the cases that we have charged. So, it is not about stating the facts and losing cases. Assuming we have 70 per cent success rate in court, is it not an A that you will give us, but as you know, we have over 90 per cent success rate in court.\n\n\u201cBut, of course, we have changed our strategy in that regard as well. And that is why maybe you are not seeing people under investigation being mentioned in the media.\n\n\u201cBut there was never a deliberate attempt, anyway, to do that (media trial). We are just trying to do things by the book but maybe that is the change of strategy that you people have observed. We are working quietly and diligently on cases without necessarily drawing public attention.\u201d\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",

          "text": "Three days after the violent kidnap of more than 80 students, a majority of them girls, and five teachers at the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State, in northwest Nigeria, federal troops late Saturday night were believed to have rescued the rest of the kidnapped victims.\n\nThe troops, THISDAY gathered, were able to rescue the students and their teachers after closing in on the bandits and killings scores of them, before the rest abandoned their hideouts, leaving the victims behind.\n\nSpeculation, however, became rife over the alleged rescue of the students and their teachers, even though details were still unclear as to how the troops ultimately pulled off the rescue operations.\n\nAlthough a day after the raid by the bandits, the military too had moved swiftly, rescuing five students and two teachers, while announcing that one of the students, a female, had died in the forest.\n\nNigerian army spokesperson, Onyema Nwachukwu confirmed that a female student was found dead in the forest by troops tracking the kidnappers, adding that those who were rescued were freed after an exchange of fire in the early hours of Friday.\n\nWith support from the Nigerian Air Force, the troops also reportedly recovered about 800 stolen cattle from the grip of the bandits during the operation, the statement by Nwachukwu claimed.\n\nSo far, no official source could confirm the eventual rescue of the rest of the abducted students and their teachers at the time of filing this report, but a few other sources have confirmed the development, albeit without the requisite details.\n\nOne of the sources contacted early Sunday morning confirmed that the news of their alleged release had been swirling since late Saturday night, but that there was no concrete confirmation from any of the official sources as everyone seemed to have shut down.\n\n\u201cWe heard the news but no one has the details, much less seen any of the students. But the news has been circulating amongst certain class of people, who were confident that the students had been released,\u201d the source stated.\n\nBandits, on Thursday, kidnapped at least 80 students and five teachers from the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State, killing a police officer in the process.\n\nA teacher from the school, Usman Aliyu, said the gunmen took more than 80 students, most of them girls.\n\n\u201cThey killed one of the (police officers), broke through the gate and went straight to the students\u2019 classes,\u201d the teacher reportedly told Reuters, a foreign news medium.\n\nKebbi State police spokesman Nafiu Abubakar, confirmed that the gunmen killed one of their officers during an exchange and also shot a student, who had since been receiving medical treatment at an undisclosed hospital.\n\nThe Kebbi State Police Command further claimed that the vehicle used to convey the kidnapped students and teachers belonged to an unnamed High Court judge in the state.\n\nA resident, Atiku Aboki, who went to the school shortly after the gunfire stopped, said he saw a scene of panic and confusion as people searched for their children.\n\n\u201cWhen we got there, we saw students crying, teachers crying, everyone is sympathising with people,\u201d he also said to Reuters.\n\nThursday\u2019s kidnapping at the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi, marked the third mass abduction from a school in Northwestern part of Nigeria in some weeks, with armed gangs carrying out the kidnappings for ransom.

          "text": "Israel has said the international community should have grave concerns about the election of Iran\u2019s new president-elect, Ebrahim Raisi.\n\nA spokesman for Israel\u2019s foreign ministry, Lior Haiat, said Mr Raisi is Iran\u2019s most extremist president yet. He also warned the new leader will increase Iran\u2019s nuclear activities.\n\nEbrahim Raisi was declared the winner of Iran\u2019s presidential election on Saturday, in a race that was widely seen as being designed to favour him.\n\nMr Raisi, who will be inaugurated in August, is Iran\u2019s top judge and holds ultra-conservative views. He is under US sanctions and has been linked to past executions of political prisoners.\n\nIn a statement following his victory, he promised to strengthen public trust in the government, and be a leader for the entire nation.\n\n\u201cI will form a hard-working, revolutionary and anti-corruption government,\u201d state media quoted him as saying.\n\nHowever in a critical Twitter thread, Israel\u2019s Lior Haiat said he is \u201can extremist figure, committed to Iran\u2019s rapidly advancing military nuclear program\u201d.\n\nIran and Israel have been in a long-running \u201cshadow war\u201d, which has resulted in both countries taking part in tit-for-tat actions, but so far avoiding all-out conflict. Recently, however, the hostilities between the two have escalated again.\n\nThe situation is complex, but one big source of tension is Iran\u2019s nuclear activities.\n\nIran blames Israel for the murder of its top nuclear scientist last year and an attack on one of its uranium enrichment plants in April.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel does not believe that Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is purely peaceful, and is convinced it is working towards building a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which saw harsh penalties lifted on Iran as long as it stopped some nuclear work, collapsed when former US President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, and re-imposed the crippling economic sanctions. The Biden administration is now trying to work out a way to re-enter the deal.\n\nIn response to the sanctions being tightened, Iran stepped up its nuclear activities, and is currently enriching uranium at its highest levels ever \u2013 although still short of what is needed to make nuclear-grade weapons.\n\nCommenting on the election result, the US said it regretted Iranians were \u201cdenied their right to choose their own leaders in a free and fair electoral process\u201d.\n\nVoter turnout was at a record low for this election, with less than 50% of registered voters going to the polls, compared to more than 70% in 2017. Many people shunned the election, believing that it had been engineered in favour of Mr Raisi, who is a staunch ally of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nMr Raisi\u2019s win has come on the same weekend as negotiations to try and save the Iran nuclear deal continue in Vienna.\n\nThe EU has said another formal meeting will take place on Sunday between Iran and the six world powers involved in the deal. This is the sixth round of indirect talks between the US and Iran, and this week officials said the parties remain divided on some key issues, Reuters reported.\n\nIn his Twitter thread, Lior Haiat called Mr Raisi the \u201cbutcher of Tehran\u201d, in reference to the mass execution of thousands of political prisoners in 1988.\n\nMr Raisi was one of four judges, who became known as the \u201cdeath committee\u201d, which allegedly sentenced about 5,000 men and women to death, Amnesty International says. In his tweets, however, Mr Haiat said more than 30,000 people were killed, which is a number also referenced by Iranian human rights groups.\n\nRussia\u2019s Vladimir Putin was quick to congratulate Ebrahim Raisi, highlighting the \u201ctraditionally friendly and good-neighbourly\u201d relationship between the two countries.\n\nThe leaders of Syria, Iraq, Turkey and the UAE sent similar messages of support and congratulations.\n\nA spokesperson for Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza, wished Iran \u201cprogress and prosperity\u201d.\n\nHowever, human rights groups have said Mr Raisi should be investigated for atrocities.\n\n\u201cAs head of Iran\u2019s repressive judiciary, Raisi oversaw some of the most heinous crimes in Iran\u2019s recent history, which deserve investigation and accountability rather than election to high office,\u201d Michael Page from Human Rights Watch said.",
