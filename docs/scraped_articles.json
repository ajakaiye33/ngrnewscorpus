          "text": "Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State has given contractors handling the construction of 1,188-unit LagosHOMS in the Sangotedo area of the state up till the end of October 2021 to complete the project or have their contracts terminated.\n\nSanwo-Olu, who spoke on Friday when he inspected the housing project to assess the pace of construction work, mandated the contractors to finish up the 744 flats being developed in Scheme One of the housing project.\n\nWhile expressing his displeasure over the slow pace of work on the project, he said erring contractors would be sanctioned if they failed to record progress in the next seven days, as the state government had fulfilled its financial obligations in the contract.\n\nThe project, sited on 16.9 hectares, took off in 2012 and was revived by the Sanwo-Olu administration, according to a statement by the governor\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Gboyega Akosile, titled, \u2018Sanwo-Olu Inspects 1,188-unit Sangotedo housing project, sets deadlines for commissioning\u2019.\n\nThe statement added that the first scheme of the project has 62 blocks of 12 flats each, while the second scheme has 32 blocks of 444 flats.\n\nThe governor was quoted as saying, \u201cWe have come on an inspection of this massive construction site that is divided into two phases. The level of work on phase one is over 90 per cent, but this is not the same in the second phase. In the next six weeks, we will be handing over the 744 units in phase one of the project and all contractors working on it must complete their work.\n\n\u201cI commend all contractors that have worked tirelessly to push through; I understand this has been a very difficult project. We have been working day and night, trying to deliver the project. We want to be fair to every contractor and we appreciate those who have shown real resilience and commitment.\n\n\u201cI use this opportunity to give a stern warning to erring contractors slowing down the project. It doesn\u2019t matter who you know; I am not going to tolerate this tardiness any longer. I will give you one week to scale up work on the project. If there is no appreciable improvement, not only are we going to terminate those erring contracts, we will also prosecute them.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu further directed officials of the Ministry of Housing and Ministry of Works and Infrastructure to monitor the contractors and submit progress reports on the project as the report would determine whether the contractors would be considered by the for other projects.\n\nThe governor also set a nine-month deadline for the completion of the project\u2019s Scheme Two and urged those handling the work to complete it before June, 2022.\n\n\u201cI have not come here to turn you away, but to make peace and restitution. For those contractors still working, we will wait for another four more weeks for extensive clean-up before we finally commission the project,\u201d he added.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Governor of Ondo State, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, has said any political party that fields a northern candidate for presidency in 2023 risks losing the support of southerners.\n\nAkeredolu made this known on Friday in an interview on Channels Television monitored by TheCable.\n\nWhile speaking on the resolutions of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum on the 2023 elections and the fact that the presidency must be zoned to the South, Akeredolu, who is the chairman of the forum, said this was for the sake of justice and fairness.\n\nHe argued that when the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), a northerner, completes his second term in 2023, the next president should come from the South.\n\nAkeredolu said, \u201cThere are about three political parties that are in the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, we have the All Progressives Grand Alliance, Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressives Congress. All of us are unanimous in our position that the next president of this country must come from the South.\n\n\u201cFor us, we are unanimous. It (the forum) is not a political platform. I believe that any party that picks somebody from the North would have to face the whole southern region because they will not support it.\n\n\u201cIt has to come from the South. We are saying that there must be what I will call rotation. The justice of it and the fairness in it are what we are preaching. If my president \u2013 President Buhari \u2014 has been in office for eight years, it can\u2019t be from the North. The next president must come from the South.\u201d\n\nWhile replying to critics who said competence should override zoning for the 2023 election, Akeredolu said there were competent persons both in the northern and southern regions.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThere are many people that are competent. We have competent people in the North as we have competent people in the South, so the president can come from any part of the country.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Our Reporter\n\n\u2022 How IPOB leader, PA outsmarted security agents over passport\n\nFresh facts have emerged in Kenya on the moments that led to the arrest in June and subsequent deportation to Nigeria of the leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nKanu\u2019s younger brother, Kingsley, with whom he was conversing on the phone when he was arrested, says the separatist champion was into his second month in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, at the time.\n\nKingsley has now filed a suit in a high court in Kenya seeking a declaration that his brother\u2019s arrest was not in order.\n\nThe younger Kanu also reveals how he and his brother\u2019s Kenyan personal assistant outwitted the Nigerian security agents in their bid to lay their hands on his British passport.\n\nKingsley is suing Kenya\u2019s Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang\u2019i, Director of Immigration Services Alexander Muteshi, Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) boss George Kinoti, the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport\u2019s (JKIA) police boss and Attorney-General Paul Kihara Kariuki over Nnamdi\u2019s alleged abduction and deportation.\n\nThe plaintiff, according to The Nation newspaper of Kenya, claims the IPOB leader had arrived in Kenya from Kigali, Rwanda, in May and was to spend \u201ca few weeks\u201d in Kenya when the country\u2019s security forces allegedly assisted in deporting him.\n\nOn the day of his arrest, he had gone to pick up a friend from JKIA and was on a phone call with his Germany-based brother when he was arrested.\n\n\u201cThe subject (Mr Kanu) was at no time notified that he was classified as a prohibited immigrant in Kenya.\n\n\u201cIf he was, he would not have been granted a visa in the first instance or allowed to exit the airport on arrival.\n\n\u201cHe would have been asked to take the next available flight out of Kenya,\u201d Kingsley says in his petition to the court.\n\nBesides, he says Kanu was in Kenya in furtherance of his campaign for the separation of Biafra from Nigeria.\n\nThe court papers reveal that the IPOB leader had stayed in a furnished apartment within Nairobi\u2019s upscale Kilimani suburb and had hired a Kenyan personal assistant.\n\nIt was the personal assistant who sent Kanu\u2019s British passport to Kingsley in Germany after his arrest and gave details of the last moment before the security swoop.\n\nKingsley says he requested for his brother\u2019s passport to avoid it getting into the hands of the Nigerian authorities, who might use it to claim that the IPOB leader travelled to Nigeria on his own volition.\n\nKingsley is praying the Kenyan court to declare his brother\u2019s arrest and deportation a violation of extradition treaties signed by Kenya.\n\nHe also wants the court to compel the Kenyan government to reveal the circumstances of the arrest and subsequent deportation to Nigeria.\n\nSimilarly, he wants the court to order the government to release the full name and ranks of police officers and any government bureaucrat who participated in the deportation to Nigeria, saying: \u201cEven though the subject (of the court petition) is not a Kenyan citizen, he was entitled to protection by and under the Constitution of Kenya and international human rights law signed and covenanted to be upheld by the government of Kenya.\n\n\u201cEven though the petitioner (Kingsley Kanu) is not a Kenyan, the Constitution of Kenya does not prevent him from moving to the High Court under Article 22 of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nCiting Kanu\u2019s previous encounters with the Nigerian authorities, the plaintiff adds: \u201cThere are concerns that he is currently being tortured in detention in Nigeria. Similar actions by Nigerian authorities against pro-Biafra activists have been widely reported and condemned by international human rights Non-government Organisations as well as the United Nations.\n\n\u201cGiven the history of Nigerian authorities torturing Mr Kanu in detention, there can be no doubt that Mr Kanu is in grave danger and at serious risk of torture while in detention.\u201d\n\nDetails of Kanu\u2019s arrest contained in the court papers show that he was admitted to Nairobi Hospital on May 13, 2021 and discharged the following day.\n\nHe went to the airport to pick up a friend on June 19 and while on a call with his brother, a group of unidentified individuals accosted him.\n\nWhile the drama was unfolding, Kanu had promised to call his brother back, but that was the last time the two would talk.\n\nBut a few days later, Kanu\u2019s Kenyan personal assistant telephoned Kingsley that the separatist leader had not been seen at the Kilimani apartment since June 19.\n\nShe said Nnamdi\u2019s passport was in his apartment which was indicative that he had not planned to travel outside Kenya when he left for JKIA.\n\n\u201cOn or about July 6, 2021 the petitioner requested Ms Gitau to send him Mr Kanu\u2019s passport in fear that the Nigerian authorities would get a hold of it and claim he voluntarily entered Nigeria. The petitioner currently has the passport of Mr Kanu in his possession,\u201d Kingsley Kanu adds.\n\nThe High Court has ordered the government officials to file their responses to the petition, which will be mentioned on October 5, 2021.\n\nThere are concerns in Kenya that Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s deportation may spark a diplomatic spat between Nairobi and London.\n\nKenya has consistently denied having a hand in Kanu\u2019s deportation.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja early in July, the Kenyan High Commissioner to Nigeria, Wilfred Machage, said: \u201cI want to address this allegation by denying that Kenya was involved in the alleged arrest in Kenya and extradition to Nigeria of Mr. Kanu.\n\n\u201cTo us, therefore, these allegations are fictional, imaginary and deliberately concerted to fuel antagonistic feelings among certain section of the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI want to challenge anyone with facts relating to this alleged arrest in Kenya to present those facts. This includes when, where, how and who was particularly involved in the alleged arrest.\u201d\n\nHe said the government and people of Kenya were also disturbed, dismayed and astonished by the unfortunate statement on this alleged arrest in Kenya which was carried in one of the national dailies.\n\n\u201cThe Government of Kenya is particularly appalled by the spurious, derogatory and libelous mention of our dear President on this matter as has been reported,\u201d Machage added.\n\nIn a statement issued by its spokesman Emma Powerful, IPOB had described as \u201cloathsome and distasteful\u201d the silence of the governors of South-East and South-South regions over Kanu\u2019s continued detention by the Nigerian government.\n\nThe group stated that the governors\u2019 attitude justified its position that they were complicit in the extraordinary rendition of the separatist leader orchestrated by the governments of Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cWe the global family of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) ably led by Nnamdi Kanu find loathsome and distasteful, the complacent attitude of South-East and South-South governors and religious leaders over the fate of our leader following his abduction and extraordinary rendition from Kenya to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s baffling that since June 19 that Kanu was abducted in Kenya and brought back to Nigeria in clear violation of international laws, the South-East and South-South governors and religious leaders are yet to openly condemn the act or take any action to register their displeasure with the impunity of the federal government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis criminal silence strongly confirms our earlier understanding and fears that these hypocritical leaders and traitors may be part of our leader\u2019s ordeals. While leaders from other zones are courageously speaking up for their own, governors and religious leaders from South-East and South-South have kept mute for reasons best known to them.\u201d\n\nKanu is currently facing treasonable charges in Abuja. He had earlier jumped bail and fled the country.",

We weren\u2019t happy that they weren\u2019t there themselves but we will not conclude until we find out why. If they have a genuine reason, well\u2026 but if they don\u2019t, we will make our own comment known. For now we are still looking into it.\u201d\n\nAnother Igbo group, the Concerned Igbo Stakeholders Forum (CISF), said there were no justifiable reasons for the governors not to attend a meeting of that magnitude.\n\nIn a chat with journalists in Enugu, the leader of the group, Mr. Chukwuma Okenwa, said it was wrong particularly coming at a time when the region is battling socio-economic and security concerns stemming from the sit-at-home order issued by the proscribed separatist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\n\u201cThe absence of the governors of Abia, Ebonyi, Imo and Anambra states leaves a lot to question the commitment of these governors to the growth and advancement of the South-East in missing a crucial meeting held within their geopolitical zone.\n\n\u201cThe body language of the South-East governors in recent times leaves no one to doubt that these governors have magnified their interest above that of the region and Ndi-Igbo in general.\n\n\u201cTheir gaze at the forthcoming elections in 2023 is becoming an unbearable distraction for them in delivering their mandate to the people,\u201d he said.\n\nA chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chekwas Okorie, expressed disappointment over the governors\u2019 absence, describing it as an embarrassment to well-meaning people from the region. \u201cI am not okay with that development especially when the meeting was brought to the Southeast and the only governor present was the host governor. I expected his colleagues to solidarise with him since he was hosting it on behalf of the Southeast governors but that didn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cBecause of my personal reach to most of them, I will not be quick to make a strong criticism of what happened until I find out why. But whether I am happy with it, I am not. Whether it is practically embarrassing to every well-meaning person from the South east, it is quite embarrassing. I will like to find out what actually happened between now and tomorrow because it is not the right thing. That solidarity ought to be there.\u201d\n\nA human rights activist, Chinedum Amobi, told The Nation that the governors\u2019 absented from the meeting because they were afraid to discuss anti open grazing law.\n\nHe said someone like Obiano, who had not done anything on the open grazing would not want to be questioned by his colleagues on why he\u2019s shying away from it after their meetings in Delta and Lagos respectively\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that Obiano is not interested in the anti-open grazing bill. Apart from Enugu and perhaps, Abia State, the other governors in Southeast are not interested \u201c the activist said\n\nA human rights lawyer, Barr Emperor Ogbonna, said: \u201cMost of the governors of the Southeast stayed away from the meeting of the southern governors\u2019 forum probably because they don\u2019t think that the meeting is worth attending.\n\n\u201cYou know that at the last meeting of the forum they agreed that open grazing is outlawed and that states shall pass anti-open grazing laws.\n\n\u201cHowever, up till today, so many of those states are yet to pass a law outlawing open grazing.\n\n\u201cEven those that passed the law do not have the will power to implement it as we still see cattle grazing in the open and nobody arrests the cows or the herdsmen.\n\n\u201cSo I think that most of those that stayed away might not have seen the need for that forum.\n\n\u201cAlso, the group has been talking about the emergence of a president from the south.\n\n\u201cHowever, with the incidents of defection among the governors to the APC, one doubts whether they would have the political will power to work against their party if the party decides to field a non-Southerner.\n\n\u201cTo me, I don\u2019t think they will go against their party so to me, it appears that they consider the forum a toothless bulldog\n\n\u201cThese governors are more interested in their own political future and any resolution by the forum that may make them be at loggerheads with their parties may not be welcome to them so the absence from the meeting appears to me as deliberate as they do not want to be confrontational to their parties and even, the north controlled federal government, which government may go against them on matters of corruption after their tenure and if a person they do not support emerge.\n\nSo I think they are either playing safe or did not find the meeting relevant.\u201d\n\nReacting, the President General, Coalition of South East Youth Leaders( COSEYL), Goodluck Ibem, said the absence of South East governors at meeting gives a very negative impression of the kind of persons Ndigbo elected as governors .\n\n\u201cIf our governors will be so scared to attend a meeting in their own geo-political zone just because they don\u2019t want to offend their masters in Abuja, it means that Ndigbo are really in trouble. The governors were elected by the people to lead them and not by anyone in Abuja.\n\nThe South East governors should stop this hide and seek game . They must be man enough to protect the interest of their people or resign from office.\n\n\u201cIt is very embarrassing that governors of the zone will be so scared to speak in defense of the people of South East. We will not tolerate this kind of behaviour from our governors next time. They must attend the Southern governors meeting next time or face the wrath of the people, \u201che said.\n\nUmahi tells Southern governors: \u2018be your brother\u2019s keeper\u2019\n\nGovernor David Umahi of Ebonyi state on Friday told other governors in Southern Nigeria that he won\u2019t support their resolution on collection of the Value Added Tax by states.\n\nUmahi was reacting to a resolution of Southern Governor\u2019s Forum during their meeting in Enugu where they called for states to start collecting VAT on Thursday\n\nUmahi, who is the Chairman of the South-East Governors\u2019 Forum, spoke on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Sunrise Daily\u2019 breakfast programme.\n\nVAT is a consumption tax paid when goods are purchased and services are rendered. It is charged at a rate of 7.5 per cent.\n\nRivers and Lagos states governments had moved to start the process of collecting VAT within their territories before they were halter by the Court of Appeal in a ruling on September 10.\n\nThe court ordered a status quo pending the determination of an appeal filed by the Federal Inland Revenue Service against the judgment of the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt.\n\nThe Nation gathered that Ogun State has also started the process of passing a bill on VAT in its House of Assembly.\n\nThe Southern Governors\u2019 Forum led by Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), reading a communiqu\u00e9 at the end of a meeting on Thursday had said, \u201cThe meeting resolved to support the position that the collection of VAT falls within the powers of the states.\u201d\n\nBut Umahi said his stand on the issue has not changed despite the resolution of the Forum.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn any gathering, the minority will have their say and the majority will have their way. For example, there was an issue that came up. I\u2019m not sure it is clear to some of our colleagues on the issue of VAT but it is very clear to me.\n\n\u201cWe (Ebonyi) took a stand as a state with our leaders on the issue of the VAT war that is going and so my deputy carried it on to say that this is what my governor is saying and this is what the state is saying and he went ahead to explain with some other deputies that represented their governors.\n\n\u201cBut together they were in the minority and it didn\u2019t stop the majority from coming up with their communiqu\u00e9. When it comes up to implementation and voicing out, I will continue to say: this is where is I stand; if it is a choice, I will choose what would benefit my state.\u201d\n\nUmahi also said every state in the country is dependent on each other as each state has one thing it is lacking that it gets from another state.\n\n\u201cWhen they (Southern governors) say that this VAT collection is part of true restructuring, I said I never believe in total restructuring; I believe in administrative restructuring,\u201d he said.\n\nUmahi warned that a change to the status quo in VAT collection will lead to a collapse of many states in the country.\n\nHe said it was not right that some states would \u201ceat and have so much surplus and then some other states don\u2019t have much to eat.\n\n\u201cWe have to be our brothers\u2019 keeper; we have to see how we can grow the economies of the weakest states, otherwise, we will breed insecurity in those states.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no way in a relationship that you will get 100 per cent of what you put in, it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d\n\n\u201cI have said that my state would not be viable and I will continue to say that more than 30 other states would not be viable; we should not break the states.\n\n\u201cWhatever thing we are doing, we have to think about the nation first. Let\u2019s tarry a while and see how we can pass this river and then we can come to the fact of who is right and who is wrong.\n\n\u201cTrue federalism is not done in a day. If we want to do a restructuring, we have to have a gradual process to do that.\u201d\n\nGovernorship campaign stopped Obiano, deputy from attending meeting\n\nThe November 6 governorship campaign in Anambra State was the reason why Governor Willie Obiano and his Deputy, Dr Nkem Okeke did not attend the Southern governors meeting in Enugu Thursday, The Nation learnt\n\nA source close to the government House Awka, who did not want to be quoted, told The Nation that the two had been engaged in making sure their party retains the governorship seat\n\nWhen The Nation contacted both the Chief Press Secretary to Obiano James Eze and the Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, C Don Adinuba, they said they were not in the know.\n\nBut one of the government officials, who pleaded anonymity, told The Nation that both men were neck deep in campaigns to make sure Prof Charles Soludo succeeds Obiano\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cthat meeting was never Obiano\u2019s priority and the Southern governors should know that Anambra election is almost at hand\n\n\u201c And other parties are doing everything possible for APGA to lose it, just to humiliate the governor\n\n\u201cSo, the governor doesn\u2019t want to give any one such opportunity. He\u2019s only interested in making Soludo governor and I think it was the major reason why he did not go or send his deputy, \u201c the source said.\n\nThe Chief Press Secretary to Imo State governor, Hope Uzodimma, Oguwike Nwachuku, said that the absence of the governor could be because of exigency of the office. \u201cThat is why there is the office of the Deputy Governor. Duties can take the governor out of the state, he can then delegate the assignment to the deputy governor.\u201d\n\nSources within the corridors of power in Abia State who would not want their names mentioned claimed that why Abia State governor was absent from the meeting in Enugu State was because he was out of the country some weeks before the meeting was scheduled.",

          "text": "By Jide Orintunsin, Gbade Ogunwale, Abuja; Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt\n\n\u2022 \u2018Plot to make Jonathan president conspiracy against South\u2019\n\n\u2022 PDP targeting 28 states, presidency, says Fintiri\n\nThe ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that it has not granted an automatic ticket to former President Goodluck Jonathan who is being rumoured to be planning to defect to the party ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nA founding member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the South-south, Chief Chukwuemeka Eze, also described alleged scheme by some northern leaders to return the former President to Aso Rock in 2023 as deceitful and a grand conspiracy against the South.\n\nOn its part, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has vowed to reclaim power at the centre come 2023, adding that the party would also win 28 of the 36 states across the federation.\n\nThe APC said the waiver granted new entrants and defectors into the party does not exclude them from undergoing nomination processes of contesting for positions in the party and as its flag bearers in general elections.\n\nAPC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) Secretary, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, made the declaration in a statement in Abuja yesterday.\n\nHe said defection into the party by any person does not confer the status of an automatic candidate of the party on such individual.\n\nAkpanudoedehe, who was reacting to a misrepresentation of his views on the waiver granted new entrants and defectors by the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) at its December 8, 2020 meeting in a television programme, said all party members, irrespective of the status of the person, must go through the party\u2019s nomination process as outlined in its constitution.\n\nHe maintained that the waiver by NEC was not restricted to anyone.\n\nAccording to the Secretary, \u201cthe waiver is not specific to anyone as being misconstrued and misrepresented in some sections.\n\n\u201cComing into the party gives no one special status of being an automatic party candidate in any election. All aspirants must undergo the nomination processes outlined by the APC constitution,\u201d he said.\n\nAkpanudoedehe recalled that the party\u2019s NEC resolved and granted waivers to persons who have recently joined the party and those desirous of joining the party in the nearest future to contest for positions in the APC and as party flag bearers in general elections.\n\nHe explained that by the NEC resolution, \u201cnew members will enjoy all the benefits and privileges accruable by the APC\u201d but not the status of automatic candidate of the party.\n\nAccording to the Secretary: \u201cFor the records, in my recent television interview reaction to the rumoured plans by former President Goodluck Jonathan to join the APC, my statement was that NEC resolution was a blanket waiver to ALL new APC entrants, including the interviewee.\n\n\u201cThe waiver is not specific to anyone as being misconstrued and misrepresented in some sections.\n\n\u201cComing into the party gives no one special status of being an automatic party candidate in any election. All aspirants must undergo the nomination processes outlined by the APC constitution,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Plot to make Jonathan President deceitful, conspiracy against South\u2019\n\nA South-south founding member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Chukwuemeka Eze, described the ongoing scheme by some northern leaders to return former President Jonathan to Aso Rock in 2023 as deceitful and a grand conspiracy against the South.\n\nEze, in a statement in Port Harcourt yesterday, said the plot was a packaged trick by some northern leaders to make Jonathan President for one term and retake power in 2027 thereby denying the southern part of the country a complete term of eight years.\n\nEze said that the northern schemers knew that with President Muhammadu Buhari successfully completing his second term by 2023, the South, in all honesty and fairness, would produce the next President.\n\nBut to truncate a southern eight-year rule, the schemes intended to feature Jonathan for one tenure in 2023 thereby throwing the 2027 presidential election open for a fresh zoning arrangement and contest favourable to the North.\n\nEze urged all Nigerians to speak up and condemn such a dastardly act that might plunge the nation into unprecedented chaos.\n\nThe APC chief, however, claimed that Jonathan had rejected the plan, describing the former President\u2019s rejection as consolatory.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis plot is an unacceptable insult on both Jonathan and the entire southern political class as if we lack credible political leaders from the South that can turn the fortunes of this country around.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to commend Dr. Jonathan for reading through the deceit of these leaders, trashing their dishonest entreaty and ensuring that his political feats and present status as a great promoter of democracy is not ruined, tarnished but kept intact by keeping these undemocratic elements at bay.\n\n\u201cI am very glad that Dr. Jonathan has done his best to keep these undemocratic forces at bay, who are hell-bent to deny the South the chance to preside over the affairs of this country according to the terms of power rotation between the North and the South, not minding that the northerners have through the military and democratic dispensations governed this country to their heart contents.\n\n\u201cFunny and sad enough, same leaders who ensured that Dr. Jonathan was not reelected in 2015 are the same crop of leaders that are doing everything to lure him back to finish whatever that is left of him politically.\n\n\u201cAs much as I am not a supporter or sympathiser of Dr. Jonathan and his type of politics, as I was one of those who ensured he was not reelected, I will not sit and allow his haters drain the little integrity left of him.\n\n\u201cLuring him to contest the 2023 does not in any way wash him off the sins and reasons behind why he was not reelected in 2023, but a careful ploy to portray the Southerners as lacking better and credible leaders to improve on the fortunes of the country.\u201d\n\nEze also commended Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State for insisting that he would not support Jonathan if he decided to contest the 2023 general election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nEze said if Jonathan allowed himself to be fooled by those luring him, he would face the worst political defeat in 2023.\n\nHe advised Jonathan not to allow himself to be used as an object of division and tension in the country, appealing to him to continue to enjoy his 2015 feat, which earned him an international figure.\n\nPDP targeting 28 states, presidency, says Fintiri\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday vowed to reclaim power at the centre come 2023, saying that the party would also win 28 of the 36 states across the federation.\n\nThe declaration was made in Abuja by Adamawa State governor Ahmadu Fintiri shortly after the inauguration of the party\u2019s Convention Organising Committee at the PDP national secretariat.\n\nFintiri boasted that the PDP would not only win the presidency but would also re-enact it\u2019s pre-2019 standing by winning 28 states.\n\nAccording to him, the upcoming October convention of the PDP would be the starting point for the party to return to power in 2023, adding: \u201cSo I believe, by 2023, we are going to have about 28 governors and the President.\u201d\n\nFintiri said the present team of National Working Committee (NWC) has done very well, contrary to claims by some interests within the party that the team failed to perform.\n\nHe justified his position by saying that the Uche Secondus led NWC moved the PDP from the 10 states it met pre-2019 general election to 17 after the election, \u201cbefore we were robbed of four states\u201d.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cThe present leadership has done very well. They have taken this party from 10 governors to about 17 governors before we were robbed at the time.\u201d\n\nStating the state of preparedness of his 279-member committee, the governor assured that the committee would deliver the best convention in the history of the PDP, considering the calibre of members.\n\nAddressing the committee members earlier, Fintiri said: \u201cI count on all your experiences to give this convention the direction it deserves. We are in an extraordinary time, and we expect to have an extraordinary National Working Committee after this convention.\n\n\u201cThis is what Nigerians expect from us. That will be the takeoff point for this party going into 2023 election.\u201d\n\nHe, however, added that the success of his committee would depend on the timely delivery by the party\u2019s Zoning Committee, chaired by the Enugu State governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi.\n\nHe said: \u201cI call on the zoning committee to work and conclude its assignment latest by the end of next week, so that we can start our job. It is not an order, but that is what we least expect from you by end of Friday next week.\n\n\u201cRound off your job so that those who are interested in contesting and occupying these very important positions in our party will start criss-crossing Nigeria. Nigeria is not a small country. Nigeria is a very big country that needs time to go round and sell themselves.\u201d\n\nStating that he had gathered enough experience from previous conventions, Fintiri said the upcoming convention would be a clear departure from previous ones, adding that more technology would be deployed in the exercise.\n\nThe governor said the possibility of having consensus candidates from states could not be ruled out, as candidates would not be forced on any elective position.\n\n\u201cIf a position is zoned to a particular state, and they so decide to field just one person, we cannot say because we want to have competition in the convention and force them into competitive election.\n\n\u201cWe assure you that we are going to conduct one of the freest and fairest conventions which will be the take off for our party for 2023,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the limited time frame for the convention would not be a challenge, assuring that there would not be shift in date.\n\n\u201cWe are equal to the task. The time is barely enough, but we are adequately preparing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any reason for any shift. We have written to INEC (Independent National Electoral Commission) and we have virtually gotten the approval of the venue. So what stops us from giving the best NWC at the end of October?\u201d he stated.\n\nWhile inaugurating the committee, the Acting National Chairman of the PDP, Elder Yemi Akinwonmi, called on leaders and members of the organising committee to not only sustain but also to improve upon what the party delivered in the 2017 Port Harcourt convention.\n\n\u201cI call on the Chairman (Fintiri), his deputy, secretary and other members of the committee to close ranks made sure that their watchword remains success at the end of the event,\u201d Akinwonmi said.\n\nAlso, the Chairman, Board of Trustees (BoT), Senator Walid Jibrin, in his address, said the party\u2019s reconciliation committee, led by a former Senate President, David Mark, had gone far in its assignment and that its job would be concluded in the shortest possible time.\n\nOn his part, the House of Representatives Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu, said the upcoming convention would engender strategic repositioning of the PDP in its determination to \u201crescue and take back our nation from the stranglehold and misrule of the All Progressives Congress (APC) led federal government.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe APC led government has compromised our national security and is now superintending over escalated bloodletting, terrorism and unrelenting acts of banditry to the extent that mass killing is becoming a new normal in our country.\n\n\u201cThis is because their (Nigerians) only hope of returning to a life of peace, security, national cohesion and economic prosperity is in returning the PDP to power come 2023.\u201d",

Eches Divine Eches, stated these in an interview with journalists in Abuja ahead of its 45th anniversary and founder\u2019s day scheduled for today in Owerri, Imo State.\n\nHe predicted that the rising insecurity in the north may consume the entire nation since government has not been sincere in checking the activities of bandits that have been unleashing terror on the masses.\n\nHe, thus, advised government to caution Sheik Gumi whose utterances, he claimed, have emboldened the bandits, thereby, promoting their inhumane acts in northern region.\n\nHe insisted that except drastic measures are put in place to curtail Almajiri phenomenon, banditry would remain in the north for a long time with devastating effects on socio-economic life.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou can\u2019t have Almajiri system of life and government in the last 40 years in our nation bringing up people without any trace to families, hometowns or nationalities. These children are scattered all over the streets without you knowing that someday they would leave the street and go to the bush where they would begin to do the trade of kidnapping.\n\n\u201cAlso, you can\u2019t, in a sane nation, have the likes of Sheikh Gumi, a religious scholar, going about promoting banditry and you don\u2019t think that this will continue. Yet, that is what we are seeing today. We are not seeing anything more than what we have planted.\n\n\u201cWe allowed this thing (insecurity) to continue and it is now going to consume the nation, if drastic measures are not put in place to take them (Almajiri) out of the streets. Give them a sense of belonging, put them in school, and help them realise their potentials.\n\n\u201cThese bandits were the Almajiri who used to be in front of our houses and begging. Howbeit, we are praying and that is why God is still sustaining our nation. I trust God will continue to sustain us in Jesus name.\u201d\n\nOn the 45th anniversary, Eches said the programme was necessary because it would provide opportunity to remember the labour of past heroes, including over 250 retired church leaders and indigent youths and women across the 27 LGAs in Imo State, who were weak and retired.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

It, however, said the one million march in New York had nothing whatsoever to do with IPOB.\n\nIts chairman, Prof Banji Akintoye, made the clarification in his response to allegation by presidential spokesperson, Garba Garba Shehu, that it was shocking that Yoruba nation advocates were throwing their lot in with IPOB, a designated terrorist organisation, and that they would be judged by the company they kept.\n\nAkintoye, in a statement by his communications manager, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye replied: \u201cWe want to put it on record that IPOB is not in any way involved in the ongoing March in New York. The IPOB banner you saw was obviously planted by agents of the Nigerian government, masquerading as members of NINAS for photo shots which we have since unraveled and checkmated.\n\n\u201cWe say to the presidency that the unintelligent attempt to cause frictions and divisions between the Yoruba people in the West and the Igbo in the East is dead on arrival. We shall continue to collaborate peacefully for the salvation of our people\u2026\n\n\u201cWe shall resume the March on September 24, opposite the United Nations Headquarters to tell President Muhammad Buhari to his face that his Miyyetii Allah people are the enemy number one of the people of South and Middle-Belt of Nigeria and they are the authentic terrorists.\u201d\n\nAkintoye stated that the peaceful demonstration has succeeded in exposing to the world, the perceived ongoing genocide and fraud being perpetrated by the Fulani-controlled Nigerian government against the peoples of the South and Middle-Belt Regions of the country, through the imposed 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe renowned historian said rather than losing sleep and temper over the march, \u201cthe Nigerian government should, without further delay, declare Miyyetii Allah a terrorist organisation as being demanded by NINAS, saying, \u201cthe real terrorists in Nigeria are operating under Miyyetii Allah. Our demand remains conduct of a referendum so that the Indigenous people of the South and Middle-Belt of Nigeria can lawfully and legally decide on their nationhood and sovereignty. We demand for the immediate abolition of the imposed 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cWe demand an end to the genocide, being perpetrated by Miyyetii Allah against our people.

T. Muhammad, at its 95th Meeting held on September 15 and 16, 2021, in line with the principles of fair hearing, has directed the three Judges of coordinate jurisdiction who granted Exparte Orders over the same case with the same subject matter to appear before a special Investigation Committee constituted by the Council in order to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against them for such act\u201d, he said.\n\nHe added that the Council resolved to set up a Medical Board in order to ascertain the health status of Justice Amina Yaroson of Kaduna State Customary Court of Appeal.\n\n\u201cCouncil also considered the Reports of its Investigation Committee and decided to issue a warning letter to Hon. Justice Sobere Biambo of High Court of Rivers State for descending into the Arena of conflict in a matrimonial Suit No: OHC/IMC/2018.\n\n\u201cCouncil at its Plenary considered the Reports of the two Preliminary Complaints Assessment Committees (PCAC) on the petitions written against 18 Judicial Officers and on the recommendation of the Committee, issued a letter of advice to Hon\u201d, the statement read in part.\n\nIt noted that Justice Elias O.

          "text": "Canvasses stiffer penalties for coup plotters\n\nECOWAS demands return to democratic rule in six months\n\nTo freeze financial assets of military junta\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nNigeria has asked the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to ensure immediate return of democratic rule to Guinea after the recent military coup.\n\nIt stressed the need for a short transition programme that will usher in a new civilian government in the country.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo who stood in for President Muhammadu Buhari made Nigeria\u2019s position known in Accra, Ghana during the Extraordinary Summit of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS member-states on the political situation in the Republics of Guinea and Mali.\n\nAt the last summit of ECOWAS leaders held virtually on September 8, Nigeria, had condemned the coup de\u2018tat in Guinea, calling for an unconditional release of President Alpha Conde, and for stringent measures on Guinea\u2019s military junta.\n\nSpeaking at the Accra summit, Osinbajo restated Nigeria\u2019s position, urging for the unconditional release of President Cond\u00e9 and calling for more pressure on the country\u2019s military leaders to return the nation to democratic rule.\n\n\u201cIt is also important that ECOWAS should simply insist that there should be an immediate return to civil rule.\u201d\n\nCalling for more stringent measures to be taken by the sub-regional body, the Vice President said \u201cwe must make sure that sanctions by ECOWAS achieve the intended objectives\u201d.\n\nHe restated the call to engage global bodies and Africa\u2019s development partners in taking steps to prevent such unconstitutional change of government in countries on the continent.\n\n\u201cIn this connection, I think we should engage all well-meaning stakeholders including the Africa Union, European Union, United Nations, developmental partners, and financial institutions to join in taking more stringent measures by imposing travel bans and freezing of offshore financial assets of the coupists and their collaborators to ensure that they do return the country to democracy immediately,\u201d Osinbajo said.\n\nNigeria again demanded the unconditional release of President Conde and respect for his physical integrity, with the Vice President urging leaders in the sub-region to also insist on a civilian-led transition.\n\nWhile noting that although the military junta in Guinea had started consultation with critical stakeholders towards transitioning the country to civil rule, Osinbajo reiterated Nigeria\u2019s stance, condemning military intervention and unconstitutional change of government in the West African country.\n\nHe therefore, called on the junta \u201cto transparently restore constitutional order without delay,\u201d adding that \u201csuch a process should be led by a civilian.\n\n\u201cWhile we condemn the development in Guinea, and affirm that no matter how popular the grievance against an elected leadership may be, the forceful seizure of power is an unacceptable assault on the dignity of a free people and their right to freely elect their leaders. We nevertheless must strongly urge all ECOWAS Member States to respect the principles of democracy and the constitutions of our respective countries.\u201d\n\nOn the update of the situation in Mali, the Vice President again commended former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan \u201cfor his continued commitment and engagement with the various stakeholders in Mali.\u201d\n\nHe commended the efforts of stakeholders in resolving the situation in Mali and restated the call of leaders of the sub-region to the Malian transition government to strictly respect and follow the electoral time table for transition to civil rule.\n\n\u201cI further call for the continued support and collaboration of all major players in the country\u2019s March towards a successful transition\u201d.\n\nAssuring that Nigeria will continue to closely monitor the situation in Guinea, Osinbajo pledged Nigeria\u2019s support in ensuring that only democratic processes are adopted in changing governments in the sub-region.\n\nAt the end of the extraordinary meeting, the ECOWAS leaders resolved to freeze the financial assets of members of the military junta, place a travel ban on them, while also demanding that the junta return Guinea to constitutional rule within six months.\n\nAccording to a communique issued at the end of the meeting: \u201cAfter consideration of the Report and subsequent deliberations, the Authority decides as follows: to uphold the suspension of Guinea from all ECOWAS governing bodies until the restoration of constitutional order; to ensure the conduct of presidential and legislative elections within six months in order to restore constitutional rule in the Republic of Guinea; to impose sanctions, in accordance with extant ECOWAS Protocols, of travel bans on the members of the CNRD (the Guinean military junta) and their family members and to freeze their financial assets.\u201d\n\nHighlighting Nigeria\u2019s position further, ECOWAS also called \u201con the African Union, the European Union, the United Nations, and other multilateral and bilateral partners to support the implementation of these sanctions; to ensure that no member of the CNRD is allowed to contest in the presidential election.\u201d\n\nECOWAS noted that it would also assist Guinea in the swift resolution of the crisis and in the preparations for the elections.\n\nThe extraordinary session was chaired by President of Ghana and Chair of the ECOWAS, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Resume Work Immediately, Court Orders Striking Doctors",
          "text": "Says no amount of monetary compensation can bring lost lives\n\nBy Alex Enumah\n\nIn what seems to be a U-turn from Wednesday\u2019s proceedings, Justice Bashar Alkali of the National Industrial Court, Abuja Division, came down hard on striking doctors, ordering them to halt their six weeks old industrial action and return to work immediately.\n\nThe doctors under the platform of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) have been on strike since August 1, 2021 to protest poor condition of work as well as some unfair government policies.\n\nThey have vowed never to return to work until the federal government meets their demands.\n\nHowever, Justice Alkali, while ruling on an interlocutory injunction brought against the striking doctors by the federal government held that their action at this time of increase of the COVID-19 pandemic was not in the interest of the country and Nigerians.\n\nHe accordingly ordered NARD to suspend its strike with immediate effect and that its members should resume to their duty post immediately.\n\nThe order is coming barely few days after the striking workers and the federal appeared to have been working towards an amicable resolution of the issues surrounding the industrial action.\n\nIt should be recalled that the court had last month ordered parties to cease hostilities pending the hearing of the federal government\u2019s suit against the doctors.\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s proceedings, lawyer to the federal government, Mr Tochukwu Maduka, had informed the court that he had filed a case of contempt against NARD.\n\nHe said, \u201cDespite the order of this court that all hostilities be suspended, the defendants who render essential services have refused to call off the strike\u201d.\n\nResponding, lawyer to the striking doctors, Mr Femi Falana, SAN, had told the court that he had filed a further affidavit in support of notice for stay of execution.\n\nFalana further stated that he was challenging the jurisdiction of the court to hear the matter.\n\nHe however, stated that parties should go back to the negotiation table, adding that it is in line with the order to suspend hostility.\n\n\u201cWe can resume today or even tomorrow if a decision is reached,\u201d he had said.\n\nWith this understanding Justice Alkali consequently adjourned to Friday for parties to report to the court whatever understanding or agreement reached towards resolution of the crisis.\n\nBut it appeared this was not the case on Friday, as Mr Maduka, urged the court for an order directing the defendant to suspend the strike pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.\n\nThis request was however opposed by lawyer representing NARD, Mr Robinson Ariyo, who claimed that granting such an order would infringe upon the right to life of members of his client, especially under the conditions of the pandemic.\n\nAriyo further claimed that members of the NARD were persons entitled to emergency rights under the Corona Virus Disease COVID-19 Protection Regulations and other related best practices in connection with the mental and physical health of its members.\n\nBut in its ruling, the court agreed with the federal government that continuation of the strike would cost the country and accordingly ordered NARD to suspend the strike and call back its members to work.\n\nAccording to him, the applicants were \u201cable to show that unless this application is granted, so many Nigerians will lose their lives most especially as the country is experiencing an upsurge in this third wave of COVID-19 with increasing fatality arising from the absence of the defendants from hospitals\u201d.\n\nThe judge further expressed strong belief that \u201cIf the court does not intervene at this stage, there is no amount of money that can compensate the lives of Nigerians who would lose their lives if the members of the defendants continue with their strike.\u201d\n\nWhile he observed that parties ought to have suspended all hostilities since the matter was brought to court, he said he found merit in the application of the federal government and accordingly resolved the lone issue for determination in her favour.\n\n\u201cI grant all the prayers as contained in the face of the motion paper and in effect, I hereby grant an order of interlocutory injunction that members of the defendant/ respondent in all the states of the federation are hereby restrained from continuing with the industrial action embarked on since on the second day of August 2021 pending the determination of the substantive suit.\n\n\u201cAlso, I hereby order all members of the defendants/respondents in all the states of the federation to suspend the said industrial action commenced on the second day of August 2021 with immediate effect and to resume work immediately pending the determination of the substantive suit\u201d, Justice Alkali held.\n\nShare

          "text": "China\u2019s leading ride-hailing company, Didi will be launching in Nigeria soon.\n\nFounded in 2012, Didi is China\u2019s dominant ride-hailing service, with 550 million annual active users globally. It operates in 17 countries, recently launching in South Africa, Ecuador, and Kazakhstan.\n\nA job listing on Linkedin suggests that the company, which launched in South Africa in March, is looking to recruit a Driver Center Manager in Lagos, Nigeria. The first of many steps it\u2019s taking as it prepares to expand to the Nigerian market.\n\nOutside of this opening, Didi is currently recruiting for a number of positions around the world, with the only other African job openings being in South Africa.\n\nPer NYT, on average, 156 million people a month used Didi in China in the first quarter of 2021, compared with 98 million for Uber worldwide. Didi handled 25 million rides a day in China during that period while Uber globally did 16 million. Note that those numbers do not include Didi\u2019s services in Latin America, Japan, Russia, and beyond.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nDespite Didi\u2019s growing dominance in the ride-hailing scene, there are questions around whether it can continue its global expansion as it feels the ripple effects of increased regulatory pressure at home.\n\nIn July, Didi\u2019s much anticipated US IPO was blundered after the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) announced that it was investigating Didi\u2019s handling of customer data and ordered the removal of the app from mobile app stores in China. Since then, the ride-hailing company\u2019s shares have fallen more than 50% below its IPO price.\n\nLast month, Didi also delayed plans to expand to Britain and Europe, partly due to political and regulatory challenges.\n\nCompeting in Nigeria\u2019s ride-hailing landscape\n\nDidi expands by employing a race to the bottom approach that requires tons of capital.\n\nCompetition among rideshare apps is already fierce in Nigeria.\n\nRide-hailing companies Bolt and Uber, which arrived in Nigeria in 2014 and 2016 respectively occupy an increasingly important role in the transportation system in many Nigerian states. In terms of operations, these two companies have taken a different approach as Uber operates only in major commercial cities like Lagos, Abuja, and Port-Harcourt while Bolt operates in more cities including smaller ones like Abia, Ebonyi, and Enugu.\n\nThese two ride-hailing companies have faced a few hurdles in Nigeria, notably unfavorable regulatory policies and protests from drivers.\n\nEarlier in the year, under the umbrella of the Professional E-hailing Drivers and Partners Association (PEDPA), Uber and Bolt drivers in Lagos went on strike protesting the unrealistic fare prices and the high commission rates. In response to this strike, the two companies Uber increased their prices.\n\nJust like its South African market, Didi might want to introduce different classes of services to suit different customers based on their needs and financial capacity.\n\nThe ride-hailing startup firm is already out pricing and out advertising its competitors in South Africa through partnerships with local radio station 947 and Didi ride voucher giveaways.\n\nIt offers three services: DiDi Go which is the low-cost option for customers with low financial capacity; DiDi Express which is the standard service for those seeking to balance price and comfort; DiDi XL which is for people who need more space, with a capacity of up to seven seats.\n\nUsing the hashtag #YourNewRideHasArrived Twitter user Reabetswe recalled her first ride with Didi writing:\n\n\u201cAs a young woman and a student in South Africa, @didi_south is an affordable ride\u2026my ride was the safe ride I have experienced in my life\u201d.\n\nShe followed her tweet with screenshots of receipts from her $1.03, 3.9-kilometer journey, a ride that would have cost $2.57 without discounts.\n\nIn Nigeria, a race to the bottom approach appears to be Didi\u2019s best option in the midst of already fierce competition.\n\nAlexandria Williams contributed to this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "On September 7, Africell announced its decision to leave Uganda after operating in the East African country for seven years. The decision saw the U.S-owned company become the latest network operator to throw in the towel and exit a market dominated by two pan-African telecom behemoths.\n\nA statement issued by Africell blames tough competition from the local units of MTN and Bharti Airtel, both of which account for more than 90% of the market share. The remaining 10% is split between three or four other nationwide operators including Africell and Uganda Telecom.\n\nSouth Africa-based MTN Group, Africa\u2019s largest telecoms operator, entered Uganda in 1998 and has since established dominance in the market; largely due to first-mover advantage and significant investments the business has made in Uganda.\n\nAirtel, which launched 12 years later, has mainly relied on acquisitions to scale its market position. After entering Uganda through the purchase of Zain\u2019s operations, the company, in 2013, fully acquired Warid Telecom for $100 million; the first-ever in-country acquisition in the sector that increased Airtel\u2019s subscriber base by over 50%.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWith operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), The Gambia, and Sierra Leone, Africell launched in Uganda in 2014 after buying the local operations of French telecom giant, Orange.\n\nAt the time of the acquisition, 8 operators were serving a population of around 36 million Ugandan residents, with total subscriptions estimated at less than 20 million. It appeared Africell was entering an untapped market and the company bet on data services to eat into the market share of incumbents.\n\n\u201cWhen entering new markets, Africell\u2019s objective is always to introduce competition in a manner that benefits local consumers and communities,\u201d Sam Williams, the firm\u2019s communications director told TechCabal. \u201cIn Uganda, our goal was to provide an appealing alternative to the incumbent duopoly, by focusing (among other things) on fast and reliable data services.\u201d\n\nAfricell is reputed for its affordable internet service packages and relative network stability in Uganda, which saw it gain the trust of a substantial number of subscribers. But like its predecessors, the company struggled to make a notable impact in a mobile market reputedly hostile to new entrants.\n\nThe perils of playing third fiddle\n\nThe economics of being number three on the telecoms players list in a relatively small and saturated market makes little commercial sense for Africell or any potential entrant.\n\nUganda has over 24 million mobile subscribers with MTN controlling 50% of the market while Airtel Uganda accounts for 43%. This means newcomers are forced to share in a limited pool of subscribers left over by the leaders.\n\nFor instance, other telecom players in South Africa apart from MTN and Vodacom have struggled to make consistent profits. MTN also decided against reapplying for a license in Ethiopia, to avoid trailing behind Ethio Telecom and Safaricom.\n\nAccording to Williams, Africell \u201cbuilt a strong position\u201d in Ugandan urban centers already dominated by its competitors. However, a wider rollout to underserved areas would have required a significant longer-term investment that would have been difficult to recover given the size of Africell\u2019s market share.\n\n\u201cIn a market where two incumbents control that much market share already, it\u2019s definitely going to be very challenging for other operators to break in,\u201d Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer, told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cTelecommunications is capital intensive. Masts, towers, fibre, and data centres do not come cheap. Without a significant number of subscribers, it\u2019s going to be hard to recoup returns on investment.\u201d\n\nAn Africell Shop in Uganda. Image credit: Techjaja\n\nOrange invested significantly in new technologies before deciding to cut short its losses. Since it entered Uganda via a shareholding agreement with HiTS Telecom in 2009, the French firm was only able to get around 700,000 subscribers \u2013 roughly 3.3% of the market share at the time.\n\nAfricell claims to have grown the inherited number of subscribers to about 2.3 million within seven years, becoming the country\u2019s third-largest player, according to data available on the firm\u2019s website.\n\nHowever, data from Omdia shows that figure is closer to 1.6 million, some way off the pace compared to almost 15 million subscribers for MTN and 12.8 million for Airtel. It\u2019s also reportedly been losing its share of the market slowly, which fell from about 7% at the end of 2019 to 5% at the end of June 2021.\n\n\u201cWe decided to end operations following a careful analysis of how the Uganda business fits into our overall Africell Group strategy,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s a recognition of the fact that \u2013 in our view \u2013 investment in our other markets is a more sustainable route to our goal of advancing the African telecoms sector.\u201d\n\nA flurry of exits\n\nAfricell hasn\u2019t been the only victim of MTN and Airtel Uganda\u2019s dominance. Before Africell\u2019s decision to pack, at least four other players have either exited or been bought out by bigger players after failing to break into the inner circle of the market.\n\nIn addition to the acquisition of Warid, which at the time was the third-largest player and had offered the biggest threat to the MTN-Airtel duopoly, K2 Telecom\u2019s operation was absorbed by Airtel in 2018.\n\nSmart Telecom exited the market in August of this year; and Vodafone, with all its solid financial backing, could only challenge for three years before it eventually quit.\n\nWith Africell\u2019s exit, only three major network providers currently operate in Uganda, a landlocked country with a population of over 44 million people.\n\nWhat next for Africell?\n\nWhile it struggled to grow its market share, Africell also grappled with high operating costs and debt burden, part of which was inherited from Orange. In 2019, the company\u2019s losses reportedly rose to over Ksh1.5 trillion ($400 million), with the bulk of its debt due to cell tower operators.\n\nPart of the conditions set by the sector\u2019s regulator, the Uganda Communication Commission (UCC), before Africell formally winds up operations is the payments of its creditors. Without giving out specific details, Williams disclosed that discussions are currently ongoing between the relevant parties.\n\nIn 2019, Africell signed a financing agreement worth $100 million with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a U.S. government funding agency. The investment is expected to be deployed across Africell\u2019s remaining markets while it\u2019s also planning to launch operations in Angola by the end of this year.\n\nAfricell\u2019s exit from Uganda will come as good news to the likes of MTN, which is gearing up to sell 20% of its shares to the public via an IPO, in line with a government directive issued last year.\n\nCurrent Africell subscribers in the country must close their accounts and switch to alternative mobile providers by October 7, with the company saying it will provide support and guidance during the migration process.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Africell will return mobile sites to third-party owners while network technology equipment will be transferred to other units within the Africell Group. The operator\u2019s mobile frequency and spectrum holdings will be returned to the UCC and it claims to have notified GSMA of the termination of roaming partner agreements.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa",
          "text": "After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple has released the iPhone 13 series.\n\nDuring a virtual event on Tuesday, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 will come in four new models: the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about the iPhone 13 series?\n\nWell, it looks very much like the iPhone 12 but two notable main updates were made to the phone\u2019s display and camera. The new phones will also run on the latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS 15. They also come with larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 Terabyte storage), a new A15 Bionic processor, a smaller notch and new camera features.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe iPhone 13 starts at $829 for 128GB, which is twice the storage the iPhone 12 started with; while the iPhone 13 Mini starts at $729 for 128GB of storage. The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max start at $999 and $1,099 respectively, for 128GB storage.\n\nIPHONE 13 SERIES US PRICES AND STORAGE\n\nPhone 128GB storage 256GB storage 512GB storage 1TB storage iPhone 13 Mini $729 $829 $1,029 NA iPhone 13 $829 $929 $1,129 NA iPhone 13 Pro $999 $1,099 $1,299 $1,499 iPhone 13 Pro Max $1,099 $1,199 $1,399 $1,599\n\nWhy the iPhone 13 series are more expensive in African countries\n\nOver the years, there\u2019s been a noticeable price difference for Apple products in African countries. So, TechCabal reached out to iPhone retailers in different African countries to find out when the iPhone 13 will be available and how much it\u2019ll cost.\n\nNigeria\n\n\u201cOf course, you can expect that since the iPhone will be available on September 24, we\u2019ll have it in Nigeria on or before October 1.\u201d Emmanuel Osho, CEO of Bodds IT and Apple certified technician told TechCabal. \u201cThe price will be about 30% higher because it\u2019s new and there\u2019s a lot of hype around it.\u201d\n\nDespite the increased margin on the iPhone, Osho expects that the new iPhones will still sell out fast. A positive effect of the people purchasing the new iPhone 13 is that they\u2019ll most times trade in their older iPhones, making room for other people to buy them at a more affordable price.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Nigeria, at an exchange rate of $1/\u20a6550, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about \u20a6593,000.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, the iPhone 13 will reportedly be available from October 8 according to iStoreZA, an Apple premium reseller. Although the store hasn\u2019t revealed the prices, the iPhone 13 Pro 128GB is expected to go for around R23,499 ($1,640), while the iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB could retail for around R25,999 ($1,815). This is a high price margin of over 50%, most likely influenced by the fact that an iPhone or iPod attracts 7% duties and 15% VAT in South Africa per Business Insider.\n\nYou can expect that the price of iPhones from other retailers to be around the same price range as the majority of Apple products sold in South Africa come through a sole distributor, Core Computer Group.\n\nKenya\n\nIn Kenya, TechCabal spoke to a Salute iWorld, an authorized Apple product retailer at Yaya Center, Nairobi.\n\nA representative of the retailer told us that they expect to have the iPhone 13 in their stores within the next two weeks.\n\nWhile he couldn\u2019t comment on how much it\u2019ll cost he mentioned that in general Apple products are charged a 16% import fee with an additional 6% added on for Value Added Tax (VAT). This is aside from the transportation cost and the profit margin that the retailer will add to arrive at a final price for the public.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Kenya, at an exchange rate of $1/KSh110, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about KSh119,000.\n\nThe iPhone 13 looks like it offers a bit over its predecessor. But not so much that it\u2019ll compel many to upgrade. In the context of Africa, it brings up the question of whether the minor upgrades are worth paying at least an additional 30% \u2013 50% to get the new iPhone 13 in Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa.\n\nAlexandria Williams contributed to this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBenin \u2013 The University of Benin (UNIBEN) said the growing worrisome trend of students\u2019 late registration was reason for introduction of the N20,000 late registration fee.\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor of the University, Prof. Lilian Salami, made the assertion at a news conference on Friday in Benin.\n\nSalami explained that the behaviour amongst students had continued to have negative down-stream impact on the institution\u2019s operations, and ability to deliver the quality of education and students\u2019 support she promised and committed to, as vice-chancellor.\n\nBeyond this, she said, research further showed that there was a direct correlation between late registration and poor student academic performance.\n\n\u201cThe sad fact is that less than 25 per cent of our students register on time yearly, no functional or high performing education institution can thrive with such lackluster statistics,\u201d she said, adding that early registration remains critical for effective operations of the university.\n\nAccording to her, timely registration provides insight into the students\u2019 volume/demand and allows for smarter planning to ensure that there are enough staff, courses and funding to support the students accordingly.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that in the past, other non-financial interventions in attempts to urge early registration have failed.\n\n\u201cIt was based on the bad practice that the university Senate on Aug. 2, agreed to increase the existing payment of late fee from N10,000 to N20,000 on all students, as another attempt to further encourage early registration.\n\n\u201cThe announcement saw significant growth in early registrations from 2020 rate of 35 per cent to 93 per cent.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen this rate of early registration in decades. It is a UNIBEN record without question, and Kudos to those students who chose to make their education a priority,\u201d the vice-chancellor said.\n\nShe noted, however, that the senate reversed the decision due to the outcry from students, in spite of the violent engagement of some students.\n\nSalami noted, notwithstanding, that the reversal of the position would not break the institution.\n\n\u201cI fundamentally believe that there are very few decisions that are irreversible and this is definitely not one of them. At this time, the N20,000 late fee is reversed and it is a closed case.\n\n\u201cUniben is resilient and we will continue to move forward with a strong conviction to ensure that the university reaches its full potential as a premier academic institution.\u201d\n\nThe vice-chancellor said she was proud of the progress the institution had made over the last 20 months under her watch.\n\nShe expressed satisfaction over the continued improvement in students\u2019 experiences in power supply, water supply, renovated and livable hostel spaces, clean and beautiful environment, improved teaching and learning conditions/materials, improved students\u2019 work study programme and academic excellence among others.\n\nShe pledged that her administrative team would reflect on the lessons learnt from the last few days in shaping future policies and back-end processes.\n\n\u201cHow we gather the voice of the students and how we leverage technology to address these kinds of issues in the future.\n\n\u201cThe goal remains \u2018to ensure that our great institution continues to strive and create an environment where all can succeed\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the imposition of the N20,000 late payment fee on students, on Tuesday, led to a two-day mass protest in the institution, forcing the management to reverse the decision.\n\n...",

          "text": "Most of the videos showing the attacks on police stations across the country during last year\u2019s #EndSARS protests were downloaded from the internet, Oludotun Odubona, an Assistant Commissioner of Police, told the Lagos Judicial Panel of Enquiry on Friday.\n\nMr Odubona, who represented Hakeem Odumosu, the state\u2019s police commissioner, disclosed this while being cross-examined by Adesina Ogunlana and Oluwatomi Olagunju, counsels to the #EndSARS protesters.\n\nMr Odubona had earlier presented several videos to the panel explaining how police officers were attacked and the activities of #EndSARS protesters.\n\n\u201cYou have brought several videos before the panel. Can you tell us your source?\u201d Mr Olagunju asked.\n\n\u201cLike I mentioned it before, a lot of the videos were taken from the internet,\u201d the assistant police commissioner replied.\n\nWhen asked whether the police relied on the description given to them by the people who posted them on the internet, Mr Odubona said there were landmarks and other pointers that helped the police to identify the locations.\n\nMr Olagunju said some of the videos had no bearing or connection to the protests of October 2020, yet, the police presented them as evidence for the #EndSARS protests.\n\nIn a video played by the #EndSARS counsel, he pointed out that the video was a Snapchat video made on 13 November, 2020.\n\nThe assistant commissioner, who was asked to verify the stamp date on the video, confirmed that it was made on the aforementioned date.\n\n\u201cYou will agree with me that there were no #EndSARS protests on the 13th of November, 2020,\u201d Mr Olagunju said.\n\n\u201cRather than the investigative duty expected of the Nigerian Police, what you simply did was to open your computer and bring all manners of garbage before the panel.\u201d\n\nAt the mention of \u2018garbage,\u2019 Cyril Ajifor, the police counsel, leaped out of his seat and shouted at Mr Olagunju, demanding an apology.\n\n\u201cMy Lord, I take exception to that choice of language by my learned friend, what do you mean by garbage. You must apologise for that choice of language,\u201d Mr Ajifor said.\n\n\u201cOut of 100 videos, you are pointing one and saying garbage, that is not right to say.\u201d\n\nDoris Okuwobi, a retired judge, heading the panel, disagreed with the police lawyer.\n\n\u201cMr Ajifor, it is a computer language, which means garbage in garbage out,\u201d she said, putting to an end the exchange of words between the lawyers.\n\n\u2018Unaware of thugs\u2019\n\nContinuing his cross-examination, Mr Olagunju asked whether the police conducted any investigation into the alleged killings by police officers during the protests.\n\nMr Odubona explained that investigations were conducted into the killing of officers and looting of the police armoury during the period.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMr Ogunlana asked whether the police was aware that thugs tried to disrupt the protests and some people who attempted to pilfer or cause unrest at protest grounds were arrested by the protesters and handed over to the police.\n\n\u201cI am not aware of thugs or whatever you called them tried to disrupt the protest,\u201d Mr Odubona responded.\n\nSpeaking on the evidence of the police that all gunshot injuries must be reported by doctors, Mr Ogunlana asked whether if such reports were not made, it would mean that the doctors that testified before the panel lied.\n\n\u201cIf there was no report of gunshot injuries at the police stations, that means it did not happen.\n\n\u201cI am not aware that any doctor gave treatment to gunshot victims, not to talk of reporting cases, I don\u2019t know how I will handle that,\u201d Mr Odubona said.\n\nFollowing different submissions by the counsels and application for summons on the DPO, Maroko station, Raji Ganiyu, the matter was adjourned till 24 September for further hearing.",

          "text": "The shareholders of Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group or The Group) Plc convened in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, on Thursday, 9 September 2021, for its first Annual General Meeting (AGM) after the demutualisation of The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE).\n\nAmidst other critical matters proposed for shareholder vote, the Board of NGX Group presented the audited financials for 2020 showcasing the resilience of NGX Group in turbulent and challenging market conditions. Shareholders approved all the resolutions proposed at the meeting including the re-election of the Non-Executive Directors who were retiring by rotation; the election of the members of the Audit Committee; the proposed remuneration for the Board and Non-Executive members of the erstwhile National Council of the NSE; and the introduction of equity-based incentives to employees\u2019 remuneration, including an Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) and a Performance Based Long-Term Incentive Plan.\n\nNGX Group, leading by example as a new corporate entity, is committed to the highest governance standards, recognising its role in critical capital markets infrastructure.\n\nMuch like leading exchanges in the world today (London Stock Exchange Group, Intercontinental Exchange, Singapore Exchange, Japan Exchange Group) and other African exchanges such as Johannesburg Stock Exchange and FMDQ, the demutualised NSE gave rise to a group structure with attendant benefits. Today, NGX Group stands as the non-operating holding company with three (3) subsidiaries \u2013 the operating Exchange, Nigerian Exchange Limited led by Mr. Temi Popoola, CFA, as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO); the independent regulatory company, NGX Regulation Limited led by Ms. Tinuade Awe as the CEO; and the real estate company, NGX Real Estate with Mr. Gabriel Igbeka serving as Acting CEO. Each of these entities is governed by independent boards, the composition of which was not only strategic but in line with acceptable practices.\n\nAt the Extra Ordinary General Meeting (EGM) of the then Members of NSE in March 2020, a resolution was passed pertaining to the appointment of the inaugural board of NGX Group, post demutualisation. The process relating to selection of council (board) members was duly followed and the identified candidates were taken through a rigorous due diligence exercise before passing through the internal governance process, being submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission for approval and thereafter, presented to previous members at the 2020 EGM.\n\nThe members agreed to the importance of maintaining continuity and preserving The Exchange\u2019s collective knowledge and learned experience (institutional memory) as well as retaining stakeholder confidence and maintaining market stability. It was therefore agreed that the composition of the Boards would comprise individuals selected from the erstwhile National Council and external candidates. This understanding was contained in the Scheme of Arrangement dated 20 January 2020 between The Nigerian Stock Exchange and the Dealing and Ordinary Members of The Nigerian Stock Exchange in respect of the demutualisation of The Nigerian Stock Exchange (The Exchange) (the Scheme). The Scheme was approved at the Court Ordered meeting held on 3 March 2020. The approved Scheme of Arrangement was sanctioned by the Court on 14 May 2020 and filed at the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) on 1 June 2020, and it became effective on the date it was filed at the CAC.\n\nNGX Group\u2019s Board currently has eleven (11) members and out of the 11 directors, five (5) have direct or indirect shareholdings in the company providing strong representation for the company\u2019s shareholders. In addition, going above the statutorily required minimum that a public company shall have at least three (3) independent directors (S.275 (1) CAMA 2020), NGX Group went with four (4) independent directors.\n\nTransition Agreements expected to last for 18 months, were also agreed and it was recognized that subsequent composition of the Board following this transition period will evolve in line with existing rules and regulations, market standards, competitive realities and succession planning policies. The composition of the inaugural board \u2013 comprising some members of the erstwhile Council and New members \u2013 was approved at the EGM, on the condition that their appointment would become effective post demutualisation.\n\nThe market continues to repose confidence in NGX Group evidenced by the statement from the Chairman, Association of Securities Dealing Houses of Nigeria, representing the largest shareholder group in the company, Chief Onyewenchukwu Ezeagu, who stated prior to the recent 60th AGM, \u201cAs major shareholders, we were involved in all the processes of demutualisation. We are comfortable with the agenda of the meeting as we have been part of the whole process. The proposed resolutions had been made public in the course of the demutualisation. The meeting will bring about a renewed relationship between the NGX Group and its stakeholders.\u201d\n\nTo align the interests of internal stakeholders with those of shareholders in long-term value creation, the establishment of ESOP was also approved at the 60th AGM, further to the approval by way of special resolution at the March 2020 EGM granting authorization to directors and subject to regulatory members / shareholder approvals.\n\nThe creation of an ESOP for the benefit of employees (who will pay a discounted fee per share) had been proposed by the Membership Verification Panel and the Demutualisation Advisory Committee in 2016. The Group held several stakeholders\u2019 engagement sessions regarding the resolutions to be presented at the Court Ordered Meeting and EGM, and these sessions addressed concerns hitherto held against any of the proposed resolutions. As such, the decision to establish an ESOP was evidently predicated upon the authority granted to directors by Members at the EGM in 2020.\n\nFurther to this authorisation, the Council commenced the process for the establishment of the ESOP by undertaking a robust request for proposal (RFP) and competitive pitching which resulted in the appointment of a seasoned External Consultant (the Consultant) following a rigorous selection process. The draft ESOP which was developed by the Consultant was not only benchmarked against global best practices, but also subjected to scrutiny by both the erstwhile National Council and the Board of NGX Group Plc, before a revised version was approved by shareholders at the recent AGM\n\nIt was also made clear at the meeting that the authority being sought from members is to issue and allot existing ordinary shares from the authorised share capital of Nigerian Exchange Group Plc for the ESOP. No new shares are being created for this purpose.\n\nEvidently, NGX Group has already begun to actualise the benefits of demutualisation including the alignment of stakeholders\u2019 interests in the value created by the new Group under a revised Corporate Governance framework. With its new structure, the HoldCo, NGX Group, sits at the apex of several organisations and is tasked with the implementation of strategic value-creating initiatives and services that strengthen the Group. Under the leadership of Mr. Oscar N. Onyema, OON, the Group is better positioned to realise its vision to be Africa\u2019s leading integrated capital market infrastructure group.\n\nSome of the key activities Mr. Onyema is undertaking include overseeing the financial planning activities of the Group including Group capital allocation as well as the investment activities of the Group with emphasis on treasury management, capital allocation, fund raising, private equity investments, Mergers and Acquisitions as well as overseeing integration processes to maximize returns. Onyema\u2019s contributions to the development of Africa\u2019s capital market is not lost on stakeholders as he just got elected to the board of the World Federation of Exchanges.\n\nRecently, Mr Oscar N. Onyema, The Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, NGX Group Plc, had commented, \u201cAs the Group progresses its plans to list on Nigerian Exchange Limited, there are exciting days ahead. The financial performance of the Group in 2020 showed strong resilience and prospects for growth. The Group ended 2020 in a sound financial position with net asset growth of over 10% to N31.28Bn, and income and resulting surplus after tax valued at N6.02Bn and N1.84Bn respectively. In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, we maintained tight cost controls, which reduced expenses by 13% despite investments in technology that allowed remote operations with zero downtime.\u201d\n\nWith these in view, the capital markets look forward to exploring this new phase of growth for the benefit of all.",

The currency has fluctuated at the official market with an average of N411.\n\nThe fall at the black market followed the stoppage of forex sales to registered money changers who the CBN has accused of fraud and round-tripping.\n\nThe fall has fueled price instability as many businesses rely on the black market for dollar sales, even though the CBN has said banks have been asked to meet all legitimate requests, Premium Times reported.\n\nAddressing journalists Friday after the central bank announced that it was holding the monetary policy rate at 11.5 per cent, the governor, Godwin Emefiele, said CBN took too long to move against the BDCs.\n\n\u201cThe only exchange rate market is the Investors and Exporters window, which is the market that we expect everybody that wants to buy or sell dollars should use,\u201d said Mr Emefiele.\n\n\u201cI am sorry to say: I do not recognise any other market. We\u2019ve asked ourselves at the CBN, why did we have to wait so long?\n\n\u201cCBN remained the only central bank in the world to dip its hands into our commonwealth mad pack dollars to BDCs all in an effort to stabilise the exchange rate.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s a wrong decision. It has stopped for good. The Bank of England, or U.S. Federal Reserves do not sell dollars to BDCs even though they exist.\n\n\u201cIt beats my imagination that tended to support illegality of people who are involved in graft and corruption,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Emefiele said banks have been given instructions to meet every legitimate demand for foreign exchange, and that the CBN will be ready to support even requests that are above the allowed limit, provided they are lawful.\n\nFor the monetary policy, the bank held all paramters as follows: policy rate at 11.5 per cent, with the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR, Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) at 27.5 percent as well as the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.",

West and Central Africa has seen four coups since last year \u2013 political upheaval that has intensified concerns about a backslide towards military rule in a resource-rich but poverty-stricken region.\n\nGhana\u2019s President Nana Akufo-Addo, who is ECOWAS chairman, had said in remarks before a closed-door session that he hoped the heads of state will help offer durable solutions to the crisis.\n\nOn Thursday, the International Monetary Fund said it was closely monitoring the situation in Guinea and called for a peaceful resolution.",

          "text": "Guinea\u2019s military junta said on Friday it would not bow to regional pressure and allow President Alpha Conde, detained since his overthrow on Sept. 5, to leave the country.\n\nOn Friday Ivory Coast\u2019s President Alassane Ouattara and Ghana\u2019s President Nana Akufo-Addo, who is ECOWAS chairman, visited Conakry to ask coup leader Mamady Doumbouya, for Conde\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cThe former president is and remains in Guinea. We will not yield to any pressure,\u201d the junta said in a defiant statement read on state TV.\n\n\u201cHe will benefit from humane treatment worthy of his rank in his country\u201d, the statement added.\n\nOuattara and Akufo-Addo, representing the 15-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), held a separate meeting with Conde at the Mohamed VI Palace in Conakry.\n\nHowever, they flew out the country on Friday evening empty-handed.\n\nOuattara told Radio-T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Guin\u00e9enne (RTG) at Conakry airport before leaving: \u201cI met my brother Alpha Conde, who is doing well. We will remain in contact.\u201d\n\nAkufo-Addo told RTG: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a very frank and fraternal meeting with Doumbouya and his collaborators. I think that ECOWAS and Guinea are going to find the best way to move forward together.\u201d\n\nECOWAS has demanded a return to constitutional rule since the special forces unit seized control of the presidential palace, detained Conde and declared itself in charge.\n\nThe bloc agreed on Thursday to freeze financial assets of the junta and their relatives and bar them from travelling. The junta has not responded.\n\nEvents in Guinea followed coups in Mali and Chad earlier this year that have raised fears of a democratic backslide in a region only just shedding its \u201ccoup-belt\u201d reputation.\n\nGuinea\u2019s coup leaders have held a week of consultations with public figures and business leaders to map out a framework for a transitional government.\n\nECOWAS\u2019s credibility in Guinea has been strained since 2018, when the bloc failed to condemn Conde for running for a third term in office last year, despite a law declaring that presidents must step down after two and widespread protests.\n\nOuattara himself used a constitutional change as an excuse to run for a third term last year, a move critics decried as illegal.\n\nFollowing Thursday\u2019s summit, during which ECOWAS also pressured Mali\u2019s transitional government to hold elections by February 2022, the regional body said it would be reviewing protocols on democracy and good governance.\n\nOn departing the airport in Conakry, the ECOWAS motorcade passed dozens of pro-junta demonstrators brandishing signs.\n\nOne read: \u201cECOWAS does not decide for us.\u201d",

We have 100 per cent confidence in him (Fani-Kayode).\u201d\n\nOPC, however, urged Yoruba people not to be disappointed by the ex-minister\u2019s move.\n\nThe statement partly reads, \u201cYou can\u2019t trust a politician, Femi Fani-Kayode is just one out of the lot. He has no principle, and he is an agent of the government. So it is never a new thing to see him defecting from PDP to APC. Fani-Kayode has no measure of integrity and he is a political jobber with no ideology.\n\n\u201cOf what value is his defection to the APC? But the truth is Yoruba should be ready for more of Femi Fani Kayodes in our midst.\u201d",

          "text": "Director-General of Progressive Governors Forum, PGF, an umbrella body for governors elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Dr. Salihu Moh\u2019 Lukman, has described as retrogressive politics the clamour by some State governors to control collection of Value Added Tax, VAT, in Nigeria.\n\nLukman stated that if the reason behind the clamor for decentralized control of VAT collection is based on divisive, ethnocentric injustice, then it is retrogressive politics which is a complete departure from the progressive politics which the APC stands for.\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike had sued and secured court judgment against the Federal Inland Revenue Service, FIRS, over the right of the State to control the collection of VAT.\n\nWike lamented injustice and inequitable distribution of resources generated from VAT, arguing that \u2018Rivers State generated about N15 billion as VAT in June 2021 but received only N4.7 billion, Lagos State generated over N46 billion as VAT in June, but got just over N9 billion, whereas Kano State generated N2.8 billion and also got N2.8 billion as allocation.\u2019\n\nIn his statement titled, \u2018Retrogressive Politics of Value Added Tax in Nigeria\u2019, issued Friday and made available to newsmen in Abuja, the APC chieftain wondered if State collection of VAT was going to prioritise the development of the nation\u2019s productive capacity or rather simply be about consuming the resources that are currently available, stressing that access may not necessarily translate into commitment to utilise the resources in ways that strengthened commitment of political leaders to invest in the development of Nigeria\u2019s productive sector.\n\nHe emphasized that if the priority is about consuming currently available resources, commitment of political leaders to mobilise investment to develop the nation\u2019s productive sectors will be weak, hence it is important to ensure that access to resources also come with increased commitment by political leaders towards developing Nigeria\u2019s productive sector.\n\nThe PGF DG maintained that the reason Nigerians are debating whether it is states or federal government that should collect VAT is as a result of significant increase in what is being generated from VAT, thereby making it an attractive variable in the struggle for resource control by State governments.\n\nLukman boasted that the APC government led by president Muhammadu has tremendously increased VAT from N759.43 billion in 2015 to N1.531 trillion in 2020, an increase of more than hundred percent.\n\nHe berated the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, for generating very low income from VAT on account of both combination of weak institutional capacity and corruption in the public sector during its 16 years reign in power.\n\n\u201cNo matter what anyone want to say, the reality is that the significant increase in VAT in the country between 2015 and 2020 confirmed improved efficiency and reduced corruption in the process of collection and management of Nigeria\u2019s public finances.\n\n\u201cThe reality however is that credit must go to the APC led federal government of President Buhari. Whether it would have been possible if PDP is still in control of the federal government can only be wishful thoughts. If that were to be the case, why wasn\u2019t it the case at any point between 1999 and 2015?,\u201d he asked.\n\nLukman added that, \u201cGovernor Wike can audaciously and shamelessly talk about VAT today because, its value has significantly increased which made it attractive for a rich State like Rivers to be interested in controlling it. If Governor Wike has any morality, he should look back and acknowledge how small Rivers must have received as its VAT share before 2015. Being a leading member of PDP, what was responsible for the low VAT records in the country between 1999 and 2015?\n\n\u201cAs members of APC, it is important that Governor Wike is reminded that the current increased record of VAT collection in the country is made possible only because the PDP is no longer in power. If PDP were to be in power the fact of inefficiency and corruption in the process of collection and management of VAT would have continued and the amount collected would have remained relatively low. It is not by accident that VAT collection in the country significantly increased under APC led federal government. This is because one of the specific commitment of APC since 2015 as outlined in the section of the party\u2019s manifesto Funding a New Nigeria was that \u2018APC government will set about the urgent task of getting Nigeria\u2019s public finances in order, by tackling the massive waste, duplication and corruption in the system, diversifying the economy and expanding our tax base to increase non-oil revenues, and reprioritising public spending away from bureaucracy towards investment in infrastructure and improved frontline services.\u2019\u201d",
          "summary": "Lukman stated that if the reason behind the clamor for decentralized control of VAT collection is based on divisive, ethnocentric injustice, then it is retrogressive politics which is a complete departure from the progressive politics which the APC stands for.\nLukman boasted that the APC government led by president Muhammadu has tremendously increased VAT from N759.43 billion in 2015 to N1.531 trillion in 2020, an increase of more than hundred percent.\n\u201cThe reality however is that credit must go to the APC led federal government of President Buhari.\nBeing a leading member of PDP, what was responsible for the low VAT records in the country between 1999 and 2015?\nIt is not by accident that VAT collection in the country significantly increased under APC led federal government.",

In the video and live broadcast programme, some of the ex-soldiers, most of whom were dismissed from Service for various acts of indiscipline and misdemeanours, made efforts to rationalize or give excuses for the various infractions that led to their exit from service using most uncouth language.\n\n\u201cWhile the military respects everyone\u2019s right to free expression and justice, it is important to know that the military profession has its peculiarity that borders on discipline, truth and respect. It also have a standard and effective procedure of seeking redress by any aggrieved personnel, even if dismissed. Notably, there exist the Harmonized Terms and Condition of Service (HTACOS) Soldiers/Ratings/Airmen (Revised) 2017 which was reviewed and signed into law on 26 January 2018 to harmonize the management of the 3 Services. Similarly, the Armed Forces Act Cap A20 the Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004 has relevant Section dealing with Discipline and Administration of Justice. Section 147 \u2013 202 of the Armed Forces Act which expressly deals with Post Trial Procedures as well as Appeals from Court Martial. What constitute status bar to appeals of cases are also well encapsulated in the Armed Forces Act. The extant laws are therefore available for persons appearing as Counsels to affected Service personnel to avail themselves.\n\n\u201cIt is important to understand that, Nigeria operates a voluntary military service. Therefore, it is expected that whoever decides to serve in the noble profession would abide by its ethics and code of conduct. If any of its personnel thus run foul of the law, there are procedures of ensuring the administration of military justice and discipline. Therefore, seeing dismissed military personnel disparaging the establishment by raising issues of perceived injustice years after their cases must have been disposed leaves much to be desired\u201d.\n\nThe statement concluded that, \u201cIt is advisable that whenever issues of Service discipline arises the media should give the respective Services benefit of doubt to address the issues raised rather than jump into conclusion of injustice and grant them airtime to reel out falsehood to justify their dismissal from Service\u201d.",

          "text": "Some Northern groups under the auspices of Northern Advocacy Groups , Thursday, threw weight behind the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria CBN, Godwin Emefiele, following calls for his resignation by a group in the north.\n\nIn a statement signed by, Alhaji Mohamed Bashir-Ali- Northern Professional Forum; Hajia Fatima-Abubakar- Arewa Business Women League; Mallam Sadiq Ibrahim- Arewa Frontier; and Comrade Yusuf Yahaya-Arewa Patriotic and Anti-Corruption Network , at a press briefing in Abuja.\n\nGroup said \u201cToday after an appraisal of the uncharitable utterances made by a supposedly Youth Assembly from the north, we came to a conclusion that it is imperative to address most of the issues wrongfully and mischievously presented.\n\n\u201cOur position is unanimous and we are all in support of Mr. Godwin Emefiele and his management team in CBN and all their effort to stabilize the Naira and grow our foreign reserve for the nation. This holistic resolve brought us together under the aegis of Northern Advocacy Group NAG.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate to observe that the misrepresentation and falsehoods emanated from some legislators who believe that pulling Emefiele down will culminate into their political God Father having access to Nigerian\u2019s money for his presidential ambition.\n\n\u201cIt is regrettable that these persons feel that it is wisdom to tarnish and bring to ridicule, the outstanding effort of CBN just to gain the support of the President and seize power.\n\n\u201cWe hereby call on those who find it profitable to peddle wrong information to stop. This act is unpopular, uncharitable and should not be associated with Northern interest.\n\n\u201cWe hereby state emphatically that any act designed to frustrate efforts of Mr. Godwin Emefiele to restore the economy from its downward slope orchestrated by fall and unstable price of crude oil and the advent of Covid-19 pandemic will be opposed.\n\nMeanwhile, the group unequivocally stated that, \u201cLet it been known that we are not part of any Northern organization trying to bring disrepute to the Government. We consider it wrong to call for the resignation of the CBN Governor by the Arewa Youth Assembly over an unproven claim that the policies of the CBN have leaped the county into poverty.\n\n\u201cIt is worthy of note that any call for resignation of Emefiele will erode the achievements recorded by President Buhari in his effort to revamp the economy.\n\n\u201cThe economy was already in shambles and it got worsened by low prices of crude at the international market, empty treasury, corruption, dilapidated infrastructure and insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to the CBN Governor and his effort in expanding foreign exchange earning opportunities so as to increase our foreign reserve and raise the value of the Naira. It is our belief that this effort will improve the economy.\n\n\u201cThe politicians should please allow the Government to work; we are convinced that President Mohammadu Buhari will deliver at the end.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed that some persons will make themselves available to unsettle the Government. No reasonable person will embark on such venture, because it is unpatriotic.\n\nThe group also warned that, \u201cWe should not be seen creating crisis for a Government that we all made effort to install. This is the time to support the Government for a peaceful and prosperous Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, we request that everybody support this Government, there is no doubt that the Governor of CBN and his team will deliver.\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nEbonyi State Governor, David Umahi, has appealed to state governors to sheathe their swords as the dispute over who should collect Value Added Tax (VAT) between the state governments and the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) persists.\n\nHe believes if the FIRS is stripped of such responsibility, only a few states will be major beneficiaries while others will be left to suffer.\n\n\u201cEven if you have all the money in the world, you will not be able to use it. So, it is very important, and it is coming at a very bad time,\u201d the governor said on Friday when he appeared as a guest on Channels Television\u2019s Sunrise Daily.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleading with my colleagues to sheathe their swords, let us pass through this challenging moment before we start looking at who is right or wrong.\n\n\u201cWe have to be our brother\u2019s keeper; we have to see how we can grow the economies of the weakest states, otherwise we will breed a lot of insecurities to those super states; this is very important.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Appeal Court Reserves Ruling On Lagos Govt\u2019s Application For Joinder Over VAT Dispute\n\nA series of litigations and rulings have surfaced since the Rivers State government took the decision to test the legality of the collection of VAT by FIRS in various states.\n\n\u2018Ebonyi Should Be Pitied\u2019\n\nThe dispute started on August 9 when a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt granted the state government the right to collect VAT \u2013 an order that affected other states.\n\nAlthough the case is before the Supreme Court, the latest is the reservation of the ruling of the Court of Appeal in Abuja, on the application for a joinder filed by the Lagos State government.\n\nBut Governor Umahi proposed that before states should be allowed to collect VAT, the \u2018weakest states\u2019 must be provided with enough resources to give them a comparative advantage.\n\nAccording to him, the Federal Government should be the major contributor to VAT while state and local governments should have 85 per cent and the remaining 15 per cent taken by the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cNow, the Federal Government and the super states will be the most beneficiaries, and a number of states will collapse and by the reason of rampant law,\u201d the governor decried. \u201cI am also encouraging the Federal Government to look the way of Ebonyi State, we are highly disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cYou say we should grow the economy, with what? We don\u2019t have money to grow the economy. We have agriculture, we have solid minerals, and our solid minerals are being stolen away. Ebonyi State should be pitied, we\u2019re in a very difficult situation. We have a lot of our youths unemployed.\u201d",

It will compete with Goldman Sach\u2019s (GS.N) consumer brand Marcus, which launched in Britain in 2018.\n\nAccording to Nutmeg, the British digital wealth manager which has more than 140,000 clients and more than 3.5 billion pounds ($4.89 billion) in assets under management, Nutmeg will form the basis of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s retail digital wealth management offering internationally.\n\nCEO of international consumer at JPMorgan Chase, Sanoke Viswanathan, stated, \u201cWe are building Chase in the UK from scratch using the very latest technology and putting the customer\u2019s experience at the heart of our offering, principles that Nutmeg shares with us.\u201d\n\nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but a source close to the transaction said it valued Nutmeg at close to 700 million pounds ($972.79 million).\n\nLaunched in 2012, Nutmeg aimed to upend the traditional wealth management market by offering lower cost automated financial planning services.\n\nWhile it quickly became one of Britain\u2019s best known financial technology companies and robo-advisers, it has yet to turn a profit. In its most recent set of full accounts for 2019, the group made a pretax loss of 22 million pounds.\n\nJPMorgan confirmed the acquisition and said it would complement the group\u2019s UK digital bank launch under its Chase brand later this year. It had already launched a product partnership with Nutmeg in November.\n\nThe Nutmeg deal follows plans by rival U.S. bank Goldman Sachs group Inc (GS.N) to shift the focus of its Marcus consumer division in Britain towards wealth and investments. The bank earlier disclosed that it intended to offer a robo-adviser to Marcus clients in the country by the first quarter of next year. read more\n\nBanking industry experts said that while Nutmeg\u2019s customer base is small relative to those of major banks, it will give JPMorgan an initial user base in Britain, where it does not yet have a consumer presence.\n\nOmotayo Araoye",
