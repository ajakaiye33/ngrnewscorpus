          "text": "Tesla chief Elon Musk has launched a hostile takeover bid for Twitter, offering to buy 100 percent of its stock and take it private, according to a stock exchange filing.\n\nMusk offered $54.20 a share, which values the social media firm at $43.4 billion, in a filing dated Wednesday April 13 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nMusk\u2019s latest move towards Twitter comes just days after he turned down a seat on the board following his acquisition of a 9.2 percent stake in the microblogging platform.\n\n\u201cI invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,\u201d Musk said in his filing.\n\n\u201cHowever, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTwitter needs to be transformed as a private company. As a result, I am offering to buy 100% of Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, a 54% premium over the day before I began investing in Twitter.\u201d\n\nMusk, Twitter\u2019s biggest shareholder, said his \u201coffer is my best and final offer\u201d and he would reconsider his position as a shareholder if it was rejected.\n\n\u201cTwitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrently the world\u2019s richest man and with more than 80 million followers on the microblogging platform, Musk last week disclosed a purchase of 73.5 million shares \u2014 or 9.2 percent \u2014 of Twitter\u2019s common stock. His announcement sent Twitter shares soaring more than 25 percent.\n\nHe was offered a seat on the board but turned it down at the weekend.\n\nMusk\u2019s move comes after he tweeted Saturday asking whether the social media network was \u201cdying\u201d and to call out users such as singer Justin Bieber, who are highly followed but rarely post.\n\n\u201cMost of these \u2018top\u2019 accounts tweet rarely and post very little content,\u201d the Tesla boss wrote, captioning a list of the 10 profiles with the most followers \u2014 which includes himself at number eight, with 81 million followers.\n\n\u201cIs Twitter dying?\u201d he asked.\n\nIn other weekend tweets, Musk posted joke polls on whether to drop the \u201cw\u201d from Twitter\u2019s name and on converting its San Francisco headquarters to a homeless shelter \u201csince no one shows up anyway.\u201d\n\nHe also suggested removing ads, Twitter\u2019s main source of revenue.\n\nThe billionaire tech entrepreneur is a frequent Twitter user, regularly mixing in inflammatory and controversial statements about issues or other public figures with remarks that are whimsical or business-focused.\n\nHe has also sparred repeatedly with federal securities regulators, who cracked down on his social media use after a purported effort to take Tesla private in 2018 fell apart.\n\nAFP",

We shall deploy a visionary leadership style that shall respond to the aspirations of the people,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the economic front, Anyim said the policy thrust of his administration would focus on industrialization, talent and innovation as well as Science and Technology.\n\n\u201cWe shall promote industrialization at the large, medium and small scales. This will drastically reduce importation, improve local production and strengthen the naira.\n\n\u201cWe shall promote micro, small and medium enterprises. Our policy on this shall segment the enterprises according to their sectors e.g., technical, hybrid, recreation, instructional etc and support them with training, marketing, technology, start-up funds.\n\n\u201cTalent and innovations shall be the flagship of the knowledge-based component of our economic agenda. Our target will be to unleash the creativity of our young population. Accordingly, we shall in this regard, establish innovation hubs in various parts of the country to create and nature start-ups in the information and e-commerce space,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthrough science and technology, we shall reposition our mode and factors of production to fit into the 4th industrial revolution. This shall affect all sectors including agriculture but more particularly the enablers of growth and prosperity, that is, security, infrastructure, healthcare, education, governance, justice system etc.\u201d\n\nHe further called on the party leadership to give him the ticket, promising to make a difference within a year.\n\n\u201cMr. Chairman (Iyorchia Ayu) if within one year of my Presidency, Nigerians don\u2019t see the difference between light and darkness; you can recall me,\u201d he said.\n\nOn zoning, Anyim said, \u201cas a true party man, I will abide by the decision of the party. However, I would want to put the following on record: Democracy thrives on three \u2018certainties- certainty of tenure, certainty of structure and certainty of process\n\n\u201cAt anytime any of these \u2018certainties\u2019 is no longer guaranteed, democracy will corrupt justice and enthrone inequity. Accordingly, my appeal is that zoning being a fundamental principle of our party should not be jettisoned.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Bala Mohammed, said having worked in the media, civil service and the National Assembly, he is prepared to lead Nigeria to new heights of given the chance.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs somebody who traversed all the constituencies of the public service, the civil service, the National Assembly and indeed, the media, with all these experiences, we have built bridges. I\u2019m a team player. I can only lead and Nigeria needs leadership.\n\n\u201cI am not going to be a Northern President, or a Muslim Fulani President or a minority President. I am going to be the Nigerian President who understands the nuances the norms and the feelings of Nigerians because I have touched them.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Bala Mohammed told the forum of former PDP governors that he would drop his Presidential ambition if former President Goodluck Jonathan decide to join the race.\n\n\u201cIf our boss, President Goodluck Jonathan is running, I will not run not because I am inferior but because of loyalty. I came to national limelight through him and I believe he has done so much. And I said that in any party, even if he\u2019s running in All Progressive Grand Alliance, APGA or anywhere, I will not run because I will not be joining issues with him.\n\n\u201cBut sadly I am PDP, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\n\nSo up to this moment, he has not made up his mind.

Ubale Maska, said the Commission looked forward to making the initiatives of both parties more impactful by enhancing cooperation between the NCC and Google Nigeria for quantifiable and remarkable impact.\n\nThe EVC expressed optimism that Google\u2019s investment in the subsea cable, Equiano, which is expected to land in Nigeria by end of April 2022, will be more impactful in driving NCC\u2019s ongoing implementation of the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP), 2020-2025, aimed at increasing broadband penetration to 70 per cent by 2025.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful that Equiano will have additional landing points in the hinterlands through collaborative efforts with the licensed Infrastructure Companies (InfraCos) to reduce retail data prices significantly and thereby complementing the Commission\u2019s efforts at ensuring affordable Internet services are available to boost the Commission\u2019s ongoing broadband policy drive,\u201d he said\n\nEarlier in her remarks, the Director, Google West Africa, Juliet Ehimuan, who led the delegation to NCC, commended the NCC for its consultative approach in formulating regulatory policies, as engine room for optimal delivery of telecommunications services that will in turn impact the digital economy drive of the government.\n\nShe particularly applauded the Commission for its seamless, fair, credible, impartial and successful auction of the 3.5 Gigahertz spectrum for the deployment of Fifth Generation (5G) in Nigeria, stating that it is evident that both the NCC and Google share a common goal.\n\nAccording to Ehimuan, demands for internet services have increased the need for more capacity, and sustainable collaborations with all relevant stakeholders within the public and private sectors. She asserted that Google\u2019s commitment of $1billion across five years in various interventions will support digital transformation in Nigeria and across Africa.\n\nEhimuan stated that research has proven that Africa will have an additional 300 million Internet users and Nigeria will lead in that number, given its current statistics of over 141 million internet subscribers and broadband penetration of over 40.88 percent as at January 2022.\n\nThe Equiano cable system is the third private international cable owned by Google and the 14th subsea cable invested by Google. Equiano connects Portugal and South Africa, running along the West Coast of Africa, with branching units along the way that can be used to extend connectivity to more African countries. The first branch is expected to land in Nigeria by end of April 2022.",

On December 28, 2020 he did the 1st and 2nd stage in my family marriage list which bride price happened to be on the 2nd stage which he paid. After he paid my bride price he started maltreating me.\n\n\u201c2021 was hell for me that at some point I left home, after everything we settled around November 2021 which he promised he will never beat me again. But still nothing changed.\n\n\u201cThis is my reason why I am calling off the traditional marriage (Igba Ngwu) and white wedding ceremony between me and Daavid Okike\u201d, she said.\n\nHelen, while noting physical abuse was not part of the agreement between them, said she has been through a lot since the beatings started.\n\n\u201cThis Saturday should have been my traditional and white wedding ceremony day. I supposed to be happy but I am not.\n\n\u201cFor couple of months now I have been going through a lot.\n\n\u201cI have been in a toxic relationship for over a year now.

From what I saw at that time, the picture was much milder than what the CT scan earlier on showed and so we felt very happy that at least there was relieve\n\n\u201cShe called me literally daily and we prayed with her reported progress. A point came when she needed no oxygen any more. According to what she said me one night and that they checked her oxygen perfusion and it was 100 % and we were very very excited at that progress.\n\n\u201cThat was the point it was before we went over to the crusade in Cameroon\n\n\u201cIt was in Cameroon the second night that I got to know of the unfortunate incident of her passing.\n\n\u201cNow, if there was domestic violence that led to or coincided with those symptoms that she came with two and half to three months ago, there is no way I would know. And if there had been domestic violence, there was no way I would have known.\n\n\u201cThe things we are hearing after her passing were things that were very very very strange to my ears.\n\n\u201cThen I began to ask questions. First, I asked the twin sister. \u201cAre you aware that your sister passed thorough all these things?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said yes that she knew some of them by that the majority of them she was hearing also from those she confided in\n\n\u201cI asked her I said \u201cif you knew, why didn\u2019t you let us know?\u201d And the twin sister said , she always begged her, \u201cplease, don\u2019t let the church know, don\u2019t let the pastor know, please the man will change, just pray for us, the man will change\u201d. And that continued to happen.\n\n\u201cI asked the first son yesterday. i said, \u2018was this real?\u2019 and the son told other stories. I said \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d because, typically they will run to me after service and I will pray for them, lay hands on them. And the the young man said, they couldn\u2019t tell me because the father would always asked them after they left me \u201cwhat did you tell the pastor? Did you tell him anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of the members in the choir who were privy to some of the things that were going on, I asked one of them when we paid a visit to the house of the deceased yesterday \u201cWhat happened? Why were we not aware of all these?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same story. That she will always go in her knees and say \u201cplease don\u2019t just pray, we are trusting God for him to changed\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe last one that touched me so much was the music producer who came to see me in the office two days ago to tell me his own experience. How he witnessed that the man slapped the wife in his music studio. And I said to him \u201d you saw how a man slapped a woman in your presence and you left the man alone and you are a man yourself\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd he said before he could respond to the man, the woman again in tears on her knees, begged him not to do anything to leave him alone and not even to do anything.

          "title": "Why Nigeria\u2019s power grid keeps collapsing",
          "text": "Over an 18-year period, beginning from 2000, Nigeria\u2019s electricity grid incredibly collapsed both partially or totally for 546 times. This collapse frequency is due majorly to the lack of a functional and reliable SCADA system that usually perceives disturbances and employs mitigating actions.\n\nSCADA is the acronym for Supervisory, Control and Data Acquisition. It is a technology that acquires real time data from field equipment for the purpose of supervision, control and analysis of power systems and associated field elements. The control centre takes advantage of acquired data for informed and prompt decision making. When SCADA is fused with an Energy Management System (EMS), the system further enjoys benefits like outage planning, load forecast, contingency analysis, generation Unit Scheduling and commitment, market settlements, etc. The SCADA/EMS may therefore be considered the Power System\u2019s \u2018brain\u2019 responsible for the efficient management and operation of interconnected systems within the Grid.\n\nAn electric power grid is a network of interconnected power systems for delivering power from producers to consumers. The collapse of the grid means loss of power supply across the environments/customers that the grid supplies. This is otherwise referred to as voltage collapse. Grid collapse is an unacceptable situation that warrants setting up of investigative panels whose findings ensure recommendations of possible solutions meant to avoid future occurrences. However, this is not the case with Nigeria\u2019s grid. The grid collapses have been indiscriminate.\n\nThe existing SCADA/EMS is a proprietary Energy Management System by SIEMENS with proprietary database and inter- application messaging system. This system is vendor lock-in and its deployment was forklift (all in one); hence, TCN is compelled to buy all the EMS applications and equipment from this same vendor. This has circumscribed TCN\u2019s ability to upgrade, modify or change packages to suit the realities of the present day market environment. Although the accompanying packages could meet the then demands of an energy market, modules like the Automated Meter Reader developed in-house by TCN or procured for certain functions from vendors rather than SIEMENS, cannot be integrated into this system because of the system\u2019s proprietary nature.\n\nIt is even more worrisome that substations built, equipped and automated by vendors like ABB, NARI, GE, etc. cannot be easily integrated into this system without contracting the integration process out to SIEMENS or hiring the extremely special skills of experts who understand both systems. This is due solely to the lock-in nature of the existing system. The unfriendly nature of this deployed system has therefore annulled the integration objective and consequently hampered expansion and reliability.\n\nThe current TCN SCADA/EMS has centralized data aggregation centres at NCC Osogbo and SNCC Shiroro. The system consists of various packages like fault analyzers, data historian, power flow analyzer, contingency analyzer, etc. These various packages are aimed to work in harmony to achieve the key objectives of real time supervision and control of the power system for stability and security as well as data acquisition for system analysis and planning. However, these very appealing objectives are rarely achieved due to the limitations in communication infrastructure, substation automation, flexibility of the existing SCADA/EMS and user proficiency.\n\nThe dream for a desired and successful SCADA/EMS implementation begins with a reliable procurement process. To accomplish this, a solution-based procurement process which encompasses equipment procurement as well as all the factors that relate with the system to ensure that the desired objectives are met before the project close out should be adopted. This procurement process will recognize and correct the challenges that have plagued the current SCADA/EMS.\n\nWhile many important requirements must be developed, perhaps one of the earliest to be considered is communications capability and required functionality. While specific features can be scaled to meet future needs and growth, available communications bandwidth needed to support any supplementary features should be taken into consideration upfront. Delivering communication services to operational applications requires not just implementing a suitable telecommunication infrastructure with adequate capacity but also with a high degree of reliability and security. The network must cover all service access points in power stations, control and monitoring platforms and must assure access to and from the technical offices. When very well designed and implemented, other applications like physical access control, video surveillance and metering can leverage the network\u2019s robustness and reliability. Moreover, existing legacy systems like radios, antennas, RTUs, fibre and cabling can also be leveraged in order to maximize investment return and reduce upfront costs.\n\nFurther on, with about $65 million available for the SCADA project, TCN must automate analogue transmission stations ahead of the procurement process. Likewise, TCN should adopt a modular system of SCADA deployment, a strategy that can afford them the luxury to replace modules of the SCADA with desired ones, upgrade such modules, modify them or integrate in house developed applications as well as afford them the ability to tweak the SCADA to suit the realities of the Nigerian electricity market. The modules can be deployed separately and from varying vendors but must be interoperable for easy and quick integration with other modules of the system. This will solve the non-flexible nature of the current system and also eliminate the challenges encountered while dealing with proprietary systems.\n\nInterestingly, by working with an outside engineering team well versed in the latest technologies (consultants), TCN can reduce complexities and make SCADA a reality. Experienced engineering teams familiar with the latest hardware and software components, as well as the potential challenges with integrating legacy equipment, can help control overall project costs and timing. This implies that TCN should employ the expertise of a consultant vast enough to support the project.\n\nAlso, the training of younger and ambitious engineers should not be neglected. This training can be captured in the procurement process such that there is knowledge transfer. These younger/ambitious engineers are assigned the desired EMS modules while working with prospective vendors as subject matter trainees. When very well trained, the said engineers will develop into subject matter experts and will be responsible for the design and prototyping of operational procedures in line with the grid code and operational procedures into the SCADA/EMS system. They will also be responsible for the training and day to day support of the user department staff.\n\nIn order to be abreast with the technology to come, the subject matter trainees should be supported with good knowledge of the power system and what is to come so that if possible, they decide the best way possible for modules to be implemented and prototyped.\n\nGenerally, the training of staff cannot be overemphasized. The future and maintenance of the system onus lies with the company\u2019s staff, therefore if the system must be sustained, adequate training must be made available to maintenance and user department staff.",

Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, disclosed this at the State House, Abuja, while briefing newsmen, along with Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (rtd), at the end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting chaired by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe government\u2019s latest position came as Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom accused the Buhari administration of pretending not to notice the unremitting killings of innocent Nigerians. Ortom, who spoke during an interview in Makurdi, also alleged plans by the government to yield power to criminal elements.\n\nThat was as members of the House of Representatives, yesterday at plenary, reiterated their call on the federal government to declare a state of emergency on security in Nigeria. Reacting to the recent escalations in insecurity, particularly the killings in Plateau State, the lawmakers demanded the sack of the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major-General Babagana Monguno (rtd.) and Minister of Defence, Major-General Bashir Magashi (rtd.).\n\nFormer Governor of Anambra State and presidential aspirant under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Peter Obi, stated the recent killing of over 100 people in Plateau State and over 20 persons in Benue State was horrific and unacceptable.\n\nBut the presidency yesterday reacted formally to Tuesday\u2019s call by the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) on Buhari to resign as a result of the worsening security situation in the country. The presidency dubbed the call a ploy by desperate politicians to get power.\n\nThe federal government said, though the security agencies are still working hard to unravel the group behind the attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train, preliminary report showed that some criminal groups had collaborated to perpetrate the act. It urged Nigerians to also cooperate with government to smoke out the criminals.\n\nBriefing newsmen in Abuja, at the end of the weekly FEC meeting, Magashi and Mohammed assured that the government was on top of the matter.\n\nResponding to a question on whether the government had identified those behind the attack, Magashi said, \u201cHonestly, I think the security chiefs are working hard to unveil those that are involved, and we will tell you very soon those that are carrying out these attacks.\n\n\u201cBoth attacks in Jos and Kaduna, we will come and explain to the public what is really going on and our efforts to ensure that all these activities are stopped once and for all. We are really on top of the situation, we are planning hard and we will get it out as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nSpeaking also, Mohammed said, \u201cWhat is happening now is that there is a kind of an unholy handshake between bandits and Boko Haram insurgents.\n\n\u201cPreliminary reports of what transpired at the Kaduna train attacks show that there is a kind of collaboration between the bandits and the dislodged Boko Haram terrorists from the North-east. I can tell you very confidently that the federal government is on the top of this matter.\u201d\n\nThe information minister said the federal government was doing all within its powers to achieve the rescue of the train passengers kidnapped by the terrorists. He said this in response to the 72-hour ultimatum given government by families of victims of the train attack to secure the release of their loved ones or they would take their fate in their hands.\n\nHe submitted that security operatives were working behind the scenes to get the captives released before long, adding that such moves would not be made known to members of the public in order not to jeopardise the steps being taken.\n\nMohammed stated, \u201cWhat the federal government is doing won\u2019t be subject matter of a press conference, because we have lives at stake. The various arms of security are working night and day to unravel the mystery surrounding the attack as a whole.\n\n\u201cOn the kidnapped people, what I can assure you is that the respective arms of government actually engaged, as we speak, are working to get those victims released.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s natural for anybody who is a father or a mother of a kidnapped person to be worried and to be concerned. But at the level of government, we appreciate that and we are leaving no stone unturned, but that we\u2019ll give you specific steps we\u2019re taking, I think it will be counterproductive and not going to aid or help those who are kidnapped or help the security forces who are tracing and ensuring that there\u2019ll be no repeat of such attacks.\u201d\n\nIn his own reaction to the killings in Plateau and Benue states, Obi said, \u201cSuch violence questions government\u2019s responsibility to protect lives and property. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of these wicked acts.\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we cannot be insensitive to the on-going bloodletting and targeting of the most vulnerable and helpless in our society. Security measures must be proactive and holistic; more so, in areas close to ungoverned rural and urban communities. Nigeria must cease being a killing field. These numbers are human beings and loved ones of many families.\u201d\n\nPlateau Killings: Angry Lawmakers Restate Call for State of Emergency, Demand Sack of NSA, Defence Minister\n\nThe appeal by members of the House of Representatives followed the amendment of two separate motions of urgent national importance on the recent massacre by terrorists in Plateau and Benue communities, which led to the death of over 100 people and destruction of property.\n\nThe two motions were sponsored by Chairman, House Committee on Navy, Hon. Yusuf Gagdi (APC Plateau), Hon. Bem Mzondu (PDP Benue), and Hon. John Dyegh (PDP Benue).\n\nThe lawmakers across party lines took turns to condemn the endless killings, the federal government\u2019s failure to secure lives, and the lackadaisical attitude of security agencies. They demanded that in the best interest of the country and to solve the security crisis,President Muhammadu Buhari should sack the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major-General Babagana Monguno (rtd.) and Minister of Defence, Major-General Bashir Magashi (rtd.).\n\nGagdi, while moving the motion on the terror attack in Kanam and Wase local government areas of Plateau State, prayed that the House should urge the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, through the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), to immediately provide relief materials for the victims.\n\nHe also prayed that the House should urge the president to, as a matter of urgency, direct the Minister of Defence, Chief of Defence Staff, Inspector General of Police, and Director General of the State Security Service to initiate a coordinated joint security operation and provide aerial surveillance and support to flush out the terrorists and destroy their camps.\n\nWhile further praying that the House should urge the Inspector General of Police to immediately deploy the Police Mobile Force squadrons to maintain law and order in the affected areas, he asked his colleagues to mandate the Committees on Emergency and Disaster Preparedness; Armed forces (Defence, Army, Navy, Air force); Police; National Security and Intelligence as well as Legislative Compliance to ensure compliance and furnish the House with a weekly report until the insecurity was brought under control.\n\nGagdi said persons responsible for the safety of lives and property in the country must be held accountable.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe have governors, we have National Assembly members, who is responsible for the safety, security of lives and property of the people of this country?\n\n\u201cWithout fear of political misrepresentation, it\u2019s Mr. President. We must ask ourselves questions, insecurity issues will never be discussed correctly if you don\u2019t detach political affiliation from it. Is Mr. President aware of what is going on in this country? Before people are killed, one of the operational commandants must be responsible, who allowed that thing to happen?\n\n\u201cWho are the various security agencies that are supposed to protect the lives of the people? Of course, the armed forces.\n\n\u201cWe vote money to these agencies every year and we provide supplementary budgets to them. We must hold someone accountable; there must be someone somewhere who has neglected his responsibility.\u201d\n\nHe said it was either the president had failed to hold accountable heads of the security services or the security agencies had refused to heed distress calls from troubled citizens.\n\n\u201cThis is not acceptable,\u201d Gagdi stated. He added, \u201cWe must hold somebody responsible for failing in the discharge of the duties to Nigeria people.\u201d\n\nOn their part, sponsors of the motion on the terrorist attacks in Mbadwem and Tiortyu communities in Guma and Tiortyu local government areas, Hon. John Dyegh and Hon. Bem Mzondu, lamented that Nigeria was bleeding. They said if those in the executive arm of government could not secure the country, then, they should resign.\n\nIn his contribution, Hon. Bamidele Salam (PDP Osun) lamented that information and early warnings were given to the security agencies, but the failed to act.\n\nSalam said, \u201cWe have come to a situation in this country where evil is perpetrated and no one is held accountable for the perpetration. We are the privileged class, we move around with convoys and security men, we are being paid to occupy this position of privilege by the sweat and taxes of some people.\n\n\u201cThe part of this motion that touched me was the reference that there were early warning signals, information given to security agencies about the plans by some terrorists to attack innocent persons and this information were not acted upon by the security agencies.\u201d\n\nHon. Fatuhu Mohammed (APC Katsina) said despite budgetary allocations, security agencies appeared to be unwilling to do their job. Mohammed said in his Daura constituency no security agent was willing to come out and do their job, but they were more interested in money.\n\nDeputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase (APC Plateau), who presided over the plenary session, made reference to a case when a soldier who was supposed to be stationed in Zamfara was given a pass to his Wase community in Plateau and was caught distributing uniforms to bandits.\n\nWase said the security agencies were part of the worsening insecurity.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis situation is not about politics, anyone that wants to politicise this is making a huge mistake. In my own community, we had a soldier who was supposed to be in Zamfara, but was given pass for consecutively six months, giving uniform to the bandits.\n\n\u201cTill this moment, he has not been taken to court. I want you to understand the complicity of security agencies in this matter. Why would you give your personnel six months\u2019 pass?\u201d\n\nHon. Lynda Ikpeazu (APC Anambra), in her submission, described Nigeria as a failed state, saying, \u201cNigeria right now is a failed state. What can we do? It is a failed state where you cannot protect your people. We have had cases where information were cast to the security agencies and still these terrorists overcome the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nIn his submission, Chairman, Committee on Police, Hon. Bello Kumo (APC Gombe), wondered why Buhari was still keeping Babagana Monguno and Bashir Magashi as NSA and defence minister, respectively, despite their failure to curb the worsening insecurity.\n\nDeputy Chief Whip, Hon. Nkeiruka Onyejeocha (APC Abia), said the country was under siege, adding that as it stands, no one knows the next community that may be attacked.\n\nOrtom: FG Turning a Blind Eye to Killing of Nigerians\n\nOrtom spoke yesterday in Makurdi during an interview with reporters at the Benue Peoples House, following the attack on two communities in the state where more than 23 persons were killed in their sleep by militia Fulani herdsmen.\u201d He said, \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d\n\nSuspected Fulani herdsmen had invaded and killed eight persons in Mbadwem in Guma local government and 16 in Tiortyu, a sprawling settlement in Tarka local government, along Makurdi-Gboko road.\n\nOrtom described the attacks as \u201cunfortunate and the height of impunity.\u201d\n\nHe accused Buhari\u2019s APC government of turning a blind eye and paying lip service to the cries of the Benue people, \u201cAs the herdsmen continue to invade our communities and kill innocent people.\u201d\n\nThe governor recalled how he had alerted Nigerians and the federal government on the murderous activities of the Fulani terrorists for many years, \u201cYet they didn\u2019t believe me. Now, they are gradually taking over every space in the country. We are now sharing our sovereignty with terrorists.\u201d\n\nOrtom alleged that the plan of the herdsmen and their sponsors was to send the people away from their ancestral homes, take over the lands, and cause confusion in the country so that the forthcoming elections would not hold.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI suspect that very soon, some states will be completely taken over by these Fulani men called bandits. I suspect that very soon, even the Presidential Villa will be handed over to them. I suspect strongly that this is their plan and so nobody should deceive me.\u201d\n\nThe governor said he was old enough to understand the agenda of the terrorists Fulani against Nigeria because, as he put it, \u201cit is a plan to hand over to these Fulani men who are called bandits so there will be no election.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to good spirited Fulani men and those who had the ears of the president to persuade him to stop the evil going on in the country.\n\nOrtom warned that if nothing was done, the people would resort to self-help, which would throw the country into anarchy.\n\nPresidency: Call for Buhari\u2019s Resignation, Ploy by Desperate Politicians to Get Power\n\nA statement yesterday by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, said resignation of the president would not solve the country\u2019s woes. It stressed that all stakeholders, including the opposition, needed to work with government to change the situation for the better.\n\nThe statement said the Buhari government was doing everything required to end the reign of violence, which it alleged had snowballed in the current crisis as a result of years of neglect of the early indicators.\n\nThe presidency stated, \u201cThe presidency does not wish to be drawn into the high-decibel show in the media, taking the nation by the storm from the Northern Elders Forum.\n\n\u201cPublicity is the oxygen for politicians who have failed to connect with voters in a democracy.\n\n\u201cIt is enough to say from our part, that resignation call on the president is not a solution to the security problems facing the country, something that has built up to a worrisome level following decades of neglect.\n\n\u201cIt is more important that citizens know what their government is doing to deal with this situation and for politicians to come to terms with the fact the it is beneficial to all that they help to preserve the state so that when it is their turn, they will have a place that they will manage.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t have to destroy what is there in a desperate quest to get power.\u201d\n\nThe statement assured Nigerians that the administration was doing what was required of it to refocus the fight against terrorism and other forms of criminality across the country, saying new massive equipment are being assembled to aid the campaigns.\n\nAccording to the presidency, \u201cIn response to the recent spike in terrorist activity, particularly in the Kaduna and Niger states axis, the defense establishment, in response to presidential directives, has realigned and reorganised the on-going operation in the areas, as well as that going on in the Niger Delta region.\n\n\u201cThe new operations structures are being reinforced with land-based assets to increase the efficiency of the troops and intelligence is equally being reinforced.\n\n\u201cThe air defense system is being reinforced with newly-acquired jets and drones which assemblage and training for operators have been hastened to meet the current exigencies.\n\n\u201cThe country is equally getting assurances of early delivery of equipment on order from manufacturers and the effort is on-going to conclude other major procurements still in process.\n\n\u201cOnly this morning, the government at a meeting of the cabinet, approved the procurement of the largest ever single procurement of military vehicles.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, similar major operations are going in the South-east and the South-south where the economic life wire of the nation and electricity transmission lines are currently being secured from saboteurs.\u201d\n\nIt also noted that more than just the coordinated assaults of terrorists on the country, there were other elements who had in recent times engaged in acts of sabotage against critical national assets, like those in the power sector, with the singular purpose of making the Buhari government seem as failing in its duties.\n\nThe presidency, however, assured the citizens that the outcome of government efforts to stabilise the country would soon become visible.\n\nThe presidency statement alleged, \u201cWhat the sponsored saboteurs aim to show is that the government cannot provide power, sabotaging equipment at switches and other vital points. They will not succeed. The public knows who is who, and who has done what in our country\u2019s governance.\n\n\u201cMassive gains being made will shortly be manifesting. Large number of arrests have equally been made.\n\n\u201cNigerians are assured that the government will keep its promise to the nation and threats to security will be handled with the firmness they call for. And government will remain firm in securing the country\u2019s unity and progress.\u201d\n\nInsecurity: 11, 536 Schools Have Been Closed Since 2020, UNICEF Reveals\n\nOn the eighth anniversary of the abduction of 276 students of Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, in Borno State, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) called for action to make schools safe for more girls to enrol in and complete their education.\n\nThe international agency also revealed that in Nigeria, a total of 11, 536 schools were closed since December 2020 due to abductions and security issues.\n\nIn commemoration of the abduction of 276 school girls in Chibok, UNICEF called on the authorities in Nigeria to make schools safe and provide a secure learning environment for every child in Nigeria, especially for girls, to increase girls\u2019 enrolment, retention, and completion of education.\n\nIn a statement, UNICEF\u2019s representative in Nigeria, Peter Hawkins, said unsafe schools, occasioned by attacks and abduction of students, were reprehensible, describing it as a brutal violation of the rights of the victims to education, and totally unacceptable.\n\nHawkins reiterated that girls had particularly been targeted, exacerbating the figures of out-of-school children in Nigeria.\n\nHe lamented that this had become a trajectory, which must be halted, adding that every hand in Nigeria must be on deck to ensure that learning in Nigeria is not a dangerous enterprise for any child, particularly for girls.\n\nHe added that since December 2020, 1,436 school children and 17 teachers had been abducted from schools, and 16 school children lost their lives.\n\nUNICEF stated, \u201cToday marks eight years since the first known attack on a learning institution in Nigeria on 14 April 2014, in which 276 students at Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, in North-east Nigeria were abducted by a Non-State Armed Group.\n\n\u201cSince then, a spate of attacks on schools and abductions of students, sometimes resulting in their deaths, has become recurrent in the last two years, especially in the North-west and North-central regions of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cUnsafe schools, occasioned by attacks on schools and abduction of students, are reprehensible, a brutal violation of the rights of the victims to education, and totally unacceptable. Their occurrences cut short the futures and dreams of the affected students.\n\n\u201cAttacks on learning institutions render the learning environment insecure and discourage parents and caregivers from sending their wards to schools, while the learners themselves become fearful of the legitimate pursuit of learning.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, a total of 11, 536 schools were closed since December 2020 due to abductions and security issues.\n\n\u201cThese school closures have impacted the education of approximately 1.3 million children in the 2020/21 academic year.\n\n\u201cThis interruption of their learning contributes to gaps in children\u2019s knowledge and skills and may lead to the loss of approximately $3.4 billion in these children\u2019s lifetime earnings.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Union demands scrapping of NITDA over UTAS\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and Francis Sardauna in Katsina\n\n\n\nAs concerns mount over continued closure of government-owned universities nationwide as a result of the strike embarked upon the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has urged the federal government to immediately set up a committee whose target would be to address grievances of the university workers with a view to ending the 59-day old strike.\n\nArising from a meeting with the unions in the universities in Abuja, the NLC said it\u2019s concern was the litany of agreements that government had failed to implement.\n\nIn the communiqu\u00e9 jointly signed by NLC president, Ayuba Wabba and General Secretary, Emma Ugboaja, the congress stated: \u201cIn the light of the foregoing concerns, the meeting resolved to call on the federal government to immediately set up a high-powered panel constituted of members with requisite mandates to resolve within 21 days the foregoing issues militating against industrial harmony in Nigeria\u2019s university system.\n\n\u201cPursuant to the foregoing resolution, the NLC would be convening a special meeting of the Central Working Committee (CWC) of all the affiliate unions of the congress to decide on the next line of action.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, non-teaching staff of universities have resolved to extend their ongoing warning strike, by another two weeks.\n\nAddressing journalists in Abuja, the chairman of the Joint Action Committee of the non-academic staff of universities, Mr. Adeyemi Peters said the unions were displeased by the government\u2019s inaction concerning the workers\u2019 demands despite several reminders.\n\nHe listed a catalogue of grievances bothering on the welfare and funding of the universities, including the arrears of earned allowances,\n\n\u201cIt was at the end of all these reminders with no acknowledgement by the government that we were left with no other resort but to embark on a two weeks warning strike.\n\n\u201cPrior to the strike, due process was duly followed and the notice were issued in line with the extant laws. Shamefully and painfully, there was no attempt by the government to intercept or even invite the unions to a meeting.\n\n\u201cThis aloof and contemptuous attitude of government further incensed our members who resolved that following the failure of government to even invite the leaderships for a meeting, the strike should be extended by another two weeks before an indefinite and total strike is declared.\n\n\u201cAs at today, the two weeks extension is getting to the middle and with no response in sight from government, we may be left with no resort but to embark on an indefinite and total strike. This is gradually becoming unavoidable and inevitable,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the unions were being left with no choice than to call on well-meaning Nigerians and stakeholders in the university system to prevail on government to honour the agreement it freely entered into with the Joint Action Committee of Non Academic Staff Union of Universities (NASU) and Senior Staff Union of Universities (SSANU) in order to avoid a total breakdown of industrial harmony in the Nigeria Universities and Inter-University Centres.\n\nSome of the grievances for which the workers have proceeded on strike include: Non-Payment of Earned Allowances;\n\nNon-Payment of Arrears of national minimum Wage and its Consequential adjustment; Poor funding of state universities;\n\ndelay in renegotiation of the 2009 Agreements; non release of White Papers of Visitation panels; among others.\n\nMeanwhile, ASUU has called on the federal government to scrap the National Information Development Agency (NITDA) over its failure to implement the union\u2019s University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS).\n\nThe Sokoto Zonal Coordinator of ASUU, Jamilu Shehu, while addressing journalists in Katsina yesterday, said the agency should be disbanded with immediate effect.\n\nThe Sokoto Zonal office of ASUU comprises Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua University, Katsina; Usmanu Danfodio University, Sokoto; Kebbi State University of Science and Technology, Aliero; Sokoto State University, Sokoto, and Federal University, Dutsinma.\n\nHe reiterated that NITDA had violated its basic mandate of seeing to the birth of the union\u2019s homegrown software and its deployment in the nation\u2019s public universities.\n\nHe added that the failure of the federal government\u2019s agency to accept UTAS revealed that it lacks capacity and drive to deliver its mandate, \u201cand is incapable of promoting homegrown solutions.\u201d\n\nShehu said: \u201cIt also shows that the agency\u2019s usefulness cannot be ascertained and ASUU calls on the federal government to scrap it with immediate effect or in the least reconstitute it with more clear and cogent mandates.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, for UTAS to score 99.3 per cent during the test run assessment, was good enough to warrant an issuance of certificate of compliance.\n\nThe ASUU zonal coordinator urged Nigerians to disregard what he described as unjustifiable propaganda by NITDA on the status of UTAS integrity test.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Approves N1.4bn for TCN projects\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\n\n\nThe Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu has linked the ongoing crisis facing the nation\u2019s power sector to acts of sabotage being perpetrated by certain criminally minded Nigerians.\n\nBriefing newsmen at the end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja, Aliyu said several recent incidences, including fatal attacks and abduction of foreign workers, who were working on various power projects, had stalled progress in achieving completion on some projects, while other attacks on installations had led to major power cuts.\n\nWhile stressing that the acts of sabotage had been robbing Nigeria of investors and development, Aliyu appealed to Nigerians to join the federal government in combating the war on sabotage, which he said was actually a war for all citizens to wage.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou\u2019re all aware this country is facing a lot of challenges. It\u2019s not only in the power sector alone, you have just heard about the insecurity. The railway and the communities are being attacked, oil pipelines. They\u2019re all similar things, including the power sector.\n\n\u201cYou can call it a sabotage because how can somebody go and pull down 330 (megawatt) tower to cause this havoc to the whole country. What do you call that?\n\n\u201cNot quite long, on January 4, the project that we had announced that we\u2019re going to commission, the Zungeru, 700 megawatts hydro, which is at present over 92 per cent completion, we\u2019re just doing little touches to commission the project. There was an attack on January 4 this year and they abducted the Chinese workers and up till now they\u2019re still with the captives. The Chinese cannot return to work until they get their brothers out.\n\n\u201cSo, they are working minimally, we have like three sites on the whole project; the main dam, which on the 28th of March we have commissioned one of the turbines and passed it, we did the tests and it has passed, it was celebrated. They are working there in the main hydro.\n\n\u201cThen there is a line of over 30 kilometers to a switch yard. So, they\u2019re not working on the switch yard on the line and if they don\u2019t finish these two, you cannot evacuate. Even the turbine that we have commissioned and tested is just a dry testing, you cannot take electricity out because of the line and the tripping point, that\u2019s where the switch yard is and this was where they attacked and killed some people, took away some of them, the foreign workers, about three.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to also work together as a nation to support the leadership, to support the government, to face these challenges together. Any support you can give, give that support.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, corroborated the submission of his Power counterpart stressing that all Nigerians suffer for any act of sabotage affecting public facilities.\n\nHis words: \u201cWhat the Minister of Power is saying is that it\u2019s not really about inefficiency or not caring on the part of the government, but that citizens also have a role to play in this. I don\u2019t know anywhere in the world where people will go and vandalise power stations or they go to the roads and take the railings from the road to go and smelt and make into spoons and aluminum.\n\n\u201cSo really, we must understand that this, whether they are bandits or vandals, they\u2019re not the enemies of just this administration, they are the enemies of Nigeria because they are depriving all of us of power, they are depriving us of peace, they are depriving us of security and I think we all need to look inwards and ask ourselves, are we all So contributing to making Nigerian ungovernable in one way or the other.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a big challenge, I think we should carry this thing to our people. Ask yourselves, the guy who goes at night to go and dig up telecoms cables to go and resell, is that political? That\u2019s sabotage.\n\n\u201cOr the guy that goes out at night to go and remove the transmission lines. Now, we\u2019ll all live to suffer the consequences of such actions\u201d, he said.\n\nThe FEC meeting also approved N1.4 billion for the supply of more equipment for the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), in order to boost power supply in the country.\n\nAliyu, said he presented two memos from the ministry of power for the Transmission Company of Nigeria.\n\nThe first one, he said, was variation of the sum of a contract for 132/33 KV substation at Kafanchan, Kaduna State with a KV line base extension at Jos substation, in Plateau State in the sum of N132,705, 861.42.\n\nAccording to him, the second approval was for the supply of handling equipment and operational vehicles also for the Transmission Company of Nigeria at the cost of N1.3 billion.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe second memo was for the supply of handling equipment, haulage and operational vehicles for the TCN at N1,338,159,080. 88. They are heavy lifting equipment that the TCN requires for doing its work in the store and on the field, while changing equipment and moving transformers and the council graciously approved.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I\u2019m here to make a presentation to our judicial officers, the vehicles that befit their status because I have seen that the Nigerian judiciary is a dependable arm of government, an arm of government that gives hope to the common man, an arm of government that dispenses justice,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m particularly happy and I\u2019m using this opportunity to express my gratitude to the Nigerian judiciary for standing on the side of the law, by standing with the truth.\n\n\n\n\u201cAgainst this background, the people of Cross River state want to show appreciation to the judiciary.

          "text": "A joker in poker is a wild card. It can be flipped; it can substitute and be substituted. And it can just be that jester. Nigeria\u2019s political caravan is saturated with jokers. While some jokers are well aware of their status as factotums of other interests in the political circus, some are just aboriginal jesters taken up in their own vanity and delusion of importance. There are presidential hopefuls and there are presidential jokers.\n\nPeter Obi, former governor of Anambra state and member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), is a presidential joker. I believe Obi knows that he cannot succeed in his presidential expedition under the current political arrangement. The entrenched system which abominates merit is not of his making, but it is an obvious encumbrance to him emerging as the presidential candidate of the PDP. Peter Obi is no match for any of the APC presidential hopefuls \u2014 Bola Tinubu, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, and Rotimi Amaechi. This is an uncomfortable but evident fact.\n\nAs I wrote in a previous column, if it were a sectional contest where only Igbo votes will decide the winner, perhaps, the former Anambra governor will have a chance. But this is a national election where every Nigerian \u2013 north, south, east, west \u2013 will decide the outcome. Obi does not have the requisite community network and he remains suspended on the fringes of political relevance. He does not matter to those who really matter in elections \u2013 the hoi-polloi. But I give it to him, he is a favourite of some Nigerians from the south on Twitter. But there are no polling stations on Twitter.\n\nIt has been speculated that Obi is using the presidential quest as a gambit to negotiate for a vice-presidential position in the PDP \u2013 because he may not get another chance like in 2019 when he was the running mate of Atiku Abubakar, PDP presidential candidate, in the election. According to whispers from party insiders, a running mate from the south-south or south-west may be selected, if the presidential ticket goes to a northern candidate. This is on the assumption that a popular running mate from the south-west can bite into the bloc vote of the APC in the region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAyodele Fayose, former governor of Ekiti state, is another presidential joker. The good thing is, the \u2018\u2019Amala and Ponmo\u2019\u2019 exponent, admits he is a joker. Fayose does not try to be suave or rational about his status as a hoaxer; he is honest about his \u2018\u2019presidential\u2019\u2019 pursuit. He is a political scullion. Fayose knows he is not popular and that he lacks the needed network for presidential nomination and election. He knows it will even take him an effort to win a senatorial election in Ekiti.\n\nBut who is the former governor fronting for? It is alleged that Fayose may be jesting at the behest of the \u2018\u2019grand patron\u2019\u2019 of the PDP \u2013 a certain governor from the south-south. Real contenders in internal party contests often flash jokers to boost their negotiating and electoral chances. The jokers act in the interest of the pied piper while maintaining a fa\u00e7ade.\n\nHowever, Dino Melaye, former senator and the liveried footman of Atiku and Bukola Saraki, accused Fayose of acting in the interest of another godfather in the APC. So, the former governor may not only be a joker but also a spoiler.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is clear from the verbal missiles deployed by Fayose that he was simply de-marketing frontline aspirants in PDP as a counterintuitive strategy to shore up the chances of his political godfather in APC,\u2019\u2019 Melaye said in response to Fayose\u2019s \u2018\u2019demarketing\u2019\u2019 of Atiku and Saraki.\n\nDele Momodu is a presidential joker. Cerebral, cosmopolitan, expansive, yes, he is. In 2011, the CEO of Ovation group ran for presidential office on the ticket of the National Conscience Party (NCP). But he only secured 26,376 votes, coming a distant 11th on the election log. Momodu is vacant of grassroots appeal and appears sequestered from everyday Nigerians. He has a m\u00e9lange of friends in the elite phylum, but not enough political network to swing the presidential pendulum his way. It has been speculated that he is fronting for Saraki.\n\nTunde Bakare is another presidential joker. He said God told him to run for president. Well, I believe the fiery preacher knows the celestials will not be voting in the elections \u2013 only Nigerians. Perhaps, he wants to take the baton from Chris Okotie, the debonair pastor known for running for president every election cycle without getting as much as 50,000 votes.\n\nThere are other persons in the band of presidential jokers. They include but not limited to Cosmo Ndukwe of the PDP, Anyim Pius Anyim of the PDP, Orji Kalu of the APC, Bala Mohammed of the PDP and David Umahi of the APC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are presidential hopefuls and there are presidential jokers.

That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

The final approval was subject to the fulfilment of certain standards of the conditions within six months. This hints that, while MTN has gotten its own approval, Airtel Nigeria could be getting its own soon.\n\nDespite being home to Africa\u2019s largest unbanked population, Nigeria has not witnessed the same exponential growth in mobile money adoption and lags behind its regional peers like Ghana and Kenya when it comes to penetration. In January, MTN revealed that MTN Nigeria\u2019s mobile money service had attracted 9.4 million active users since launching in August 2019.\n\nThis approval is expected to spur the adoption of mobile money in Nigeria as the use cases increase. The widespread coverage of MTN will help it serve people all over the country, especially in rural areas and also position the telecom giant as a competitor for the market share and earnings of commercial lenders.\n\nMTN Nigeria, which provides one-third of the MTN Group\u2019s sales, saw revenue climb to a record \u20a61.7 trillion ($3.4 billion) last year, with profit leaping 45.5% to \u20a6298.9 billion ($598 million).

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Federal Government has said preliminary reports on the Abuja-Kaduna train terror attack have revealed the impact of collaboration between the bandits and dislodged Boko Haram terrorists from the North East.\n\nThe Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, said this Wednesday while fielding questions from State House reporters after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa in Abuja. Mohammed intervened after the Minister of Defence, retired Major General Bashir Salihi Magashi, was asked to provide information on the perpetrators of the train attack.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat is happening now is that there is a kind of an unholy handshake between bandits and Boko Haram insurgents. Preliminary reports of what transpired at the Kaduna train attacks shows that there is a kind of collaboration between the bandits and the dislodged Boko Haram terrorists from the northeast. I can tell you very confidently that the Federal Government on the top of this matter.\u201d\n\nIntense fire from bandits in 2021 caused a Nigerian attack jet to crash in northwestern Zamfara State, but the pilot survived by ejecting from the aircraft, the Nigerian air force has said. Zamfara and neighbouring Kaduna are among the states worst-affected by a surge in criminality including mass abductions of schoolchildren and armed robberies, often carried out by large gangs of outlaws, locally known as bandits, who operate from remote hideouts.\n\nBandits are now members of Boko Haram. The only avenue left for Boko Haram to raise funds now is banditry. Bandits are occupying Zamfara, Katsina, Sokoto, Kebbi, Niger and Kaduna States to raise funds for Boko Haram. Boko Haram is using banditry to infiltrate all parts of Nigeria. Banditry represents the financial wing of Boko Haram to raise funds to finance terror activities. Bandits are terrorists who can raise funds for Boko Haram across Nigeria. Bandits have negotiated with many state governors in the north-west of Nigeria. President Buhari should treat bandits as terrorists. Bandits have participated in kidnappings where ransoms were collected to finance terrorism across Nigeria.. Boko Haram has also been known to raise funds through mass kidnapping of foreigners and civilians for ransom. Boko Haram has a specialized kidnapping task force led by bandits that sets out to abduct school children, politicians, business people, foreigners, rulers and civil servants with the intention of later trading them back for large sums of money or for the return of other Boko Haram militants. Nigeria\u2019s North West is suffering deadly conflict involving many armed organisations which Boko Haram has used to infiltrate the region, including herder-allied groups, vigilantes, criminal gangs and jihadists. The violence has killed many people since 2011, and displaced some people, some into neighbouring Niger. Despite several security operations and dialogue efforts, a durable peace remains elusive.\n\nFrequent acts of violent crime have grown to form a major threat to Nigeria\u2019s national security. These include instances of militancy, insurgency and banditry. Banditry includes cattle rustling, armed robbery and kidnapping for ransom. Kidnapping for ransom has remained the most virulent form of banditry in Nigeria. It has become the most pervasive and intractable violent crime in the country.\n\nKidnapping can be targeted at individuals or at groups. School children have been kidnapped in groups in various parts of Nigeria. Usually, the prime targets of kidnapping for ransom are those considered to be wealthy enough to pay a fee in exchange for being freed.\n\nKidnapping is the unlawful detention of a person through the use of force, threats, fraud or enticement. The purpose is an illicit gain, economic or material, in exchange for liberation. It may also be used to pressure someone into doing something\u2014or not doing something.\n\nNigeria has one of the world\u2019s highest rates of kidnap-for-ransom cases. Other countries high up on the list included Venezuela, Mexico, Yemen, Syria, the Philippines, Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia. Thousands of Nigerians have been kidnapped for ransom and other purposes over the years. Kidnapping has prevailed in spite of measures put in place by the government. The Nigerian police\u2019s anti-kidnapping squad, introduced in the 2000s, has endeavored to stem the menace. But this been to no avail, mainly due to a lack of manpower and poor logistics.\n\nIn my view these efforts have also failed because of weak sanctioning and deterrence mechanisms. Kidnapping thrives in an environment that condones crime; where criminal opportunism and impunity prevail over and above deterrence. This obviously calls for an urgent review of Nigeria\u2019s current anti-kidnapping approach to make it more effective\n\nSimilarly, Boko Haram insurgents have used the proceeds of kidnapping to keep their insurgency afloat. The insurgents engage in single or group kidnapping as a means of generating money to fund their activities. Huge sums are often paid as ransom by the victims\u2019 families and associates to secure their release.\n\nIn addition to militants and insurgents, organized local and transnational criminal syndicates have been involved. This is happening to apocalyptic proportions in North West Nigeria where rural bandits engage regularly in kidnapping in the states of Zamfara, Kaduna, Katsina, Kebbi, Katsina and Sokoto.\n\n________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes from Sokoto State.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

On Monday, he officially declared his ambition.\n\nHowever, the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress and presidential aspirant, Bola Tinubu who declared his ambition in January, met with the governors in Abuja on the same day.\n\nRecall that. last year, when Tinubu was in London on medical leave, the members of the northern caucus of the APC in the House of Representatives visited him where some of them described him as \u201cMr President.\u201d\n\nAs the battle rages on, Osinbajo, Tuesday, met with members of the APC caucus in the Senate. He also met, yesterday, with the House of Representatives Caucus.. The House was led by the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, a political godson of Tinubu who is also an active member of his campaign team.\n\nA Source close to our correspondent disclosed that some of the members loyal to Tinubu may not honour Osinbajo\u2019s invitation.\n\nThe Chairman, Committee on Finance, James Faleke, who is also the Convener of the Tinubu Support Group, told The NIGERIAN OBSERVER that Tinubu remained the candidate of the APC caucus in the House.\n\nFaleke, who represents Ikeja federal constituency, added that he would not be attending the Vice-President\u2019s dinner.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu remains our candidate. I will not be attending the meeting,\u201d Faleke stated.\n\nEarlier at the plenary on Tuesday, a letter of notification was read out by the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, which came from the Majority Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, informing the APC caucus of Osinbajo\u2019s breaking of Ramadan fast (Iftar) and Easter with the lawmakers.\n\nThe Iftar/Easter dinner was scheduled for 6.30 pm at the Aguda House, Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nAlso, Tuesday, Osinbajo invited the APC caucus in the House to the Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa for the Iftar dinner on Wednesday.\n\nThe Deputy Speaker of the House, Ahmed Wase, read the Vice-President\u2019s letter through the Majority Leader, Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, at the opening of plenary on Tuesday.\n\nThe letter to the House caucus read, \u201cIn the spirit of the Holy Month of Ramadan, it will be my great pleasure to host you and all members of the APC caucus in the House of Representatives to the Iftar/Easter dinner on Wednesday, April 13, 2022.\n\n\u201cIt is proposed that members arrive at 6.30 pm, hence arrangements would be made for prayer at the State House Banquet Hall which is also the event venue.\n\n\u201cI will appreciate your very kind assistance in conveying this invitation to all concerns, including persons who are equally welcome to join us for the dinner.\u201d\n\nAlso on Tuesday, groups loyal to Tinubu and Osinbajo told our correspondent that the support of the governors is unwavering.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

They will not succeed. The public knows who is who, and who has done what in our country\u2019s governance.\n\n\u201cMassive gains being made will shortly be manifesting. Large number of arrests have equally been made.\n\n\u201cNigerians are assured that the government will keep its promise to the nation and threats to security will be handled with the firmness they call for.

          "text": "Children of the late popular gospel artiste, Osinachi Nwachukwu have opened up on the despicable horror they and their mother experienced with their father Peter Nwachukwu.\n\nThe children reluctantly opened up to Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen.\n\nOsinachi was the breadwinner of the house. She brought in the money which the husband spent as he liked, giving the woman peanuts.\n\nPeter Nwachukwu frequently beat the woman and the children. Worrisome was that the eldest child who is 12 years old is in primary five and he could barely read.\n\nTheir horrible stories left Pauline Tallen heartbroken.\n\nTallen visited the Abuja home of the deceased on Tuesday to identify with the grief-stricken children and on Wednesday, she spoke about the encounter.\n\nThe minister said, \u201cIt is so traumatizing, so heartbreaking, the death of Osinachi.\n\n\u201cWhen I came into the compound, I saw the children, four beautiful children; three boys, one girl. He (Peter) had told the children that they should not speak about the things that have been happening in the house.\n\n\u201cI came in with all the directors in the ministry. When I was asking questions, I saw that the children were not forthcoming. I excused everyone and said I wanted to have a one-on-one with the children.\n\n\u201cI first spoke with the first son. I asked him, \u2018Do you love your mother?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes\u2019. \u2018Has your mummy taught you to tell lies?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes\u2019. I asked him if she is still alive and he said she is dead. \u2018Do you know that she is now your angel and she is now watching you?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes\u2019. \u2018So, it will be very sad if you tell lies\u2019.\n\n\u201cI introduced myself and I told him the President is concerned, every Nigerian is concerned, we all join them to mourn Osinachi\u2019s death but what we want from him is the truth.\n\n\u201cThen he opened up\u2026 And said that their dad used to beat their mom and their mom was always sad. He would beat her and flog her. He said their father would gather them in the room and be beating them and if the mom comes into the room to stop him, he would turn back on her and beat her up. And that has always been the issue.\n\nThen he opened up\u2026 And said that their dad used to beat their mom and their mom was always sad. He would beat her and flog her. He said their father would gather them in the room and be beating them and if the mom comes into the room to stop him, he would turn back on her and beat her up. And that has always been the issue.\n\n\u201cThey said it was their mom that runs around on her gospel music, comes back with her money, in fact, if the money is paid through (a) bank account, it was paid into his account. She has no account of her own, any money she has, he collects it and gives her just peanut for feeding and when she cooks, he started shouting and beating her. And their mom was living in fear and was always sad.\n\n\u201cIt was such a horrible story from a young boy that is said to be just 12. I asked him what class he is and he said Class Five. At the age of 12? I said, \u2018Why?\u2019 And he said he can\u2019t even read. So, mentally, this child is already destroyed.\n\n\u201cI was battling with tears and when he finished, I called on the second son.\u201d\n\nTallen further said \u201cthe second son repeated the same horrible situation\u201d as well as the third son.\n\nThe minister vowed that justice would be served on the matter as it would be followed to a logical conclusion.",

          "text": "Ahmed Iyanda\n\nMuslim youths have been urged to take up the responsibility to reform society as the contemporary world is immersed in corruption, mischief, and other social vices.\n\nProf. Abdulwahab Tijani urged the youths at the maiden Ramadan Lecture/Iftar organized by Atibyan Online Islamic Foundation held at Excellence Hotel, Ogba Lagos State with the theme \u2018The Reformer: Youth on Call\u2019.\n\nTijani said youths are the leaders of tomorrow and they must be guided against involving themselves in vices to be good ambassadors of Islam.\n\nTijani, who is the grand Chief Imam of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology noted that failure to give children proper home and spiritual training they need at a tender age may lead to regret when they grow up to be adults.\n\nHe said that in this period where social vices are common among the youths, there is a need for parents to give children the moral upbringing and teachings they need to prepare for the future, adding that society is getting more corrupt on a daily basis.\n\nSpeaking further, he said that the only way to get out of this mess is for the parents to equip their children properly at a tender age so that they can be better citizens when they grow old.\n\nAlso, he noted that the high rate of unemployment, and lack of proper Islamic education, among others are reasons why many youths engage in social vices, thereby pleading to the Nigerian government to create jobs for graduates.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a high rate of unemployment in Nigeria, our youths are suffering. First-class graduates find it difficult to get jobs, and If we fail to equip our youths, this country will not be developed, \u201d the cleric added.\n\nThe cleric said the alarming trend of social vices among youths suggested that youths have not been playing their roles effectively in nation-building.\n\n\u201cMuslim youths are a representation of Islam. Internet fraud, known as Yahoo-Yahoo, is now a norm. More pathetic is that some mothers are also backing this abnormality. We have an Association of Yahoo-Yahoo Mothers. Betting is now widely recognized and legalized.\n\nHe, however, urged Muslim youths to pay more attention to self-awareness to stem the tide of social vices in the country, saying they have the biggest role to play in societal reformation.\n\nIn the same vein, The Chief Executive Officer, Our Friend Hospital, Dr. Abdulmujeeb Isa opined that youths must emulate the behaviors of Prophet Muhammed to live a good life.\n\nWhile giving his lecture, the medical doctor tasked the youth to be hardworking, diligent, and committed to contributing positively to the growth and development of the country.\n\n\u201cYouths are the leaders of tomorrow, and if it so, then you must shun drug abuse, and all other social vices that inhibit the progress of the society.\n\n\u201cFor this nation to develop, the younger generation must be committed and resilient in contributing positively to the growth of the society.\n\nHe identified self-destruction, family damage, and societal damage as challenges facing the country.\n\nHowever, he tasked Muslim youth to be productive and be instruments of change.\n\n\u201cYou cannot be an instrument of change if you cannot change yourself,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his part, the Rector of the Foundation, Toyyib Shuaib Atata, urged organizations of young Muslims to rise up and create templates for the development of Nigeria in particular.\n\nAccording to him, AOI is an independent, non-governmental, and non-for-profit humanitarian Organization, with a commitment to supporting and empowering the Muslim community.",

          "text": "Catch Me If You Can, Bauchi Governor, Mohammed Dares EFCC, Other Anti-Graft Agencies To Prove He\u2019s Corrupt\n\nGovernor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State has dared anti-graft agencies that previously investigated him to tell Nigerians if he was found guilty.\n\nBala, who is one of the presidential aspirants of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), said this while addressing members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the opposition party and other stakeholders, on Wednesday.\n\nThe governor challenged the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Independent Corrupt and Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) and other anti-corruption agencies as he seeks to contest for President.\n\nThe EFCC on Wednesday, May 10, 2017, arraigned Mohammed before Justice A. M. Talba of the Federal Capital Territory, High Court sitting in Gudu, Abuja, on 6 counts bordering on abuse of office, false declaration of assets and fraud to the tune of N864 million.\n\nAccording to the EFCC, Bala, while in office as minister, allegedly received N550 million as a bribe from the Aso Savings and Loans Limited with respect to some properties in the Asokoro area of Abuja.\n\nMohammed, however, said if elected, he would not be a northern president, but one who captures the nuanced aspirations of every part of the country.\n\nThe former FCT minister, who is seeking the support of the committee to emerge as the party\u2019s presidential candidate, expressed the belief that the party would pick the most suitable of the 17 presidential aspirants who have so far obtained their nomination and expression of interest forms.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI don\u2019t bear any malice against anybody who investigated me. But I dare anybody to find me guilty because I know my conscience and that\u2019s why I\u2019m still standing here. I dare every investigative agency; I did my best.\u201d\n\nCiting his record in the past three years in office as governor, Mohammed argued that states do not have to be rich before providing infrastructure for their people.\n\nHe also noted that he would not be a partisan president only reflecting the desires of the North but all Nigerians who, he said, need good governance, justice and equity.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s body language as to his preferred candidate for the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has unsettled aspirants including Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, national leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, among others.\n\nIt was gathered that the inability of the aspirants to properly deduce the direction of the president delayed the declaration of some of the aspirants including Osinbajo and Amaechi. While Osinbajo declared on Monday, Amaechi did same at the weekend.\n\nStarting with Tinubu, the presidential aspirants of the ruling party had sought for the blessings of the president before declaring for the race.\n\nThe lack of clarity on the president\u2019s direction, Daily Trust reports, is fuelling agitation among the aspirants and their supporters as the deadline for the conduct of the political parties\u2019 primaries approaches.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had issued a deadline of June 3, 2022, for political parties to conduct their primaries.\n\nSo far, eight aspirants in the ruling party have indicated interest in the president\u2019s seat. They include; Tinubu, Osinbajo, Amaechi, Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, business tycoon Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, a former governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha as well as Ihechukwu Dallas Chima (IDC).\n\nImpeccable sources around the presidency told Daily Trust that Buhari did not object to the plans by all the aspirants to vie for the presidency but that he was keeping close to his chest his preference among the contenders.\n\nThe president had on January 5, this year during an exclusive interview with Channels TV, said he does not care who succeeds him.\n\nHis words: \u201c2023 is not my problem, I don\u2019t care who succeeds me, let the person come, whoever the person is.\u201d He also declined to mention his favourite, saying if the person is named, he would be eliminated.\n\nOne of the sources said the president\u2019s action was causing ripples among the aspirants, their supporters and critical stakeholders of the ruling party.\n\nThe source, a founding member of the APC, said, unlike the party positions, the presidential candidate of the party cannot be singlehandedly handpicked by the president.\n\n\u201cWhat I can tell you is that the scenario that brought Abdullahi Adamu, where the president handpicked him cannot be repeated now. The primaries must be conducted for the party to emerge victoriously in 2023.\n\n\u201cMr President is being mindful of this fact, hence is being careful. In the build up to the 2015 general elections, even when key stakeholders knew that the party ticket was for him (Buhari), we still conducted primaries in Lagos, where he defeated Atiku, Kwankwaso, Bukola (Saraki), Okorocha and others,\u201d the source said.\n\nHowever, another source said the president seems not to be conformable with the candidatures of Osinbajo and Tinubu.\n\n\u201cThis is my reading of him but let me tell you, the odds favour Asiwaju, power is not given, it is taken. He will pick the ticket,\u201d the source said.\n\nPresident in a tight corner\n\nSources said despite his open declaration that he does not care who succeeds him, the president seems to be in a tight corner.\n\nOne of them said those who supported him when he needed it most and their supporters think this is the payback time.\n\nWhile those with Tinubu are saying the president owed them in view of the role played by the former Lagos governor in the victories of Buhari in 2015 and 2019, those in the camp of the vice president believed that his emergence as the running mate did the magic in the 2015 polls.\n\nRecall that Buhari had contested thrice before emerging victory in 2015.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s supporters are also saying that as the number two person in the administration, he should be given the right of first refusal for continuity of the relative success of the APC administration.\n\nOn their part, those in the camp of Amaechi, the former governor of Rivers State are saying that their candidate should be considered in view of the role he played as the director-general of the Buhari\u2019s campaign organisation.\n\nHow Obasanjo picked successor\n\nDaily Trust reports that in the build up to the 2007 general elections, former President Olusegun Obasanjo allowed all the aspirants under the then ruling party, PDP to contest.\n\nThe key aspirants at that time were sitting governors, Peter Odili (Rivers), Ahmed Mohammed Makarfi (Kaduna), Abdullahi Adamu (Nasarawa) and Donald Duke (Cross River), among others to promote their candidatures. But before the presidential primaries of the PDP, Obasanjo threw his weight behind late Umaru Musa Yar\u2019adua who was rounding up his tenure as governor of Katsina State even though he had not indicated interest in the race.\n\nSoon, Obasanjo mobilised the state apparatus to ensure Yar\u2019adua picked the party\u2019s ticket and won the election. The late Yar\u2019adua had during his inauguration accepted the fact the election that brought him to power was flawed.\n\nAnalysts weigh Buhari\u2019s body language\n\nResponding to the issue, a Political Scientist from the University of Ilorin, Dr Isiaq Atanda Abdulwaheed, described President Buhari\u2019s disposition as \u201cvery political\u201d and may spell doom for the party.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhat I think everyone should know for now is the fact that President Buhari has not come out to endorse anybody for the race and this is highly political and shows that he is keenly interested in whoever succeeds him.\n\n\u201cNow, another thing we should learn from this is that if care is not taken, Buhari\u2019s politics may lead to some caucus breaking out of the ruling party.\n\n\u201cThe reason is that, with the way things are going, if the VP, Yemi Osinbajo, gets the APC ticket ahead of Tinubu, which is likely now in the present circumstance, though the dynamics may change along the line, then the party will be facing a very serious issue.\n\n\u201cThe implication is that if the opposition PDP produce a strong candidate with wide acceptability of the people, there is every tendency that they may have a free day during the poll to produce the next president in a violence-free election,\u201d he said.\n\nA public affairs analyst, Comrade Achike Chude warned of a possible implosion in the APC with the number of presidential aspirants that have so far emerged.\n\nChude, who is Deputy National President of the Joint Action Front, a civil society coalition, said the decision of the president not to endorse any candidate could be counterproductive.\n\nAccording to him, the situation is still very complex as all the aspirants that have so far emerged believe the president owes them his support.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur observation of politics in Nigeria is that when candidates going for various political positions go to traditional rulers for endorsement, they bless them and wish them well. In most cases, they do not tell them, \u2018I will support you.\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is what we are seeing with the president. If the president has a candidate, which he has told us he has if you remember during a media chat, he said, \u201cHe has his favourite but he is not going to expose him because he doesn\u2019t want him to be eliminated.\n\n\u201cNow, the debate over that statement was whether the elimination is physical elimination or political elimination. At least, he told us he has a favourite. Now that favourite might be Tinubu, he might be the Vice-President, he might be Pastor Tunde Bakare who has said clearly that he is number 16th President and Buhari is number 15, that when Buhari leaves, he will step in. We don\u2019t know whether it is any of them or any other person that comes out from the APC.\u201d",

On December 28, 2020 he did the 1st and 2nd stage in my family marriage list which bride price happened to be on the 2nd stage which he paid. After he paid my bride price he started maltreating me.\n\n2021 was hell for me that at some point I left home, after everything we settled around November 2021 which he promised he will never beat me again. But still nothing CHANGED.\n\nThis is my reason why I am CALLING OFF the Traditional Marriage (Igba Ngwu) and White Wedding ceremony between me and DAVID OKIKE OFF.

I supposed to be happy but I am not.\n\nFor couple of months now I have been going through a lot.\n\nI have been in a TOXIC RELATIONSHIP for OVER a YEAR now. I am aware that this may be a shock to many people, especially people from my Home Town. My supposed husband HIT and ABUSE me in any slightest provocation, just small misunderstanding without minding what condition I am into.\n\nBecause I have chosen ME and I will not live my entire life facing DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. My supposed husband is full of RAGE, BEATING me with his Belt, Stick, Broom is his DAILY ROUTINE, Many a times he had lifted his hammer \ud83d\udd28 on me and this Monday last week just because of little misunderstanding he beat me mercilessly and on the process of it he rushed into his mother\u2019s kitchen for a cutlass, when I noticed he\u2019s going for a weapon I locked the door behind him which he forcefully opened, both his mother and Sisters and some neighbors were begging him not to cut me with the cutlass \u2026 With all these things and more I am fed up.\n\nI AM CALLING OFF THE WEDDING AND TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE (IGBA NGWU) BETWEEN ME AND DAVID OKIKE that supposed to hold on this Saturday 16th, April 2022.\n\nPlease to my family and friends I am so sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udfff\n\nBut I will not end up with a man who always promise that if I didn\u2019t kill him, that he will kill me.\n\nI am still suffering from unstoppable headache I sustained from the head injury he gave me 3 weeks ago.\n\nThe \u201cbride price paid\u201d will be Returned in due time.\n\nPlease Respect my choices.

          "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government Wednesday said bandits operating in the North-west and parts of the North-central zones now collaborate with Boko Haram terrorists dislodged from the North-east region.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed stated this to journalists after the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the State House Abuja.\n\nThe government\u2019s position is coming days after about 142 persons were killed across 10 villages in Kanam and Wase local government areas of Plateau state.\n\nIt also comes two weeks after the attack by suspected bandits on the Kaduna-Abuja rail track.\n\nPremium Times had reported how the bandits rigged the tracks of the rail lines with explosives, causing damage to the Kaduna bound train, while also shooting sporadically at the passengers on board the train.\n\nAt least eight people were confirmed killed in the attack while others are still missing, according to the Kaduna state government.\n\nThe bandits, a few days later, released a video of the kidnapped victims who were urging the federal government to heed to their demands before they were released.\n\nMinister speaks\n\nBut reacting to the train incident, Alhaji Mohammed said the dislodged terrorists from the North-eastern part of the country were now in collaboration with the bandits who had hitherto operated in the other two zones in the north, adding that the federal government was working hard to put an end to the menace.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening now is that there is a kind of an unholy handshake between bandits and Boko Haram insurgents. Preliminary reports of what transpired at the Kaduna train attacks show that there is a kind of collaboration between the bandits and the dislodged Boko Haram terrorists from the North-east.\n\n\u201cI can tell you very confidently that the federal government is on top of this matter,\u201d he said.\n\nEfforts to release abductees\n\nOn efforts to rescue the kidnapped victims, Minister of Defence Bashir Magashi, who was at the briefing, also said the government was on top of the situation.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I think the security chiefs are working hard to unveil those that are involved, and we will tell you very soon those that are carrying out these attacks.\n\n\u201cBoth Jos and Kaduna, we will come and explain to the public what is really going on and our efforts to ensure that all these activities are stopped once and for all.

          "text": "Another major setback looms in the nation\u2019s education sector as the Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions (NASU) and the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) threaten a total and indefinite strike.\n\nThe Joint Action Committee (JAC) of NASU and SSANU announced this in a communique on Wednesday, amid the ongoing warning strike by the unions.\n\nThey explained that the decision has become necessary following the government\u2019s failure to address the issues that led to the warning strike.\n\n\u201cWe had written no less than 10 letters or reminders to the government to no avail, not even an acknowledgement,\u201d the communique read. \u201cIt was at the end of all these reminders with no acknowledgement by the government that we were left with no other resort but to embark on a two-week warning strike.\n\n\u201cPrior to the strike, due process was duly followed, and the notices were issued in line with the extant laws. Shamefully and painfully, there was no attempt by the Government to intercept or even invite the Unions to a meeting.\n\n\u201cThis aloof and contemptuous attitude of Government further incensed our members who resolved that following the failure of Government to even invite the leaderships for a meeting, the strike should be extended by another two weeks before an indefinite and total strike is declared.\n\n\u201cAs of today, the two weeks extension is getting to the middle and with no response insight from the government, we may be left with no resort but to embark on an indefinite and total strike. This is gradually becoming unavoidable and inevitable.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: NLC Asks FG To Resolve Impasse With ASUU, NASU, Others In 21 Days\n\nSome of the issues that led to the industrial action, according to the unions, include problems of inconsistencies in payment with the Integrated Payroll and Personnel information system (IPPIS), non-payment of earned allowances, and non-payment of arrears of national minimum wage and consequential adjustment, among others.\n\nNASU and SSANU faulted the government for failing to implement an agreement it freely entered into with the unions.\n\nThey also called on Nigerians and stakeholders in the university system to prevail on the government to honour the agreement to avoid a \u2018total breakdown of industrial harmony in the universities and inter-university centres.\n\nRead the full text of the communique below:\n\nJOINT ACTION COMMITTEE OF NASU AND SSANU PRESS CONFERENCE HELD ON WEDNESDAY, 13TH APRIL, 2022 AT BOLTON WHITE HOTEL, ABUJA\n\nOur friends from the Press, this meeting has been called to acquaint you with matters leading to and arising from the ongoing industrial action embarked upon by the Joint Action Committee (JAC) of the Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions (NASU) and the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU).\n\nThis strike, like others before it, was borne out of the insensitivity and non-responsive nature of the Government and its officials to matters affecting the members of the Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions (NASU) and the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) and by extension, the entire University System.\n\nYou will recall that the Joint Action Committee of NASU and SSANU had embarked on an industrial action that started on Friday, February 5th, 2021, and culminated in a Memorandum of Action (MoA) signed on Thursday, February 20th, 2021. Prior to this, we had embarked on a fourteen-day warning strike which culminated in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed on Tuesday, 20th October 2020.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the issues that led to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) of October 2020 and the Memorandum of Action (MoA) of February 2021 are the same issues that have led to this strike action of March 2022. It needs to be said that these same issues had led to previous Collective Bargaining Agreements with the Government in 2017, and 2018 before the agreements reached in 2020 and 2021.\n\nGoing by this, therefore, it is easy to conclude that the recurring cause of industrial unrest in our Universities and Inter-University Centres, especially between the JAC of NASU and SSANU and the Federal Government, has been the total disrespect and contemptuous disregard for Collective Bargaining Agreements by the Government.\n\nWhat are the issues that have led to these strike actions?\n\nThe problem of inconsistencies in Payment with IPPIS;\n\nNon-Payment of Earned Allowances;\n\nNon-Payment of Arrears of National Minimum Wage and its Consequential Adjustment;\n\nPoor Funding of State Universities;\n\nDelay in Renegotiation of the 2009 Agreements;\n\nNon-RELEASE of White Papers of Visitation Panels;\n\nUsurpation of Headship of Non-Teaching Units in clear violation of Conditions of Service and Establishment Procedures; and\n\nNon-Payment of Retirement Benefits to Outgone Members.\n\nThe Problem Of Inconsistencies In Payment With IPPIS\n\nAs had been expressed previously, while other stakeholders had from ab-initio rejected the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System, the Joint Action Committee had embraced the payment platform with the belief that it would stem the tide of corruption in the University system and with the understanding that the peculiarities of the University system would be taken into consideration in its operations.\n\nAlas, having permitted our members to enrol into the platform, what we witnessed was the most haphazard and disorganised pattern of salary application as our members began to receive salaries haphazardly, salaries of clerks paid to Professors and vice-versa, unpredictable salaries, non-issuance of payment advice or payslips, unsubscribed deductions to unknown organizations, non-remittance of payments to third parties especially Cooperative Societies and Unions, etc. The anomalies exposed a new underbelly of centralised corruption in the IPPIS office as against the decentralised corruption perpetrated by some University and Inter-University Centre Managements, which we had fought hard against.\n\nIn view of the pains experienced from IPPIS, we had engaged the Government and at the October 2020 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), agreed that a five-man Committee would carefully address all the concerns raised by the Unions on IPPIS. This did not happen and the Memorandum of Action (MoA) of February 2021 resolved that the committee must hand in its report within one month i.e. March 2021. To date, one year after, we await the outcome of the work of the 5-man committee.\n\nIt should be noted that the 2020 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) raised a challenge for the Joint Action Committee to come up with an alternative platform which we christened University Peculiar Personnel and Payroll System (U3PS).\n\nThis U3PS accommodates all the peculiarities of the university system and is a multi-tenant system that includes employees\u2019 salaries, bonuses, deductions, generation of pay advice and financial reports using accounting best practices. The U3PS is the solution to the problems encountered through IPPIS.\n\nWe have since communicated our desire to present the Payroll System to the Federal Government but to date, after two years of notifying the Government of the existence of the payment platform, we have not been invited for a presentation talk less of accrediting it with the relevant Government agencies.\n\nNon-Payment of Earned Allowances\n\nThe Earned Allowances are products of the FGN/NASU and SSANU 2009 Agreements. Following our industrial action of October 2020 and the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) therefrom, the Government had accepted to pay a sum of N30 Billion Naira being part of the outstanding sum owed for Earned Allowances.\n\nWhile the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) had stated that the criteria for disbursement would be according to the computation from each University and Inter-University Centre in line with what is outstanding for each staff, sadly, when the said sum was released, it was evident that rather than adopt the submissions of Universities and Inter-University Centres, the Federal Ministry of Education in releasing N22 billion adopted a lopsided sharing formula of 75% for ASUU and 25% for other Unions.\n\nPrior to the N22 Billion released late last year, previous disbursements had witnessed the same lopsided sharing formula without recourse to submissions from Universities and Inter-University Centres.\n\nAs responsible Unions, we have always demanded a forensic audit of all disbursements because we are convinced that the manner of disbursements and allocations are tainted with many irregularities which must be corrected going forward because the backlogs being owed our members continue to pile up. It is for this reason that we demand and insist that the N30 Billion originally agreed upon to be paid as part of what is being owed us, be released as a precondition for suspending the strike.\n\nNon-Payment of Arrears of National Minimum Wage and Its Consequential Adjustment\n\nIt would shock Nigerians to hear that four years after the National Minimum Wage was signed into law, the arrears of the payment is being owed to workers in the University system. This has been a thorny issue that the 2020 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and 2021 Memorandum of Action (MoA) addressed.\n\nSpecifically, the 2021 Memorandum of Action (MoA) stated that the amount being owed to Tertiary Institutions including Inter-University Centres was N18,629,473,989.39 (N18.6 Billion) which would be captured in the 2021 supplementary Budget.\n\nIt was also agreed that the money would be processed for payment within a three months time frame. Three months from March 2021 would have been June 2021 and the money was not paid. We have had four three months since March 2021 and all efforts including follow-ups at the Budget Office and other relevant offices have yielded no results.\n\nPoor Funding of State Universities\n\nWe have continually made a case for the strengthening of the supervisory roles of the National Universities Commission to sanction or even deny accreditation to proprietors of Universities who are not meeting up to the personnel obligations of paying their staff, most especially State Governments.\n\nAs of today, many of our members in State Universities are being owed salaries running into arrears of months because of insufficient or zero subventions by State Governors. We had addressed our concerns on this issue in the 2021 Memorandum of Action (MoA) but to date, no action was taken on this. Our request for a meeting with the governors\u2019 forum on this matter has also not attracted any positive response.\n\nDelay in Renegotiation of the 2009 Agreements\n\nWe must admit that perhaps out of all the issues raised in the two Memoranda under reference, only the issue of renegotiations of the 2009 Agreements of NASU and SSANU is under processing.\n\nThese are however too early to conclude because meetings of the renegotiation team chaired by eminent Professor Nimi Briggs have only started. We however hope that tangible results are gotten from the engagements and discussions are not stalled as was the case in the past.\n\nNon-Release of White Papers of Visitation Panels and Constitution of Governing Councils\n\nThe health of our University system is predicated on the assignment of Visitation Panels to the Universities and Inter-University Centres. One year after the Visitation Panels completed their assignments and reports submitted, and despite our continued agitations for release of White Papers, nothing has been done.\n\nWe wish to further add that while the Federal Government had constituted Governing Councils for a number of Universities, Universities of Agriculture have been without Governing Councils for upward of a year now leading to dislocations in the Governance of those specialised Universities.\n\nUsurpation of Headship of Non-Teaching Units in clear violation of Conditions of Service and Establishment Procedures\n\nUsurpation of Non-Teaching staff positions by academic staff has been an issue that we are very passionate about because of its truncation of the careers of our members. This was assured to be addressed in the 2021 Memorandum of Action (MoA) but to date, nothing has been done.\n\nNon-Payment of Retirement Benefits of Outgone Members\n\nConcerted effort has not been put in the payment of retirement and death benefits to our retired and outgone members and the hardship caused by inexplicable delays in payment of retirement and death benefits to retired and departed staff is excruciating.\n\nThese anomalies were pointed out to the Government and in the signed Memorandum of Action (MoA) of February 2021, it was agreed that within three months-timeline, efforts will be made to correct the anomalies. To date, nothing concrete has been done on the matter.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe above issues among others represent the core of our disagreement with the Government. Arising from the last memorandum and following up on the issues, we had written no less than ten letters or reminders to the Government to no avail, not even an acknowledgement.\n\nThe letters of reminder included those dated 26th July 2021; 18th August 2021; 25th October 2021; 22nd November 2021; 24th February 2022; 1st March 2022 and 16th March 2022.\n\nIt was at the end of all these reminders with no acknowledgement by the Government that we were left with no other resort but to embark on a two-week warning strike. Prior to the strike, due process was duly followed, and the notice were issued in line with the extant laws.\n\nShamefully and painfully, there was no attempt by the Government to intercept or even invite the Unions to a meeting. This aloof and contemptuous attitude of the Government further incensed our members who resolved that following the failure of the Government to even invite the leadership for a meeting, the strike should be extended by another two weeks before an indefinite and total strike is declared.\n\nAs of today, the two weeks extension is getting to the middle and with no response in sight from Government, we may be left with no resort but to embark on an indefinite and total strike. This is gradually becoming unavoidable and inevitable.\n\nTo say we are saddened by the developments is putting it mildly; it is unbelievable that a Government cannot live up to its honour by implementing an agreement it freely entered into. It is a sorry path that we had avoided but being left with no choice, we have brought our agitation to you with a view to presenting them to the world.\n\nWe call on well-meaning Nigerians and stakeholders in the University System to prevail on Government to honour the agreement it freely entered into with the Joint Action Committee of NASU and SSANU in order to avoid a total breakdown of industrial harmony in the Nigeria Universities and Inter-University Centres.\n\nThank you.",

We don\u2019t just know how to run the race and take care of the gear of progress,\u201d Tinubu said at the event hosted by the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon.

I am one. I am the first governor to grant autonomy to the House of Assembly. I survived non-allocation of local government funds. We didn\u2019t suffer, we didn\u2019t retrench. We made progress out of adversity.\n\n\u201cI inherited N600m as Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) with zero allocation from Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC). But we survived and today, Lagos is number one economy.\n\n\u201cThat is why I am begging you to do me a favour so that I can do Nigeria a favour.\n\n\u201cIt is a very challenging time for us in the country and we have to get it right. We need to intellectually interrogate ourselves.\n\n\u201cI am the first governor to bring Independent Power Project (IPP) to Nigeria. It was 300 megawatts. If they had followed my advice then, Nigeria will not be facing epileptic power supplies,\u201d he said recalling how he brought major investors to Nigeria and promising that he is ready to do it again.\n\nTinubu also said he believed in religious tolerance and women\u2019s participation in politics.\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who was a guest of honour at the parley, described Tinubu as his mentor and benefactor.\n\nHe also urged the legislators to key into the desire to make Nigeria a better country with Tinubu as President.\n\nSpeaking with his colleagues, Dr. Obasa described Tinubu as a true democrat.\n\n\u201cI am standing here before you because Asiwaju is a talent hunter. He is someone that would support you, raise you to a point of leadership and give you room to excel.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that he is the brain behind the legislative autonomy that we enjoy today at the Lagos State House of Assembly and he did this far before the clamour for it by other states.\n\n\u201cSo we can see that he is a person that will support the legislative arm of government to remain strong.

          "title": "East Africa, Horn of Africa Prepare for Worst Drought in Decades",
          "text": "Agricultural workers in the east and Horn of Africa are preparing for their most severe drought in 40 years, as authorities warn that higher temperatures and less than normal rainfall was recorded by weather agencies in March and April this year.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Authority on Development said rains will likely fail for a fourth consecutive year, triggering fears of increased cases of malnutrition, threats to livelihoods and severe risks for 29 million people in the region. Meteorologists are linking the unfolding drought to human-caused climate change which is leading to increased warming in the Indian Ocean, causing more frequent cyclones.\n\nLike most of Africa, the east and the Horn\u2019s economic mainstay is agriculture, which is rain-fed, making it vulnerable to extreme weather events. Mama Charity Kimaru, who practices mixed farming by rearing livestock and planting cereals and vegetables in her 30-acre farm in Nyandarua, some 80 miles (126 kilometers) north of Nairobi, is among the farmers who are preparing for the worst outcomes. Kimaru says that increased temperatures recorded over the past few months have denied her livestock pasture and the crops she had planted in anticipation of the long rains season have failed.\n\nThe weather agency previously said in February that the region should prepare for a \u201cwetter than average\u201d long rains season, which normally pours from March to May, but the agency revised its previous forecasts this week.\n\n\u201cThe March, April, May rains are crucial for the region and, sadly, we are looking at not just three, but potentially four consecutive failed seasons,\u201d Workneh Gebeyehu, the executive secretary of the intergovernmental agency, said. \u201cThis, coupled with other stress factors such as conflicts in both our region and Europe, the impact of COVID-19, and macro-economic challenges, has led to acute levels of food insecurity across the greater Horn of Africa.\u201d\n\nBelow average rainfall for 2022 are likely to prolong the already extremely dry conditions which have not been experienced to this degree since 1981. Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia \u2014 which will be severely impacted by the reduced rains \u2014 are already in the midst of a dire famine.\n\nLack of rainfall during the short rains season late last year and the ongoing drought during the current long rains season has already led to crop failures and livestock deaths, causing high food prices and intercommunal conflicts over scarce pasture and dwindling water resources.\n\n\u201cWhenever we have intense cyclones in the Southwest Indian Ocean, we always prepare for a long drought season in eastern and the Horn regions,\u201d Evans Mukolwe, the former science director at the U.N., said. \u201cThis is because the cyclones suck much of the moisture depriving the region of the much-needed precipitation. It has been the pattern for decades.\u201d\n\nAid organizations are already concerned about how worsening climate change impacts will affect the region in future decades.\n\n\u201cThis is not the Horn\u2019s first drought, nor is it likely to be its last,\u201d said Sean Granville-Ross, the regional director for Africa for the aid agency Mercy Corps. \u201cAs the climate emergency worsens, droughts will become more frequent and severe. People affected by climate change cannot wait for one crisis to end before preparing for the next.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe international response must prioritize immediate needs while allocating additional resources to long-term, smart interventions that will result in long-term change and assist communities in becoming more drought-resistant.\u201d\n\nThe U.N. humanitarian office warned last week that the current drought \u201crisks becoming one of the worst climate induced emergencies in recent history in the Horn of Africa.\u201d It also said that the $1.5 billion drought response appeal required to assist some 5.5 million people in Somali remains seriously underfunded.",
          "summary": "Meteorologists are linking the unfolding drought to human-caused climate change which is leading to increased warming in the Indian Ocean, causing more frequent cyclones.\nLike most of Africa, the east and the Horn\u2019s economic mainstay is agriculture, which is rain-fed, making it vulnerable to extreme weather events.\nKimaru says that increased temperatures recorded over the past few months have denied her livestock pasture and the crops she had planted in anticipation of the long rains season have failed.\n\u201cWhenever we have intense cyclones in the Southwest Indian Ocean, we always prepare for a long drought season in eastern and the Horn regions,\u201d Evans Mukolwe, the former science director at the U.N., said.\nIt has been the pattern for decades.\u201dAid organizations are already concerned about how worsening climate change impacts will affect the region in future decades.",

          "text": "The governor of Benue State in Nigeria\u2019s North-Central region Samuel Ortom accused the Muhammadu Buhari administration of pretending not to notice the unremitting killings of innocent Nigerians. Ortom, who spoke during an interview in Makurdi, also alleged plans by the government to yield power to criminal elements.\n\nOrtom spoke on Wednesday in Makurdi during an interview with reporters at the Benue Peoples House, following the attack on two communities in the state where more than 23 persons were killed in their sleep by militia Fulani herdsmen.\u201d He said, \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d\n\nSuspected Fulani herdsmen had invaded and killed eight persons in Mbadwem in Guma local government and 16 in Tiortyu, a sprawling settlement in Tarka local government, along Makurdi-Gboko road.\n\nOrtom described the attacks as \u201cunfortunate and the height of impunity.\u201d\n\nHe accused Buhari\u2019s APC government of turning a blind eye and paying lip service to the cries of the Benue people, \u201cAs the herdsmen continue to invade our communities and kill innocent people.\u201d\n\nThe governor recalled how he had alerted Nigerians and the federal government on the murderous activities of the Fulani terrorists for many years, \u201cYet they didn\u2019t believe me. Now, they are gradually taking over every space in the country. We are now sharing our sovereignty with terrorists.\u201d\n\nOrtom alleged that the plan of the herdsmen and their sponsors was to send the people away from their ancestral homes, take over the lands, and cause confusion in the country so that the forthcoming elections would not hold.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI suspect that very soon, some states will be completely taken over by these Fulani men called bandits. I suspect that very soon, even the Presidential Villa will be handed over to them. I suspect strongly that this is their plan and so nobody should deceive me.\u201d\n\nThe governor said he was old enough to understand the agenda of the terrorists Fulani against Nigeria because, as he put it, \u201cit is a plan to hand over to these Fulani men who are called bandits so there will be no election.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to good spirited Fulani men and those who had the ears of the president to persuade him to stop the evil going on in the country.\n\nOrtom warned that if nothing was done, the people would resort to self-help, which would throw the country into anarchy.",
