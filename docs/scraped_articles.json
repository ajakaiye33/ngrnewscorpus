          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has warned Prince Dotun Babayemi to stop further legal action against the Governor-elect, Sen. Ademola Adeleke, in the overall interest of the party.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that Babayemi contested in the PDP primary in Osun that produced Adeleke as its candidate for the July 16 election.\n\nAdeleke later in the governorship election defeated the incumbent, Gov. Adegboyega Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress.\n\nThe warning is contained in a statement signed by the caretaker Chairman of the PDP in Osun, Dr Akindele Adekunle, on Sunday in Osogbo.\n\nThe party, in the statement, specifically frowned at \u201capparent attempt by the former aspirant to become a tool of the APC to truncate the overwhelming victory of PDP at the governorship poll\u2019\u2019.\n\nIt described as worrisome Babayemi\u2019s refusal to listen to calls by elders of his group who urged him to discontinue legal challenge of the PDP primary in Osun.\n\n\u201cWhile the aspirant had filed several cases and failed to upturn due process decision of the party, the party noted that the last ruling of the Court of Appeal should put paid to further litigation on the primary.\n\n\u201cAny decision to pursue the issue further will smack of open anti-party activity and a direct disrespect for the people of Osun state who voted massively for Sen. Ademola Adeleke,\u2019\u2019 it said.\n\nThe party described as a very dangerous and self-destructive dimension the alleged collaboration between Babayemi and the APC to continue the case, affirming that such evil alliance would end in further legal defeat.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning of the litigation to date, it was obvious the aspirant was only holding unto straws as the primary that produced Sen. Adeleke fulfilled all extant regulations and legal requirements in line with the Electoral Act among others,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nNAN reports that the PDP in Osun had on March 8 held two parallel governorship primary elections in the state.\n\nIn one of the primaries held at the Osogbo City Stadium, under the supervision of Deputy Governor of Bayelsa, Mr Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, as Chairman, Sen. Ademola Adeleke was declared the winner.\n\nHowever, the other primary held at the Women and Children Development Initiative Foundation (WOCDIF) Centre, Osogbo, produced Prince Dotun Babayemi as the winner.\n\nIn a list of candidates later released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Adeleke emerged as the flag bearer of the PDP.\n\nBabayemi, however, approached the Federal High Court, Osogbo, challenging the PDP\u2019s nomination and submission of Adeleke\u2019s name to INEC and the validity of the governorship primary conducted at the stadium.\n\nThe case was, however, dismissed at the Federal High Court Osogbo, as well as the Appeal Court in Akure.\n\nAdeleke later won the governorship election on July 16 with 403,371 votes to defeat his closet rival, Gov. Gboyega Oyetola, the candidate of the APC, who scored 375,027 votes.\n\nBut in a swift reaction, the Babayemi Campaign Organisation said that the redress being sought at the law court was not to truncate the victory of PDP at the recently concluded governorship election, but rather to ensure it translates to good governance.\n\nThe campaign organisation in a statement signed by its Director, Oladiran Ojedele, said that Babayemi was out for justice with a view to claiming his mandate.\n\nIt said \u201chaving explored all internal mechanisms of the party to no avail, the option left as spelt by the party\u2019s constitution is to seek justice through the judiciary.\n\n\u201cOur symbol, Prince Dotun Babayemi, is not seeking to truncate PDP\u2019s victory, but he\u2019s out for justice, seeking to claim his mandate at the law court.\n\n\u201cIs such lawful trajectory out of place? For all those who are now crying wolf, what genuine efforts did they make to ensure the PDP is not exposed to litigation?\n\n\u201cAt this point, we want to assure everyone that Prince Dotun Babayemi is a genuine and bonafide member of the PDP who will not, for any price, submerge the wishes of the people.\n\n\u201cHe has never pretended on his resolve to always be with and for them\u201d.",

Two among the assailants approached him while the others kept watch in case of a reprisal. Then one thing led to another. They shot him and took away his Hajoue motorcycle.\u201d\n\nBarely an hour after they killed Ibrahim on his farm at Kore village, the terrorists attacked a commercial coastal bus belonging to Katsina State Transport Authority (KSTA) and killed it\u2019s driver identified as Nasir Yushau.\n\nThe incident which occurred between 12:00 noon to 1pm on the weekly Jibia market day involved a state government-owned commercial coaster bus with registration number KT 14D-58 KT.\n\nThe KSTA Coastal Bus with full load of passengers was heading to Katsina from Jibia when the hoodlums attacked it and killed the driver. Some passengers were also reported to have secure gun wounds in the attack and are currently receiving treatment at the hospital.\n\nConfirming the report, Managing Director, KSTA, Alhaji Haruna Musa said the hoodlums were passing by when the driver bumped into the marauding bandits\n\nHowever, contrarily to reports from some quarters that all the passengers inside the coastal bus and several other persons were abducted, Alhaji Musa noted that nobody else was shot nor kidnapped by the bandits.\n\n\u201cThe vehicle was heading to Katsina from Jibia to Katsina, at about 11a.m when he ran into the bandits. Immediately the driver saw them, he tried to stop and go back.\n\n\u201cBut unfortunately to him, one of the tires of the vehicle was hooked by sands, that was how they shot him to death, and the passengers started running.\n\n\u201cThe bandits collected the phones and other things belonging to some of the passengers before leaving the scene.\n\n\u201cThe conductor of the vehicle who narrated to us what actually happened said none of the passengers was kidnapped by the bandits and we have not heard any such report of kidnapped person.\n\n\u201cSince then, we have not heard any report that one of the passengers in the car is missing during the attack,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Katsina-Jibia road where the hoodlums stage the attack is said to have no fewer than 20 security check points, including those of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and the police.",

          "text": "The Director General of the National Biosafety Management Agency(NBMA), Dr. Rufus Ebegba, has restated that all approved Genetically Modified Organisms(GMOs) or food crops in Nigeria are safe for human consumption.\n\nEbegba stated this in Abuja at the Science Hangout organised by Alliance for Science Nigeria in collaboration with NBMA and Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology(OFAB), with the theme, \u201cNigeria\u2019s Biosafety Regime for GMOs.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the approved genetically modified foods had been subjected to rigorous process and scrutiny before they were released for use.\n\nAccording to him, before the official release of GMOs, it would take up to 13 years of rigorous process, to do a risk assessment on the issues of culture, environment, and human health, among others.\n\nHe noted that his Agency has approved the commercial release of Bt.cotton and Pod Borer Resistant (PBR) cowpea, as the Agency has also reviewed various applications for confined trials of cassava, maize and rice.\n\nHe also revealed that the Agency has developed policies, and guidelines as well as acquired a GMO detector laboratory, which is used to ascertain whether any product is safe or not.\n\nHe pointed out that following the amendment of the Act establishing NBMA in 2019, the Agency has been given more mandate to regulate gene editing and gene drive.\n\nWhile stressing the importance of modern biotechnology to the development of the economy, Ebegba contended that the burgeoning population of Nigeria should not be a disadvantage but rather an advantage, if properly managed.\n\nHe said: \u201cI say this with all authority, biosafety is an economic enabler. The world cannot attain a green economy without the application of safe modern biotechnology.\n\n\u201cThe increase in Nigeria\u2019s population is not a disadvantage. It is an advantage.\n\n\u201cHuman labour is available. All that we need to do is to harness what we have and feed everybody.\n\n\u201cThe issue of crime will be reduced. Science and Technology can reduce crime. It can solve the energy crisis we have.\u201d\n\nAs part of measures to ensure the independence of the Agency in the discharge of its statutory responsibilities, he disclosed that NBMA has not relied on international donor funding.\n\n\u201d We don\u2019t want to depend on donors. It is said that he who pays the piper, dictates the tune. They will direct us to do what they want.\n\n\u201cSo, on the issue of biosafety, the Federal Government has given us enablement, resources, even though not enough.\u201d\n\nEbegba, therefore, tasked journalists to be factual in their science reportage to forestall misinforming the public, while assuring that the doors of the Agency are wide open to clarify issues on biosafety.\n\nIn her remarks, Dr. Rose Gidado, Country Coordinator, Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology(OFAB) in Africa, Nigeria Chapter, expressed joy at the giant strides made in the application of agricultural biotechnology in Nigeria.\n\nGidado noted that a delegation from Ghana was recently in Nigeria to understudy the milestones recorded in the country\u2019s efforts to use agricultural technology to feed her teeming populace.\n\nShe underscored the need for the deployment of science and technology to mitigate the plethora of challenges confronting the agricultural sector as well as ensure nutritional enhancement.\n\nShe argued that some people reject genetically modified products due to ignorance while acknowledging that at the inception of GMOs, there was no adequate communication to the public on the benefits of the technology.\n\nIn his welcome remarks, Mr. Opuah Abeikwen, Coordinator, Alliance for Science Nigeria(ASN), explained that the group is a body of stakeholders who seek to promote access to scientific innovation as a means of enhancing food security, improving environmental sustainability and raising the quality of life of Nigerians.\n\nAbeikwen observed that despite the major breakthroughs in modern biotechnology, there is still a public misunderstanding of its benefits.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe concept of biotechnology and biosafety is sophisticated and public enlightenment on its use, benefits and contributions are crucial to enhance food security and ensure its successful adoption.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the challenge of food insecurity is a fundamental problem that requires urgent attention, quoting the recent report of the Food and Agriculture Organisation(FAO), which predicts that the food crisis would affect 19.4 million Nigerians in 21 States between June and August 2022.\n\nAbeikwen pointed out that agricultural biotechnology appears to have provided answers to a myriad of challenges confronting the agricultural sector.\n\nButtressing the argument, he said, with the simple techniques in biotechnology, crops are developed to resist pests, withstand drought as well as increase productivity.\n\n\u201cIt is on this basis that the Federal Government established the National Biotechnology Development Agency(NABDA) in 2001 to lead the country on how to leverage this technology to solve some of the obstacles in the food chain.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, to demonstrate the nation\u2019s commitment to tackling the food crisis that is threatening the citizenry, the Federal Government later in 2015, established the National Biosafety Management Agency as part of the legal requirement to superintend over the deployment and use of this technology in a manner that is in line with global best practice.\n\n\u201cSince then, so much has been achieved with regard to their various mandates. NBMA for example, distinguished itself in 2019, when it approved the Pod Borer Resistant cowpea, commonly referred to as beans.\n\n\u201cWith this action, Nigeria joined other countries like South Africa that have approved genetically modified food crops in Africa,\u201d he explained.",

I\u2019m a proud Mushin girl. I was playing for FC Robo, and I will never forget what coach Osahon used to tell us. That we have to learn to adapt wherever we found ourselves. I learned the meaning of focus under him. He would say it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from, what matters is your destination.\u201d\n\nTruly, her story has been that of grass to grace, rising from the slum of Mushin to grace European soccer in the colours of one of the biggest teams on the continent.\n\nRasheedat left FC Robo financed by teammate and Barcelona forward Asisat Oshoala, for Norwegian side Avaldnes IL in 2018. Two years later, she left the club for the Spanish club side, Atletico de Madrid Femenino. She won the most valuable player at the 2017 edition of the Asisat Oshoala Foundation Football4Girls and she went on to represent Nigeria twice at the U-17 and U-20.\n\nShe was named in the WAFU team that finished third in 2018 and was named in the title-winning Nations Cup team later that year. Ajibade was named in Nigeria\u2019s team that got to the second round of the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in 2019.\n\nRasheedat is also a consummate scholar with two degrees to her credit.\n\nShe, who obtained her first degree in Accounting in Nigeria, before securing the second in Europe, thanks to the global lockdown, said she came from a family that doesn\u2019t joke with education.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Caf website, Ajibade, who has a degree in Accounting and Sports Psychology, explained why she had to delay her move into professional football.\n\n\u201cMy family likes education. I feel like I had to finish my degree first. It was important for me to finish school because I was also underage to move abroad so it was a bit challenging because when I saw people that I was older than playing in Europe \u2013 while I was still playing in Nigeria \u2013 it was tough,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut when things like this happen, you have to know the right time to make a move. When you believe in God, things align and fall into place.\n\n\u201cEducation is very important because you can fall back to it after you are done playing football.\n\n\u201cIt is by God\u2019s grace. It would help if you had the discipline and you have to be focused, and train hard. Everything is still God\u2019s grace because I know where I came from and all, and to represent my country in underage football and the national team, it\u2019s hard work and God\u2019s grace.\u201d\n\nThe 21-year-old forward has a degree in Sports Psychology from the Barca Innovation Hub, and when asked how difficult it was for her to study while playing active football, she said it was down to determination.\n\nShe continued: \u201cI made up my mind to do it, and it was a little easy because I was studying from home due to the pandemic. In the end, I finished and I thank God. I want to do more, get more certificates\u201d\n\nIn the absence of Oshoala, who could not play due to injury, at the 2022 Women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON), Ajibade was impressive, as she actively stepped into line.\n\nAjibade\u2019s smart header and the lone goal in the quarter-final match between Nigeria and Cameroon secured the World Cup ticket for the nine-time Africa champions-Super Falcons in Morocco.\n\nAfter a goalless first half at the Stade Mohammed V in Casablanca, the Atletico Madrid forward powered the West Africans to victory in the 53rd minute \u2013 heading Ifeoma Onumonu\u2019s cross past goalkeeper Ange Bawou.\n\nAjibade, who has three goals to her name, and was named player-of-the-match, later took to social media to celebrate.\n\nRelishing the triumph and qualification for the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup, to be co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia, she wrote on her Twitter handle: \u201cEvery time I call, he answers me. My help comes from the Lord. Naija, we are going to the World Cup.\u201d\n\nThough she was red-carded in the semi-final clash against host country Morocco, Ajibade said she was proud of her accomplishment at the championship.\n\nShe looked back at her humble background to declare her love for God and excellence.\n\nThe Atletico Madrid attacker was also instrumental to the Super Falcons\u2019 defeat of the Swallows of Burundi as she grabbed a goal and a hat-trick of assists.",

          "title": "Outrage over video of terrorists brutalising Abuja-Kaduna kidnap victims",
          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo, Sunday Ani and Chukwudi Nweje, Chinenye Anuforo, John Adams, Minna, Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja and Agaju Madugba, Katsina\n\nNigerians have expressed outrage over a video showing kidnapped passengers aboard the Abuja-Kaduna train being whipped by terrorists who abducted them.\n\nIn the viral video, the insurgents suspected to be members of Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) also threatened to abduct President Muhammadu Buhari and Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna State.\n\nOn March 28 terrorists attacked a train going to Kaduna from Abuja, killed eight, injured many, and kidnapped over 60 persons. Eleven of 61 remaining victims were released following negotiation in June.\n\nA video released in the early hours of yesterday showed the kidnapped passengers sitting on the floor in the bush, and surrounded by their captors, who brutalised them.\n\nOne of the captives spoke on behalf of the other victims, accusing government of being insensitive to their plight while an elderly woman among them was seen crying and pleading with the Federal Government to rescue them. One of the insurgents said the captives would be sold off as slaves if their demands are not met by the government.\n\nSpeaking in Hausa, he said the authorities must meet their demands or they will kill some of the captives.\n\n\u201cThis is our message to the government of Nigeria and just as you have seen these people here, by God\u2019s grace, you will see your leaders; your senators and governors will come before us. These ones you are seeing here, we will keep some as our slaves and sell them off just as our Imam told you in the past.\n\n\u201cJust like the Chibok girls that were sold off, we will equally sell these ones as slaves. If you don\u2019t adhere to our demands, we will kill the ones we need to kill and sell the remaining.\n\n\u201cBy God\u2019s grace, el-Rufai, Buhari, we will bring them here.\u201d\n\nMeanwhle, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Ijaw Monitoring Group (IMG), Arewa Youths Consultative Forum (AYCF), Aka Ikenga and others have condemned the government for not acting promptly to rescue the abductees. On social media, more Nigerians have also expressed outrage.\n\nNational President of MBF, Bitrus Pogu, said military has the capacity to flush out the terrorists but that President Muhammadu Buhari who is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces is not willing to end insecurity.\n\nHe accused the government of dishonesty in the fight against terrorism.\n\n\u201cIs the government honestly telling Nigerians that they don\u2019t have intelligence on the location of these terrorists when Sheikh Gumi visits them at will? If the government knows their location and has allowed them to be killing Nigerians, then, government has failed. When former President Goodluck Jonathan was there, he brought mercenaries that almost wiped out the Boko Haram terrorists but he lost the election, otherwise the issue of terrorism would have been history in Nigeria by now.\n\n\u201cThe president is not willing, he is playing games and I believe some of the statements he made during the period of Jonathan is what is playing out. If you check the internet, you will find statements like \u2018You are killing our people\u2019, \u2018The fight against Boko Haram is a fight against the north\u2019. If this was the attitude before he became president, certainly, he would treat them with kid gloves and this thing would never end,\u201d Pogu said.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, said what the terrorists did showed the level of deterioration of the current government.\n\n\u201cThese are signals and effects of poor governance. They are not causes but effects of mis-governance. Nigerians are in quagmire and it is a pity,\u201d he said.\n\nElder statesman, Tanko Yakassai, told Daily Sun that the level of insecurity did not come as a surprise because Buhari has not shown any capacity to tackle it.\n\n\u201cYou have asked me years ago about insecurity and I told you that I don\u2019t expect anything positive from Buhari and I remember saying that he has no capacity to tackle the problem and so far, nothing has happened to change my mind. In fact, it has now been confirmed from the experience that this country has been going through that he doesn\u2019t have the capacity,\u201d Yakassai said.\n\nAn aggrieved All Progressive Congress (APC) chieftain in Niger state, Mr. Jonathan Vatsa, also lambasted President Buhari, saying the APC government has failed Nigerians in all ramifications.\n\n\u201cNo matter the so-called achievements, any government that failed to protect the lives and properties of the citizens has failed the people and should honorably apologise to the people because African leaders don\u2019t resign from office.\n\n\u201cDo we still a government in the country? This is huge embarrassment not only to this government but the entire Nigerians home and in diaspora. There is no country in the world where a government will watch and deliberately refuse to protect the lives of It citizens like the current situation in Nigeria. It is unfortunate that this government that the Nigerian masses brought into power through their votes will create an impression in the minds of Nigerian that the Nigerian Army and other security agencies have no power to secure the release of this train victims and other kidnapped victims across the country. I think this a deliberate plan to enrich a particular ethnic tribe through proceeds of crime and criminality,\u201d he alleged.\n\nThe former APC publicity secretary and commissioner for information, culture and tourism in Niger State, particularly accused the president for always issuing political directives to security agencies through their heads without any action, stressing that \u201cthese directives to security heads always ended in Aso Rock.\u201d\n\nPresident of the AYCF, Alhaji Yerima Shettima, agreed that the government has failed.\n\n\u201cOne cannot imagine that after three months, those people will still be in captivity and the government is relaxing, campaigning and talking about 2023. It is so annoying that we no longer attach any value to human life. There should be a clarion call for all Nigerians to begin to get ready because we can\u2019t continue like this. I believe we will continue to rub minds. Nigerians will have to speak out. This is a moment to chart a new course for this country because this cannot continue. The responsibility of any government is to provide safety for the citizens; anything short of that means there is no government. We can\u2019t afford to continue like this because we are not in a Banana republic. This wasn\u2019t the mandate given to the APC government; something must be done immediately to arrest the situation. We can\u2019t continue like this,\u201d he submitted.\n\nCoordinator of IMG, Joseph Evah, described it as a sad development and tasked government to bring out money to rescue the remaining victims from the terrorists\u2019 den.\n\n\u201cNow, some of the victims have been rescued. Why can\u2019t the Federal Government pay money to rescue the remaining ones? Are they saying that those that have been set free after money was paid are more Nigerian than those still in captivity that are now being flogged?\u201d he queried.\n\nFormer president of Aka Ikenga, Chief Goddy Uwazurike, equally agreed that indeed, President Buhari has failed in his primary responsibility under the constitution.\n\nHe noted that terrorism had persisted because the Federal Government and its security agencies have not brought the full weight of law on them.\n\n\u201cRemember, the primary responsibility of the government under the constitution is the security and welfare of the citizens. President Buhari has failed to guarantee that. Seven and half years ago when Buhari came to power, he made three promises \u2013 to fight insecurity, improve the economy and tackle corruption; he has not done that. So, indeed, he has failed,\u201d he said\n\nHe also accused the Buhari-led administration of emboldening the terrorists by treating them with kid-gloves.\n\nOn social media, more Nigerians also expressed outrage with rights activist, Aisha Yesufu said: \u201cUntil we realise that terrorist attack to anyone anywhere is terrorist attack to everyone everywhere, we will continue to be victims to terrorists and uncaring governments.\u201d\n\nWhile Senator Shehu Sani said: \u201cThere has never been any successful rescue operations for most mass kidnappings of students, farmers or passengers in Kaduna, other than ransom payments by families. That is why terrorists in this video called the committee set up by the government as \u2018Tea drinking committee\u2019.\n\n\u201cWhen terrorists post video clips of the torture of their victims, they are waging a psychological war to bring attention to their demands. We don\u2019t have a thick forest in the North West to warrant four months of this ordeal. Time is of essence for the government to act now.\u201d\n\nWhy we\u2019re cautious in rescue efforts \u2013 Presidency\n\nThe Presidency, yesterday, assured that the military is not relenting in its efforts to rescue the remaining of the victims.\n\nA statement by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the Presidency explained that if the military should go by the popular call for carpet bombing of the known locations, it will only assuage the desire of an angry public for revenge, but pit the hostages in danger.\n\n\u201cTerrorist activity using propaganda and the use of violence to force governments to accept or submit to political demands is not new all over world.\u201d\n\nHe assured that the country\u2019s security and defence forces are not clueless or helpless.\n\n\u201cThey have their plans and ways of doing things which they will not display in the media.\n\nThe dilemmas in dealing with the specific case of train terrorists are manifold: punitive action like the popular call for carpet bombing of the known locations may assuage the desire of an angry public for revenge, but what about the hostages? They have committed no offence. All they did was to board a train.\u201d\n\nShehu said the security forces were not relenting and were aware of their duties and what the nation expects of them.\n\n\u201cTo help the nation against ongoing situation, the media must increase their support for the fight against the exploitation of the internet and social media for terrorist purposes. The Presidency, in the meantime wishes to reassure the public that the president has done all, and even more than what is expected of him as Commander-in-Chief by way of morale, material and equipment support to the military and expects nothing short of good results in the immediate.\u201d\n\nTerrorists hit Katsina\u2019s safest route, kill 3, abduct others\n\nSuspected bandits on yesterday afternoon struck on the Katsina-Jibia highway reportedly killing at least three persons and kidnapping several others.\n\nThe 45-kilometre road was hitherto described as the \u201csafest\u201d road in the entire Katsina State as virtually all other routes remain unsafe due to activities of bandits.\n\nEyewitness accounts said that the hoodlums attacked a state government-owned commercial coaster bus, with registration number KT 14D-58 KT at about 1. 30 pm, killing the driver on the spot and evacuated the passengers along with those in four other vehicles into the surrounding bush.\n\nAccording to one of the sources, \u201cthe gunmen had operated at Farun Bala village where they rustled some animals before going to the highway.\n\n\u201cSome of the villagers had alerted security forces on check-points along the Katsina-Jibia road on the attack but non responded.\u201d\n\nReports indicate that there are well over 20 security check-points on the short route as it links Niger Republic, with rampart smuggling activities.",

          "title": "NDLEA arrests 8 over Lagos, Abuja, Enugu airports cocaine busts",
          "text": "By Emma Njoku\n\nThe National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has arrested two ladies and six men for attempting to import hundreds of cocaine pellets into the country and export thousands of tramadol 255mg tablets among other illicit drugs to Europe, through the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (NAIA), Abuja; Akanu Ibiam International Airport (AIIA), Enugu, and Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) Lagos.\n\nThe Director, Media and Advocacy of the anti-narcotic agency, Mr. Femi Babafemi, who made the disclosure in a statement, yesterday, said the streaks of arrests and seizures began last Sunday when a 52-year-old father of three, Okwo Paul Okechukwu, was arrested upon his arrival from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, via an Ethiopian airline flight, at the Abuja airport, for ingesting 76 pellets of cocaine.\n\n\u201cDuring preliminary interview, Okechukwu, who hails from Enugu Ezike, Igbo Eze Local Government Area (LGA) of Enugu State, said he was into selling women\u2019s wigs and hair attachment before veering into the drug trade. He has since completed excreting all the 76 wraps of the drug he swallowed while under observation at the agency\u2019s facility in Abuja,\u201d Babafemi disclosed in the statement.\n\nThe statement further read: \u201cIn the same vein, another father of three, Lawrence Chijioke, 42, was arrested at the Abuja airport the same day, in an operational synergy between NDLEA and Nigeria Customs Service at the NAIA. Chijioke, who hails from Umuahia in Umuahia LGA, Abia state, was arrested during an inward clearance of Ethiopian Airline flight from Addis Ababa, with 529 pellets of cocaine weighing 11.70kg concealed in his bag. In his statement to anti-narcotic officers, he claimed he was promised N2 million, which he planned to use to boost his business, upon successful delivery of the cocaine consignment in Abuja.\n\n\u201cNDLEA operatives, also, on Saturday, arrested 29-year-old Ms. Onuorah Caritas Onyinye at the Enugu airport, upon arrival on Ethiopian airline flight from Addis Ababa. A search of her luggage led to the discovery of 2.192 kilograms of cocaine concealed in two designer\u2019s women handbags with false linings. Attempts by drug traffickers to export different illicit drugs through the NAHCO export shed at the Lagos airport to Europe and the United Arab Emirate were also frustrated by officers and men of the agency.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that the operatives, last Monday, intercepted some illicit substances concealed in a consolidated cargo going to Dubai, UAE. Apart from 24 parcels of Loud, a variant of cannabis, which is largely grown in the United States and Canada, other substances recovered from the cargo include a precursor for methamphetamine, BMK glycidic acid; tablets of designer drug MDMA and another five parcels of cannabis. No fewer than four freight agents were arrested in connection with the seizure. They include: Balogun Adesola Olamilekan; Sulaimon Kaosarat Yetunde; Benjamin Christopher Joel; and Omoniyi Ibukun Abraham.\n\nAlso, same last Monday, the bid by an Italy-bound passenger, Tony Osas, to export 10, 250 tablets of tramadol 255 mg to Europe, through the Lagos airport, was foiled by NDLEA operatives who intercepted him at gate B departure hall during outward clearance of passengers on a Turkish airline flight to Milan.\n\nDuring a search of his luggage, Osas, who hails from Ovia South-West Local Government Area of Edo State was found with the illicit substance that weighed 5.70kg concealed inside gari, a local cassava product tucked in his black handbag.\n\nIn Kaduna, a driver Jamilu Lawal, was arrested penultimate Sunday, along Abuja-Kaduna expressway, with 157,000 tablets of diazepam weighing 37.5kg.

Their job will be purposely for this and they will be all out on election day. Vote buyers and sellers are giving INEC a bad name, however, it is not the duty of INEC to monitor this,\u201d he said.\n\nAgbaje advised that all stakeholders should engage politicians on vote buying ahead of the 2023 general elections, and talk to them as actors sponsoring and encouraging this menace. He said security, judiciary, INEC, National Assembly, political parties, NGOs and other critical stakeholders had roles to play in fighting vote buying and vote selling.\n\nHe also decried the delay in prosecuting electoral offences in Nigeria, describing it as frustrating.\n\n\u201cWhen we see this kind of thing, we get frustrated. The judiciary also has to do something. What is the court waiting for in some of these electoral offences? In fact, in Kenya and other countries, within two hours, an electoral case will be judged. If people are jailed for electoral offences, I am sure by 2023, everybody will be careful; but because there is no punishment, people just feel they can do anything.\n\nSERAP sues\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a lawsuit against INEC for \u201cfailing to prosecute those suspected of vote-buying and electoral bribery during the recently concluded Ekiti State governorship election.\u201d\n\nAccording to reports, there was a brazen pattern of vote-buying and electoral bribery in several polling units during the recently concluded Ekiti governorship election, including bargaining prices for votes and payments made in uncompleted buildings.\n\nIn the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/1189/2022 filed last Friday at the Federal High Court, Abuja, SERAP sought \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel INEC to seek and obtain detailed information about reports of vote-buying by the three leading political parties in the 2022 Ekiti State governorship election.\u201d\n\nSERAP also sought \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel INEC to promptly and effectively prosecute those arrested, and to bring to justice anyone who sponsored, aided and abetted them.\u201d",

          "text": "Peoples Democratic Party presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, has reacted to the claim by presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, that it was Atiku that offered him vice presidential ticket in 2007, saying the APC candidate may be suffering from memory loss.\n\nAtiku had in an interview with Arise TV faulted the Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket of the APC, recalling that he rejected Tinubu\u2019s bid to run on a joint ticket with him in 2007 because of his conviction that same faith ticket would not augur well for a multi religion and multi ethnic country like Nigeria.\n\nTinubu Campaign had swiftly reacted to the interview, claiming it was indeed Atiku that offered Tinubu to be his running mate in the 2007 presidential election.\n\nReacting Sunday night, Atiku Campaign, in a statement said: \u201cWe would not say that Bola Tinubu has lied. Rather, it is our desire to give him the benefit of the doubt, and believe that his memory may not be what it used to be.\u201d\n\nSee full statement by the Atiku Campaign below:\n\nPress Release\n\nMultiple Unconnected Third Parties Corroborate Atiku Abubakar\u2019s Position on Tinubu\n\nWe have read the response from Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to the groundbreaking interview granted by His Excellency, Atiku Abubakar, to Arise TV, and even though it was replete with indiscreet language, the former Vice President has elected to respond to the claims made by Asiwaju.\n\nIn responding, he has chosen the route of a friendly riposte, in the hope that his gesture will be reciprocated by the Asiwaju in future.\n\nOn the issue of Atiku Abubakar offering to make Bola Tinubu his running mate in 2007, the Waziri says as a statesman, which he believes Asiwaju Bola Tinubu also is, or should be, it is pertinent that they use temperate language at all times. It not only shows that they are seasoned and mature, more importantly, it is a good indicator of fitness for the office.\n\nAnd that is why it is our intention to respond to Asiwaju\u2019s statement on Atiku Abubakar\u2019s Arise TV interview, not in the rather impolite manner that he dealt the PDP presidential candidate, but in measured tones.\n\nThe major accusation made by Asiwaju Tinubu is that the Waziri Adamawa offered him the opportunity of being his running mate in 2007, which means that the former Vice President was not then mindful of Nigeria\u2019s religious and ethnic diversity, making his statements during the Arise TV interview hypocritical.\n\nWe would not say that Bola Tinubu has lied. Rather, it is our desire to give him the benefit of the doubt, and believe that his memory may not be what it used to be.\n\nNigerians may want to note that on 14 September, 2005, the then US Consul General, Brian L. Browne, drafted a memo, leaked via Wikileaks, wherein he stated that Bola Tinubu was scheming to be a running mate to either Atiku Abubakar or Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThis is further historically corroborated by the subsequent political history of Nigeria. Biographers of President Muhammadu Buhari have variously recounted how Bola Tinubu made the same request of then Presidential candidate Muhammadu Buhari in 2015.\n\nIn his 2016 AUTHORISED biography of President Muhammadu Buhari titled \u2018Muhammadu Buhari: The Challenges of Leadership in Nigeria\u2019, Professor John Paden, an American, wrote about the issue as follows:\n\n\u201cTinubu, a former governor of Lagos State and political \u2018godfather\u2019 of the South-West geopolitical zone, felt he should be the vice-presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nThe above clearly shows a behavioural pattern here. So, if anyone is \u201cunhinged from the truth\u201d (to borrow Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s words), it certainly is not Atiku Abubakar.\n\nIn any case, if Bola Tinubu can forget the name of his own political party, why will he not also forget what transpired in 2007 and 2015? We do sympathise with him.\n\nThe fact remains that in a fragile and ethnically diverse nation, such as ours, religious and ethnic balance must be observed at the highest levels, and from there flow downwards.\n\nThat is what Atiku Abubakar said during his interview with Arise TV on Thursday, July 21, 2022, and he stands on that principle and will continue to so stand without apology to anyone.\n\nFrom the forgoing, it is clear that His Excellency, Atiku Abubakar\u2019s memory and recollection of the event has been corroborated by multiple, independent, and unconnected third parties, and if this were a court of law, this issue would have been regarded as proved beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nWe would also like to remind Nigerians that even though multiple sources have testified that Bola Tinubu desperately lobbied to be made Buhari\u2019s deputy in a Muslim-Muslim ticket, Bola Tinubu himself denied this on June 22, 2022, and instead accused President Buhari of offering him the position of Vice President.\n\nWhich is exactly the same false allegation he has made against Atiku Abubakar. This is a pattern of behaviour. Not owning up to his actions.\n\nTherefore, we hope this settles the matter, and that cordiality can be expected henceforth from the opposing camp.\n\nSigned:\n\nPaul Ibe,\n\nMedia Adviser to Atiku Abubakar, Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party and Vice President of Nigeria, 1999-2007.\n\nAbuja\n\n24th July, 2022.",

          "text": "OREGON 2022 FALLOUT\n\nDuro Ikhazuagbe\n\nNigerian athletes may not have recorded appreciable impact at the World Athletics Championships concluded early hours of this morning in Eugene, Oregon, USA, the African record in the women\u2019s 4x100m relay erased, appears enough consolation for the young ladies that made it happen.\n\nNigeria ran a new 42.22secs to finish in fourth position behind USA who stunned Jamaica and Germany to take the gold.\n\nThe previous African record of 42.39secs was set by the Christy Opara-Thompson, Beatrice Otondu, Faith Idehen and Mary Onyali-Omagbemi at Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992.\n\nOn August 7, 1992 inside the Estadio Olimpico in Barcelona, the quartet of Beatrice Utondu, Faith Idehen, Christy Opara-Thompson and Mary Onyali-Omagbemi ran an incredible race to put Nigeria on the podium. It was Nigeria\u2019s second relay medal at the Olympiad after the Innocent Egbunike led 4x400m men\u2019s quartet had done so eight years earlier at the 1984 Los Angeles Games.\n\nWhat made Nigeria\u2019s feat more spectacular at the Barcelona Games was the manner Onyali and teammates celebrated that bronze medal. Pictures from that celebration made news around the world.\n\nIt is against this backdrop that despite the quartet of Rosemary Chukwuma, Favour Ofili, Grace Nwokocha and Joy Udo-Gabriel not making it to the podium in perhaps their first major competition together, breaking the African women\u2019s 4x100m relay record, was a big deal.\n\n\u201cBreaking the African record is a big deal for us, because we didn\u2019t practice until two weeks ago,\u201d gushed Ofili who last April send Blessing Okagbare\u2019s four-old national 200m record to archive reporters early hours of yesterday.\n\nThe 19-year-old sprinter however admits missing a podium appearance that would have been icing on her cake.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad missing the podium, but breaking the record? I\u2019m grateful for that.\u201d\n\nBefore the quartet\u2019s record breaking race in the sprint relay, Tobi Amusan, posted 12.40 seconds to set a new African women\u2019s 100m hurdles record to surprise even herself in the heat stage of the event.\n\nAmusan said after posting the time to qualify for the semi final of the Oregon 2022 concluded early hours of this morning that she was not really expecting it to happen.\n\n\u201cI really wasn\u2019t expecting that (the African record),\u201d. \u201cMy coach always says execute and let the time take care of itself. I\u2019m happy, healthy and competing.\u201d\n\nHaving finished fourth at both the last Olympics and World Championships, she prayed to go at least one better in Eugene.\n\n\u201cIt would be a dream come true, because I\u2019ve always been in championship finals, and getting on the podium is going to be a reward for all my tears and pain over the years,\u201d the Nigerian petit sprint hurdler explained.\n\nAmusan\u2019s time is two hundreth of a second faster than the 12.44 seconds Glory Alozie ran to win a silver medal in the event 23 years ago in Seville, Spain.\n\nAmusan has also smashed four of the six records Alozie set before switching allegiance to Spain after the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.\n\nThe 25-year-old Amusan started with Alozie\u2019s 12.74 seconds African Games record set in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1999.\n\nShe broke the Games record twice in 2019 in Rabat, Morocco. She ran 12.69 seconds to win her semifinal heat before running a hundreth of a second faster in the final to win the gold at the African Games.\n\nNext was the 12.68 seconds Alozie ran twice to win a silver medal at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia which made her the fastest Nigerian in the history of the quadrennial event.\n\nAmusan smashed that in 2021 in Tokyo with her 12.60 seconds performance which fetched her a fourth place finish in the event.\n\nThe reigning Commonwealth Games champion also consigned to history the 12.44 seconds Alozie ran at the Monaco Diamond League in 1998. The time, which also doubled as the African record at the time was the fastest by an Nigerian in the history of the event until September 2021 when Amusan ran 12.42 seconds to achieve a treble.",

          "text": "Babatunde Fashola, minister of works and housing, says the Lagos-Ibadan expressway and the Second Niger Bridge will be completed by Decemeber 2022.\n\nFashola said this on Sunday in an interview on Channels Television.\n\nHe also said the roads will be tolled, noting that the completion date for the Lagos-Ibadan expressway was subject to challenges that have slowed down work.\n\n\u201cThe expected completion date now will be in the last month of this year. We are hoping that we will be done before Christmas and that is subject to a lot of variables,\u201d Fashola said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs we speak now, somewhere between Ojo, the Oyo state government is constructing a drilling facility. So, that has slowed our work considerably, in spite of the fact that the contractor is now working at night. So, just two days ago, Governor Makinde and I were talking because I called him a week ago that look, we need to make a choice, which do you prioritise the drainage or that road? And he said the road is what affects, but we can\u2019t dismiss the need for the drainage. So, he called me back to say look, he has a solution now. He\u2019s worked with the contractor, talked to them and we\u2019ll discuss it in this new way.\n\n\u201cSo, these are some of the challenges.\u201d\n\nFashola, who hinted at the situation of the road prior to the current administration, said the Lagos-Ibadan expressway was in a terrible condition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to him, part of the reason the project had taken this long was because of a lack of funding from past governments.\n\n\u201cLet me also say that over the years, at the time, we took $2 billion to go and pay creditors in 2005 this road was bad. People used to sleep on it. So let us dimension that completion. The road is built in sections. That road has no less than 40,000 vehicles every day that\u2019s the traffic road count that we did, so you can\u2019t close it down. So, what we do is to close sections of one side, divert traffic to the other side. Complete about 10/20 kilometers and then reopen it and move traffic back,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow what you might not know and it is important to share this the construction material likely comes from Ogun state. So, whether you\u2019re constructing the Lagos section or the Oyo section, you have to go and move laterite cross tools, and all of that, they move in the same traffic. So, thousands of daily truck trips. And that road is being excavated to about a meter or more deep, so, we\u2019re essentially first removing bad material from unsuitable material, filling up and then constructing the road. So, I don\u2019t think it is slow. What has happened is that over the years government has not funded it sufficiently.\n\n\u201cSo, we factored it this year subject to some of these challenges that I\u2019ve told you. Governor Makinde and I will resolve that pretty soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFashola, while admitting that the road will be tolled, said it will eventually be \u201chanded over to the concessionaires who NSA is talking to to bring in more financing.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the road will \u201ctwo to three\u201d tolling plazas.\n\n\u201cOne on the Lagos end, one in the Ogun end. And I think the other one, in Ibadan which is what we used to have there before traditionally,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on the completion date for the Second Niger Bridge, the minister assured Nigerians that the road would be opened for use by December 20222.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re planning also before Christmas to open that (Second Niger Bridge) to public for use, because that\u2019s when there\u2019s a large movement. Hopefully by Christmas, it should also be open. That was the last meeting I had with the contractor I think about three weeks ago. There are challenges of course, as you might know, but the main bridge deck is finished,\u201d Fashola said.\n\n\u201cThe toll plazas have been built.\u201d",

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB.

          "title": "From Nigeria to the UK with the Global Talent Visa",
          "text": "Japa (verb, /d\u0292a pa/, Nigeria): to leave one\u2019s home country in search of greener pastures.\n\nWhen writers Ope Adedeji and Chika Jones decided to apply for the UK Global Talent Visa, both thought the process would be like all other visa applications\u2014grueling and 3 months long, filled with insurmountable documentation, and lingering interviews.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. In 2020, the UK instituted the Global Talent Visa which allows leaders or potential leaders in the fields of academia and research, arts and culture, and digital technology, to work in the UK for up to 5 years, without a sponsor or a job offer.\n\n\u201cI was surprised,\u201d said Adedeji to TechCabal in an interview. \u201cFrom start to finish, the whole process probably took about 2 months. And from an application perspective, I was most surprised about how effective it was.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 surprise was that a 5-year residence visa existed for writers. \u201cVisas like these are usually reserved for STEM careers or even tech professionals. Writers and poets like me usually focus on fellowships or masters\u2019 degrees,\u201d he commented in a Twitter Space he and Adedeji held earlier this year.\n\nJones\u2019 own application process, from submission to approval, took a total of 2 weeks, but he\u2019d taken 5 months to plan, and the only major delays he experienced were with his medical tests.\n\nOpe Adedeji, managing editor at Paystack\n\nAdedeji and Jones are just 2 out of many Nigerians who have taken advantage of the Global Talent Visa to leave their home countries to work abroad. In fact, Nigeria ranked third for the total number of applications processed for the visa in 2021 while South Africa ranked 10th.\n\nMany more are looking to take advantage of this opportunity, and if you\u2019re one of them, here\u2019s how 2 exceptionally talented individuals japa-ed with the UK Global Talent Visa.\n\nExceptional Talent v Exceptional Promise\n\nThe first stage of applying for the UK Global Talent Visa is getting endorsed by any of 6 relevant endorsing bodies.\n\nUnlike other visa applications where you have to book interviews at consulates, the Global Talent Visa has 6 governing bodies that review applications from applicants who can bid for the visa under 2 circumstances: Exceptional Talent or Exceptional Promise.\n\nPeople who apply under Exceptional Talent are established leaders in the fields of academia and research, arts and culture, and digital technology. They have won prestigious awards, appeared in notable publications, and have many years of experience under their belt.\n\nApplicants under Exceptional Promise have a record of outstanding work in their field over a 5-year period. They are intentional about developing outstanding international track records.\n\nEach of the 6 endorsing bodies has its own requirements for the Exceptional Talent and Exceptional Promise, and you can check them out here.\n\nAdedeji and Jones, both of whom have glowing track records of excellence in writing, applied for the visa under Exceptional Promise for arts and culture, which is open to creatives with careers in literature, dance, architecture, fashion design, film, and animation. The documents they needed were basic: passports, tuberculosis test results, and more importantly, 3 recommendation letters from organisations and people established in their fields.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been published in quite a number of notable magazines and publications over the years, and I also had a few literary awards to my name. I\u2019d also been a speaker at some literary festivals, so all I had to do was gather these in a document and submit it to the Arts Council,\u201d Adedeji said.\n\nChika Jones, poet and digital marketing manager\n\nWhen she first heard of the visa, Adedeji, who is also managing editor at Paystack, had thought endorsement would be the most difficult part of the application process. \u201cI was sceptical at first because I thought I probably didn\u2019t qualify. After reading a bit more and speaking to people who\u2019d already gotten the visa, I realised I had a chance, and I took it.\u201d\n\nAdedeji mentioned that she collated links to her appearances and awards, her published stories, and news mentions in a Google Doc. \u201cThat\u2019s all it took,\u201d she said.\n\nJones concurred, adding that the process is less stressful than people think it is. \u201cVisas are notoriously difficult to get, and so people don\u2019t even try. But with this, it wasn\u2019t as mind-numbing as I thought it would be.\u201d\n\nThe UK Global Talent Visa website states that endorsement takes about 4 weeks, but both writers got their arts and culture endorsements within 2 weeks.\n\nFunfere Koroye, a design engineer whom TechCabal interviewed for an earlier episode of Digital Nomads, applied under Exceptional Talent. His route was a bit different from Adedeji\u2019s and Jones\u2019. While the creators had to apply to the Arts Council England, the endorsing body for arts and culture, Koroye had to apply to Tech Nation, the endorsing body for digital technology.\n\nUnder the digital technology option, people with technical and business skills can apply for endorsement.\n\nThe careers eligible for the digital technology Talent Visa\n\nKoroye already had over 8 years of experience building and designing products, and even building a startup, NuPay Technologies. All he had to do was dust up his resume, gather the links to sites like Figma and GitHub which highlighted his projects, and submit them to Tech Nation. Koroye\u2019s application was so successful he was also invited to become an ambassador for Tech Nation. \u201cMy job as an ambassador is to create more awareness about the visa,\u201d Koroye said. \u201cAcross Africa, not a lot of people know about the visa, so I\u2019m here to spread awareness and give people information about their applications.\u201d\n\nAfter getting endorsed, all the professionals had to do was get their tuberculosis test results, schedule a date for biometric capturing, and submit their applications. Adedeji, who had already been living in the UK for her masters\u2019 at the time, did not have to get a tuberculosis test or buy a ticket.\n\n\u201cMy process took 5 months because it was difficult to get my tuberculosis test, but that was the only stressful part. Everything else was pretty smooth,\u201d said Jones.\n\nAnd the best part\u2026\n\nThe whole process costs about \u00a32,000, said Jones who applied with and moved with his wife.\n\nTotal amount Chika Jones spent applying for the UK Global Talent Visa\n\n\u201cBut it can be more expensive, depending on how many years you apply for, and how you\u2019re moving.\u201d The visa itself costs \u00a3623\u2014\u00a3456 for endorsement and \u00a3167 for the visa application itself. You\u2019ll also have to pay \u00a3624 per year for every year you plan to spend in the UK for up to 5 years.\n\n\u201cFor me, the costs for endorsement, health insurance and biometrics all added up to about \u00a33,500,\u201d said Adedeji.\n\nThe best part about the Global Talent Visa, according to Koroye, is that awardees don\u2019t have to be in the UK all year round. The visa only requires awardees to stay in the UK for 6 months out of every year they have applied for; the rest of the time can be spent in any country of their choosing. \u201cIt just opens you up to a more expansive world,\u201d Koroye said.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re open to applications from Digital Nomads. If you\u2019re an African who\u2019s travelling the world while working or living abroad for work, please send me an email at timi@bigcabal.com and sultan@bigcabal.com or fill this form.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Yesterday, global streaming service Netflix announced via its Q2 2022 financial results that it lost 970,000 subscribers in the second quarter of the year.\n\nThis is the second time in a row that the streaming service is suffering a massive blow to its subscriber base. In the first quarter of this year, the service reported its first subscriber loss in 10 years with a 200,000 subscriber decline.\n\nAt the time, Netflix outlined 4 reasons for its subscriber decline: an increase in streaming services; geopolitical events like Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine; a decline in addressable market; and more notably, an increase in household password sharing. According to Netflix, over 100 million of its 222 million paying subscribers are sharing their passwords with people outside of their households.\n\nNetflix experiencing another dip in its subscriber count doesn\u2019t come as a shock to the service because it predicted, in April, that it would lose up to 2 million subscribers in Q2. Its subscriber growth decline, however, was less than half of that. Netflix\u2019s biggest subscriber loss came from its largest markets, the US and Canada, where Netflix said it lost 1.3 million users. This number was offset by an increase in subscribers from other regions.\n\nWhile the streaming service has not commented on reasons for its recent decline, experts project that it\u2019s due to the proliferation of streaming services. With the launch of HBO Max, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\u2019s library of movies, series and even games will be limited as more studios launch their own streaming platforms.\n\nNetflix, however, still has the biggest share of the streaming service market with 220 million subscribers while Amazon\u2019s Prime Video holds 200 million, while Disney+ and HBO Max hold 87.6 million and 74 million subscribers respectively.\n\n1 million subscribers in Q3\n\nThe service also plans to keep its top spot and add 1 million subscribers to its tally by Q3.\n\nTo do this, the service will implement a few long-term solutions, including increased movie and game development budgets. It\u2019s introducing ads to its platform in a partnership with Microsoft. Later this year, starting with the US and Canada, the platform will introduce a cheaper ad-tier option for streamers.\n\nThe platform is also taking a tough stance on password-sharing as it announced the testing of an \u201cadd a home\u201d feature which will charge users an extra $3 to share accounts with users in other households. \u201cWe know this will be a change for our members,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cOur goal is to find an easy-to-use paid sharing offering that we believe works for our members and our business that we can roll out in 2023.\u201d\n\nRevenue soars\n\nIn its letter to its shareholders, the service stated that Q2 was \u201cbetter than expected\u201d.\n\nWhile its total number of subscribers might have declined by 970,000, its year-on-year revenue, however, increased by 9% in Q2 2022.\n\nImage source: Netflix\n\nThe streamer\u2019s net profit for the quarter was $1.44 billion, up 6.5% from $1.35 billion in Q2 2021. It, however, noted that it expects its revenue growth would slow to 4.5% by Q3.\n\nDespite this news, Netflix\u2019s shares jumped by 7% after the report was released.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

In the last two months, we\u2019ve talked to a DJ who teaches kids coding, a lawyer who\u2019s also a content creator, a gadget seller at Computer Village, Ikeja, an Uber driver, a dentist turned YouTuber, and Burna Boy\u2019s monitor engineer.\n\nThis time, we\u2019ll be talking to three business owners about their experiences with delivery and logistics in the bustling city of Lagos and the ancient Kaduna town.\n\nFirst up, Egemba Michael Kachi, chef, photographer, and perfume merchant.\n\nKachi, Perfume Merchant\n\nDo you use delivery apps?\n\nI don\u2019t really use delivery apps. Someone introduced me to one, but I can\u2019t remember the platform. I booked the ride and was asked to pay, which I did. I was told the delivery person would be with me in about two hours. Throughout the day, I did not see anybody, didn\u2019t do the delivery, and had already paid.\n\nSo, I spoke to them, and they said, \u201cOkay, it won\u2019t happen next time,\u201d and I believed them. The next day, the same thing happened.\n\nKachi\n\nThey eventually did the delivery, but that was it for me; I just went back to my individual rider companies.\n\nWhat\u2019s your experience with traditional delivery companies?\n\nWith delivery companies, just mentally prepare yourself because you can\u2019t control anything. They could pick up from you and tell you they are going there immediately, and only for you to realise five or six hours later, late in the evening, that they\u2019ve still not delivered.\n\nThey\u2019ll tell you, \u201cOh, the bike spoilt.\u201d\n\nOr, they were held up by local government boys, or they had an accident, blah blah blah. So whenever I\u2019m doing deliveries, I basically tell my customers, \u201cYou could get it today or tomorrow.\u201d\n\nNot that I\u2019m giving an excuse, but just in case something happens. And the annoying thing is when they know they\u2019re running late, they won\u2019t call. If you call, they might not pick up or be very rude when they do.\n\nOne time I gave a package to the wrong rider; I was so confused that day, like, \u201cWho did I give my perfume to?\u201d It didn\u2019t end there, though. The rider dropped it off at their office, and my perfume went missing. The manager had to threaten not to pay his people their salaries before it was found.\n\nAnother time, the rider delivered the perfume at 11 p.m. At night! To give him credit, the manager had told me it would be same-day delivery; I just didn\u2019t know his today meant from the start of the day to the end of the day.\n\nSo how do you handle customers then?\n\nI steadily update them. So that gives them a bit of confidence. It would be very odd if I told them a rider had picked up and they didn\u2019t hear anything from the rider or me all day, and they didn\u2019t see their deliveries all; it\u2019d look like I\u2019m a fraud. So I\u2019m constantly communicating with the riders and giving the customers feedback.\n\nNext, we have Feranmi Ajetomobi, a growth marketer at Flutterwave and the Co-founder of Nigerian food startup, NiFries.\n\nFeranmi, Co-founder of NiFries\n\nFeranmi\n\nHow do you run your deliveries?\n\nWe do a mix, actually. So we have apps, and our delivery guys, like people we built relationships with to help handle the deliveries. That is very important because when you start running a delivery service for food in Lagos if you depend solely on apps, you\u2019d most likely be disappointed unless the orders come from the apps.\n\nMost times, you have to actually get traditional riders who are available at any time. It\u2019s a supply-demand issue because, say, I finished cooking by 11:00 a.m. and somebody orders at that point, I would have to go into the app, order for a rider, and then wait for the rider to come.\n\nSometimes some riders don\u2019t come early, and at other times, you wouldn\u2019t even get the rider. So there\u2019s a big supply issue when it comes to the delivery apps.\n\nFor areas around us, we\u2019ve actually resorted to bicycles that handle deliveries on our behalf.\n\nThere\u2019s also pricing. If somebody orders food by 11:00 a.m. and you tell them they\u2019ll get it in 45 minutes, but another order comes before you finish packaging it by 11:45 a.m., one rider can take everything.\n\nBut when it comes to the apps, I need to wait for orders to compile before I can make a request.\n\nBut\u2026\n\nI think logistics companies that focus on other forms of logistics have no business with the food business because, first off, the margins are very low. Nobody wants to pay \u20a61,000 ($2) for food that costs \u20a6800 ($1.8). But say I\u2019m buying shoes, I will pay \u20a61,500 ($3) because the shoes probably cost \u20a610,000 ($23) or even \u20a630,000 ($70).\n\nBecause of that margin cost, you either give that delivery company a bulk of those orders, or they charge you high because you\u2019ve made just one order.\n\nThe alternative I\u2019ve seen work is with companies like Chowdeck, a logistics company for food businesses. And their approach is to run a marketplace where food operators like me can list our business and get orders through them. It is the same thing with Bolt Food.\n\nThat way, I don\u2019t bother with logistics; I don\u2019t bother about the price. The good thing is that aside from running that marketplace, you can have an agreement with Chowdeck that allows you to have some bikes and bicycles at your store.\n\nIt is possible to get orders or process orders outside their marketplace. The hybrid structure is the best, honestly, because it allows you to mix the marketplace structure with your bike.\n\nYou have more professionalism, and you can easily track your goods. There\u2019s accountability and protection for your product. And some of them even insure your products, so if they get damaged, you are covered to an extent.\n\nWould you ever enter the logistics part of the business?\n\nThere\u2019s no economic sense in owning a bike. In the future, I can come together with other food business owners and build a consortium of bikes; we\u2019d put money together and own our delivery network.\n\nThen I can be confident to own bikes. But for me, to own banks on my own, it\u2019s not a wise business decision at all. It\u2019s too expensive. Maintainance capital costs and even operational costs.\n\nWhat\u2019s one thing you wish delivery apps could do better?\n\nTracking. Most of them are bad at it so you can\u2019t accurately track where the rider is with your food.\n\nLast but not least is Yetunde Aisha, the Founder of Shop Yetu, who sells thrift items and essential oils.\n\nYetunde, Entrepreneur\n\nYetunde\n\nSo how do you do your deliveries?\n\nI deliver within and outside Kaduna. At first, I was using all these normal bike logistics companies for deliveries within Kaduna.\n\nBut late last year, there was a ban on all motorcycles, so those logistics companies couldn\u2019t operate. You had to have a car or Keke [tricycle] to do what the bikes were doing. So deliveries within Kaduna were halted for some time because I had to look for another means of delivering my items.\n\nAnd the thing with having a business online is that apart from the price of the item, some people get discouraged when they hear the cost of delivery. Delivery within Kaduna used to cost \u20a6500 ($1), but the people using cars were charging \u20a61,000 ($2) or \u20a61,500 ($3). So it\u2019s either you increase the delivery fee, or you take out of the profit you\u2019re making from your business. Then I got a Keke guy.\n\nFor deliveries outside Kaduna to certain places like Abuja, I like using public transport and a car costs \u20a61,500. But those ones are a bit tricky because you can\u2019t track them. You have to keep calling the driver, and sometimes they switch off their phones. Or you take it to the motor park, and they put it in another car.\n\nThere was an item I sent to Jos last year, but it ended up in Sokoto; I still don\u2019t understand it. And then, because of kidnapping issues, some of the cars don\u2019t arrive until late at night. So I had to get someone at the holding park in Mabushi [Abuja].\n\nFor any place outside Abuja, I strictly use GIG Logistics because you can track the packages, and so far, I am satisfied. I\u2019ve been using GIG since last year, and I\u2019ve had only one issue when they mixed up my packages.\n\nHave you tried other companies?\n\nI tried DHL, but it wasn\u2019t working out because they\u2019re very expensive. A good example is Maiduguri, where I send items using regular public transport. I used DHL three times when their rates were still reasonable, but with the fuel scarcity and increase in fuel price, their rates have gone up. I think one month, when I wanted to send a package, they told me it would cost \u20a68,000 ($18).\n\nHow much is the cloth the person bought? With public transport, you pay like \u20a62,000 ($4), and it gets there.",

          "text": "Vince McMahon, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) boss, who turned the firm from a regional player to global giant, says he will retire amid a flurry of misconduct claims.\n\nHe stepped down from his roles in WWE last month following reports he paid millions to suppress allegations of sexual misconduct and infidelity.\n\nMr McMahon remains WWE\u2019s majority shareholder.\n\nHe has led WWE for decades, often appearing as a performer in the ring.\n\nIn a statement that did not mention the allegations against him, Mr McMahon said he has the \u201cdeepest appreciation and admiration for our generations of fans all over the world\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur global audience can take comfort in knowing WWE will continue to entertain you with the same fervour, dedication, and passion as always,\u201d the 77-year-old said.\n\n\u201cMy personal thanks to our community and business partners, shareholders, and Board of Directors for their guidance and support through the years. Then. Now. Forever. Together.\u201d\n\nHis daughter Stephanie will serve as interim chairperson and co-CEO.\n\nIn June, The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr McMahon had agreed to pay $3m (\u00a32.5m) to a former paralegal who said he sexually harassed her at work.\n\nHe reportedly agreed to an upfront payment of $1m, with the rest to be doled out over five years and apparently paid by Mr McMahon personally.\n\nDespite initial reports that he would remain in post as the company\u2019s CEO and chairman, the WWE board announced an investigation after it emerged that he had paid more than $12m to four other women to hide numerous allegations of infidelity. He was replaced as acting CEO and chairperson by his daughter.\n\nThe women \u2013 all former employees of WWE \u2013 signed agreements with Mr McMahon that barred them from discussing their relationships with him in exchange for the payments.\n\nMr McMahon has overseen the WWE\u2019s growth into a media juggernaut whose content is broadcast in more than 180 countries and 30 languages.\n\nWhen he purchased the then World Wrestling Federation from his father in 1982, matches took place in small venues and its rare television broadcasts were limited to local US cable channels.\n\nMcMahon faced off against future President Donald Trump in a \u2018Battle of the Billionaires\u2019 event in 2007\n\nBut the organisation underwent a seismic change under his management, with events like WrestleMania, a live event featuring the sport\u2019s top stars, drawing in millions of viewers. In 2021 the company\u2019s revenue exceed $1bn for the first time.\n\nAs the sport grew, Mr McMahon leveraged his abrasive and bombastic personality to become one of its most recognisable faces.\n\nHe has been at the centre of some of its most famous moments, including being attacked by future US President Donald Trump at a WrestleMania event in 2007, and his feuds with stars like \u2018Stone Cold\u2019 Steve Austin and Hulk Hogan became box office viewing, CNBC reported.",

I\u2019ve also told him and his team not to allow anyone that is not ready to serve, anyone that his focus is to come and look for money to steal from the poor people (Osun is a very poor state) into the team\u201d.\n\nWhile counselling the new graduates, he urged them to live an accountable life in order to hold leaders accountable for their acts in public offices.\n\nAccording to him, we just held an election in Osun State, forty-five polling units disappeared, young NYSC presiding officers did not show up in their designated polling units, meanwhile people were waiting to vote but the material, result sheet and BIVAS machine was taken to somewhere else.\n\n\u201cUntill a Director started calling to make sure that those people reported to where they are supposed to, otherwise my brother wouldn\u2019t have been the governor-elect today. And those who allowed themselves to be used were NYSC young people, it\u2019s not Commissioners in INEC, people blame INEC but forgotten that it is the young ones that have been entrusted in this responsibility are the one wrecking their (your) own future. Because if you cannot hold a government accountable then we don\u2019t have any future in this country.\n\n\u201cSo please our young ones, do remember what you\u2019re taught here, remember that the future of this country depends on you, seize up that future, make sure you register to vote, make sure that any government you don\u2019t want or that is not serving right in your constituency is voted out, do not participate in bringing down this country, participate in all things that will bring up this country to the desired country that you want\u201d, he said.\n\nIn his convocation speech, the Vice Chancellor, Professor, Solomon Adebola said 25 of the graduates bagged first class degree honours, 468 bagged second class upper, 260 had second class lower while only 9 graduated with third class.\n\nHe added that the University graduated 28 Ph.D students, 55 with Master\u2019s degrees, one with MPhil Ph.D and three students of Post Graduate Diploma (PGD).",

Zenith Bank\u2019s financial performance for the year was underpinned by double-digit growth of 10% in gross earnings, with an improved market share in both retail and corporate sectors despite a very challenging macroeconomic environment aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCommenting on the 2022 Top 1000 World Banks Ranking, the Group Managing Director/CEO of Zenith Bank Plc, Mr. Ebenezer Onyeagwu, said: \u201cThis ranking is a testament to our resilience and doggedness as an institution despite economic headwinds and a persistent challenging macroeconomic environment. Indeed, being ranked as the Number One Bank in Nigeria by Tier-1 Capital for the thirteenth year in a row underscores our commitment to sustaining the superior performance we are renowned for and creating value for our highly esteemed customers.\u201d\n\nOnyeagwu expressed his appreciation to the Founder and Chairman of Zenith Bank Plc, Jim Ovia, CON, for his guidance and for laying the foundation and building the structures of an enduring and very successful institution; the Board for the outstanding leadership they provide; the staff, whose drive and commitment sustains the exceptional performance; and the Bank\u2019s customers for their unflinching loyalty to the Zenith brand.\n\nTier 1 Capital describes capital adequacy, which is the core measure of a bank\u2019s financial strength from a regulator\u2019s point of view. According to the ranking, Tier 1 Capital, as de\ufb01ned by the latest Bank for International Settlements (BIS) guidelines, includes loss-absorbing capital, i.e. common stock, disclosed reserves, retained earnings and minority interests in the equity of subsidiaries that are less than wholly owned.\n\nZenith Bank\u2019s track record of excellent performance has continued to earn the brand numerous awards, with this latest accolade coming on the heels of several recognitions, including being recognised as the Best Bank in Nigeria for three consecutive years from 2020 to 2022, in the Global Finance World\u2019s Best Banks Awards; Best Commercial Bank, Nigeria 2021 and 2022 in the World Finance Banking Awards; Best Corporate Governance Bank, Nigeria in the World Finance Corporate Governance Awards 2022; Best in Corporate Governance \u2018Financial Services\u2019 Africa, for three consecutive years from 2020 to 2022, by the Ethical Boardroom; Best Commercial Bank, Nigeria and Best Innovation In Retail Banking, Nigeria in the International Banker 2022 Banking Awards; and Bank of the Year (Nigeria) in The Banker\u2019s Bank of the Year Awards 2020. Also, the Bank emerged as the Most Valuable Banking Brand in Nigeria in the Banker Magazine Top 500 Banking Brands 2020 and 2021, and the Retail Bank of the year at the BusinessDay Banks and Other Financial Institutions (BOFI) Awards 2020 and 2021.\n\nSimilarly, Zenith Bank was honoured as Bank of the Decade (People\u2019s Choice) at the ThisDay Awards 2020 and emerged winner in four categories at the Sustainability, Enterprise, and Responsibility (SERAS) Awards 2021, carting home the awards for \u201cBest Company in Reporting and Transparency\u201d, \u201cBest Company in Infrastructure Development\u201d, \u201cBest Company in Gender Equality and Women Empowerment\u201d, and the coveted \u201cMost Responsible Organisation in Africa.",

          "text": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said that it has been implementing measures aimed at encouraging more listings by creating new Rules and amending existing ones, improving general review processes, continuing engagements with issuers, advisers and other critical stakeholders.\n\nDirector General of the SEC, Mr. Lamido Yuguda who stated this recently at the Nigeria Exchange Limited\u2019s CEO Roundtable held in Lagos, said the Commission and the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited have moved to make the processes involved in listing more efficient and cost effective by streamlining the approval process between the SEC and the NGX.\n\nYuguda stated that last year, the Commission collaborated with Nigeria Employers Consultative Association, NECA to inaugurate the Securities Issuers Forum (SIF) which was aimed at providing an opportunity for Issuers to engage directly with regulators on pertinent regulatory issues.\n\nThe objectives of the forum, amongst others he said, are to maintain regular contact with the regulator; promote sound corporate governance and ethical conduct; advise the regulator on regulations affecting companies & issuers; promote healthy competition; and maintain an enabling business environment by monitoring issues of direct relevance to members.\n\nHe said, \u201clet me reiterate that the SEC is continually focused on increasing the visibility and attractiveness of our market, and will continue to focus on building and sustaining a fair, transparent and efficient capital market.\n\n\u201cThe Commission will also continue to embrace the ease-of-doing-business principle by simplifying its processes and enhancing time-to-market through the elimination of superfluous requirements that lead to inordinate delays in capital raising and other capital market operations. This is particularly important so that the market be deepened further and provide avenue for hitherto inadmissible entities to be eligible for listing\u201d.\n\nThe SEC Boss said the theme \u201cCreating the enabling ecosystem for accessing capital from the Nigerian capital markets, resonates with the mandate of the Securities and Exchange Commission of developing and regulating the market while protecting investors.\n\nHe stated that the demutualization of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), which led to the emergence of the current NGX Group has brought with it a renewed focus on expanding the market, by consolidating on the successes achieved through the traditional methods of capital raising while working with important stakeholders to introduce new sources of financing.\n\n\u201cThe Commission welcomes the sound initiatives of NGX for continued engagement with experts to share their perspectives on changes that would lead to the much desired expansion of the market. This effort would not have come at a better time than now when economies are just beginning to face the devastating economic reality of the Ukraine and Russia crisis, which reared its head, just as nations were still grappling with the health and economic challenges posed by the Coronavirus Pandemic.\n\n\u201cYou may be aware that the Commission is in the implementation phase of a comprehensive market and institutional reform program \u2013 the Capital Market Masterplan that is intended to reposition the Nigerian Capital Market to be globally competitive. The Commission has successfully completed a comprehensive review of the Masterplan. The reviewed plan is expected to guide further development of the capital market so as to attract more funds for economic growth and development\u201d he stated.\n\nThe Commission the SEC DG said, is also making concerted efforts to ensure the repeal of the Investments and Securities Act (ISA) 2007 and the passage of a new Investments and Securities Bill into law. This is to align the law with current realities and global trends in capital market regulation, including growing changes in market practices, processes and products.\n\n\u201cWe have consistently focussed on the creation of an ecosystem in which governments, entrepreneurs and other issuers can efficiently access capital. Stakeholders must however look further to introduce more products, leveraging on the emerging trend of financial technology\u201d he added.",

          "text": "The hottest places in Hell are reserved for those who, in a period of moral crisis, maintain their neutrality.\u201d (Dante Aliegri)\n\nThe unfolding certificate forgery scandal hanging around the neck of Pastor Umo Eno, the man whom Deacon Udom Emmanuel and his boys \u2013 Barr. Emmanuel Enoidem , Enobong Uwah and Frank Archibong imposed as the \u2018governorship candidate\u2019 of the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP) in our dear State is such that men and women of good conscience who mean well for this State can no longer sit back and watch or stand and stare as if it is of no consequence. Yes , the threesome have made their money , extended their empires and are living large , bestriding the state and country as colossuses. The unfortunate and unfolding Ordinary level certificate forgery saga has brought an unmitigated embarrassment and shame on Akwa Ibom people and the whole state with potentials of even wider implications. Akwa Ibom State has a solid standing as a land that has produced well educated men and women who have excelled in academia, businesses and the professions over the years. For crying out loud , this is the home state of revered icons like the late international jurist, Hon.Dr.Egbert Udo Udoma , who distinguished himself as a first class scholar in Dublin in the 1930\u2019s. This state also produced the legendary Barr. O.O.Ita of Oro extraction. This state had the educationist, Professor Eyo Ita , the 7 merchants of light , including Professors Essien Udom, Donald Ekong , Reuben Uko , Sam Akpabot , Etim Essien , Okon Uya , Enyenihi and thousands of others in the state , across Nigeria and in the Diaspora. The dead , among them would be turning in their graves over this shame that has turned Akwa Ibom into a butt of jokes and a laughing stock everywhere in the 21st century.\n\nHow have the mighty fallen ?\n\nWho would explain to future generations that the state that produced world class public Administrators like Chief Ntieyong Akpan , Ekukinam Bassey, Ime Ebong, Clement Isong, public intellectuals like Moses Ekpo, Nelson Etukudo, Ahaziah Umana, Ray Ekpu , Effiong Essien , Timtiniko Enodien, Nsikak Essien , Udeme Ufot , a guru in advertising and Anietie Usen to name just a few among several others is now using state resources to promote a Governorship candidate with questionable basic academic qualifications ? What shall we tell our children ?\n\nWould we tell them that lying one\u2019s way to appointment and government position is just okay and that they should muddle their way through life like Umo Eno ? Is this not witchcraft ? Are the sponsors of Umo Eno not bewitching Akwa Ibom people while singing and dancing during Government house prayer gatherings ? Who does not know that failing examinations is not bad but no reasonable person should support the deliberate procurement of fake examination results to gain advantage in any society. Why is Udom Emmanuel paying Akwa Ibom back with a counterfeit coin ?\n\nWhat would Prelate Mbang and other Fathers of Faith tell their grandchildren about this saga ? Is Prelate Mbang who prayed during the unveiling of Umo Eno at peace with himself ? Does a man who went to the best schools , served as National President of the Christian Association of Nigeria and President of World Methodist Communion sleep well at night in his old age for not questioning the process which threw up Umo Eno as the right choice to lead Akwa Ibom State from 2023 ? What would Archbishop Joseph Ekuwem say about this ? That the home state of the first Cardinal of West Africa has gone this low ? And that his younger brother , a well known ICT expert was a part of the decision making cabal ?Who bewitched Obong Victor Attah to eat this humble pie and become the person assigned to bless this mess at every turn ? Does Obong Attah now listen to himself ?\n\nOne recalls that Deacon Udom Emmanuel had told the people of the state that it was God who revealed Umo Eno to him but at different interviews with Journalists recently, Obong Attah has declared that there was a group behind that choice. Who constituted that group and who were the Members ? He hasn\u2019t said ! How on earth can Arc. Victor Attah emerge as the new spokesperson to a man young enough to be his son ? No wonder , Ekerete Udo , the greatest pretender to the office of Chief Press Secretary to the Governor since the creation of that office has gone into hiding because former Governor Attah has taken over his job ! What a time to be alive in Akwa Ibom State !\n\nBut must Umo Eno be Governor at all cost and by all means ? What does Deacon Udom Emmanuel want to hide that another person could not have covered up for him ?\n\nWhy is the sneaky ambition of one man bigger than the collective health and sustainable wellbeing of a state with more than 7 million people ? Why are the promoters of this particular Candidate so obstinate and bullish in wrongdoing in a wrong direction ?\n\nOkay, Enobong Uwah wants to become the Secretary to the State Government, and Frank Archibong wants to continue in his present office, while Enoidem plans to run the show from the Senate in Abuja and prepare to take over in 2031! These are the three \u2018wise\u2019 henchmen who have brought this roof down on Akwa Ibom State and pressed the entire state to it\u2019s knees.\n\nSo far , the image of this state has been tarnished , it\u2019s high time people moved to save what remains of it for the sake of posterity.\n\nAkwa Ibom leaders should not be seen to be condoning bad behavior bordering on criminality. It is trite saying that evil rules when good people keep silent.\n\nA stitch in time, they say, saves nine , Governor Udom Emmanuel should pull back and back off from this wretched path now to save this State from eternal shame.\n\nWhether the SANs hired to defend Umo Eno succeed in buying the case or not , the conflicting certificates, birthdates, marriage date, the legal imbroglio has damaged Candidate Umo Eno beyond redemption and derobed him of every value to serve in any capacity in Akwa Ibom State going forward. He should be released to return to his hotel business.\n\nUdom Emmanuel should come off his high horse , humble himself , proceed on a weekend dry fasting with all the fathers of faith for using the name of God in vain and for \u2018playing the street\u2019 with the generality of Akwa Ibom people. A stitch in time , indeed , saves nine !\n\nBassey Udosen writes from Mkpok, ONNA in Akwa Ibom State.",

Unless that is done, the children of the ruling class trained in foreign universities will return to take over from their wicked parents and continue to enslave Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe union will actively participate in the two days protest being organised by the Nigeria Labour Congress and other labour unions in the country. It is sad that the President Buhari government which prides itself on fighting corruption will be frustrating the use of homegrown solution for the Integrated Personnel and Payroll System that has been discredited by audit report of 2019.\u201d\n\nThe ASUU leader stated that members of the Union were also affected by the strike not only in terms of finances but by their education as many of them are doing their doctoral degrees in public universities, adding that many will also be affected as their promotion will also be delayed and \u201cmy children are at home with me too.\n\n\u201cWe got here by collective negligence of electing incompetent people into public offices. The fight for quality education for the children of the masses has become a class war among the economic elite, the working class and the ruling class.\n\n\u201cUntil we rise and demand accountability from those in office to do what is in the best interest of the majority, the cycle of strikes and underdevelopment will not stop.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

So we are not working with any delegation as we are concerned.\n\n\u201cThis time around nobody is ready to come and compromise. We are ready to face the sacrifice and challenge.\u201d\n\nHe further said, \u201cThere is a statement that an idle hand is the devil\u2019s workshop, so many of our students have adopted the act of illegal activities because they are at home doing nothing. The strike has succeeded at increasing the level of internet fraud.\n\n\u201cBut if the school was in session and students were engaged with academic activities, there would be no such thought of getting involved in internet fraud.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I am supposed to have graduated by now which would have been done a month ago. But here I am, I am still waiting on ASUU to call off strike before we can go back. The strike can also reduce the level of interest for education.\n\n\u201cIf a student sits at home doing nothing, he or she begins to think otherwise and if this otherwise starts working then you should be sure that the interest of such a person will definitely be reduced.\n\n\u201cWhat we are after as students is that the federal government and ASUU should just reach a resolution. In every negotiation table, there is always a space that the both parties will have to have a compromise on a particular aspect of that negotiation.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what they have to do but our concern is that they must resolve the issues and end the strike within seven days.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, had on Tuesday directed the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, to resolve the prolonged strike embarked upon by the four university-based unions and report back to him in two weeks time which elapses on Tuesday, August 2, 2022.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nManufacturing giant of mining explosives, Nigachem Nigeria Limited, yesterday, organized a capacity building training of over 50 mining companies on use of explosives at their sites this is following issues on safe- mining in the solid minerals sector.\n\nSpeaking on the essence of the \u2018Two-day Technical Training In Explosives Management and Optimization\u2019 , the Founder and Chairman, NIGACHEM Nigeria Limited, Engr Sylvanus Ghasarah, represented by the Executive Director, Administration and Human Resources, Maureen Tiamiyu, explained that the company deed it fit to give back to its customers across the country through capacity building that would cushion effects of high cost of materials via optimization.\n\nGhasarah also noted that the cost of doing business has been over 300 per cent, and there was need to optimize this cost to continue in business.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe know how the inflation rate has gone up. We know the exchange rate, how much is gone up. So the cost of doing business has been over 300 per cent.\n\n\u201cI know that our product has gone up a lot. So for us to give back a little bit to a customer to appreciate their patronage, we have put up this optimization so that even though the cost has gone up, if they can know how to manage the explosives properly, they can manage their costs more efficiently.\n\n\u201cWhat we want is for them to be able to carry out that blast with profits. We don\u2019t want the increase in prices to affect them because sometimes some businesses are closing down. So the aim is for people to be aware. I mean, mining engineers versus the accountants in the organizations versus the owners of the business, everybody needs to come together and put their heads together; the miners need to understand that there is a cost to blasting and the better they can efficiently manage their blasting, the better for the business owners.\n\n\u201cAnd they effect of all the other factors; diesel price has gone up, exchange rate, the effect could be cushioned with optimization basically.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, he added that the training would be taken to other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning. We have started this at this time. We have planned to go to different regions where we have our customer cluster, like I said, is a give back to our customers and our customers all over Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo we will continue to have one programme or another to give back to our customers\u201d, he said.\n\nAlso Executive Director, Sales, Nigachem Nigeria Limited, Engr Bayo Yusuf, described the capacity building workshop as reawakening training for customers.\n\n\u201cBasically, everybody here is not a greenhorn but professionals, and they understand the language, and what we need to do is to just follow up on the product we supply them to make sure they get the best value in the application against the value for their money for using our product\u201d, Yusuf said.\n\nOn the areas lacking among mining companies as customers, he said, \u201cThe emphasis is on security and safety of our products because of global wave of terrorism and insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cExplosive if it gets into wrong hands could do a lot of damage. We have to emphasize that whoever buys our products, we have the technology, capacity, and infrastructure to be able to track and trace whatever takes our material.\n\n\u201cWe say to our customers to safeguard our products, ensure you have proper human reliability of your workers so it doesn\u2019t leak out of your premises. Leakage can hardly happen with us but when it gets to the end-user we don\u2019t have control\u201d, he said.\n\nHe also explained that there was difference between his company\u2019s product called Super Power Explosives or 90 Super Power 80, and it is not an Improvised Explosive Device, IED, rather is for civil works- mining, quarrying and oil and gas exploration\n\nHowever, he called on government to make sure roads across the country are reconstructed, rehabilitated and properly maintained, and if not safety and security of Nigerians cannot be guaranteed.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on the impact of insecurity on the mining sector, the Director, Mines Inspectorate, Ministry of Mining and Steel Development, Engr Frank Odom, said there was need to track and monitor movement from point of manufacture to usage or storage as the case maybe, and stressed the need for companies in the mining sector to copy what Coca-cola Bottling Company, Dangote Company, and others are doing to track their trucks.\n\n\u201cThese trucks carrying mining explosives are not monitored while moving on the roads. It is important putting additional measures to know probably on your phone or tablets you can see when a material leaves from the point it was sold or conveyed from or loaded from or even the sea port and to look at it as making progress to where it will be delivered for usage or storage.\n\nThis will prevent diversion, you can raise alarm over delay on the road by calling nearest security agency, you will know what it is happening to the truck every minute.\n\nHe made it known that there will designated companies specifically for explosives movement of explosives, that would be registered and licensed for that purpose, but not there yet because mechanisms are being put together, and he added that the tracking would be done by the Ministry.\n\n\u201cHowever, when those companies come on stream they would be compelled to do the same because there is no too much monitoring because it is for the same purpose in order for us not to be lost in anything or caught unawares. So that is the main purpose,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the workshop organised by NIGACHEM will boost and improve productivity of miners as far as safe mining and profitability are concerned, which is also the key in capacity building.\n\nOne of the participants at the workshop, Assistant, Manager, Section 9 (1) Manager, Mines Department, Dangote Cement Plc, Obajana Plant, Kogi State, Engr Caleb Aransiola, commended Nigachem for the capacity building and new knowledge acquired as far as optimisation is concerned.\n\nAransiola said Nigachem did not only focused on profit but showed concern to help its customers by giving back to their customers\n\n\u201cDespite two decades of practical experience on the field I still gained a lot from the resource people, who have four decades of experience, especially on the issues we are talking about I\u2019m terms of optimisation\n\n\u201cWhat I am taking back home is to make sure my employer, Dangote Cement Plc, Obajana Plant have more profit and the turnover of the business, improve on the cost analysis and making more because if the company doesn\u2019t make profit we also will be out of job.\n\n\u201cI need to improve more on safe-mining because we basically focus on blasting because blasting is the most technical aspect of mining. I need to avoid misfire which at the end we will record success; no fatality and also maximize cost\u201d, he said.\n\nAccording to him, the company has strong policy on tracking movement, use, storage and management, which no explosives have left the company since exception due to the high technology and discipline put in place to curb ay breaches, but more will be done to improve on what the company has security of explosives and movement.\n\n[7/22, 1:57 PM] Palma Jennifer: \u201cI will prioritize education, engage youths in nation building\u201d- Adebayo\n\nPresidential Candidate of the Social Democratic Party, SDP, Prince Adewole Adebayo has promised to prioritize education and engage youths in leadership roles if elected as President of the country next year.\n\nAdebayo stated this when he played host to the leadership of National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS in Abuja.\n\nWhile promising to represent the interest of the masses and youths through a policy that sustains and guarantees a smooth educational system, Prince Adebayo charged the student body to rise to the defense of the nation\u2019s educational sector.\n\nThe leader of the delegation and national secretary of the National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS, Mr. Salahudeen Lukman said the visit was to interface with Presidential flag bearers of political parties on their agenda for the educational sector.\n\nLukman advocated more fundings for the sector to save it from incessant strikes and urged the federal government to find a lasting solution to the current industrial action embarked upon by he Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU.",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP has filed a suit against the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC for \u201cfailing to prosecute those suspected to have participated in vote-buying and electoral bribery\u201d in the June 18 governorship election in Ekiti State.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSERAP In a statement on Sunday, cited reports that suggested there was a brazen pattern of vote-buying and electoral bribery at several polling units in the state, including bargaining prices for votes and payments made in uncompleted buildings.\n\nThe group in the suit seeks \u201can order to compel INEC to obtain detailed information about reports of vote-buying by the three leading political parties in the Ekiti election.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSERAP is also seeking to compel INEC to promptly and effectively prosecute those arrested, and bring to justice anyone who sponsored, aided and abetted act.\u201d\n\nSERAP is arguing that, \u201cVote buying is a threat to fair and representative elections. Vote buying amounts to undue influence and improper electoral influence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cWealthy candidates and their sponsors ought not to be allowed to profit from their crimes. Arresting and prosecuting vote buyers will end widespread impunity for vote buying ahead of the February 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nSERAP is arguing that, \u201cVote buying encourages poor governance and weakens citizens\u2019 capacity to hold their \u2018elected officials\u2019 accountable for their actions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSERAP is also arguing that, \u201cVote buying undermines the ability of INEC to discharge its responsibilities under Section 153 of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution (as amended), paragraph 15(a) of the third schedule of the Constitution, and the Electoral Act 2022.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also arguing that, \u201cCorruption of the ballot box intrudes on the freedom of Nigerian voters to make up their own minds. Vote buying and other forms of electoral corruption freeze out the less wealthy candidates and parties.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSERAP is arguing that, \u201cWhen political candidates or their sponsors decide to buy the support of the people rather than contest fairly for their votes, there are possibilities that such candidates and sponsors will show a disregard for democratic rules and a disposition to adopt illegal means becomes inevitable.\u201d\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Opeyemi Owolabi, read in part: \u201cVote buying is entirely an act of election malpractice connected with vested interest since an election can be said to be free and fair when it is devoid of vote buying.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEnding impunity for vote-buying and electoral bribery would contribute to free and fair elections. A corruption-free electoral process is essential for building public confidence in the electoral process, and the credibility and legitimacy of the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the people\u2019s most sacred rights is the right to vote. INEC has a constitutional and statutory responsibility to ensure the effective exercise of the right of all eligible voters to participate in their own government in free and fair elections.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPreventing and combating vote buying and electoral bribery would advance the people\u2019s right to vote and to participate in their own government, as well as bolster the ability of INEC to effectively discharge its constitutional and statutory mandates.\u201dhttps://www.tvcnews.tv/2022/07/nubess-gives-fg-14-days-ultimatum-to-resolve-asuu-strike/\n\n\u201cMany years of allegations of vote-buying and electoral bribery and entrenched impunity of perpetrators have undermined public confidence in the electoral process.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cProsecuting allegations of vote-buying and electoral bribery would be entirely consistent with the Nigerian Constitution, the Electoral Act, and the country\u2019s international human rights anti-corruption obligations.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgents of the three dominant political parties in the state, namely All Progressives Congress (APC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Social Democratic Party (SDP), were reportedly involved in buying votes across the state, and voters offered as high as N10,000 in exchange for their votes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution provides in Section 14(1)(c) that, \u2018the participation by the people in their government shall be ensured in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 145(2) of the Electoral Act provides that, \u2018a prosecution under this Act shall be undertaken by legal officers of the Commission or any legal practitioner appointed by it.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

          "text": "A new video released by terrorists shows abducted passengers of an Abuja-Kaduna train service being tortured by their captors.\n\nThe heart-rending video circulating on Sunday showed the terrorists flogging their victims mercilessly. They threatened to kill the captives.\n\nOn March 28, 2022, terrorists attacked the Kaduna-bound passenger train, killing eight people and abducting 63. Many others were wounded.\n\nAfter a series of releases for ransom, 43 Nigerians are still held by the terrorists somewhere within the Birnin Gwari forest in Kaduna.\n\nIn the viral video recorded in Hausa, the terrorists threatened to kidnap Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari and Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai, as well as other government officials.\n\nThe terrorists claimed the government knows what their demands are, and if not met, they will enslave the captives and sell the rest \u201cjust like the Chibok girls.\u201d\n\nThey also vowed to \u201cturn this place to a slaughterhouse\u201d if they are not appeased.\n\nThe terrorists also said they know of a plan by the Nigerian government to storm their hideout \u201cwith guns and planes.\u201d\n\nWHAT THEY SAID\n\nThis is the result of what the bad Nigerian government has caused for her people.\n\nLook at it very well. It\u2019s not our intention to do this but this is what the Nigerian government has caused.\n\nWe have tried to dialogue with the Nigerian government some time ago in Kaduna to release the abducted victims but the FG seems relaxed \u2013 having their tea.\n\nThe FG should know that we are aware that there\u2019s no committee being set up to fast track the release of the victims. We know that you are planning to forcefully rescue the victims using guns and planes.\n\nYour guns and your planes are spider webs in the sight of Allah.\n\nWe are fighting for the cause of Allah. We don\u2019t fear anybody. We only fear Allah. We have pledge solidarity to Allah. We will carryout whatever Allah says we should.\n\nThis is small compared to what you will see. Just as we have told you in times past \u2013 if our demands are not met, we will turn this area into a slaughterhouse\u2026\n\nThis is our message to the government of Nigeria and just as you have seen these people here, by God\u2019s grace, you will see your leaders; your senators and governors will come before us.\n\nThese ones you see here, we will keep some as our slaves and sell them off just as our Imam told you in the past.\n\nJust like the Chibok girls that were sold off, we will equally sell these ones as slaves\u2026\n\nIf you don\u2019t adhere to our demands, we will kill the ones we need to kill and sell the remaining. By God\u2019s grace, El-Rufai, Buhari, we will bring you here.\n\nEXCLUSIVE DETAILS\n\nARISE News spoke to a family member of one of the abductees who would rather be anonymous.\n\nHe said the terrorists contacted him within the past week and told him that two of the captives are seriously ill from wound infections.\n\nThe terrorists told him to come get them both, as long as he comes with food and water.\n\nExcited at the prospect of securing his loved ones\u2019 freedom, he loaded his car with food and water for the captives and set out for Birnin Gwari from Kaduna.\n\nHowever, some family members of other captives got wind of the plan, and weren\u2019t too pleased he was negotiating for just his own relatives.\n\nAccording to the source, he was barely 30 minutes from the location given to him by the terrorists in Birnin Gwari, when he was stopped at a military checkpoint.\n\nThey had \u201cinformation from headquarters\u201d that someone was coming with ransom for the terrorists.\n\nHe told them to check the car, that all he had was food and water, not cash.\n\nNonetheless, he was detained for hours, then sent back.\n\nBACKSTORY\n\nOn March 28, 2022, terrorists attacked a Kaduna-bound passenger train, killing eight people and abducting 63 others. Many others were wounded.\n\nOne of the abducted victims, the managing director of the Nigerian Bank of Agriculture, Alwan Hassan, was released about a week later, after reportedly paying a ransom of N100 million.\n\nA pregnant woman was also released, before another 11 were set free early June.\n\nOn July 9, Seven of 50 remaining abductees were released.\n\nReports in local media claim the terrorists were paid N800 million; N100 million for each of the six Nigerians released, and N200 million for the Pakistani captive.\n\nHowever, Tukur Mamu who negotiated their release \u2013 as well as previous negotiations with the terrorists \u2013 insisted that no ransom was paid.\n\nMamu is publisher of the Desert Herald and a media consultant to popular Kaduna-based Islam cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi.\n\nDemola Ojo, Nissi Gabriel",

Natasha Fouts, a spokeswoman for CalFire, said officials don\u2019t expect to contain the fire until next week.\n\nLocals described evacuating their homes with the flames approaching and one shoeless elderly man attempting to flee the blaze on Friday was rescued by firefighters after crashing his car into a ditch.\n\nThe scale of the evacuation means it is proving challenging to find accommodation for all those seeking shelter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re full with evacuees,\u201d Alyssa Wildt, a local hotel owner, told the LA Times.\n\n\u201cToday we have a bunch of fire crews looking for rooms,\u201d Ms Wildt added. \u201cWe don\u2019t have them. I believe most of town is full.\u201d\n\nThe scale of the blaze marks an ominous start to California\u2019s wildfire season and officials have warned that a combination of drought, climate change, and overgrown vegetation are posing significant challenges and increasing the chances of the fire spreading rapidly.\n\nMuch of the United States is sweltering through a heatwave and heat advisory warnings are in effect in more than a dozen states. Temperatures in Mariposa County hit 96F (35.5C) on Saturday, and are expected to stay at that level for the next few days.\n\nYosemite National Park, which lies to the north-east of where Oak Fire is burning, is home to some of the largest and oldest sequoia trees in the world. The redwoods were threatened by another blaze earlier this month, but firefighters managed to save them.\n\nThe US Forest Service said on Friday it is taking emergency measures to protect the trees, including removing low-lying vegetation that can fuel fires and other measures.\n\nClimate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.\n\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.\n\nSeveral European governments have struggled to contain dozens of separate wildfires which have ripped across the continent in recent weeks.\n\nBBC",
