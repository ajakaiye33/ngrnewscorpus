Under the primary health development agency which would mean that everything about primary healthcare will be under the agency.\n\n\u201cPresently, we have the primary healthcare domiciled in the ministry of health and we have the local government service commission, who really pays the workers under the local government system. Some of these challenges are there.\u201d\n\nThe Commissioner also disclosed that the process was ongoing to make it possible for people to be able to access primary healthcare while the state government has given the approval for the migration of staff from other departments to the agency.\n\n\u201cThis could have been done long before now, as you would remember the EndSars protests of last year in which the office of the primary healthcare development agency was vandalised. The place was well set up, it was one of the best in the country, and they went there and destroyed many things. We need to put all that back together. First of all we have to wait for the insurance company, the owner of the building, to restore it, this took us away from our initial plans.\n\n\u201cWe are conducting training for the primary healthcare workers to bring them at par with their counterparts in other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThis will be followed by the enumeration of the different primary health care centres to know what we have and find out what should be done,\u2019\u2019 he said\n\nThe commissioner dismissed insinuations that the state government has abandoned the primary healthcare, explaining that \u201cit may look like nothing is happening, but work is ongoing, when we have done what we are planning to do, we will be able to have more funds from the national primary healthcare development agency, so it is not being abandoned.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cRight now there are different controls of primary health care staff working in this area, going forward, all the staff shall be under the control of one agency, the Akwa Ibom State primary health care development agency. \u201c\n\nHe also explained that the challenges that had bedeviled the school of health technology in Etinan have been addressed after a committee was set up to find lasting solutions to the issues.\n\nHe ruled out the establishment of more primary healthcare centres for now by the state government , as according to him, \u201cevery ward in the state has a primary healthcare centre\u201d, adding that the centres are being equipped by the state government accordingly.",

          "text": "By Elo Edremoda, Warri\n\nNot less than 27 residential buildings have been razed in the wake of a boundary dispute between two communities Obubu and Oleri in Udu council area of Delta state.\n\nIt was gathered the conflict began last Tuesday afternoon when a real estate developer from Obubu community allegedly trespassed a land belonging to neighbouring Oleri.\n\nAccording to reports, some angry indigenes of Oleri allegedly stormed the land for development, forcing the equipment away from the location and further invaded Obubu community, setting houses on fire over alleged trespass of their land.\n\nIndigenes of Obubu, including women and children, were said to have scampered for safety, seeking refuge in other neighbouring communities to avoid been caught up in the onslaught.\n\nThough details of the incident were not clear as of press time, it was gathered that warriors from Obubu made attempt to retaliate the attack the following day but were repelled by Oleri youths.\n\nAlthough no death was recorded, the clash reportedly left several persons from the two communities with varying degrees of wounds.\n\nA source,who spoke in confidence, said in 2001, the Ovie of Udu kingdom and people from both communities sat and resolved the matter by sharing the disputed lands for both communities.\n\n\u201cIt was after then that a tourist centre came and they (Oleri) gave out 350 acres for the tourist centre, another 50 acres to a Catholic church\n\nRead Also: Gunmen kill radio anchor in Ibadan\n\nCouncillor of Obubu ward, Hon. Oputu Awhotu, confirmed all 27 houses burnt are in Obubu community, adding the community is still under threat of attack in a conversation with The Nation.\n\nHe said a visit to the land in question showed it is a portion that has never been in dispute between the communities.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe explained though both communities have had boundary disputes in time past, some of them were \u201csettled out of court and others in favour of Obubu community\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe place they took the bulldozer to has never been in dispute between Obubu and Oleri communities. So these guys attacked Obubu and said the machine must not work.\n\n\u201cNobody in Obubu had dispute with Oleri community, so they just attacked, shooting anyhow and burning houses. Either 27 or 28 houses were burnt.\n\n\u201cThe current situation is we are still facing threats of their attack. The council called both communities over the matter, they came for inspection too.

And we are following up with dialogue, which at the end of the day is what will happen. We have to talk, we have to discuss. Minister of Defence, Minister of Interior and service chiefs were in Enugu earlier last Saturday and we are going to do follow-up meetings on that again starting from tomorrow.\n\n\u201cWe briefed him and he accepted that dialogue is the way to go in all these. Like I keep on saying, there is a very thin line between perception and reality, so certain things should be done, at least to assuage the feelings of the people in the area and make them not to feel unwanted, so that area was also discussed.\u201d\n\nHe said they also briefed the president on labour issues, including the recent strike by Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) for two months before it was called off.\n\n\u201cI have to see him to appraise him with labour industrial milieu, especially when you know that the judiciary and parliamentary workers JUSUN and PASAN respectively had been been on strike that lasted for two months. We achieved a truce, through up an agreement and we have to today summit his own copies of the agreement to him.\n\n\u201cWe are going to monitor the agreement. He is very interested in it. And if you remember, he had to do an Executive Order 10 in consonance with the constitution, so that we have independence, financial autonomy for the judiciary and legislature in the states. And he was happy that at least the strikes had been called off.\u201d\n\nThe minister also said government was apprehensive over the looming industrial action in Kaduna as regards the face-off between the state government and Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), and that this formed part of the discussion with President Buhari.\n\nHe said this followed complaints by the leadership of the NLC that the Kaduna State government had refused to obey the terms of agreement reached between the two parties after the Federal Government, through the Minister of Labour and Employment, intervened to broker a truce in the industrial dispute between the two parties.",

I urge all fathers in the country to put their heads together in the best interest of our nation. As a nation, we are in pains as a result of the security challenges that we are passing through.\n\n\u201cFathers should stand up as soldiers of Christ and defend the Church and Nigeria at large. As fathers, we must continue to advocate peace and unity in diversity beginning from our homes,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ambience of the church was lightened up as Kalu donated over N2 million to the Catholic Men Organisation (CMO), Catholic Women Organisation and officiating Catholic priests.\n\nIn his response, Rev. Father Charles congratulated fathers and acknowledged that the roles of fathers in nation building cannot be over-emphasised.\n\nThe Catholic cleric also urged fathers to register with CMO and lamented the refusal of some fathers in the church to join the organisation. He outlined the numerous benefits of aligning with the forum, while urging unregistered fathers to join the association.\n\nEarlier, the church conferred an award of patrons of the CMO on Joe Ezie and Emmanuel Umoh.",

The two women were arrested with seven bags of cannabis weighing 77.23kg brought in from Ogbese, Ondo State, to supply a man they simply identified as Alhaji. According to them, they had earlier supplied the same Alhaji two bags before coming with the seven bags they were caught with.\n\nOn Friday June 18, operatives of the Oyo state Command acting on intelligence also raided the residence of Alhaji Faruq, at Elebu area, Akala expressway, Oluyole LGA, Ibadan, where they recovered 43 ampoules of methylphenidate. In Kaduna state, a drug trafficker, Segun Abraham was arrested at Panteka area of the state on 17th June with 211.500kg of skunk heading to Kano state.\n\nMeanwhile, a Nigerian returning from Pakistan, Ezenyeche Kingsley Ebuka has been arrested by NDLEA operatives at the Murtala Muhammed International Airpirt, MMIA, Ikeja Lagos with five pellets of heroin weighing 250grams discovered in his anus. The suspect had arrived the \u2018D\u2019 arrival hall of the airport on 14th June on Turkish airline flight from Pakistan with the illicit drug inserted in his anus. He however failed to beat the eagle eyes of narcotic officers during inward clearance of passengers on the flight.\n\nWhile commending the Ogun, Oyo, Kaduna and the MMIA Commands of the Agency for sustaining the offensive action against illicit drug trafficking and the cartels running it, Gen. Marwa warned that the NDLEA will not spare any law enforcement agent hiding under the privilege of his uniform to engage in narcotic criminal business.\n\n\u201cThose who think they can sabotage ongoing efforts to rid Nigeria of the menace of illicit drug trafficking and abuse hiding behind the fa\u00e7ade of their uniforms should better think twice because they\u2019ll have NDLEA to contend with.\u201d",

          "text": "* Uncovers heroin in Pakistan-returnee\u2019s anus at Lagos airport\n\nA serving officer of a law enforcement agency, Popoola Abayomi has been arrested for selling assorted illicit drugs to students of a federal university and cultists in Ogun State.\n\nThe drug dealer who serves in the Lagos State Command of the security agency was arrested on Wednesday, June 15, 2021 after days of surveillance on his wife\u2019s shop used as his sales point in Camp area of Abeokuta.\n\nOne of his salesmen, a motorcycle rider known as Ogah was trailed to the location at about 8p.m and arrested with six pinches of Colorado weighing 1.17grammes before Popoola who has been on the agency\u2019s watchlist, was nabbed with different illicit drugs, including codeine -17 bottles; cannabis -22.26grams; tramadol 230 -98grammes; 61 tablets of flunitrazepam -23.72grammes; 113 tablets of molly -48.16grammes and sex drops -43.92grammes.\n\nAfter the arrest of the two suspects, some student union officials of the institution blocked the NDLEA team with their official vehicle. The narcotic agents however restrained themselves and after hours of standoff, succeeded in moving the suspects to custody.\n\nIn the same vein, one Adelodun Kamaldeen has been arrested by operatives of the Oyo State Command of the agency at General Area, Ilorin, Kwara State following the interception of a parcel containing cocaine and heroin that weighed 10.5grammes and 4.8grammes , respectively on June 13.\n\nThe following day, two ladies; Mary Peter, 40, and Mercy Oladele, 39, were arrested at Total Garden, Ibadan when NDLEA operatives acting on a tip-off, intercepted their commercial micra car. The two women were arrested with seven bags of cannabis weighing 77.23kg brought in from Ogbese, Ondo State, to supply a man they simply identified as Alhaji. According to them, they had earlier supplied the same Alhaji two bags before coming with the seven bags they were caught with.\n\nOn Friday 18th June, operatives of the Oyo state Command acting on intelligence also raided the residence of one Alhaji Faruq at Elebu area, Akala expressway, Oluyole LGA, Ibadan, where they recovered 43 ampoules of methylphenidate.\n\nIn Kaduna state, a drug trafficker, Segun Abraham was arrested at Panteka area of the state on 17th June with 211.500kg of skunk heading to Kano state.\n\nMeanwhile, a Nigerian returning from Pakistan, Ezenyeche Kingsley Ebuka has been arrested by NDLEA operatives at the Murtala Muhammed International Airpirt, MMIA, Ikeja Lagos with five pellets of heroin weighing 250grammes discovered in his anus.\n\nThe suspect had arrived the \u2018D\u2019 arrival hall of the airport on 14th June on Turkish airline flight from Pakistan with the illicit drug inserted in his anus. He however failed to beat the eagle eyes of narcotic officers during inward clearance of passengers on the flight.\n\nWhile commending the Ogun, Oyo, Kaduna and the MMIA Commands of the agency for sustaining the offensive action against illicit drug trafficking and the cartels running it, the Chairman and CEO of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (rtd) warned that the NDLEA will not spare any law enforcement agent hiding under the privilege of his uniform to engage in narcotic criminal business.\n\n\u201cThose who think they can sabotage ongoing efforts to rid Nigeria of the menace of illicit drug trafficking and abuse hiding behind the fa\u00e7ade of their uniforms should better think twice because they\u2019ll have NDLEA to contend with. We\u2019ll not only arrest and expose them but we\u2019ll equally prosecute them and seize all assets acquired through the proceeds of their criminal act\u201d, he warned\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Seeks suspension of elections until new grundnorm is promulgated\n\n\u2022Urges UN to intervene in resolving crisis in Nigeria\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThe National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) has written to President Muhammadu Buhari over the rising security challenges in the country and canvassed as panacea, the return to the 1960 and 1963 Constitutions to replace the extant 1999 grundnorm, which it said the military imposed on Nigerians.\n\nThe pro-democracy group, which was in the vanguard of the clamour for the rebirth of democracy in Nigeria during the military regime of late Gen. Sani Abacha, leading to the return to civil rule in 1999, in an open letter to the president, pressed for the suspension of further elections until the country gets a new constitution.\n\nThe letter, dated June 15, 2021, and obtained by THISDAY, was signed by its General-Secretary, Mr. Ayo Opadokun.\n\nAnother letter by the group also dated June 15, 2021, and signed by Opadokun, to the Secretary-General, United Nations Organisation (UN), Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, requested the global body\u2019s intervention to halt the fast deterioration of national security and political instability in Nigeria.\n\nTHISDAY also obtained a copy of the letter to the UN copied to the UN Security Council; the President of the United States; the Speaker of the Congress and Leader of the Senate of the United States; the European Union and European Parliament; the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the House of Common and the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Buhari as well as the President of the Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs of Nigeria.\n\nNADECO, in the letter to the president, accused him of fuelling secessionist agitations through the \u201cFulanisation\u201d policy of his administration and its disregard for the constitution.\n\nIt also decried the deterioration of national security and political instability under Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nIt said: \u201cOther than diminishing democracy to a virtual dictatorship, NADECO wonders by which Section of our Ill-founded and presently extremely beleaguered so-called the Federal Republic of Nigeria Constitution 1999 do the trio of your good self, Mr. President, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives aided by your hound dog, the Minister of Justice, public service officers all, with specific functions set out in the constitution, find the justification to judge yourselves entitled to jump uninvited, with decrying statements, into the compendium of frays between trespassing Fulani herdsmen and ancestral land owners exercising their primordial rights to decide whom they want or do not want on their lands.\u201d\n\nNADECO said perhaps Buhari\u2019s interest in supporting the herdsmen was due to the fact of his being the patron of the Fulani herdsmen and cattle traders, (Miyetti Allah), making him to push for the suspension of land owners\u2019 rights \u201cin awe of such trespassers.\u201d\n\nIt stated that it is such defence for especially preferred ethnicities that had led to the various discomfort experienced by other groups, including Ndigbo and the whole of the Middle Belt and Southern Nigeria, which now want to opt out of Nigeria.\n\nNADECO argued that the growing secessionist tendencies in the country were fueled by what it called the obvious policy of Fulanisation and the president\u2019s refusal to discontinue the operation of the 1999 Constitution as altered.\n\nIt said: \u201cIn all the circumstances of this matter, NADECO has no alternative but to join in the insistence that there better be no more elections under the 1999 so-called federal constitution, until we return to the negotiated 1960 and 1963 federal constitutions to which Nigerians subscribed at independence and when we became a republic.\u201d\n\nNADECO also expressed concern about the inequitable distribution of political posts between the North and the South, saying that out of the total of 360 House of Representatives members, the South has 169, while the North has 191.\n\nIt also decried the injustice in the distribution of oil revenue.\n\nCiting the Nigeria Bureau of Statistics report of 2017, NADECO stated that the North-central receives 20 per cent of oil revenue and contributes 0.00 per cent, while the North-east receives 16 per cent and contributes 0.00 per cent.\n\nIt added that the North-west receives 21 per cent from the oil revenue and contributes 0.00 per cent.\n\nNADECO said every month, the 19 Northern states receive a minimum of 57 per cent of 100 per cent of oil revenue to which they contribute 0.00 per cent.\n\nAccording to it, the South-west receives 16 per cent, contributes 6.36 per cent, while South-east receives 11.00 per cent; contributes 3.12 per cent and South-South receives 16.00 per cent and contributes 70.64 per cent.\n\nWorking with the data from the office of the Accountant General of the Federation, as published by the Ministry of Finance (2013 April), NADECO stated that the 357 LGAs of the 17 Southern states received 45.1% and contributed 100 per cent, while the 419 LGAs of the 19 Northern states received 54. 9% and contributed 0.00 per cent.\n\nNADECO added: \u201cThe foregoing narrative explains why the owners of Nigeria were not given the opportunity to participate in constitution-making whilst the Tables of Rights of the component parts of the country show the reasons why you, Mr. President, and your preferred citizens, will forever not allow Nigeria to go back to what was agreed and formed part of the independence constitution; making one Nigeria the biggest fraud ever.\u201d\n\nNADECO decried what it regarded as the nepotism, ill-treatment, inequitable and unjust nature with which the Buhari administration has governed Nigeria.\n\nIt said since Section 6 of the 1999 Constitution ousted the jurisdiction of courts, there was no local Nigerian legal forum the entrapped ethnic nationalities who constitute the majority and are occupying four out of the six zones in the country can seek redress.\n\nNADECO accused Buhari of rejecting all entreaties and appeals by eminent Nigerians and ethnic nationalities leaders for the country to return Nigeria to the independence constitution as negotiated by the founding fathers and upon which Nigeria sought membership of the United Nations, but would rather accuse the protagonists of seeking to break up the country whilst ridiculing and threatening them with the charge of secession.\n\nIt said it was based on this that it decided on behalf of Nigerians to put world leaders on notice through the open letter.\n\nNADECO stated that it supported and endorsed the clarion call made by a former Minister of Defence, Lt. Gen. Theophilus Danjuma (rtd), and the \u2018Save Our Soul Plea\u2019 of the Ilana Omo Odua led by Prof. Banji Akintoye, asking Nigerians to exercise their rights of self-defence.\n\nIt said its reason was that the federal government had failed to fulfil its constitutional responsibility as contained in section 14 (2) (b) of the 1999 Constitution as altered, which states: \u201cThe security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "With the resumption of activities in courts and state Houses of Assembly, the judiciaries and the legislatures in states of the federation have begun to relist cases and bills that were stalled as a result of the strike by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) called off after two months.\n\nTHISDAY investigations showed that the industrial action, embarked upon to press home the workers\u2019 demands for financial autonomy for the two arms of government in the 36 states of the federation, stalled proceedings in over 100,000 court cases, some of which were in the judgment delivery stage, in 16 states.\n\nThe strike also stopped the passage of 49 important bills in six states, while debates on many other legislative bills were halted.\n\nAccording to the investigation, the passage of five bills was affected in Edo State; four in Bauchi; three in Ondo; one in Cross River; 15 in Nasarawa and 21 in Niger State.\n\nAlso, proceedings in 880 court cases were halted in Ekiti; over 100 cases in Sokoto; and over 100,000 cases in Katsina, mostly in sharia and magistrate\u2019s courts.\n\nTo reduce the burden on lawyers and litigants, Lagos and Plateau states\u2019 courts have waived the default fees on cases that were not filed at the appropriate time.\n\nTHISDAY also gathered that the strike may have plunged the Niger State House of Assembly into a constitutional crisis as it sat for only 176 days before it entered a new legislative year last Thursday against the mandatory 181 days stipulated by Section 104 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nInvestigations showed that to avert such a constitutional crisis, the Ekiti and Imo States\u2019 Houses of Assembly were sitting at the official quarters of the speakers since they were public buildings recognised by the House rules.\n\nIn Edo State, the Speaker of the state House of Assembly. Hon. Marcus Onobu, told THISDAY that about five bills critical to good governance could not be passed due to the strike embarked by the legislative workers.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe assembly has five outstanding bills at various stages of passage before the strike by legislative began.\u201d\n\nOn the judiciary, THISDAY\u2019s investigation revealed that the judicial workers in the state did not embark on any strike.\n\nIt was gathered that their refusal to join the national body was borne out of the experience they had when they participated in such strike during the administration of Mr. Adams Oshiomhole and were not paid for the period they were on strike to date.\n\nIn Ekiti State, no fewer than 880 cases were stalled in different hierarchies of courts as a result of the strike, which commenced on April 6 and ended on June 14.\n\nThe Public Relations Officer, Ekiti State Judiciary, Mr. Oba Olayiwola, told THISDAY that a total of 880 cases were paused by the industrial action.\n\nHe said: \u201cOut of these cases, 600 were in the Ekiti State High Court, Ado Ekiti, while the magistrates and other high court divisions had 280 pending cases.\n\nHowever, the Speaker of the Ekiti State House of Assembly, Hon. Funminiyi Afuye, said the strike didn\u2019t affect the legislature much because the lawmakers were meeting at his lodge regularly to attend to legislative issues.\n\nAfuye, however, agreed that the industrial action affected the passage of some bills, which he assured would soon be passed to make up for the lost period.\n\nThe Chief Registrar of Sokoto High Court, Mr. Bashir Ibrahim, told THISDAY that over 100 cases filed in the state high court were stalled due to the strike.\n\nHe lamented that many lawyers complained that their clients who were awaiting trials suffered unnecessarily due to the strike.\n\nThe Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Nasarawa State Judiciary, Mr. Enoch Ali-Maku, also told THISDAY that many cases that were on the cause list could not be heard while fresh ones filed shortly before the commencement of the strike could not be listed.\n\nHe, however, said he did not have the exact number of the cases whose proceedings were disrupted by the strike.\n\nThe Clerk of the state House of Assembly, Mr. Ego Maikeffi, also said 15 bills were not passed into law by the legislature as a result of the parliamentary workers\u2019 strike.\n\nIn Bauchi State, the Chairman, House Committee on Information, Hon. Garzali Wunti, said the lawmakers had only four bills pending, which would have been considered and passed if not for the parliamentary staff strike.\n\nIn Taraba State, the Chairman, House Committee on Information, Mr. Bashir Bape, who represents Nguroje State Constituency, told THISDAY that some bills that were at various stages of passage were affected by the industrial action.\n\nIn Katsina, the Chief Registrar of the state High Court, Mr. Kabir Shu\u2019aibu, told THISDAY that there were over 100,000 outstanding cases, whose proceedings were stalled as a result of the strike.\n\nShu\u2019aibu, in an exclusive interview with THISDAY, said Sharia and magistrate\u2019s courts had the highest number of pending cases.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have over 100,000 pending cases because of the strike. Sharia and magistrate\u2019s courts are the courts with the highest number of these outstanding cases. The police have even called us that they have about 400 inmates and that some of the inmates were dying in their cells because of the congestion during the strike.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman for the Kano State High courts, Mr. Baba Jibo, told THISDAY that he could not tell the number of pending cases since they were still been compiled.\n\nChairman, Plateau State House of Assembly Committee on Information, Hon. Peter Dasun, said a backlog of bills and motions were stalled but added that he could not give an exact figure.\n\nAlso speaking to THISDAY, the Chief Registrar of Jos High Court, Hon Ladi Madaki, said the judges were currently \u2018calling over\u2019 cases that should have been heard during the strike, and assigning them new dates.\n\nAccording to her, there is a timing for filing of cases, and defaulters are expected to pay default fees, but the state chief judge has issued a circular that default fees should not apply between April 2021 and June 15 when the courts opened to avoid burden on litigants and their counsel.\n\nShe feared that judges\u2019 annual vacation, which begins by July ending and will last through August, may further constitute a delay, but said it was statutory for judges in superior courts.\n\nBut Plateau State NBA chairman, Mr. Yakubu Bawa, said his association was already meeting the state Chief Judge, Justice Yakubu Dakwak, to appeal to the judges not to go on the six-week annual vacation.\n\nIn Lagos State, the strike had minimal effect on the workings of the state House of Assembly as it carried on its business normally.\n\nWithin the period, the assembly suspended six local government and development councils\u2019 chairmen for breaching rules and regulations guiding the operations of council areas.\n\nIt also approved the executive branch\u2019s request for the purchase of operational vehicles for ministerial and extra-ministerial departments.\n\nHowever, the same cannot be said of the judiciary where all activities were crippled throughout the strike.\n\nFollowing the resolution of the strike, a memo was sent to all heads of department and registrars of court by the state Chief Judge, Justice Kazeem Alogba, waiving default fees in the state from April 6 to June 14, 2021.\n\nIn Niger State, the House of Assembly is now in a dilemma over how to comply with Section 104 of the constitution, which provides that Houses of Assembly should sit for 181 days in a legislative year.\n\nThe Clerk of the House, Alhaji Abdullahi Kagara, confirmed that the assembly is thinking about how it will solve the constitutional crisis the strike has plunged it into, as a result of its inability to meet for the number of days it should sit in a legislative year.\n\nKagara said: \u201cThis is a problem we are trying to solve but since it is not deliberate and it is a national issue, we will get over it.\u201d\n\nIn Ondo State, efforts to ascertain the number of cases stalled by the strike from the Chief Judge, Justice Oluwatoyin Akeredolu, was unsuccessful.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, the Chairman of the House of Assembly Committee on Information, Hon Gbenga Omole, said the passage of three important bills were stalled.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnti-Open Grazing Bill; Violence Against Persons Prohibition Bill; and the Public Fund Committee Bill of the Judiciary and Legislative Autonomy were stalled by the strike.\n\n\u201cApart from these three bills, there are other bills at different stages of debate and legislative actions, which were affected by the strike.\u201d\n\nIn Cross State House of Assembly, the Cross River State Mining and Quarrying Bill (2020) is the only outstanding Bill whose passage was stalled by the strike.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, the Clerk of the Abia State House of Assembly, Sir John-Pedro Irokansi, said that with offices shut down, it was impossible for legislative activities to continue during the strike.\n\nFor Imo State House of Assembly, the Chairman, House Committee on Information, Hon. Johnson Duru (representing Ideato South State Constituency), told THISDAY on the telephone that the activities of the house was not badly affected by the strike.\n\nHe stated that members were meeting at the official quarters of the Speaker, Hon. Paul Emezim, which is a public building in line with the rules of the House of Assembly, to deliberate on matters concerning the smooth running of the state.\n\nSpeaking yesterday, the spokesman of the Osun State House of Assembly, Mr. Kunle Alabi, told THISDAY that the state legislature used the period of the strike to increase its oversight functions since the assembly complex was shut.\n\nBut the state Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Femi Akande, said the strike stalled all court proceedings in cases as far as hearing of both substantive and interlocutory matters were concerned.\n\nThe Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) in Kwara State, Alhaji Mumin Jimoh (SAN), told THISDAY that thousands of cases that were supposed to be adjudicated upon at the various courts in the state were affected.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Initiative to help Nigeria conserve forex\n\nChinedu Eze\n\nAs part of efforts to end the huge capital flight spent on maintenance of aircraft overseas put at $2 billion annually, some operators in the aviation industry and the Akwa Ibom State government have taken steps towards developing maintenance facilities in Nigeria.\n\nIn the last four years, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has given Aircraft Maintenance Organisation (AMO) certificates to Aero Contractors, 7-Star Global Hangers Limited, and Overland Airways for the maintenance of ATR aircraft in addition to the certification given to Execujet, a global maintenance organisation for executive jets.\n\nAlso, by early next year, the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility being built in Uyo by Akwa Ibom State government will come on stream, while the Chairman and CEO of Air Peace, Mr. Allen Onyema, has announced that the airline has completed plans to set up an MRO facility in Nigeria for the maintenance of its fleet and others.\n\nOwing to these, industry experts said the move would end the huge resources spent overseas in the maintenance of aircraft, which is the highest operations cost to airlines after aviation fuel by Nigerian carriers and others.\n\nThe maintenance facilities would, in turn, be a source of forex earner for the country as airlines and aircraft owners in Africa and beyond could maintain their equipment in Nigeria.\n\nThe Head of Engineering and Maintenance of Ibom Air, Mr. Lookman Animaseun, told THISDAY in a telephone interview yesterday that it was good that the NCAA was licensing MRO organisations in Nigeria to save the country about $2 billion spent on aircraft maintenance overseas every year.\n\nAnimaseun said besides the Nigerian market, airline operators in West and Central Africa would also bring their aircraft to be maintained in Nigeria, which would attract forex to the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is good that NCAA is licensing MROs. This is good for Nigeria. We also expect the MRO organisations to reciprocate and properly equip their facilities. I do not have any doubt that we can accomplish that.\n\n\u201cThere is huge market for the facilities in West, Central and other parts of the continent and beyond. It makes me happy that the owners of these maintenance facilities have a good purpose. It is people we know their background and we have interacted with.\n\n\u201cThese facilities will be saving Nigeria $2 billion annually if properly harnessed. We shall have more of the facilities by the time Akwa Ibom completes its own early next year.\n\n\u201cWhat makes me happy is that there is a huge market for these maintenance facilities. Aero Contractors, which has maintenance facility, cannot cope with the demand anymore. It should look for a place to expand its hangar. The company needs to up its game to match to what the industry is looking up to now.\u201d\n\nIndustry expert, Captain Ado Sanusi, told THISDAY that the MRO business is a good one. \u201cBut before investors go into it, they should do their commercial evaluation, looking at the manpower, the clientele and the skills so that their operations would be profitable,\u201d he advised.\n\nOn the market for the MRO facilities in Nigeria, the Managing Director of Aero Contractors, Captain Mahmood Abdullahi, said Aero Contractors had been having third party aircraft (from other airlines) for maintenance and they were not coming from Nigeria alone.\n\n\u201cYou can see a lot of third party aircraft are here in the hangar. It is not only Nigerian airlines. There is the Democratic Republic of Congo, they have their Boeing 737 here and we have already signed with the Ghana Civil Aviation and they have given us the approval to maintain aircraft registered in Ghana.\n\n\u201cAnd so, we have an agreement with Passion Air in Ghana. So is Tunisia, they are working on it to get their approval and then Malta also, we are working on it to get their approval. Yes, we are working on all those approvals; once we have those approvals we will maintain aircraft registered in those countries in our facility here,\u201d Mahmood said.\n\nHe also spoke about the cost of taking aircraft overseas for maintenance, saying: \u201cI think there are so many disadvantages to taking your aircraft out of the country for maintenance. If you talk about how much it is going to cost an airline to fly its aircraft from Nigeria, to probably Europe, or wherever it is going to, if you talk about the fuel that they would burn to go, navigational charges paid, the aircraft goes there, and then fly it back again.\n\n\u201cAll these costs are saved by having an MRO here. We have saved the airlines such huge costs. Then, if you come to the maintenance aspect, you are talking about the labour. If they go there, they pay for man-hour in dollars, but here we charge them the man-hour in naira. So it is easy for them if they cannot access the forex, at least we are giving them an opportunity to pay naira here.\u201d\n\nOnyema decried the huge costs the airline incurs maintaining its aircraft overseas, saying that the company has completed plans to establish a maintenance hangar in Nigeria.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThe establishment of a veritable MRO is long overdue. You don\u2019t want to know the amount of capital flight, monies that could have been used for other things in our nation is going abroad. Let me give you an example, at the last count, as at two weeks ago, Air Peace has 21 planes out of this country. You don\u2019t want to know the amount we are spending on those planes.\n\n\u201cWe are at the mercy of these MRO owners overseas and you and I know the way they stigmatise us and everything in Nigeria. So you expend a lot of money taking these planes abroad. We need to have our MROs here. The good thing about having MRO is that you are not only going to be maintaining your own fleet, other Nigerians will come there, the whole of Africa will come here. Aviation is the same worldwide.\n\n\u201cOnce you have EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency) approval for your MRO, you have FAA (US Federal Aviation Administration) approval for your MRO, NCAA approval and you have other civil aviation authorities\u2019 approval, the whole world will be coming here. And that will be capital influx, not the ones (forex) flying out of Nigeria. So it will help. Yes, Air Peace is ready, we have acquired the land, we are ready to give this country a maintenance repair and overhaul facility that Africa will be proud of.\u201d\n\nRecently NCAA granted 7Star Global Hangar Ltd, AMO certificate to operate an all-inclusive Maintenance Repair and Overhaul facility.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A former Inspector-General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, has been asked to answer for about N250 million unapproved contracts as well as unremitted revenue at the Nigeria Police Academy, Wudil, Kano State, in 2018 when he was in charge of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nIdris served as the Inspector General between June 2016 and January 2019, and he is being asked to account for financial misappropriations at the police academy.\n\nThis query was contained in the annual report of the Auditor-General of the Federation for 2018, a copy of which was obtained by SaharaReporters.\n\nThe report alleged non-remittance of revenue, awards of unauthorised contracts as well as other financial infractions.\n\nThe audit report says, \u201cIssue one; Non-remittance of Internally Generated Revenue; N46,457,934.92; Audit observed in the financial year 2017 that, out ofN56,740,802.87 being Internally Generated Revenue to the Federal Government, the sum of N46,457,934.92 was not remitted. The funds were received in cash and the Academy was not on the Treasury Single Account (TSA) system at the time. This indicates weaknesses in internal controls operated by the management of Police Academy, Wudil.\n\n\u201cThe Inspector-General of Police is required to remit the sum of N46,457,934.92 being the unremitted Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) to the Treasury Single Account (TSA) maintained in the Central Bank of Nigeria. Sanctions in line with FR3112 (i) and (ii) should apply.\n\n\u201cAlso, unauthorised variation of contracts \u2013 N204,342,446.77; Audit observed that the contract sum of N84,145,095.24 for the construction of a 90m by 90m new parade ground was awarded and paid for in 2012 by the defunct Ministry of Police Affairs. Approval was given by the commandant without recourse to the Ministry. In 2013, the then Commandant modified the expansion of the construction to 120m by 120m square at an additional cost of N70,200,885.56 without any further tendering process, bringing the total cost to N154,345,980.80.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the project was abandoned, the stage of work and the details of payment made before abandonment was not disclosed. A second variation cost for the review of the layer thickness was put at N49,950,125.65 thus bringing the final total contract sum to N204,942,446.22.\n\n\u201cThe Inspector-General of Police is required to account for and justify the payment of the sum of N35,000,000 and to substantiate the genuineness of contract, failing which sanctions in line with FR3106 should apply.\n\n\u201cThe Inspector-General of Police is required to provide evidence (Circular and signed agreement) to support the genuineness of the payment, or otherwise recover the sum of N15, 650,067.85.\u201d",

          "title": "How to avoid investment scams in Nigeria",
          "text": "\u201cDo you want to double your money in 10 days?\u201d\n\nInvestment scams tend to start off the same way.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a social media advert or a video of a celebrity telling you that an \u2018investment platform\u2019 made them millionaires overnight.\n\nThey all echo an alarming promise: \u201cgive us your money and we will give you more returns than you\u2019ve ever seen in the market \u2013 oh and did we mention your money is sure to come back to you?\u201d\n\nThese offers always seem too good to be true. And they usually are.\n\nOver the past few weeks, two different scams have been uncovered in Nigeria. Insha-Allahu Investment is the latest of them.\n\nWith a business name that roughly translates to \u2018If God Wills\u2019, the company\u2019s CEO is currently on the run after promising investors up to 20% Return on Investment (ROI) in two months. Many of the investors put in their life savings and in one case, their inheritance in a bid to multiply their money.\n\nInvestment is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It requires work. The work on your part as the investor is to perform due diligence and ensure your money is going to the right place.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that many more investment scams will continue to spring up. Days after Brisk Capital\u2019s CEO was arrested for fraud, a tweet featuring a popular celebrity made the rounds.\n\nThe power to become a millionaire is in your hands. Start your journey to become a millionaire today by Joining the great @mcivip known as Millionaire Club where you can invest and earn big.\n\n\n\nOfficial website: https://t.co/HMfsRY9aCspic.twitter.com/i0gqGXYzjJ \u2014 Instablog9ja (@instablog9ja) May 28, 2021\n\nIn it, the actor claimed that the company, Millionaires Club Investment, would give you 50% ROI (Return on Investment) in 3 days.\n\n\u201cOkay, but how?\u201d\n\nThis is a question that should follow every claim of returns. If a company tells you they plan to give you 30% of your money back in say, a month as Brisk Capital did, it\u2019s important to ask for details of how exactly they plan on making those returns.\n\nI spoke to Adedayo Bakare, COO of Money Africa and Oluwatomi Solanke, CEO of Trove Finance to get an idea of how to gauge if a deal is too good to be true.\n\nThey both agree that there is a relative benchmark to employ when discussing investments in the country \u2013 it\u2019s called the MPR (Monetary Policy Rate) \u2013 it\u2019s usually around the price of most of the government\u2019s debt instruments \u2013 like bonds and treasury bills.\n\nAs of March 2021, the MPR for Nigeria was 11.5% per year. To find out how much that is monthly, we just need to divide by 12 and we have roughly 0.96% per month.\n\nSo as a rule of thumb, if you have any \u2018investment platform\u2019 offering you significantly more than 0.96% ROI per month then you should proceed with caution. If they\u2019re offering less, then you shouldn\u2019t bother with them at all because you could get more by buying debt instruments directly from the government.\n\nInvestment is, by nature, risky. Legitimate investment platforms are usually keen to inform you of the risks involved when you\u2019re putting your money with them. If a person is promising you 30% monthly and telling you it is low-risk then they are already lying to you and you should not bother doing business with them.\n\nThis is the first step in finding out if an \u2018investment opportunity\u2019 is a scam \u2013 investigate their ROI claims and how they intend to turn them into a reality.\n\nIf a company tells you they are investing in the stock market \u2013 which admittedly can give you high returns \u2013 you must be aware of the risks. The market is volatile and can move up or down very quickly.\n\nIf they say they are investing in real estate then, as an investor, the onus is on you to ask questions about the real estate offerings. Are they selling land? Renting out buildings? How exactly are they able to make that much money from renting or selling land within a short time frame.\n\nIf you find that a company\u2019s explanation for the \u2018how?\u2019 is satisfactory, then you should go on to the next item on our checklist: Regulation.\n\n\u201cAnd you are licensed by\u2026?\u201d\n\nThis is probably one of the most essential checks you must perform before you hand over funds to an investment company.\n\nIt is not enough that a company is \u2018registered\u2019 as a business. Any street-smart hustler can register a business.\n\nAn investment platform you are considering must be either: registered with the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), or be affiliated with a company that is licensed by the SEC or the CBN.\n\nA company claiming to be a financial services company of any kind that has no connection to the SEC or CBN is one to approach with extreme caution.\n\nTo be extra sure, when a company tells you they are licensed with the SEC or gives you their affiliate company (or trustee), you can click here to confirm their eligibility.\n\n\u201cWho did you say you were again?\u201d\n\nContinue your due diligence by looking into the company\u2019s track record.\n\nIt is important to find out what credentials the owners or managers of these companies have. In the case of Dominic Joshua, a quick search would have raised some doubt about the veracity of a 21-year-old investment wunderkind with no real track record.\n\nThis step is especially important when you speak with referees or the company\u2019s brand ambassadors. You shouldn\u2019t put your money into a company just because a friend or family member told you it was great.\n\nYou should also check the company\u2019s track record and find out if fraud allegations have been levelled against its founders, senior leaders, or board members.\n\nPlatforms like ours, Nairaland and even Facebook have been around long enough to have picked up news on all kinds of scams and their perpetrators. It would be good to search for the names of those people and companies and see what comes up.\n\nFinally, making wise and well-informed investment decisions is a great idea but the journey to financial freedom is no walk in the park and requires careful research.\n\nSo the next time you or a loved one are faced with a new \u2018investment opportunity,\u2019 we recommend you share this article with them.\n\n*This is not investment advice\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Two unhealthy decades later\n\nOnly Rwanda, Botswana and Zambia have budgeted over 15% to health in the last two decades. In Nigeria, budget allocation for healthcare was 4.15% and 3.91% in 2017 and 2018 respectively, as data by TechCabal Insights shows.\n\n\n\nWith governments\u2019 poor performance, the burden of funding African healthcare has largely fallen on the shoulders of the private sector, which accounts for nearly 60% of financing. The continent relies on private providers for nearly 50% of its healthcare needs.\n\nEast and Southern Africa remain the regions most affected by HIV in the world. But as other diseases like Ebola and COVID-19 have shown, Africa\u2019s healthcare concerns are systemic, broad and in need of huge capital injection.\n\nAfrica has an estimated $66 billion-a-year health financing gap and in the absence of serious government efforts, donors and the private sector have come through.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the value of PE and VC investments in African healthcare increased from 3% to 16% of total investments in the continent, according to the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (AVCA).\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, 97 private equity and venture capital fund investments worth $1.3bn were made in health care in Africa. Most healthcare deals in that period happened in Nigeria (15%), Morocco (11%), Egypt (10%), South Africa (8%) and Ghana (8%). Boluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nHealth care, as an investment sector, can be narrowed down to a number of segments, according to the GICS classification system: Equipment & Supplies, Providers & Services, Technology, Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals, and Life Sciences Tools & Services.\n\nAnd health technology (healthtech) has received the most attention recently in Africa.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, AVCA estimates that healthtech accounted for 35% of health care investments in Africa. In 2020 alone, healthtech was the bright star too \u2013 gulping 45% of health care investments.\n\nOne of the more eye-catching healthcare companies is mPharma. The Ghana-based startup is now present in 7 other countries and has raised over $40 million. It became a crucial partner in the Ghanaian government\u2019s vaccine distribution strategy this year and is tipped as one of Africa\u2019s next big companies..\n\nOther breakout healthcare startups in Africa include LifeBank, Helium Health and 54Gene in Nigeria, Ilara Health in Kenya, and Healthlane in Cameroon. These startups are filling critical gaps in blood products logistics, genetics data and hospital management technology to improve service delivery. More are coming on board.\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nAs with mPharma, new innovative health startups are relying on VC funding to rise to popular consciousness. To close the $66bn-a-year gap, the PE and VC community will be expected to invest larger checks at a faster rate in more startups. COVID-19, while an unfortunate pandemic, has spurred a welcome boost in visibility for healthcare startups.\n\nBut tough questions will have to be asked of governments as well. Are they doing their bit, at least keeping to what they agreed to 20 years ago? The first quarter of the 21st Century has only four years before it ends.

          "text": "The Buhari administration has stepped up efforts to regulate the online media in Nigeria in what is seen by many as attempts to further stifle the civic space in the country.\n\nTwo weeks after blocking Twitter\u2019s operations, the federal government has asked the House of Representatives to enact a law that will empower the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to control all forms of internet broadcasting and social media.\n\nThe request was made on Wednesday by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, during a public hearing organised by the house committee on information, national orientation, ethics, and values on a bill to amend the NBC Act.\n\nThe commission already controls television and radio broadcasting in Nigeria, based on provisions in Section 2(b) of the NBC Act. It states that \u201cthe Commission shall have [the] responsibility of receiving, processing and considering applications for the establishment, ownership or operation of radio and television stations including cable television services, direct satellite broadcast and any other medium of broadcasting.\u201d\n\nLai Mohammed now wants the commission to also regulate the online media, in addition to other channels of broadcasting. \u201cI want to add here specifically that internet broadcasting and all online media should be included in this because we have a responsibility to monitor contents, including Twitter,\u201d the minister told lawmakers.\n\nBefore Lai Mohammed\u2019s proposal, the broadcasting regulator had asked all social media platforms and service providers in the online broadcasting space in Nigeria to apply for a broadcast licence.\n\nPossible clampdown on freedom of expression\n\nWidespread criticism has trailed the proposal by the Nigerian government, which has only further stoked concerns over a possible clampdown on free speech and internet freedom by the Buhari administration.\n\nMedia stakeholders at the public hearing kicked against the inclusion of online media under NBC\u2019s mandate, asking the panel to instead make the commission more independent of the Minister of Information.\n\nOver time, the NBC has acted as an extension of the Ministry of Information and Culture, which rarely acts independently, and thus, the commission\u2019s operations have often been subject to political interference. This was condemned by the International Press Centre (IPC) and the Centre for Media Law and Advocacy in a joint statement that called for the neutrality of the commission.\n\nAccording to Akin Akingbulu, executive director of the Institute for Media and Society, the commission should not receive directives from the information minister. \u201cThe power to give directives to the commission, vested in the minister of information in section 6 should be removed and replaced with powers which include policy formulation for the broadcasting sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial media bill through the backdoor\u201d\n\nDespite the ban on Twitter, Nigerians continue to use the platform thanks to virtual private networks (VPNs) that help bypass the suspension.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

Notably, the first virtual class of Google for Startups Accelerator Africa was launched last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGFSA Cohort 6. Source: Supplied\n\nGFSA has graduated 67 startups from the past five cohorts \u2014 represented across 17 African countries \u2014 since it launched in 2018.\n\nCharles Murito, Google\u2019s Africa Policy and Government Relations Director, told Techpoint Africa that these startups are in turn accelerating the continent\u2019s economy, having collectively raised over $72 million in capital and provided 2,800 jobs after participating in the programme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Founders Fund (BFF) Africa\n\nSimultaneously, applications will be opened for the $3 million Black Founders Fund for African startups in their early stage. The programme will have 50 African startups, led by Black founders, receive cheques between $50k and $100k.\n\nHowever, it is non-dilutive equity-free funding, which means the startups do not have to give up part of their shares to Google following the financing. In addition, the startups will get $220k in Google ads grants and cloud credits alongside training sessions and access to Google\u2019s network of mentors.\n\nEligibility\n\nTo be eligible for this, interested businesses must be a tech startup headquartered in either Botswana, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, or Zimbabwe; have a founding team of at least one Black founding member, and possess technical skills to use Google\u2019s resources.\n\nHead of Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, Onajite Emerhor, adds that, for inclusiveness, there will be an exemption for startups showing interest in the African market but are not situated within the continent.\n\nQualified startups can apply here as applications close on July 7, 2021.\n\nSME grants and support for 500 female entrepreneurs\n\nMeanwhile, another $3 million has been earmarked as SME grants. This fulfils the company\u2019s promise to open funding initiatives to small businesses that are not online. The $3 million funds will be used to provide mentorship, coaching, and access to key markets for 5,000 female entrepreneurs with low digital skills come from rural areas and currently operate in an informal sector.\n\nThis will also include seed capital in the form of cash grants and Google product support for 500 aspiring female entrepreneurs. Beneficiaries will be chosen from Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and select Francophone countries.\n\nFor two of the programmes, Google will be working with two African partners, with a thriving community of entrepreneurs, to disburse the funds \u2014 Co-Creation Hub (CcHUB) for BFF, while Tony Elumelu Foundation will be in charge of grants for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Google\u2019s 14 years of presence in Africa, it has at different times launched investments initiatives that are far-reaching into the continent, not only South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, and Ghana, where it has physical offices. It has reached more locations through partnerships with tech hubs and startup communities in other locations.\n\nApart from funding, Google has also been actively involved in empowering African talents with digital skills. During his visit to Nigeria in 2017, Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, disclosed plans to train 10 million Africans in digital skills by 2022.\n\nIn January 2020, Google launched the Google Developers Space in Lagos, the first of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 to serve as an incubation ground for innovators. In the meantime, the tech giant has ongoing projects addressing Africa\u2019s Internet access and connectivity challenges.",

          "text": "Today, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nA possible policy on intellectual property in Nigeria\n\nSexual violence and tech\n\nThe latest news on 5G deployment in Nigeria\n\nNigeria\u2019s intellectual property policy\n\nNigeria may get an intellectual property (IP) policy soon. This was revealed by Nosakhare Uwadiae, Managing Partner, Gee Law Firm, at a webinar organised by the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON) in collaboration with the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC).\n\nWhy should we care? Currently, Nigeria loses over $287 million to IP theft annually. This also affects foreign direct investment (FDI), research and development (R&D), innovation, and technology transfer.\n\nEssentially, as a result of Nigeria\u2019s weak lP policy regime, amongst several other factors, the country loses inflows from FDI. Of course, this is apart from the lack of domestic R&D, innovation, and technology transfer because of copyright and patent protection challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery year that Nigeria has failed to address its failing IP policy regime, the country loses much-needed economy-boosting FDI. Citing the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a PwC study says that the strength of a country\u2019s patent protection is positively correlated to FDI inflows.\n\nAnd for a developing country like Nigeria, a 1% increase in the strength of patent protection leads to nearly a 1% increase in domestic R&D. A similar increase in trademark and copyright protection corresponds with a 1.4% and 3.3% increase in domestic R&D, respectively.\n\nNo date yet: While we do not have a date yet, Uwadiae \u2014 one of the draftsmen working on the policy document \u2014 says the ongoing efforts will pay off this time around and will crystallise into a workable policy in the not too distant future.\n\nStill wondering why you should care? Check this out: Why the Nigerian tech ecosystem needs to take intellectual property rights more seriously.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, sexual violence, and tech\n\nIn recent times, sexual violence cases seem to be on the rise. According to the United Nations, COVID-19-induced lockdowns exposed vulnerable people to more risk of sexual violence in 2020.\n\nAn increased spate of reported official and unofficial cases led the Nigerian government to create a national database of sex offenders in 2019. Unfortunately, this was not enough, and an even worse increase during the pandemic led governors in all 36 states to declare a state of emergency on rape.\n\nThey also agreed to set up a sex offender register and sign laws to punish the crime.\n\nFast forward to May 2021, and Lagos State \u2014 one of the few with an active online sex offender register \u2014 disclosed that it had added 206 names to its list of sexual offenders between 2020 and 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOluwanifemi did a deep dive into the issue, highlighting the various ways tech and social media have helped combat sexual violence in Nigeria.\n\nRead: How tech tools create a safe space for sexual violence survivors in Nigeria\n\nMore on 5G deployment in Nigeria\n\nPhoto Credit: <a href=\u201dhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/[email protected]/49713123696/\u201d>Ivan Radic</a> Flickr via <a href=\u201dhttp://compfight.com\u201d>Compfight</a> <a href=\u201dhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\u201d>cc</a>\n\nIt appears 5G deployment in Nigeria is gaining even more traction. Umar Danbatta, Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) CEO, has inaugurated a committee on Spectrum auction for 5G deployment.\n\nThis comes after the Commission signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Nigerian Communications Satellite (NIGCOMSAT) Limited on the use of C-Band Spectrum for 5G services in Nigeria.\n\nThe C-Band Spectrum is a mid-range frequency set at 3.6 GHz-4.2 GHz touted as the most suitable and appropriate frequency for deploying the 5G network services.\n\nRecall that the Nigerian Senate approved deployment plans after an investigation conducted by the Senate Joint Committee on Communications, Science and Technology, ICT, and Cyber Crimes and Primary Healthcare, and Communicable Diseases.\n\nThe Committee\u2019s mandate is to develop the Information Memorandum for the auction of the 3.5 GHz spectrum band, which will be used for the early deployment of 5G services in Nigeria. It will also develop an award process for the grant of these licences.\n\nThe Information Memorandum defines the process that the Commission has decided to adopt for the auctioning of the C-Band Spectrum. It will provide information on the Nigerian telecommunications market, details of the Spectrum, the pre-qualification process, the auction process, and an indicative timetable.\n\nWhile it has taken a while to get to this stage \u2014 2019-2021 \u2014 this is certainly great news for Nigerians despite the controversies which have shrouded 5G deployment in the country.\n\nLast week on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nMicrosoft issues copyright takedown request over leaked Windows 11 build. Read\n\nFacebook will start putting ads in Oculus Quest apps. Read\n\nEarth has been trapping heat at an alarming new rate, study finds. Read\n\nHave a beautiful week!",

          "text": "Once again, investors and the federal capital territory administration (FCTA) Abuja are back to the table following approval for resumption of the ambitious Land Swap Initiative by the federal executive council (FEC) early last week.\n\nThe Abuja Land Swap initiated by the Bala Mohammed administration was valued then at N1 trillion. It is the short form of the \u2018FCT Land Infrastructure Swap Initiative\u2019 designed to address the infrastructure deficit in the FCT.\n\nIn simple terms, the initiative means engaging the private sector to provide infrastructure in exchange for land. The aim, essentially, is to open up new districts in the FCT by constructing and completing access roads to those districts.\n\nApart from freeing government land for economic activities such as real estate and industrial development, the initiative also solves one of the major problems of urban or city development which is the provision of a good network of roads and associated infrastructure.\n\nIt is also an answer to real estate sector development in Nigeria where investors and property developers estimate the cost of infrastructure at 30 percent of total construction cost.\n\nThe implication is that the initiative will not only increase housing stock, but also reduce house price, and ultimately bridge the housing demand-supply gap in the country put variously at 17, 20 and 22 million units, depending on who one is speaking to.\n\nRead Also: FEC okays resumption of FCT land swap\n\nIt is expected that construction activities resulting from infrastructure development and housing delivery will have combined capacity to create, at least, 2,000 direct construction jobs on an ongoing basis. It is expected also that many of the workers, skilled and unskilled, will come from the catchment districts, thereby empowering the people economically.\n\nAs the federal capital city, Abuja, like Lagos, the country\u2019s commercial nerve centre, is experiencing a high influx of people and this is already putting pressure on available facilities in the city. The urbanisation growth rate of Abuja is conservatively put at 30-40 percent per annum.\n\nSimilarly, the population of the FCT currently is estimated at 6 million whereas the Abuja Master Plan envisaged a population of about 2 million people for the Territory. This means that over 60 percent of the residents of the FCT have not been captured and catered for in the Abuja Plan Book.\n\nThis foreshadows a major problem to the FCTA administration but finds a solution in the Land Swap Initiative which now, more than ever before, is most welcome given dwindling oil revenue that leaves so little for the different tiers of governments to share.\n\nThe resumption of the initiative comes with some benefits. There is now a legal framework that protects the interests of all parties, including the investor, the FCT administration and the project (housing) off-takers. Before now, the investor, particularly, was exposed to high risk.\n\n\u201cAfter a review of what has transpired over the years, and changes made, the FEC approved that we now continue with the land swap initiative on the basis of amendments to the procedures as well as new safeguards introduced so that investors, the FCT, as well as off-takers, will be protected, Mohammed Bello, Federal Capital Territory (FCT) minister, explained recently.\n\nIn spite of this, the investors still have quite a lot to do in the deal. They are to provide all the infrastructure within a particular district and then they will be paid for that with land. They are given a certain percentage of the land developable within that district, while the FCT administration will take a certain percent too.\n\nBut the investors are the ones to resolve the issue of compensation and payments and relocation of people as the city grows. They are expected to create a special purpose vehicle. Through this, the size of the investment will be determined and, on the basis of this, the financial institutions will provide financial guarantees to the administration through performance bonds.\n\nBello explained further that the land that is going to be used as swapping for the investment will be held in custody by a designated financial institution, which will serve as the custodian.\n\n\u201cAs milestones are being achieved, the land will be released to the investors which, obviously, they will sell and use the proceeds to pay for their investment. So, this is the whole concept,\u201d he said.\n\nExperts see this as a huge opportunity for real estate developers in particular and investors in general. \u201cFor a real estate developer, this initiative lowers his cost. Apart from freeing him from the bureaucratic challenges that impact negatively on both budget and time of delivery, he will save cost from land,\u201d Kunle Ogunlewe, a property broker, noted.\n\nOgunlewe hopes to see, with the implementation of the initiative, a considerable reduction of the housing deficit in Abuja which, according to him, is already taking after Lagos in terms of the growing population of urban slums where many residents live in shanties in largely unplanned communities.",

          "title": "How Nigeria\u2019s manufacturing sector can enjoy effective AfCFTA participation",
          "text": "The development and strategic positioning of Nigeria\u2019s manufacturing sector is necessary for the country to enjoy the benefits that the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has to offer.\n\nUnfortunately, despite expressing willingness to participate in the trade agreement by signing it in 2019, Nigeria is yet to participate or make transactions on the platform due to series of challenges hurting local producers of goods.\n\nNigeria\u2019s counterparts are however making efforts to effectively utilize the trading platform for economic gains. Although many of them are being propelled by available resources and infrastructure to carry out the provisions of the pact.\n\nToki Mabogunje, President, Lagos Chamber Of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) president while speaking at an international conference on AfCFTA, noted that Nigeria is yet to participate in the trade agreement three months after commencement despite the many months spent preparing in anticipation of the pact.\n\nShe said, as a result, Nigeria is losing out on the gains of cross border trade and this may threaten the speedy economic recovery that the country anticipates.\n\nSimilarly, Similarly, Muda Yusuf, director-general, LCCI, said participation in the trade agreement will be challenging for local manufacturers, due to the different challenges bedevilling the sector, adding that the government is in a better position to help manufacturers by providing an enabling environment to make Nigerian manufacturing sector competitive.\n\nThe Manufacturers CEOs Confidence Index (MCCI) for Q4 2020 compiled by the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) highlighted five major challenges hurting manufacturer\u2019s performance.\n\nSector players also affirm that these challenges have hindered their ability to participate in the trade agreement and therefore called for the government\u2019s prompt response in tackling these issues.\n\nIMPROVED INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nNigeria lacks the necessary infrastructure needed to grow businesses, especially developed transport systems as Roads are decrepit and although rails are coming up, they are not connected to the nation\u2019s seaports.\n\nRead Also: Timeless Advice for Manufacturing Businesses \u2013 A Review of Adebola Adefila\u2019s Profit\n\nNigeria requires $15bn (N5.8tn at N390 to a dollar) worth of investments annually for 15 years in order to adequately develop its infrastructure according to reports from the Financial Derivatives Company, an economic and financial research firm.\n\nHowever, the possibility of fulfilling that is quite slim considering the allocated budget for infrastructure in the country, coupled with the dwindling rate of foreign investment into the country.\n\nIn the quarterly survey mentioned earlier, respondents affirmed that the country\u2019s infrastructure is in a dilapidated state and has not been able to spur the desired economic growth through enhanced real sector productivity.\n\nAccording to them, this is caused by the low budgetary allocation for the provision of infrastructure and the absence of a monitoring and evaluation mechanism to interrogate the implementation of the budget and relevant Executive Orders.\n\nMAN advises that budgetary allocations for infrastructure be prioritized and properly monitored for implementation.\n\nACCESS TO PORTS\n\nIn Nigeria, access roads to premier seaports in Apapa and Tin Can, Lagos, is plagued by gridlocks, hurting export and import, in addition to lack of functional scanners by the Nigeria Customs Service, which causes untold delays of raw materials to factories and exports to destination countries.\n\n\u201cManufacturing companies situated on the Amuwo-Odofin and Kirikiri axes lose over N20 billion annually, and most of the factories are on the brink of shutting down because the roads are inaccessible, \u201d said Frank Onyebu, chairman of Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) Apapa branch told BusinessDay.\n\nAlso between 2019 and 2020, the cost of moving goods in a 40-foot container from Apapa to other areas within Lagos rose from N350,000 to N1.5 million to N2 million making manufacturers incur more cost. Also, almost 5,000 trucks seek access to Apapa and Tin Can ports in Lagos daily, however, the two ports can only accommodate 1,500 trucks\n\nMAN recommends that the federal government upscale trade facilitation infrastructure at the ports and encourage the use of other ports outside Lagos.\n\nAnd in addition, states that necessary equipment are installed at the ports in order to hasten clearing procedures,\n\nIMPROVE POWER SUPPLY\n\nHowever, over the years, issues around energy and electricity availability in Nigeria has been on the rise especially among local manufacturers as they are forced to either pay heavy tariffs for electricity or generate power for themselves.\n\nMAN noted that inadequate electricity supply and incessant increases in tariff without a commensurate improvement in the generation, transmission, and distribution remain key challenges of the sector.\n\nIn 2020, manufacturers spent N81.91 billion on providing alternative energy, representing a 33 percent increase when compared to the N61.38 billion expended in 2019.\n\nAlso, Nigeria ranked 169 in the getting electricity metric, scoring 47.4 points on the World Bank\u2019s ease of doing business 2020 report and a zero in the reliability of power supply.\n\nExperts say that the high energy cost of these companies hinders the production capacity of these firms, thereby limiting local, regional and global competitiveness.\n\nMAN advises that it is necessary to reverse the current increment in electricity tariff and focus more on improving generation, distribution and efficient use of available electricity.\n\nCREDIT AVAILABILITY\n\nAnother critical issue bedevilling the industrial sector is funding. Nigeria is cash-strapped due to low oil prices. This is hurting the country\u2019s capacity to fund projects and critical sectors. However, the pool of funds from the CBN and development finance institutions is stashed in banks which are sometimes unwilling to lend to businesses due to what they call the \u2018high-risk level\u2019 of lending to businesses in Nigeria. Consequently, several manufacturers have complained that they are unable to access most funds advertised by the government.\n\nPresently Nigeria has one of the highest lending rates in Sub Saharan Africa as the financial regulator pegged its Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at a double-digit of 11.50 percent leaving deposit money banks to lend as high as 25 to 35 percent interest loans.\n\nOther countries like Kenya and Ethiopia have an MPR of 7 percent, Rwanda has 4.5 percent, South Africa and Cameroon have 3.5 percent interest rate while Namibia has 3.75 percent.\n\nMAN advises that the sector needs funding, especially long-term, single-digit funds, to compete, and therefore recommends that the CBN rolls out modalities for a specialized single-digit interest loan especially for businesses involved in production activities.\n\nMAN also asked the CBN to review the guidelines of the various development funds to ensure that the terms and conditions are liberal enough to attract borrowing from the industrial sector.\n\nREDUCED OVERREGULATION OF AGENCIES\n\nOverregulation is another major issue affecting the sector\u2019s performance. In Nigeria, there are over 25 regulatory agencies that supervise business activities some of which have synonymous duties under different bodies. While each agency tries to carry out its responsibilities, their activities clash and create confusion and problems for manufacturers particularly when it has to do with levies or documentation.\n\nIn the CEO survey mentioned earlier, 92 percent of the respondents agreed that over-regulation by agencies of government restricts activities and hurt productivity in the manufacturing sector.\n\n\u201cOften times agencies of the Federal, State and Local Authorities regulate the same manufacturing process resulting in operating losses, supervisory duplication using similar checklists and multiple regulatory charges which often culminates in increased overheads for manufacturers,\u201c the report stated.\n\nMAN recommends that the government at all levels make efforts to harmonize regulatory operations, checklists and mandates in a manner that these agencies can promote a friendlier operating environment and enhance sustainable economic growth in the country.",

          "text": "Following the abduction of students and staff from the Federal Government College in Birnin Yauri by bandits, seven schools in Kebbi have been closed indefinitely.\n\nAccording to Isah Arzika, Chairman of the Nigeria Union of Teachers, the schools that have been closed indefinitely are in locations prone to bandit assaults.\n\nMr Arzika stated that the government had instructed all school administrators to close any school that they considered was unsafe, and that police were on the lookout.\n\n\u201cOn these proactive measures, as you all know, we are part of the system. Because principals are teachers, all the directors at the board are also teachers. It is the decision that we all took that is affecting us.\n\n\u201cGovernment has given us an order and option to take any necessary action as far as our schools are concerned. That we can close those schools which we think are not safe and prone to attacks in the areas close to the forest,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe NUT leader promised that the front-line schools had already been closed, describing the measure as proactive in order to prevent another mass kidnapping of kids and teachers.\n\n\u201cI am not talking about only boarding schools, any school that is on the front line, and it is not safe. We would just ask the students to pack and go home, pending the time the situation normalises.\n\n\u201cBefore now, the state government had recruited a large number of vigilance members to look over our schools, and we are very much satisfied with what the government has done.\n\n\u201cSome of these schools that I am talking about have policemen attached to them. Honestly, we are satisfied with government actions,\u201d he disclosed.\n\n\u201cSince the security agencies sprung into action on the bandits, we have not made fresh touch with the parents and relatives of the children and teachers still in captivity,\u201d the NUT chairman stated of the FGC Yauri abduction.\n\n\u201cWhen we made our first contact two days ago, precisely on Thursday, they did not demand any ransom. Instead, they told the parents and relatives that they only wanted to establish contact with them and inform them that their children are with them.\n\n\u201cAs I am talking to you, two of our teachers have regained their freedom. Already, seven schools on the front line in that area have been closed, and more will be closed if we realise the situation is not safe for the teachers and students.\u201d",

This year, however, we\u2019re talking about 1.3 million to 1.4 million people. We know that things like the addition of the NIN to the registration procedure had a negative impact.\n\n\u201cFrom the information on ground, the NIN did not make lots of candidates register and you know before now we have been having cases of multiple registrations and that was why we brought in the NIN.\u201d\n\nThe registration period for 2021 began on April 10, 2021, and ended on May 29, 2021, though the board had stated that a few candidates with \u201cexceptional conditions\u201d would be granted an extension.\n\nIn 2021, a total of 1,338,687 applicants applied for the UTME, with 75,328 applying for the Direct Entry exam.\n\nThe estimates are based on a total of over two million candidates who have registered for the 2020 election.",

          "text": "General Superintendent, Deeper Christian Life Ministry, Pastor William Kumuyi has lifted punishment meted out to some youths of the church who obstructed a Sunday worship service to celebrate his 80th birthday.\n\nKumuyi turned 80 years on Sunday, June 6, 2021.\n\nAt the worship service that day which was attended by Governors Babajide Sanwo-Olu and Emmanuel Udom, some youths of the church strategically positioned at the first gallery of church building suddenly emerged from the blues and started blowing the trumpets and sang happy birthday to their pastor.\n\nService was temporary obstructed as they were overjoyed, singing and blowing the trumpets and other musical instruments. This was the first time such a thing has occurred in the history of Deeper Life, a conservative holiness church.\n\nThe action of the youths elicited mixed feelings in the church. While some were happy, others felt the youths have compromised the standard of the church.\n\nBut on Saturday, shortly before delivering his message at the workers\u2019 meeting, Kumuyi doused the tension and said those who had been punished by their action during the service should be restored back to the working team.\n\nKumuyi thanked the youths for honouring him with their musical instruments.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the 6th of June some young people did something they were excited about and some of us old people, we maybe rebuked them directly or indirectly. I even heard that one of those who played instruments singing \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019..understand these are young people and sometimes young people need to express their joy and their excitement in the way we adults might not have thought, we should express our own joy\u2026but we were all happy, were you not happy?\n\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t express it, you did yours in a quiet, matured, decent, weighty manner which is good\u2026but those young people acted like they are young people and I want to register my appreciation publicly to all of them. Those who sang, those who played instruments and those who excitedly dramatized whatever, I appreciate them, God appreciates them and we praise the Lord for them.\n\n\u201cAnd if it so happens that you know any of them or you are an authority, spiritual authority on any of them and any of them was removed from doing what they were doing in the Church, please for love sake and for unity sake, restore all of them and young people, we love you, we appreciate you, we are looking forward to you doing more for the glory of God and joining us in evangelism and bringing your own method, your own ideas and some of our own ideas as older people that are not working, if you come forward and you give us good ideas, we will replace our old ideas which are not working with your new ideas.\n\n\u201cPraise the Lord! Church are you alright? Let\u2019s encourage our children. Our children will go farther than we have done in Jesus name. Amen.\u201d",

These activities are geared towards a total clamp down on bandits\u2019 activities in the area.\n\n\u201cOn 19th June, 2021 five bandits were arrested and detained at Kastina-Ala Police Division for investigation and prosecution.\n\n\u201cOn 20th June, 2021 at about 0130hrs more than fifty other gang members of the detainees mobilised and invaded the police station to rescue their counterparts.\n\n\u201cOfficers at the division who were already at alert engaged them in a gun duel and were able to subdue the bandits.\n\n\u201cFourteen (14) of them were brought down during the exchange of fire while several others escaped with gunshot injuries. Operatives in the area are currently on the trail of suspects at large.\n\n\u201cThe good people of Kastina-Ala town are advised to remain calm and avail every useful information about the bandits to the police.\u201d\n\n15 bandits killed in Niger\n\nIn a related development, about 15 armed bandits were killed in a gun duel with troops Saturday in Anguwan Mallam, Kontagora, Niger state.\n\nBlueprint gathered that the exchange of fire occurred at about 4.00pm when the troops on patrol sighted the criminals at the location.\n\nA local source told Blueprint that the arrival of the troops was what saved the 70-member gang from dealing a deadly attack on the residents.\n\nWith the gallant soldiers exhibiting superior firepower, the bandits reportedly fled into the bush.\n\nHowever, the police authority was yet to comment on the development as at the time of this report.\n\nNAF shells terrorists\n\nAlso in yet another victory over the criminal elements, the fighter aircraft of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Sunday eliminated scores of ISWAP-Boko Haram terrorists, including their commanders in Lamboa in Kaga local government area of Borno state.\n\nPRNigeria gathered that the multiple airstrikes conducted by a mix of aircraft including Alpha-Jets, L-39 and MI-35 helicopters, might have also killed the notorious ISWAP Logistic Commander, Modu Sullum.\n\nSullum was allegedly responsible for the destruction of power transmission towers at Malanari along Maiduguri-Damaturu Highway and attacks on travellers in Auno and Jakana axis.\n\nThe insurgents, in a convoy of eight gun trucks had invaded Lamboa, preparatory to launching a gruesome attack in Mainok axis in the state.\n\nBut the terrorists were swiftly engaged by ground and air troops, who foiled their missions after the NAF reconnaissance platform had earlier hovered over the location before the airstrikes.\n\nIt was gathered that over a dozen ISWAP-Boko Haram fighters were killed by bombardments of the military fighter aircraft.\n\nWhen contacted, air force spokesperson, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet confirmed the success of the military airstrikes.\n\nHe told PRNigeria that \u201cYes, it was a very successful operation. Of the eight terrorist gun trucks sighted by our surveillance team, the aircraft successfully took out six of the trucks, including an unconfirmed number of terrorists that were eliminated.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the ground troops of the Nigerian Army and our air elements are mopping up the area and assessing the situation.\n\n\u201cAs we have said before, there is no hiding place for these terrorists especially with the renewed vigour, synergy and jointness being exhibited by all members of the Armed forces in the North-East theatre of Operation.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, PRNigeria gathered that other military offensives were simultaneously taken place in other axes including Magumeri with the resumption of office of the New Theatre Commander Operation Hadi Kai, Major-General Chris Musa.",

          "text": "As preparation for the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress , APC, gears up, a chieftain of the party has revealed that a dark horse might emerge as the National Chairman of the party.\n\nThe chieftain who craved anonymity said that the dark horse is a serving Senator from Niger State.\n\nAccording to him, two aspirants have indicated interest from Niger State, a former Minister and Serving Senator but the lot favors the serving Senator.\n\nHe said, \u201cyou should also know that there are two other former Governors from the North Central who have indicated interest for the position. One is from Benue state and the other is from Nasarawa State\n\n\u201cBut as l speak to you now the governors are taking their mind off them.\n\n\u201cThe reason is hinged on the fact that the experience they had with the former governor who was the National Chairman the party.\u201d\n\nThe chieftain posited also that the Senators are making case for the serving Senator from Niger State on the grounds that since the inception of APC all the National Chairmen had been former Governors.\n\nFurther, he said,\u201d From all indications and the narratives going round strategic blocks in the party shows that the support base of two frontline aspirants in the person of a vocal serving senator and a former minister both from the North Central zone are most likely going to dominate the permutations for the race of who becomes the new national chairman of the party in the next national convention which is coming up in few months.\n\n\u201cThere are indications that the serving senator is said to be popular amongst young political class as he is versatile in managing the diversity and strength of both the old and new generation of politicians, he is outspoken against a society that groom bad and inept leadership, which pundits believe it can results in establishing bad governance. His silent mentioned has today created a challenge for older politicians and will be making it look tough in the coming days for the older hands on how to deal with the dynamics of the permutations.\n\n\u201cFor the former minister who was also a one time member of the lower green chamber, the political environment may proof too difficult as pundits believed he will be used, and the fear is that It makes the party future uncertain. He is a good schemer in the game of party politics and within the macro environment, but when it comes to rallying round the party leadership blocks and populace he will face a herculean task to manage.\u201d\n\nAccording to the chieftain, the old hands that have indicated their ambitions to contest if given the opportunity may throw the party into turmoil, those that have openly declared interest are former governors of Borno State, Ali Modu Sheriff, Nasarawa, Umaru Tanko Almakura, Zamfara, Abdulazeez Yari and a few others. They are all seeing to carry one baggage or the other that may affect the fortunes of the party come 2023. Majority of the APC faithfuls are of the opinion that new breed of leadership is desirable for the party, they are ferocious of the old class emerging this time again as they believe it will be business as usual and they are of the opinion that they don\u2019t know what the problem is and they don\u2019t know how it can be solved.\n\nHowever, the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee has not concluded the date for the National Convention as the proposed time table for the congresses is before the President, Muhammadu Buhari awaiting approval.",

          "text": "Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan\u2019s party won 53.9 percent of the vote in snap parliamentary polls called in an effort to defuse a political crisis after a war with Azerbaijan, official results showed Monday.\n\nAn alliance led by his rival, ex-leader Robert Kocharyan, came second with 21 percent, according to the results based on ballots from 100 percent of precincts counted.\n\nA winning party or bloc needs to obtain at least 50 percent of seats plus one and can be assigned additional seats in order to form a government.\n\nPashinyan hours earlier claimed victory based on early results, but Kocharyan\u2019s grouping swiftly contested the vote and alleged election fraud.\n\nA record four electoral blocs and 21 parties ran for election on Sunday.\n\nThe vote was seen as a two-horse race, with both Pashinyan, 46, and Kocharyan, 66, drawing massive crowds in the run-up to the polls.\n\n\u201cThe people of Armenia gave our Civil Contract party a mandate to lead the country and personally me to lead the country as prime minister,\u201d Pashinyan announced in the small hours of Monday.\n\n\u201cWe already know that we won a convincing victory in the elections and we will have a convincing majority in parliament,\u201d he added, urging supporters to turn up at Yerevan\u2019s main square Monday evening.\n\nKocharyan\u2019s electoral bloc said it would not recognise Pashinyan\u2019s quick claim to victory, which came when around 30 percent of precincts had been counted.\n\n\u201cHundreds of signals from polling stations testifying to organised and planned falsifications serve as a serious reason for lack of trust,\u201d the bloc said in a statement, adding it would not \u201crecognise\u201d the results until the \u201cviolations\u201d were studied.\n\nOn Sunday evening, the general prosecutor\u2019s office said it had received 319 reports of violations. It said it had opened six criminal probes, all of which concerned bribes during campaigning.\n\nConflicting opinions\n\nThe vote was followed by Armenia\u2019s Soviet-era master Russia, arch-foe Azerbaijan and Turkey, which backed Azerbaijan in the six-week war over the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh last year.\n\nDespite stifling heat, nearly 50 percent of around 2.6 million eligible voters cast their ballots, election officials said. Some observers said turnout in the South Caucasus country of three million people was higher than expected.\n\nDuring a campaign marred by polarising rhetoric, Pashinyan had said he expected his party to secure 60 percent of the vote. Some pollsters had called that estimate far-fetched.\n\nElection officials said the vote was conducted in accordance with Armenia\u2019s legislation.\n\nKocharyan was himself accused of rigging a presidential election in favour of his hand-picked ally and presiding over a deadly crackdown on protesters in 2008.\n\nArmenia won international praise for holding its first free and fair vote under Pashinyan in 2018.\n\nOn the streets of Yerevan on Sunday, Armenians voiced conflicting opinions about Pashinyan.\n\nVoter Anahit Sargsyan said the prime minister, who spearheaded peaceful protests against corrupt elites in 2018, deserved another chance.\n\nShe said she feared the return of the old guard whom she accused of plundering the country.\n\n\u201cI voted against a return to the old ways,\u201d said the 63-year-old former teacher.\n\n\u2018Secure borders\u2019\n\nAnother voter, Vardan Hovhannisyan, said he had cast his ballot for Kocharyan, who calls Russian leader Vladimir Putin his friend.\n\n\u201cI voted for secure borders, solidarity in society, the return of our war prisoners, the well-being of the wounded and a strong army,\u201d said the 41-year-old musician.\n\nCritics blame Pashinyan for having ceded territory in and around Karabakh to Azerbaijan in a humiliating truce agreement, and accuse him of having failed to deliver reforms.\n\nPashinyan has said he had to agree to the Moscow-brokered peace deal with Azerbaijan in order to prevent further human and territorial losses.\n\nMore than 6,500 people were killed in the war, according to the latest official figures from Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n\nBesides Kocharyan, who hails from Karabakh and was in power between 1998 and 2008, two other leaders of post-Soviet Armenia backed parties in the race.\n\nDuring a venomous campaign, candidates exchanged insults and threats. Pashinyan brandished a hammer at rallies, while Kocharyan said he would be ready to fight the prime minister in a duel.",

          "text": "The Tokyo Olympics will allow some local fans to attend when the games open in just over a month, organizing committee officials and the IOC said on Monday.\n\nOrganizers set a limit of 50% of capacity up to a maximum of 10,000 fans for all Olympic venues.\n\nThe decision was announced after so-called Five Party talks online with local organizers, the International Olympic Committee, the International Paralympic Committee, the Japanese government and the government of metropolitan Tokyo.\n\nThe decision contradicts the country\u2019s top medical adviser, Dr. Shigeru Omi, who recommended last week that the safest way to hold the Olympics would be without fans. He had previously called it \u201cabnormal\u201d to hold the Olympics during the pandemic.\n\nThe Tokyo Games are set to open on July 23.\n\nFans from abroad were banned several months ago. Officials say local fans will be under strict rules. They will not be allowed to cheer, must wear masks, and are being told to go straight home afterward.\n\nOrganizers say between 3.6-3.7 million tickets are in the hands of Japanese residents.\n\nHaving fans in the venues presents a risk of spreading the COVID-19 infections, and not just at the venues, since it causes more circulation on commuter trains, in restaurants and other public spaces.\n\nTokyo and other areas are under \u201cquasi-emergency\u201d status until July 11. This replaced a tougher full state of emergency that was in effect until last weekend. The new rules will allow restaurants to serve alcohol during limited hours.\n\nPrime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who has favored allowing fans, said before the official announcement that he would bar fans if conditions change.\n\n\u201cIf a state of emergency is necessary, I will be flexible and open to no fans in order to achieve that the games give top priority to safety and security for the people,\u201d Suga said. \u201dIn case of a state of emergency, it is quite possible \u2026 for safe and secure (games) I will not hesitate to have no fans.\u201d\n\nHe said he took \u201cseriously\u201d Omi\u2019s recommendations but did not follow them.\n\nTokyo Governor Yuriko Koike also said before the the talks that fans may need to be banned if conditions changes.\n\n\u201cUnder this COVID-19 pandemic, people in Tokyo, people in Japan, are feeling very uneasy. We have concerns and the experts are also making recommendations about the risk of spreading the infection,\u201d Koike said. \u201cIf there should be a major change in the sanitary situation, or infection situation, we need to revisit this matter among ourselves and we may need to consider the option of having no spectators in the venues.\u201d\n\nIn recent polls, support seems to be increasing for holding the Olympics, though opposition is strong, depending how the question is worded. An Asahi newspaper poll of June 19-20 of almost 1,500 people showed 62% supported another postponement or cancellation of the games. But about one-third supported holding the Olympics, up from 14% in May in the same poll.\n\nIn the same survey, 83% said they \u201cfeel uneasy\u201d that the Olympics might spread the virus. The poll said 53% wanted no fans and 42% said attendance should be limited.\n\nThe seven-day average for new infections in Tokyo is about 400 daily. The curve has flattened but health officials fear the Olympics and new variants will drive it up.\n\nAbout 6.5% of Japanese are fully vaccinated, and 16.5% have had at least one shot, according to figures from the prime minister\u2019s office. More than 14,000 deaths in Japan have been attributed to COVID-19.",

          "title": "Nigeria: Government, Operators Move to End $2bn Aircraft Maintenance Capital Flight",
          "text": "As part of efforts to end the huge capital flight spent on maintenance of aircraft overseas put at $2 billion annually, some operators in the aviation industry and the Akwa Ibom State government have taken steps towards developing maintenance facilities in Nigeria.\n\nIn the last four years, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has given Aircraft Maintenance Organisation (AMO) certificates to Aero Contractors, 7-Star Global Hangers Limited, and Overland Airways for the maintenance of ATR aircraft in addition to the certification given to Execujet, a global maintenance organisation for executive jets.\n\nAlso, by early next year, the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility being built in Uyo by Akwa Ibom State government will come on stream, while the Chairman and CEO of Air Peace, Mr. Allen Onyema, has announced that the airline has completed plans to set up an MRO facility in Nigeria for the maintenance of its fleet and others.\n\nOwing to these, industry experts said the move would end the huge resources spent overseas in the maintenance of aircraft, which is the highest operations cost to airlines after aviation fuel by Nigerian carriers and others.\n\nThe maintenance facilities would, in turn, be a source of forex earner for the country as airlines and aircraft owners in Africa and beyond could maintain their equipment in Nigeria.\n\nThe Head of Engineering and Maintenance of Ibom Air, Mr. Lookman Animaseun, told THISDAY in a telephone interview on Sunday that it was good that the NCAA was licensing MRO organisations in Nigeria to save the country about $2 billion spent on aircraft maintenance overseas every year.\n\nAnimaseun said besides the Nigerian market, airline operators in West and Central Africa would also bring their aircraft to be maintained in Nigeria, which would attract forex to the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is good that NCAA is licensing MROs. This is good for Nigeria. We also expect the MRO organisations to reciprocate and properly equip their facilities. I do not have any doubt that we can accomplish that.\n\n\u201cThere is huge market for the facilities in West, Central and other parts of the continent and beyond. It makes me happy that the owners of these maintenance facilities have a good purpose. It is people we know their background and we have interacted with.\n\n\u201cThese facilities will be saving Nigeria $2 billion annually if properly harnessed. We shall have more of the facilities by the time Akwa Ibom completes its own early next year.\n\n\u201cWhat makes me happy is that there is a huge market for these maintenance facilities. Aero Contractors, which has maintenance facility, cannot cope with the demand anymore. It should look for a place to expand its hangar. The company needs to up its game to match to what the industry is looking up to now.\u201d\n\nIndustry expert, Captain Ado Sanusi, told THISDAY that the MRO business is a good one. \u201cBut before investors go into it, they should do their commercial evaluation, looking at the manpower, the clientele and the skills so that their operations would be profitable,\u201d he advised.\n\nOn the market for the MRO facilities in Nigeria, the Managing Director of Aero Contractors, Captain Mahmood Abdullahi, said Aero Contractors had been having third party aircraft (from other airlines) for maintenance and they were not coming from Nigeria alone.\n\n\u201cYou can see a lot of third party aircraft are here in the hangar. It is not only Nigerian airlines. There is the Democratic Republic of Congo, they have their Boeing 737 here and we have already signed with the Ghana Civil Aviation and they have given us the approval to maintain aircraft registered in Ghana.\n\n\u201cAnd so, we have an agreement with Passion Air in Ghana. So is Tunisia, they are working on it to get their approval and then Malta also, we are working on it to get their approval. Yes, we are working on all those approvals; once we have those approvals we will maintain aircraft registered in those countries in our facility here,\u201d Mahmood said.\n\nHe also spoke about the cost of taking aircraft overseas for maintenance, saying: \u201cI think there are so many disadvantages to taking your aircraft out of the country for maintenance. If you talk about how much it is going to cost an airline to fly its aircraft from Nigeria, to probably Europe, or wherever it is going to, if you talk about the fuel that they would burn to go, navigational charges paid, the aircraft goes there, and then fly it back again.\n\n\u201cAll these costs are saved by having an MRO here. We have saved the airlines such huge costs. Then, if you come to the maintenance aspect, you are talking about the labour. If they go there, they pay for man-hour in dollars, but here we charge them the man-hour in naira. So it is easy for them if they cannot access the forex, at least we are giving them an opportunity to pay naira here.\u201d\n\nOnyema decried the huge costs the airline incurs maintaining its aircraft overseas, saying that the company has completed plans to establish a maintenance hangar in Nigeria.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThe establishment of a veritable MRO is long overdue. You don\u2019t want to know the amount of capital flight, monies that could have been used for other things in our nation is going abroad. Let me give you an example, at the last count, as at two weeks ago, Air Peace has 21 planes out of this country. You don\u2019t want to know the amount we are spending on those planes.\n\n\u201cWe are at the mercy of these MRO owners overseas and you and I know the way they stigmatise us and everything in Nigeria. So you expend a lot of money taking these planes abroad. We need to have our MROs here. The good thing about having MRO is that you are not only going to be maintaining your own fleet, other Nigerians will come there, the whole of Africa will come here. Aviation is the same worldwide.\n\n\u201cOnce you have EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency) approval for your MRO, you have FAA (US Federal Aviation Administration) approval for your MRO, NCAA approval and you have other civil aviation authorities\u2019 approval, the whole world will be coming here. And that will be capital influx, not the ones (forex) flying out of Nigeria. So it will help. Yes, Air Peace is ready, we have acquired the land, we are ready to give this country a maintenance repair and overhaul facility that Africa will be proud of.\u201d\n\nRecently NCAA granted 7Star Global Hangar Ltd, AMO certificate to operate an all-inclusive Maintenance Repair and Overhaul facility.",

          "text": "As the one-week ultimatum issued by the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) to the federal government to inaugurate the board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) expired weekend, some elders in the region under the auspices of Rural Chiefs and Development Initiative have called on President Muhammadu Buhari to dissolve the interim management committee of the NDDC and inaugurate the president\u2019s nominees cleared and confirmed by the Senate in 2019.\n\nThe Leader of the Forum, Chief Edwin Clark, gave the ultimatum to the federal government a week ago, while addressing journalists in Abuja.\n\nThe Ijaw leader had noted that his desire was to see the best man appointed for the job, saying there was no need for the perceived power tussle.\n\n\u201cThe two persons involved are from my state and are my children, but all I am interested in is for a board to be inaugurated for the commission. And this should be done within the next one week,\u201d he stated.\n\nClark added that the inauguration of a new board for the commission was critical to enable it to realise its mandate of impacting positively on the lives of the people of the region.\n\nIn a letter to the president, the Niger-Delta chiefs described the Interim Management team set up by the Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio, as illegal and unacceptable, saying it negates the Act that establishes the commission.\n\nThe letter jointly signed by the Chairman of the group, Chief Nengi Eriwori, and Legal Adviser, Mr. Ebinyu Aderigba, made available to THISDAY, said the tenure of the previous interim management board had expired, noting that they were not unaware of the power of the president under the 1999 constitution as altered to delegate his powers to any ministry to carry out any function as contained in Section 170 of the constitution.\n\nThey argued that the Act establishing the NDDC does not contemplate interim management to take over the management of the commission.\n\nThe elders also argued: \u201cSince the tenure of the last board elapsed by effluxion of time, it is expedient upon President Buhari to swear in a board in pursuant to the provision of the clear, sacrosanct and unambiguous of the NDDC Act.\n\n\u201cWe make bold to say that the interim caretaker committee set up by the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs is not a legal entity as same is not recognized by law. Therefore, there is no confusion in the NDDC that will warrant the setting up of an interim management committee.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, demand the immediate dissolution of the interim caretaker committee in the interest of peace and development of the Niger Delta Area, which we stand for as your Excellency may have been ill-advised by some self-seeking persons contrary to the spirit and the intendment of the Act setting up the Niger Delta Development Commission,\u201d the Niger Delta\u2019s leaders added.\n\nSimilarly, a group under the auspices of South-South Youth Initiative has also accused Akpabio of a plot to wilfully bypass the established protocol and extant rules as directed by President Buhari to inaugurate a substantive board of the commission for alleged pecuniary reasons.\n\nIn a petition dated June 10, 2021, to the Director-General, Department of State Security Service (DSS), made available to THISDAY, the group alleged that it was aware that Senator Akpabio has \u2018\u2019cooked up a new list of nominees\u2019\u2019 other than the ones already screened and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThe group recounted how President Buhari had in August 2019 approved the inauguration of the board of NDDC that was \u201cvetted by the mandatory security agencies screened and confirmed by the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nThe group, however, warned that \u201cany attempt by the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs to replace the already screened and confirmed list will be against the spirit of understanding and agreement reached on June 3, 2021, with the youths from the region.\u201d\n\nTo this end, it called on the Director-General of the DSS to use his good office to intervene so as to avoid unrest in the region.\n\nThe confirmed nominees for NDDC are former Deputy Governor of Edo State, Dr. Pius Odubu, Chairman; Bernard Okumagba (Delta), Managing Director; Otobong Ndem (Akwa Ibom), Executive Director of Projects; Maxwell Oko (Bayelsa), Executive Director of Finance and Administration; Jones Erue (Delta); Victor Ekhator (Edo); Nwogu N. Nwogu (Abia) and Theodore Allison (Bayelsa).\n\nOthers are Victor Antai (Akwa Ibom); Maurice Effiwat (Cross River); Olugbenga Edema (Ondo); Uchegbu Kyrian (Imo); Aisha Muhammed (North West); Shuaibu Zubairu (North East) and Abdullahi Bage (North Central).\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren and Emameh Gabriel in Abuja",

          "text": "Hong Kong pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily will be forced to shut \u201cin a matter of days\u201d after authorities used the national security law imposed by China to freeze the company\u2019s assets as it arrested the paper\u2019s editor and four other directors, an adviser to jailed tycoon Jimmy Lai told Reuters on Monday.\n\nMark Simon, speaking by phone from the United States, said the company could no longer access its funds and would be holding a board meeting on Monday to discuss how to move forward.\n\n\u201cWe thought we\u2019d be able to make it to the end of the month,\u201d Simon told the news agency. \u201cIt\u2019s just getting harder and harder. It\u2019s essentially a matter of days.\u201d\n\nHis comments signalled that closure was imminent, even after Apple Daily said on Sunday the freezing of its assets had left the newspaper with enough cash for \u201ca few weeks\u201d of normal operations.\n\nThe news comes two days after editor Ryan Law, 47, and Chief Executive Cheung Kim-hung, 59, were denied bail after being charged under the security law with \u201ccollusion\u201d with foreign forces in relation to a number of articles, marking the first time the authorities have used the security law over content published by Hong Kong media.\n\nApple Daily\u2019s editor-in-chief, Ryan Law, arrives back at the detention centre after he was remanded in custody on Saturday [Lam Yik/Reuters]\n\nThree other senior executives were also arrested last Thursday when 500 police officers raided the newspaper\u2019s offices in a case that has drawn condemnation from Western nations, human rights groups and the chief United Nations spokesperson for human rights.\n\nThe three have been released on bail.\n\n\u201cCertainly these are dark days for the journalistic community in Hong Kong,\u201d Al Jazeera\u2019s Adrian Brown said from outside the Apple Daily. \u201cI think what we are going to see more of is increasing self-censorship and big Western media organisations who have their headquarters here in Hong Kong are beginning to make contingency plans.\u201d\n\nSimon, who is also wanted under the security law and left the city last year, told Reuters it had become impossible to conduct banking operations.\n\n\u201cVendors tried to put money into our accounts and were rejected. We can\u2019t bank. Some vendors tried to do that as a favour. We just wanted to find out and it was rejected,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking to the US news channel CNN, Simon said the company had about $50 million available, but was unable to access the funds.\n\n\u201cOur problem is the Secretary of Security and the police will not let us pay our reporters, they will not let us pay our staff, and they will not let us pay our vendors. They have locked up our accounts.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Apple Daily reported that it was planning to ask the security minister to unfreeze some of the money to enable it to pay its 700 employees.\n\nIf the application is unsuccessful, they will go to court, the paper added.\n\nThe publisher has come under increasing pressure since its owner Jimmy Lai was arrested under the national security law last August, which marked the first time the company\u2019s headquarters was raided. Lai, 73, is now jailed and facing trial under the national security law. In May, the authorities also froze some assets belonging to the longtime critic of Beijing.\n\nThree companies related to Apple Daily are also being prosecuted for \u201ccollusion\u201d with foreign powers and authorities have frozen 18 million Hong Kong dollars ($2.3 million) of their assets.\n\nChina imposed the national security law on Hong Kong last June saying it was necessary to restore \u201cstability\u201d to a territory that had been rocked by mass protests in 2019, some of which turned violent.\n\nThe broadly worded law criminalises acts such as subversion, sedition, collusion with foreign forces and secession with possible life imprisonment, but critics have said it is being used to suppress legitimate political debate with dozens of pro-democracy politicians and activists among the more than 100 arrested since it was brought into force.\n\nThe law also allows authorities to freeze assets of any individual or company in the territory that has been deemed a security threat.\n\n\u201cThese are all orders from basically the Secretary of Security, we are facing a security agency we are not facing courts,\u201d Simon told CNN.",
