          "text": "\u2026 Retains Ministerial post\n\nBy Victoria Ojeme and Fortune Eromosele, Abuja\n\nThe Minister of Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen, has withdrawn from the Senatorial race, after much deliberation from critical stakeholders.\n\nShe made the announcement in a statement in Abuja on Monday. Giving reasons for her withdrawal, she said it came on the heels of family consultations, stakeholders and well-wishers, to still be a voice for the Nigerian women.\n\nRecall that on May 8, Tallen had announced that she will be vying for the Plateau South Senatorial seat in the 2023 general elections\n\nAfterwards, Buhari had sometime last week issued a directive to all appointees seeking nomination ahead of the APC primaries to resign on or before May 16.\n\nThe directive followed the decision of the Court of Appeal to dismiss a suit that challenged section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, which prohibits appointees from participating in a convention as a delegate or nominee.\n\nContinuing, Tallen said, \u201cI remain resolute as I continue to relish the opportunity to serve Nigerian women in my capacity as Minister of Women Affairs under the able leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR.\n\n\u201cConsequently, I wish to inform you all that following broad-based consultations and interventions from critical stakeholders, I have decided to withdraw from running for the senatorial seat mindful of our accomplishments and the notable progress we have recorded under my stewardship at the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs.\n\n\u201cAbove all, as we celebrate our modest achievements, we are also conscious of the opportunities and achievements yet to be harnessed for Nigerian Women under this administration.\n\n\u201cWith profound gratitude and great humility, I have decided to voluntarily step down from the Senatorial race sequel to the yearnings of women and other well meaning Nigerians who see the need for a strong voice for Women at the Senate having consulted widely with my family, well-wishers and supporters conscious of the role I play for Women in Nigeria today.\n\n\u201cSo to all Nigerian Women and young girls who have raised concerns as to what next, rest assured that I, Dame Pauline K. Tallen, OFR, KSG have not submitted any resignation letter and therefore, it is my decision not to go ahead with this request but carry on as the Minister of Women Affairs.\u201d",

          "text": "By Kennedy Mbele\n\nFollowing the murder of 36- year-old sound engineer, David Imoh, by Okada riders, a group, League of Concerned Lagosians,LCL, has urged Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to save residents of the city from barbaric attitude of Okada riders.\n\nIt also called on the state governor to immediately ban the activities of commercial motorcyclists in the state, saying they pose dangers to lives and property.\n\nThe group in a statement by its President Chief Omowale Aro, said given the way Okada riders murder innocent Lagosians, it was high time government stopped them from operating in the state.\n\nThe statement titled: Should Government Wait Until Okada Riders Kill the Next Victim?, said it was surprising that Lagos has literally become the headquarters of Okada while the riders kill innocent people at will.\n\nImoh was killed and burnt after a misunderstanding over N100 change with an Okada rider in Lekki, Lagos.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201d we make this statement with heavy hearts given what has befallen our dear state, Lagos. It\u2019s saddening and scary that our state has been turned into a theater of absurdity by Okada riders. How do we explain that Okada riders of no address are now terrorising innocent residents of a cosmopolitan state like Lagos? Who do we tell that Okada riders kill innocent Lagosians at will with or without provocation? Who will believe that Lagos Okada riders wield the power of life and death? Isn\u2019t it unheard of that the list of Lagos residents killed by Okada riders increases rapidly? Is this happening in Lagos, you may ask? Yes, it happens in Lagos. This isn\u2019t the first time neither is it the second nor third. Okada riders in Lagos are above the law. They own the roads in Lagos and you dare not challenge their unruly behaviors. They are ignorant of everything the way they find it difficult to observe traffic rules. They are always right, whether you are right or not doesn\u2019t matter. They are bigger than the police and any law enforcement agent. No agent of the state has the balls to make them accept the norms of a civilized society like Lagos.\n\n\u201cThey can pass death sentence on you even when they are obviously wrong. They seem to have the numbers on the streets of Lagos because other Lagosians look the other way whenever they attack innocent road users or passersby. They are everywhere in Lagos. They are the lords of the manor everywhere in Lagos. From Ojota to Second Rainbow, Abule Ado to Ajah, they unleash terror on Lagosians. Where\u2019s government in all these? Obviously, the state government seems helpless.\n\n\u201cCould it be that they are overwhelmed by the numeric strength of the fellows of no address? One wonders why government is reluctant in banning their activities outrightly. Some northern states like Kano and Kaduna among others have banned Okada and heavens didn\u2019t fall. Why is Lagos pampering them at the expense of lives, peace, civility and orderliness? Is it until they murder another David Imoh that a drastic action would be taken? The menace of Okada riders in Lagos require more than knee jerk reactions each time they destroy life and property.\n\n\u201cThey are evil and shouldn\u2019t be tolerated in the interest of peace and harmony in Lagos. Taking them out of Lagos roads require more than the Lagos State Traffic Laws that only exists in a reactionary way. It requires leadership that stems from having the ability to make unpopular decision for public good. We know that Governor Sanwo-Olu has the courage to banish Okada riders from Lagos. The best way to console the families of those killed so far in Lagos by these uncivilized people is to totally outlaw their activities and not the Lagos Traffic Law that has failed.\u201d",

In view of this long-held position, Onyendu consequently distanced IPOB from the nefarious activities of criminals who are desecrating our land and assured that their end is near.\n\n\u201cOnyendu urges Umuchineke to recall his personal sacrifices and contributions towards alleviating the hardship imposed on our people by the COVID-19 pandemic, during the infamous lockdown that lasted several months.\n\n\u201cOnyendu restated that IPOB is a peaceful movement, and not in any way associated with any form of violence. No doubt, the Federal Government of Nigeria has nothing to place before the court to justify the bogus empty charges filed against Onyendu.

          "text": "Garba Emmanuel, the father of late Deborah Samuel, who was gruesomely killed and burnt in Sokoto last Thursday, has narrated how his daughter was killed.\n\nA distraught Emmanuel in an interview with elifeonline.net described his 22-year-old daughter as a humble girl who wanted a bright future, believed so much in the Lord and did not play with Church activities.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn her school, she was a member of the Christian Student Association and was well known in the Church because she didn\u2019t miss Church activities. She was not a troublemaker.\u201d\n\nGarba, who witnessed the killing of his daughter, said the mob action took place despite the presence of over 100 security agents comprising Police, NSDSC and DSS operatives.\n\nHe said: \u201dOk that Thursday morning around 9.00 am, she called me on her phone to say that some people wanted to kill her. I quickly left where I was and went to her school. On getting there, I saw a huge crowd of these boys and girls. The school authorities had taken her and locked her and another girl at the security gate by the school entrance.\n\n\u201cI then decided to report the matter to the police that there was a problem at the school. The police responded that I had no right to report what was happening in the school; the school was supposed to call them.\n\n\u201cI told them that I am a citizen of Nigeria and I have the right to report any wrongdoing happening anywhere if it affects me or anybody. So, they gave me two police officers in plain clothes.\n\n\u201cOn arrival at the school, they saw that the situation was beyond what they could handle.\n\n\u201cThey called the DPO, the Area Command, Police headquarters and the DSS office. The DSS arrived first on the scene and began shooting in the air to disperse the mob, some of whom ran away.\n\n\u201cThey attempted to rescue her but the door of the security post was locked with a padlock and the person holding the key was not there. Later, more police officers arrived and began to shoot teargas all over the place.\n\n\u201cAs this continued, more mobs from the adjourning communities began to arrive, all the passersby by the road because the school is on the express road, began to troop in, and the crowd was much.\n\n\u201cAt about 11 am, more police officers, Civil Defence and DSS were around and were teargassing the whole place. Rather than break the door and rescue her, they were waiting for the person with the key. Soon, the person came and in bringing her out, the mob took hold of her.\n\n\u201cAs they were struggling with the security men, one of the mob hit her on the head with a huge iron rod and she fell to the ground.\n\n\u201cThat was how they began to stone her, hit her with rods and sticks and she died. She was killed in the presence of all the security agents.\n\n\u201cAfter they killed her, the mob was jubilant that they killed her. The students and people from the villages were all shouting Allah Akbar, Allahu Akbar.\n\n\u201cThey were all happy and jubilating. Different people began to say, \u2018I am the one that killed her\u2019, \u2018I am the one that killed her\u2019.\n\n\u201cAfter some twenty to thirty minutes, a lady in hijab, one of her schoolmates, began to shout, a kone ta, a kone ta, akone ta, meaning \u2018set her body ablaze, set her body ablaze.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat was when they gathered tires, and one of the boys brought his machine from where they siphoned the fuel, which they poured on the tires and set her body ablaze.\n\n\u201cAfter about two hours, the school authority and the police officers took her body to the mortuary.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cMore than 100 policemen were there. They were more than one hundred. The DSS people there were not many. The DSS people tried to rescue her but left it to the police when they came in about five to seven vehicles, including the civil defence. But see what eventually happened.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the police officers deliberately did what they did, he said: \u201cWell, what can I say? If they, did it deliberately, I leave them to the hands of God because I believe that if the police and the other security agencies wanted to rescue her, immediately they shot in the air and the mob dispersed, they could have taken her into one of their many vehicles and zoomed off.\n\n\u201cThey could have broken the padlock and repaired it later. But\u2026 they did what they did. I leave everything to God.\n\n\u201cWe are based in Magajia in Niger state in Rijaw Local government. I was in Sokoto when she called me to say they wanted to kill her and I immediately moved to the school.\n\n\u201cThey were on holiday during the Salah break and the school resumed on Saturday and started exams on Monday. They were still in the exam mood on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and on Thursday, they killed her.\u201d\n\nOn withdrawal of the voice note, he said: \u201cNo. Nobody told her to remove the voice note. She made the recording on Wednesday evening and on Thursday morning, they started making arrangements to kill her.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he was going to relocate as speculated in the media, revealed that amid the uproar and riot in the state over the arrest of his daughters\u2019 killers, he still feels safe staying in Sokoto and will not move out of the state.\n\n\u201cI will move to nowhere. I am ok here. I am already established here, and these people can\u2019t scare me away from this place.\n\nOn how his wife heard about Deborah\u2019s death, he said: \u201cSome of Deborah\u2019s mates broke the news to her. When I got back home, I heard that when she was told, she fainted and was rushed to the hospital in Magajiya. She slept there because she had high blood pressure.\n\n\u201cThere is no problem. We have peace. Even the Muslims now know that what they had done was wrong and not Islamic. We have said this so many times.\n\n\u201cSome Arab preachers also said no place in the Koran that says they should kill anybody. Even Gumi, one of their Sheiks, said when Mohammed was alive, he was insulted face to face and he never asked anybody to deal with no one.\n\n\u201cIs it now after his death that anyone would say they should kill? He said it was some Mallams, some Ulama, who took that decision so they could control their masses. It is not in Islamic laws.\n\n\u201cTheir law says if anyone is caught in blasphemy, they should be taken to the Sharia courts, and it is the court that will determine if blasphemy was indeed committed.\n\n\u201cThe Muslims have condemned it. The Sultan and many Muslims were not happy about this.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking on how his other children reacted to the incident said: \u201cThey all know there is nothing we can do now. She is not my only child and not the eldest.\n\n\u201cThey know that all we can do now is to thank God and praise him because there is nothing we can do to bring her back.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel denied saying his children will not go to school again, stating he only questioned the safety of his children in school.\n\n\u201cThat is a lie. I never said so. You can\u2019t stop your children from going to school because of this.\n\n\u201cI guess they misquoted the calls of our people not to send their children to that school again because if you send your child to school and what you get is her dead body, it is a break of trust.\n\n\u201cIf they cannot keep your children safe, why send them to that school?\u201d\n\nHe stated that his family has no plans of taking the school authority to court but the government can do so if need be.\n\n\u201cI am not going to court because if I do, it won\u2019t bring her back. For three to four years, you are still in court. For what? I am not going to court.\n\n\u201cBut if the government wants, they are free. She is an indigene of Nigeria. Government can decide to go to court to prosecute the offender as a deterrent for a reoccurrence.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernment should handle it and punish the culprits so it would not happen again.\n\n\u201cWe believe in God and thank Him that He has called her back home this way. How many people die, and the news goes as far as this? So, she is a child of a poor man, but her name has gone around worldwide. Glory be to God.\u201d",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan, Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure, Tony Osauzo, Benin\n\nNigerian students, yesterday, made good their threats to cripple socio-economic actives in the country as they barricaded major highways and obstructed movements in continuation of their protest over ongoing nationwide strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).\n\nIn 2020, the union embarked on a nine-month strike, the longest since 1999 and about two years later on February 14, it went on a four-week warning strike. It declared another eight weeks strike, saying it was giving the government more time to attend to its demands. Upon it expiration, it announced additional 12 weeks roll-over with effect from May 9, to end in August. The students have so far spent three months at home owing to the lecturers\u2019 strike.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nFollowing the protracted industrial action which has lasted over 90 days, the students had last week released an action plan which include disruption of socio-economic and political activities to force government and the lecturers back to the dialogue table with a view to speedily resolving the disputes and ensure the return to classrooms. Yesterday\u2019s protest forced motorists on major routes linking the South West to the South East and the north to spend several hours while others had to find alternatives routes out of the logjam. Most commuters were forced to trek long distances to their destinations.\n\nIn Ibadan, Oyo State, the protesting students barricaded the highway in front of the University of Ibadan (UI) and hampered free flow of traffic along the busy Ojoo-UI-Molola Road and the road leading from UI to Bodija. The students also went to the entrance of Oyo State Government Secretariat, Ibadan, and prevented vehicular movement.\n\nLeader of the Ibadan protest, Solomon Emiola, said: \u201cWe are here because of ASUU, NASU SSANU strike. We want the Federal Government to use this as the last strike. We want all the strikes to finish. This should be the last strike in the history of Nigerian students.\u201d\n\nOne of the protesting students, Damilola Olubunmi, said: \u201cI am here because we need to tell the Federal Government that students must resume. The strike is not affecting the students alone. It is also affecting our parents. The essence of this is that when the road is blocked, people cannot move and they will trend it for us. Then, the government will know that we protesting.\u201d\n\nIn Ogun, a joint protest by students of Olabisi Onabanjo University (OOU), Ago-Iwoye; Tai Solarin University of Education, Science and Technology (TASUED) Ijagun and Federal University of Agriculture (FUNAAB), Abeokuta, saw the students block the Sagamu-Benin Expressway.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

He stressed that it was high time the Federal Government and members of ASUU agreed and reach a compromise to end the strike.\n\n\u201dWe have been clamouring since the commencement of this ASUU strike that something should be done with immediate effect, but both ASUU and the federal government are not listening to us.They have to understand the fact that Nigerian students will always be at the receiving end at the end of the day. Our students are suffering, our students are fed up. This whole issue is getting out of hand. We do not pray that our students end up engaging themselves in criminal activities as we all know that an idle hand is the devil\u2019s workshop,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NANS chairman begged the two parties to do the needful and call off the strike.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nDon Ayomide, President, Student Union Government of TASUED, said the protest was necessary to let both the federal government and ASUU be aware of the plight of Nigerian students.\n\nSimilarly, students of the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA) also blocked major roads in Akure, the Ondo State capital in protest to the ASUU strike.\n\nThe students who trooped out as early as 6.30am moved in enmass on major roads in the town chanting various solidarity songs.\n\nThe protest caused serious crisis for transporters and commuters as the busy Ilesa-Akure express road was temporarily blocked.\n\nFor hours, transporters plying the busy road were stranded as a result of the protest, just as commercial activities in the affected areas were halted. Some of the roads blocked aside the Ilesa-Akure express road include Benin-Owo road and Orita Obele road among others.\n\nThe students hinged their action on the attitude of the Federal Government on the strike by the university teachers, condemning the attitude of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration on the plight of both the university students and teachers.\n\nWhile appealing to the Federal Government to accede to the demands of ASUU and other staff unions of university, the students threaten to continue with the protest until the universities are opened for academic work.\n\nIn Benin, Edo State, students of the University of Benin (UNIBEN) shut the Federal Secretariat, Benin, stormed the secretariat at Aduwawa area and declared a work free day for workers.\n\nThey cooked at the secretariat and threatened to shut Federal Government offices in the state to press home their demand for the resolution of the ASUU crisis.\n\n\u201cWe have told the workers that today is a free day for them because they can\u2019t be working while we are out of our classes. All the Federal offices would be shut down. We have also written to INEC to let them know that election will not take place in Edo until we return to our classes. The police is here with us to ensure that the protest is not hijacked by hoodlums because the students are peace-loving people,\u201d said Foster Amadin, president, UNIBEN Student Union Government.\n\n\u201cEducation has been taken to an unserious level and the Federal Government is busy with election, forgetting that there are many students at home due to the ASUU strike. We are here today, we have protested at the Airport, Ring Road and Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) office. We will keep going round until they find a solution and we go back to our classes,\u201d Amadin said.",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Adora Nwodo is making a name for herself in the cloud",
          "text": "Adora Nwodo is a 25-year-old software engineer based in Lagos. She currently works as a cloud engineer at Microsoft and is the author of Cloud Engineering for beginners. I\u2019m bringing Adora to Centre Stage because she has shown great commitment to strengthening developer communities across Nigeria and is an advocate for African women in technology.\n\nAdora Nwodo on cloud engineering and mixed reality\n\nKoromone Koroye: Hi Adora, thanks for agreeing to speak with me. Please, tell me a little about yourself.\n\nAdora Nwodo: I am a software engineer currently building mixed reality on the cloud at Microsoft. I am also a public speaker, published author, digital creator, and occasional DJ.\n\nKK: Are there any differences between cloud and software engineering, or are the terms interchangeable?\n\nAN: There are differences. Anyone who designs, builds, implements, and maintains software applications is a software engineer.\n\nCloud engineers are typically hired to deploy or scale up new and existing cloud resources. Cloud engineers literally do their engineering on the cloud, whether software engineering or DevOps engineering.\n\nKK: What does it mean to build mixed reality (MR) products?\n\nAN: Before I talk about mixed reality, let me briefly explain the difference between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\n\nAR is essentially an enhanced and interactive version of our physical and real world. If you have ever used Snapchat or Instagram filters, you have interacted with AR somehow.\n\nOn the other hand, VR is a computer-generated environment that usually requires a head-mounted display (HMD) or headset to enjoy a fully-immersed digital experience.\n\nMixed reality blends both AR and VR and provides an interesting middle ground for both technologies. MR gives you the immersive VR experience and the chance to interact with multiple digital objects. Furthermore, MR gives you the illusion that these digital objects exist in your physical space. I can see holograms in my room when I wear a mixed reality headset, but I still get to experience my room as it exists in real life.\n\nKK: Fascinating! What do you enjoy about building mixed reality products in your current role?\n\nAN: I\u2019m building a platform called Mesh for Microsoft. Mesh is the engine that will power the metaverse. Building Mesh has been an exciting experience, primarily because most of the ideas we are working on are relatively new and unknown. Sometimes, building in uncharted territory without a pre-existing playbook to fall back on, can be frustrating. Still, I choose to enjoy the learning process of pioneering a new industry or sector.\n\nDigging deeper with Adora Nwodo\n\nKK: How did you get into cloud engineering? What piqued your interest?\n\nAN: Before joining Microsoft, I already had a vested interest in technology, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and cloud engineering. When I found out about the Microsoft role and that it involved working with mixed reality, I was immediately interested in being a part of the team. During my early months in Microsoft, I primarily worked on the HoloLens before transitioning into cloud-related projects.\n\nKK: Is there a learning curve to accommodate cloud engineering? What are the specific courses people need to take?\n\nAN: If you\u2019re trying to come into cloud engineering, taking an introductory computer science course is essential. The cloud is basically a network of computers, so you need a foundational understanding of computers to understand what is going on. Take any fundamental course on computer science; learn about Linux, operating systems, networking, and cloud fundamentals of the computer.\n\nKK: Let\u2019s talk about your professional growth. Did your career kick off at a startup?\n\nAN: No, it didn\u2019t. I worked with an advertising agency as a software developer before moving to Microsoft.\n\nKK: What was it like transitioning from working at an agency to moving to a more structured and global company like Microsoft?\n\nAN: Joining Microsoft was a breath of fresh air for me, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily about the company as much as it was about the team. I\u2019m a big advocate for working with great teams rather than just great companies. The transition was easy for me because I was excited about the opportunity to build solutions I am passionate about and become the kind of engineer that I have always dreamed of.\n\nAdora on being an African woman in technology\n\nKK: What changes do you think need to be made for gender biases to be eradicated in our ecosystem? It\u2019s obviously going to take a while, but practically speaking, what kind of changes do you think need to be made?\n\nAN: When we talk about gender bias, some people think it\u2019s always conscious, but unconscious biases also exist. I implore African startups and businesses to hold recurring bias training sessions for their employees throughout the year. We can\u2019t start the mindset shift if we don\u2019t educate people and expose them to their conscious and unconscious biases.\n\nHannatu Asheolge: You are pretty influential in the Nigerian tech ecosystem. You\u2019re also a blogger, published author, and active YouTuber. How has putting yourself out there helped you grow?\n\nAdora Nwodo: Putting myself out there is one of the reasons I got into Microsoft at the time that I did. Being active in the developer community and on LinkedIn at that time put me on a recruiter\u2019s radar; it helped me acknowledge that I\u2019m a big fan of learning in public. If I didn\u2019t try to learn in public by posting tweets about things I was reading or learning, people wouldn\u2019t have reached out to me to offer help. Finally, it helped me build my network. Going to ecosystem-related events, meeting new people, and taking on collaborative projects has helped my professional growth.\n\nHA: You recently announced that you were accepted into a Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) programme. What does this acceptance mean to you as a young Nigerian woman?\n\nAN: I am excited about learning career-accelerating skills like leadership and business management, and I get to be a part of the impressive GSB network.\n\nHA: Do you have any tips you\u2019d like to share about balancing work life and school?\n\nAA: First of all, I don\u2019t know if balance is achievable. I like to think we just try our best and leave the rest to vibes, to a great extent. Delegation is a skill everyone needs to learn on the job. You don\u2019t have to do everything, primarily when you work with a team of talented people. How you prioritise your tasks and assignments matters as well. Prioritise, delegate, and ask for help.\n\nMy calendar has also made my life easier recently. I use it to schedule most of my days to avoid wasting time on unnecessary tasks.\n\nHA: You\u2019re very vocal about your non-work-related hobbies and interests. Can you share some of your favorite hobbies or after-work activities?\n\nAN: I love going around drinking wine and eating steak and mashed potatoes. I enjoy the whole restaurant-hopping thing with a bunch of my friends where we\u2019re just eating good food and drinking wine. I also DJ at lounges and curated events.\n\nHA: You\u2019re currently part of several communities. Can you share a few that have helped shape your professional and personal growth?\n\nAN: I\u2019ve been a part of several communities, but the one that really helped a lot at the start of my career was Google Developer Groups(GDG). I was a co-organiser for GDG Ajah and a member of GDG Lagos. My involvement with them helped me meet many tech people at that time. Currently, I\u2019m VP for the Nigerian chapter of the VR/AR Association. The goal is to advocate for VR and AR usage in this region and let the world see what Nigerian companies are doing with VR and AR technology.\n\nHA: You\u2019re a young woman with a thriving career. Do you see yourself sticking with cloud engineering for a long time, or is there a career pivot in your future?\n\nAN: There\u2019s a career pivot in my future. I see myself taking on more roles that allow me to make business decisions within tech organisations pretty soon. Engineering decisions are fun, but I definitely want to take on roles that will enable me to make more business and product decisions at some point in my career.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Safaricom, the largest telecommunications provider in Kenya, is set to launch commercial operations in Ethiopia later this year. This announcement was made by Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa while sharing the telco\u2019s financial statement for the year ended March 31, 2022 last week.\n\n\u201cWe have made our first test call, sent [the] first test SMS and completed [the] first test data session,\u201d Ndegwa said on Twitter. \u201cWe have a strong team of 300 employees with half of them being Ethiopians.\u201d\n\nA key highlight from the results announcement is that we are set to launch commercial operations in @SafaricomET within the year as part of our regional expansion efforts to provide world-class telecommunication services to over 112 million Ethiopians. #SafaricomFYResults pic.twitter.com/oJPgGSVJfw \u2014 Peter Ndegwa (@PeterNdegwa_) May 12, 2022\n\nSafaricom increased its service revenue by 12.3% to KES 281.11 billion ($2.42 billion) and profit by 13.5% to KES 109.13 billion ($940 million), according to its latest financial report. Voice service revenue grew by 0.8% to KES 83.21 billion ($720 million); mobile data revenue grew by 8.1% to KES 48.44 billion ($420 million), while M-PESA revenue grew by 30.3% to KES 107.69 billion ($930 million).\n\nSafaricom Ethiopia\u2019s plans to bring mobile financial services to Ethiopia. However, this is subject to the licensing and regulatory process by the Government of Ethiopia.\n\nLast year, Safaricom joined efforts with Vodafone, Vodacom, Japan\u2019s Sumitomo Corp, and UK\u2019s CDC Group to secure the licence to operate in Ethiopia at a cost of $850 million, a landmark win as the second most populous African country opened up its telecom sector to competition.\n\nThis led Safaricom to set up shop in Ethiopia earlier this year, but while the licence allowed the company to compete against state monopoly Ethio Telecom, it couldn\u2019t offer M-PESA services (its mobile financial service) due to legal limitations.\n\nIn April, Ethiopia started changing its national payments law to enable Safaricom to introduce M-PESA in the country.\n\nAccording to Business Daily Africa, the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) drafted a new bill which included a clause that \u201cForeign nationals may be allowed to invest in a payment instrument issuer or a payment system operator business, or establish a subsidiary which shall be licensed as a payment instrument issuer or payment system operator.\u201d\n\nWhen the new bill is signed into law, Safaricom will be able to compete with Telebirr, a mobile service Ethio Telecom launched last year that attracted 4 million users within its first month. Ethio Telecom has over 58 million subscribers, the highest number of subscribers by an African operator in a country.\n\nShare this article",

Techpoint Pitch Friday.\n\nOn Friday, May 13, 2022, we had two entrepreneurs share their startups and their journeys with us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally scheduled to start by 5 pm, we eventually began by 5:15 pm when one of the founders scheduled to pitch was held up by traffic. However, we kicked off with Peter Ayeni pitching Strich.\n\nA one-stop-shop for managing business operations\n\nOver 80% of Nigerians depend on mom and pop shops for their household supplies. Unfortunately, many of these shops struggle to track their finances and inventory, leading to avoidable losses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Ayeni, CEO Strich\n\nStrich wants to eliminate these challenges for the businesses and help them grow their operations. Already, the startup has gotten support from Adanian Labs and is in the process of raising a pre-seed round.\n\nMaking life easy for laundry merchants\n\nWhen people decide to start businesses, they rarely anticipate the operational challenges that will often take them away from doing the main tasks their businesses should be doing.\n\nFor laundry merchants, they have to market their services to customers, but they also have to track and fulfil orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAyo Popoola responding to questions about Ricive\n\nPreviously, all this had to be done manually, but Ayo Popoola wants to digitise these operations with Ricive.\n\nFeedback and networking\n\nAfter the founders were done pitching, they were peppered with questions on everything from their business model to traction and differentiating factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 6:30 pm, the event was brought to an end, and participants lingered to network.\n\nThe next edition of Pitch Friday comes up Friday, June 11, 2022, and it promises to be an exciting time.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nRemember Elon Musk saying his $44 billion bid to buy Twitter was \u201ctemporarily on hold\u201d due to spam concerns on Friday, May 13, 2022?\n\nSo, Twitter CEO, Parag Agrawal responded yesterday, Monday, May 16, 2022, claiming Musk\u2019s plan to quantify the problem by randomly sampling 100 accounts would fail.\n\nThe Twitter-Musk drama that we thought was almost over appears to be just getting started.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what do you think this is all about? Is it true that he probably won\u2019t buy Twitter and finding ways to avoid paying the $1 billion fine, as some claim? Or do you believe he is genuinely concerned? If you\u2019re indifferent, please let me know too.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nWhy some people in tech fake it until they make it\n\nTopship\u2019s $2.5m seed\n\nTwiga Foods launching Twiga Fresh\n\nWhy do people in tech fake it \u2019till they make it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you listened to the latest episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast? If you haven\u2019t already, you should. It is always published before the newsletter.\n\nI laughed a lot while listening to today\u2019s episode; it is quite entertaining. My favourite story is probably, \u201cFake it till you make it.\u201d\n\nBefore we proceed, what do you think about the adage? Anyway, while listening, one question that kept popping into my head was, \u201cDoes doing that make you a bad person?\u201d\n\nI mean, humans need to achieve their goals one way or another, and if it means faking it until they reach it, what\u2019s the big deal?\n\nHmm. Before you come for my head, let me unequivocally state that I do not support living a fabricated life on or off social media.\n\nHowever, based on the definition of the adage, you may agree with me that humans may need to fake it before they make it at times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what exactly does the adage mean? \u201cFake it until you make it\u201d implies that you can imbue your life with confidence, competence, or an optimistic outlook by imitating those qualities.\n\nAnd we all know that appearances are significant if you want to be appropriately addressed. Well, except you look like a baby like me. \ud83d\ude02 And, as we all know, babies don\u2019t care. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 Okay, I\u2019m kidding.\n\nHowever, you will agree that wearing high-quality or nice clothing and accessories boosts confidence. Still, I have a problem with the adage, especially when people try to convince us that they\u2019re doing something they\u2019re not on social media.\n\nThis happens all the time, and it isn\u2019t any different in the tech industry. Why will some tech bros and sis claim to be doing something they are not? To what purpose?\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m not sure why some people in the tech industry want to literally fake it until they make it \u2014 assuming they make it at all.\n\nBack to the podcast, Oluwanifemi spoke with two experts from The Experts series concerning this, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like to hear their perspectives, and the editorial\u2019s too. You can listen here.\n\nTopship\u2019s $2.5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed closely, you\u2019d have noticed that after the publication of our Y Combinator report, Emmanuel answered the question, \u201cwhat problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving in Africa?\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s news is about a startup attempting to solve one of the problems named Topship. If you don\u2019t know what the company does, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got you covered.\n\nTopship is a Nigerian digital freight forwarder that recently completed the YC winter batch. It was founded in 2020 after Co-founder and CEO, Moses Enenwali, noticed an increase in merchants\u2019 needs for shipping parcels and cargo outside of Nigeria.\n\nAnd yesterday, Monday, May 16, 2022, the company announced that it has raised a $2.5 million seed round to assist merchants with international shipping.\n\nThe round was led by Flexport. Other participants include Y Combinator, Soma Capital, Starling Ventures, Olive Tree Capital, Capital X and True Capital, while some of the individual investors in the round include Immad Akhund, Mercury CEO and Arash Ferdowsi, Co-founder of Dropbox.\n\nTopship wants to make shipping as simple as possible for African businesses to export and import parcels and cargo to their customers, suppliers, and distributors worldwide.\n\nThe company says it enables 1,500 merchants to ship cargo and parcels from Nigeria to over 150 countries.\n\nAlthough it can assist Nigerian merchants in receiving parcel deliveries from other countries, it can only accept cargo deliveries from the United States, the United Kingdom, and China.\n\nThe new funding provides Topship with sufficient funds to proceed and begin operations in Ghana, Tanzania and Kenya. Also, a portion of the investment would go toward improving its asset-light technology and developing a proprietary global shipping infrastructure to make imports and exports much faster and easier.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in four days!

Twiga Foods has used technology since its inception to connect smallholder farmers with informal traders. This has given producers access to new markets and a large pool of customers while also optimising the food supply chain in its markets.\n\nHowever, Twiga claims that along the way, they have encountered traceability issues, stock-outs, and price volatility, making it difficult for the company to deliver on its promise of affordability and food security.\n\nConsequently, Twiga believes Twiga Fresh can improve production control.\n\nThe company claims that the investment in Kenya will result in one of Africa\u2019s largest single horticultural farms focused solely on the domestic market.\n\nFurther, Twiga Foods plans to start operations in Uganda and Tanzania soon and is also looking into new markets in Central and West Africa.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious?

A culmination of Amber Group\u2019s multi-disciplinary expertise in digital architecture and blockchain-native infrastructure, Openverse serves as a gateway to the metaverse, empowering Web2 creators, brands and businesses with tools and services to transition into Web3.\n\nWith the metaverse economy projected to reach $13 trillion by 2030, Openverse marks Amber Group\u2019s venture into Web3 community building. Due to launch in Q3 2022, Openverse is a significant milestone in Amber Group\u2019s plans to aid businesses, industries and societies as they transition into Web3. As a one-stop platform, Openverse will create entry points into the metaverse by delivering end-to-end creative and digital infrastructures for creators, brands and businesses.\n\n\u201cDigital assets are the first step in realizing a decentralized future where people are empowered to create and connect with online communities, unlocking new digital experiences. While there has been a lot of interest in the metaverse, it remains largely conceptual. With Openverse, we are taking a solid step towards creating this digital reality for all. Backed by our expertise and partnerships within the digital asset ecosystem, Openverse is at the forefront of onboarding businesses and communities into the metaverse, unlocking the true potential of decentralization,\u201d said Amber Group\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Michael Wu.\n\nOpenverse is designed to be a Web3 enablement platform, supported by leading real-time 3D rendering technology to create an experiential digital world for all users. The platform will be accessible on mobile, desktop and VR platforms, and will come equipped with features such as real-time content interaction, gameplay, customizable digital avatars and an NFT valuation system. Openverse will also leverage Amber Group\u2019s flagship digital asset platform, WhaleFin, for its crypto financial services, creating synergies with the company\u2019s thriving consumer business line to expand the reach of its digital asset services.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to launch Openverse, and convert the possibilities of the metaverse into reality in the next few months. As we develop a gateway for everyone to journey into the metaverse together, we are also building a strong line-up of partnerships with gaming studios, sporting brands, digital artists and creators in an effort to bridge the gap between physical and virtual economies. Not only will this encourage more Web2 users to migrate into the metaverse, it will also herald a new era for digital assets worldwide,\u201d said Openverse\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Jo Xu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

It is being executed through a novel $27.8 million (about N15.5 billion) MSME Revitalization Fund, ensuring that qualified MSMEs can access loans for their business at a single-digit interest rate. Seventy percent of the MSME Revitalization Fund targets women-owned MSMEs in agribusiness, the creative industry, and digital sector. The remaining 30 percent will be deployed to meet the funding needs of youth-owned enterprises and businesses run by vulnerable members within Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking on the partnership, the Managing Director, FCMB, Yemisi Edun, described it as a purpose-driven intervention that would further help break the barriers that limit MSMEs\u2019 productivity and overall success in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said, \u201cThe past few years have been very challenging for individuals, households, and businesses in Nigeria.

          "title": "Surging wheat prices evoke ditched cassava policy",
          "text": "The Nigerian government is expected to be under pressure to dust off its cassava flour policy as India, the second-largest producer of wheat, has banned the export of the grain, sending global prices to new peaks.\n\nThe rise in wheat prices is coming amid an already tight supply of the commodity that has hit Nigeria, Africa\u2019s biggest economy.\n\nFutures traded in Chicago rose as much as 4.12 percent to $12.47 a bushel on Monday, their highest level in two months, according to future quotes on the CMEgroup website. Wheat prices have risen more than 60 percent year to date, mainly driven by the Russian-Ukraine war.\n\nIndia has filled a gap in the international market created by the decreased output induced by the war in the Black Sea region, which accounts for almost a third of the world\u2019s wheat export.\n\nIndustry sources and analysts say the ban by India would send the global prices of the grain to new heights, and could compel the Nigerian government to back to the abandoned policy on cassava flour, a close substitute for wheat.\n\n\u201cWith India enforcing an export ban on wheat, prices of wheat will further surge and this is bad for Nigerians and Africans,\u201d Ayo Olubori, former chairman of the National Cassava Processors and Marketers Association, said in a response to questions.\n\n\u201cIt will force the Nigerian government to rethink the cassava flour inclusion policy it abandoned as it hopes to control inflation and alleviate the suffering of its citizens,\u201d he said.\n\nHe lamented the neglect of the cassava flour policy, saying \u201cImagine the jobs that would have been created if the policy was sustained? We would have had a thriving industry that would have been exporting cassava flour and earning forex.\u201d\n\nAyodeji Ebo, managing director and chief business officer of Optimus by Afrinvest, called on the country to start looking inwards and leverage its opportunities as a top cassava producer.\n\n\u201cWe need to start looking inwards by revisiting the cassava flour inclusion policy. This will enable us to reduce our wheat imports dependency and control inflation,\u201d he said.\n\nEfforts at boosting the country\u2019s local wheat production in recent years have been hampered by the Boko Haram insurgency in the North-Eastern region, as farmers in Borno, the country\u2019s major wheat-producing state, had abandoned their farmlands and fled to other regions for safety, while some stay at the internally displaced persons\u2019 camps.\n\nAmid the current global wheat crisis, analysts say the Nigerian government is faced with choices \u2013 to either invest massively in wheat production or to look for cheaper alternatives like cassava and orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFP) as substitutes for wheat.\n\nThe former will take time as the country has not been able to significantly increase its wheat production, despite millions of naira invested across the value chain in recent years.\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture estimates Nigeria\u2019s wheat production at 90,000 metric tonnes in the 2021/2022 season, the most recent data on the country\u2019s wheat production.\n\nThis figure represents less than 20 percent of total annual demand, estimated at 5 million metric tonnes by the Nigerian agricultural ministry in 2018. This means Nigeria is left with the option of looking at cheaper alternatives.\n\nKenya, Egypt, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon are already blending cheaper alternatives such as sorghum, OFSP and cassava into their loaves of bread, pastries, and pastas as wheat prices continue to surge.\n\n\u201cCurrently no flour miller in the country is including cassava in their flour as we speak. The cassava flour has been abandoned since Buhari\u2019s administration. What we do is to buy cheaper wheat from the Black Sea region and blend it with quality wheat from the United States and Canada,\u201d said Jude Okafor, national publicity secretary of Association of Master Bakers and Caterers of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur local production is still low, and we need to start looking at alternatives such as cassava flour and the orange-fleshed sweet potato flour to help control the price,\u201d Okafor said.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, there is going to be another round of price increase in bread because there is a daily increase on the prices of flour, and bakers cannot carry the extra cost but pass it to the consumers. This constant increase has forced many bakers to close up,\u201d he added.\n\nInflation in Africa\u2019s most populous country accelerated to 16.8 percent in April, the highest in eight months. Food inflation hit 18.37 percent, the highest in seven months, with analysts expecting more acceleration in May on the back of the further surge in wheat prices.\n\nRead also: Experts urge action to avert wheat value chain collapse\n\n\u201cIf we fail to start looking at other cheaper alternatives, the implication is that the demand for FX will further increase and inflation will further accelerate.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government had in 2002 kicked off the flour initiative when it mandated flour millers\u2019 to substitute five percent cassava flour in wheat flour meant for baking bread and production of other confectioneries to reduce its wheat importation.\n\nIn 2007, the policy, which was already gaining momentum, was abandoned after the Obasanjo-led government left office, thus bringing the whole policy process to a halt.\n\nAfter five years of being abandoned, in 2012, former President Goodluck Jonathan re-introduced the cassava flour inclusion policy to encourage the substitution of high-quality cassava flour for wheat flour and the inclusion rate increased steadily from 10 percent to 40 percent by 2015.\n\nNigeria currently imports 98 percent of its wheat needs and the grain is the second most imported item in the fourth quarter of 2021, accounting for 6.69 percent of total imports for the period.\n\n\u201cIf we had continued with the policy when it was initiated, we would have doubled our cassava production by now. But because we failed too, turning to cheaper local alternatives right now means prices of the tuber will surge and prices of garri and fufu will also increase,\u201d Olubori said.",

          "text": "One week after the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) intervened to resolve the aviation fuel crisis in the country, investigation shows that the supply from the NNPC has been used up and airlines are now grappling with price hikes amid scarcity.\n\nLast week, the NNPC and domestic airlines, during a meeting with the House of Representatives, reached an agreement that the national oil firm would supply Jet-A1 to marketers nominated by airline operators for a period of three months at N480 per litre, pending when the carriers would be granted licences to import the commodity.\n\nAirline Operators of Nigeria (AON) had said it nominated 10 marketers for the purpose.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s findings show that airlines have exhausted these products and are back to buying fuel at higher prices.\n\nA top oil marketer told BusinessDay in a phone interview that in February, when airlines first complained of fuel price increase, the product was made available to oil marketers at N432 per litre and after spending on logistics, oil markers sold to them at N480 per litre.\n\nHe said when the product became scarce, few companies still had fuel they bought at N432 but were selling to oil marketers at N540 per litre, taking advantage of the fuel scarcity.\n\nThe oil marketer explained that what the NNPC and the Central Bank of Nigeria did was to call these companies to sell the remaining fuel they had at N480 per litre to the airlines since they bought at N432, adding that when this was done, the companies had about six million litres only.\n\nHe said many airlines keyed into this opportunity and bought fuel at N480 per litre.\n\nAs of Monday, the product was sold in Lagos at N598 per litre, N642 in Kano, N640 in Kaduna, N627 in Abuja, N635 in Enugu and Anambra and N628 in Port Harcourt.\n\nAirlines already feeling the impact have started delaying flights and increasing fares for flights across the country.\n\nSukhjinder Mann, deputy CEO of Dana Air, said the airline was again witnessing the scarcity of Jet A1 fuel across the airports in Nigeria, which he said had, in some cases, caused recent flight delays.\n\nMann however craved for the understanding of passengers.\n\nObiukwu Mbanuzuo, chief commercial officer of Green Africa told BusinessDay that the current fuel crisis was also affecting Green Africa despite its usage of small fuel-efficient aircraft.\n\n\u201cOur aircraft type is different and fuel burn is different but when there is an increase in fuel price, it will affect us because it will increase our operating costs,\u201d he said.\n\nAzman Air passengers were on Saturday and Sunday stranded at the Malam Aminu Kano International Airport as a result of aviation fuel scarcity.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s investigations show that most airlines have left the N50,000 base fare benchmark and have increased to about N55,000 to N60,000.\n\nFindings also show that there was no N50,000 fare on Air Peace\u2019s website as of Monday.\n\nRead also: Airlines announce flight disruptions over aviation fuel scarcity\n\nFares for flights from Lagos to Abuja, Owerri, Port Harcourt, and Asaba on Air Peace, Dana and United Nigeria Airlines have risen to between N55,000 and N70,000 for an economy one-way ticket.\n\nFares for flights from Lagos to Abuja, Kano and Kaduna on Air Peace, Azman and Max Air have risen from N50,000 to about N65,000.\n\nThe AON, on Monday, alerted the public to impending flight disruptions to scheduled operations.\n\nIt said in a statement that the development was being forced on members by the growing scarcity of aviation fuel, popularly known as JETA1.\n\nThe airlines said: \u201cThe scarcity is impacting negatively on seamless conduct of air transport operations and would lead to flight rescheduling, and or, cancellations.\n\n\u201cHowever, the association and its members are working very hard and in alliance with the product marketers, government and relevant stakeholders, to ensure availability and proper pricing of aviation fuel in the country.\u201d\n\nWhile pleading the understanding of the flying public in the face of this reality, the AON promised to do all that is necessary and within its powers to restore normal flight schedules as soon as possible.",

Ibrahim Tukur El-Sudi, the Taraba State chairman of the APC, has promised Rotimi Amaechi, a presidential aspirant, at least 90 percent of the state\u2019s delegates votes during the party\u2019s primaries.\n\nEl-Sudi made this known during Amaechi\u2019s consultative visit to the party in Jalingo, Monday.\n\nEl-Sufi said the party is grateful for what he referred to as Amaechi\u2019s enormous interest in Taraba State and pledged in consonance with the delegates to deliver at least 90 percent of their votes to him at the forth coming Presidential primaries.\n\n\u201cOur delegates know how to separate the chaff from the grain. Sir, we are assuring you that 90 percent of our votes will go to you. Our Emir has already spoken, therefore you should be guaranteed of 90 percent(delegate votes)\n\n\u201cSir, you are a grassroots politician, we know how you came up in Rivers State to become member of House of Assembly, Governor two times and by the grace of God you just resigned as a Minister. Most of our delegates are legislators and I believe they will be very much comfortable with you,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier Amaechi told the delegates that Taraba State is key to Nigeria as it is one of the highest producers of food in the country. He also promised to invest in the Mambilla power project if he gets to the Presidency, to increase power generation and distribution as well as create jobs for the people of Taraba State.\n\n\u201cTrust me on this, I\u2019m going to invest in Mambilla (Power project). Take it for free, I know what is wrong with Mambilla, because I was among those who went to negotiate it in China. So, if you vote for me, you\u2019re voting for yourself, because the jobs that will be created here, will be for the people of Taraba. The next critical thing I will invest in here is agriculture and the value chain will bring industrial development to Taraba,\u201d Amaechi said.\n\nAt the Palace of the Emir of Muri in Jalingo, Alhaji Abbas Tafida, Amaechi stated that he understands the problems of Nigeria more than other aspirants vying for the presidency and that he would provide workable solutions to those challenges if given the opportunity to serve as President.\n\n\u201cYour Highness, we are here to fulfill one political tradition. You don\u2019t enter any man\u2019s kingdom without first, going to the owner of the kingdom to seek approval to enter the kingdom. So, we are here to seek your blessings, we are here to seek your permission to be able to talk to your delegates. I have been in public office for quite some time. I have been in office back to back, non-stop and I have done seven years as a Minister.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am here because I know that if you give me your blessings I will certainly win on that day. I will not dissapoint you. The reason for which people elected and appointed me back to back for twenty three years is because I take my responsibility very seriously.\n\n\u201cThere is no aspirant that I see on stage now that has done the number of years I have done in public office, so I know what the issues are , I know how to deal with the issues by God\u2019s grace and all I\u2019m seeking is your support to get the power to do those things to better the lives of Nigerians and to stop insecurity,\u201d Amaechi assured.\n\nOn his part, the Emir of Muri, Alhaji Tafida who described the former Minister as a man with a national stature and outlook, expressed his pleasure to receive Amaechi, who he said was the first Presidential aspirant to visit him.\n\nHe assured Amaechi of his support, stating that he needs not bother about the delegates in Taraba because they would vote for him.\n\n\u201cWithout mincing words, you have seen it all, you have been through the system, you have put up a national outlook in every direction, you are a very patient person and understanding person, you have met most of the qualities required for a perfect President of Nigeria. I wish you the best for the Presidency of Nigeria,\u201d the Emir said.",

Though we thank him, he should do well to listen and save the lives of millions in the North-East, and now, the FCT, Abuja.\n\n\u201cIn the last one year, we have pushed and have been pushed in our quest to ensure that the federal government under President Buhari becomes accountable and ensure that true restructuring, true federalism and quick establishment of a substantive board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). We have been pushed more by the deliberate deaf ears paid to agitations by the President Buhari-led government.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not be cowed and will not stop reminding President Muhammadu Buhari, his anti-Niger Delta collaborators, that the region remained unshaken by our resolve for restructuring, true federalism, immediate establishment of the NDDC board.\n\n\u201cAnd to remind the rising numbers of presidential aspirants and would-be candidates of the various political parties, we will not support any aspirants who will not prioritize the issues of Niger Delta region nor vote for those aspirants from South South in the current administration who have colluded with the government to under-develop our region.\n\n\u201cAdaka Boro, which is the spiritual consciousness of Ijaw liberation which is in the blood of every Ijaw man, awakens us today to speak in unity of purpose for emergence of a South South President that will restructure Nigeria and return the ownership of resources back to the communities. The South South zone has only governed this country for four years during the military era and now. But we have helped in the growth and stability of this country more than any other region.\u201d",

          "text": "Barring any last change of mind, ministers who backed down from their much touted political ambitions on the All Progressives Congress (APC) platform may not return as members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC).\n\nSimilarly, some others who just dropped their resignation following President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s directive that they quit latest Monday (yesterday), may have also lost out to the party guidelines which gives 30 clear days for resignation before the party primaries.\n\nFollowing Buhari\u2019s directive, Minister of Labour and Employment Chris Ngige, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubaka Malami, SAN, Minister of Women Affairs Dame Paulen Tallen and Minister of State Petroleum Timpre Sylva, all made a U-turn on their various political ambitions.While Malami and Tallen were eyeing governorship and senatorial ambitions in Kebbi and Plateau states respectively, Ngige and Sylva aspired to be president, all on the APC platform.\n\nThe U-turn\n\nAt different times, the ministers said they were dropping their ambitions to continue in office, a decision Blueprint gathered, may not work out.\n\nA top presidency source told this medium that \u201cIt is all over for them after the president hosted all the ministers seeking one elective office or the other to a valedictory session. As at Friday, the president has said and declared there is no going back. The ministers are gone for good and won\u2019t continue in office.\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides, the president doesn\u2019t want to be seen as condoning impunity from cabinet members. It is surprising that they could announce their withdrawal from the race all because the president asked them to resign. The thinking out there was that they would contest for the various positions as sitting ministers. Neither the party\u2019s guideline nor the Electoral Act allows for that,\u201d said another source familiar with the development.\n\nBlueprint further gathered that \u201ca governor is already working on a replacement for his minister who is affected under this arrangement.\u201d\n\nOn 30-day notice of resignation\n\nOn the fate of Minister of Transport Rotimi Amaechi; Minister of Niger Delta Affairs Godswill Akpabio, and Minister of Science, Innovation and Technology Ogbonnaya Onu who reigned their appointments after the presidential order, the party\u2019s guidelines may have shut them out.\n\nThey resigned about two weeks to the party primaries, a decision that clearly negates the party guidelines.\n\nSection 3(i) of the APC\u2019s guidelines for the conduct of primaries states: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for the purpose of the nomination of candidates.\n\n\u201cAny political office holder interested in contesting for an elective office shall leave Office 30 days prior to the date of election or party primary for the office sought.\u201d\n\nParty sources told Blueprint that the clause as well as the controversial Section 84(12) of Electoral Act 2022 which also makes it mandatory for elective office seeker to resign 30 days before primaries, may have forced the aspirants to back out.\n\nOf the ministers with presidential aspiration, only Emeka Nwajiuba complied with both the party guidelines and provision of the Electoral Act.\n\nHe was said to have resigned 28th April, exactly 30 days to the May 28/30 date for the party\u2019s primaries.\n\nHowever, some of the appointees seeking elective offices did not beat the 30-day deadline but remained in their offices.\n\nElectoral Act 2022\n\nSection 84(12) of the Electoral Act has similar provision which the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) may wield to apply the sledge hammer on defaulting aspirants, depending on the outcome of the litigation which has crossed the appellate court and now awaits the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\nTallen pushes on\n\nWhile AGF Malami withdrew Saturday from his governorship ambition without any reason, Tallen dumped her ambition to contest for the Plateau South Senatorial District of Plateau state Monday following the presidential directive.\n\nShe relied on the party\u2019s guidelines which gives 30 days to aspirants wishing to seek an elective office to resign their appointments.\n\nWomen groups and other stakeholders had purchased the nomination and expression of interest forms of the APC for the minister.\n\nIn a signed statement made available in Abuja Monday, Tallen stated that following the APC\u2019s guidelines, \u201cit will therefore be a breach to resign office at this time since this was not done ahead of the stipulated timeline.\u201d\n\nShe noted that \u201cNigeria is at a crucial point in history with women\u2019s participation at the lowest ebb with just 6.7% at the Parliament.\u201d\n\nThe minister said she was more committed to seeing a better picture with Nigeria taking its rightful place as the true giant of Africa, and therefore have taken an informed perspective to support more women across all political spheres at this time.\n\n\u201cI would like to thank and assure all my supporters that while their intention was well conceived, my current work in superintending the numerous projects for Mr President as Women affairs Minister require my undivided attention.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, whilst their quest is a good move in support of the clamour for more Women in elective and appointive positions, and considered to be critical in addressing the Gender question, I am compelled to focus on the foundations we have laid towards the advancement and realisation of gender equality in leadership positions in the country,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI remain resolute as I continue to relish the opportunity to serve Nigerian Women in my capacity as Minister of Women Affairs under the able leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR. Consequently, I wish to inform you all that following broad-based consultations and interventions from critical stakeholders, I have decided to withdraw from running for the senatorial seat mindful of our accomplishments and the notable progress we have recorded under my stewardship at the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs.\n\n\u201cI have decided to voluntarily step down from the Senatorial race sequel to the yearnings of Women and other well meaning Nigerians who see the need for a strong voice for Women at the Senate having consulted widely with my family, well-wishers and supporters conscious of the role I play for Women in Nigeria today! So to all Nigerian Women and young girls who have raised concerns as to what next, rest assured that I, Dame Pauline K. Tallen, OFR, KSG have not submitted any resignation letter and therefore, it is my decision not to go ahead with this request but carry on as the Minister of Women Affairs,\u201d the minister further added.\n\nShe noted that \u201cNigeria has a long standing commitment in overcoming the challenges that inhibit Women from bringing about positive changes and the requisite impacts when given a place at the table of decision making, adding that her appointment as the Minister of Women Affairs is indicative of this progress and therefore she cannot lose sight of this opportunity.\u201d\n\nShe added that \u201cthe quest for gender equality and broadening access to enable Women to participate meaningfully in nation building, is at the heart of her desire to unlock the potentials of women to bring about positive change in the history of Nigeria, adding that the values upon which this success rests is most critical, if appreciable, progress is to be made in fulfilling our well conceived gender agenda.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate our modest achievements, we are also conscious of the opportunities and achievements yet to be harnessed for Nigerian Women under this administration. As a humble servant of Nigerian Women, I am overwhelmed by the hard work, courage, patriotism and loyalty displayed by Women and I remain resolute to ride on these foundations to enable us build solid structures to yield strategic progress to add through our history.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

It is being executed through a novel $27.8 million (about N15.5 billion) MSME Revitalization Fund, ensuring that qualified MSMEs can access loans for their business at a single-digit interest rate.

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nAssociation of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON) has developed a roadmap campaign plan needed to save the naira from further decline and enhance exchange rate stability.\n\nThe ABCON National Executive Council said the move to save the naira was agreed by the body at the conclusion of its meeting in Lagos, where it unveiled strategies for save the local currency, bridge the exchange rate gaps and curb volatility in the forex market.\n\nThe naira exchanges at N596 to dollar at the parallel market and N415.83 to dollar at the official market creating a rate gap of N180.17 per dollar.\n\nThe ABCON President, Alhaji (Dr) Aminu Gwadabe said there was urgent need to enhance dollar liquidity in the market and ensure stability of prices in the economy.\n\nThese steps, he said would save the local currency and economy from the impact of election spending that has kept inflation at double digits for a very long time.\n\nThe ABCON boss disclosed that the depreciation of the naira against global currencies was due to pressure from rising dollar demand without sufficient liquidity to meet the demands from retail end users, manufacturers and other key players in the economy.\n\n\u201cThe naira has consistently come under serious pressure due to dollar scarcity making it difficult for forex end users, manufacturers and key industry players to access dollar needed to meet their needs. ABCON under my leadership will continue to encourage our members to play the vital role of closing the exchange rate gaps in the market and reducing widening premium between the parallel market and the official window,\u201d he said.\n\nGwadabe listed several factors that continue to undermine the naira stability and the local currency\u2019s value against other currencies.\n\nThe ABCON boss called for the creation of BDCs\u2019 Autonomous Foreign Exchange Trading Window (BAFEX) with determined maximum daily limit for legible BDCs to access dollars from banks, autonomous market and diaspora forex widow at the prevailing market prices.\n\nHe requested for enhancement of existing BDCs\u2019 automation portals to file transaction returns on CBN/ABCON/NFIU/NIBSS portals for effective regulatory monitoring and supervisions.\n\nGwadabe also sought for the creation of an automation portal to encourage registration of undocumented and unlicensed operators for effective monitoring, identification and tracking of their transactions.\n\nHe said the reluctance of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to open new windows through which foreign exchange can be attracted to the economy remains a key factor in the naira continued fall.\n\nHe said the non-inclusion of BDCs in the list of channels through which diaspora remittances flow to Nigeria, under the CBN\u2019s guidance and regulation, has reduced the volume of dollar inflows to the economy.\n\nAccording to him, the World Bank\u2019s latest Migration and Development Brief showed that Sub-Saharan Africa attracting $49 billion in 2021. The bank said officially recorded remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries are expected to increase by 4.2 per cent this year to reach $630 billion.\n\nGwadabe said Nigeria\u2019s contribution to the remittances fund is expected to rise when BDCs are allowed to receive funds from Nigerians in Diaspora into the economy.\n\nHe said the BDCs are to perform this role through contactless and digitised channels that make collections easy and seamless.\n\nHe said there is urgent need to review the guidelines on BDC\u2019s Scope of Operations to include participation in payment space, such as agency banking, Point of Sale (PoS) services, inbound and outbound forex transfers, ATM Forex services, to reflect global business model practice.\n\nHe suggested that the BDCs should be allowed to access dollars or diaspora remittances through the autonomous forex windows that enable operators to receive IMTOs proceeds, carry out online dollar operations and Point of Sale (PoS) Agency, among others.\n\nGwadabe insisted that now is the time to break the current industry monopoly that puts the remittances market in the hands of few players depriving others from tapping into the plan.\n\nThe ABCON boss also called for the establishment of training institutes to enhance capacity and infrastructure in the industry and broaden players\u2019 business scope with cash-back incentives for those that patronize BDCs while also implementing a less cumbersome and complex documentation requirements for end users.\n\n\u201cThe BDCs should be able to operate a network of digital solutions for PTA/BTA. This would reduce overheads, and improve profitability. Some BDCs might still consider working closer with commercial banks. The ABCON can also be recognized as self-regulatory organization to enable it operate effectively and sanction erring members,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cWe wish to reiterate our resolve to align with the policy thrust of the apex bank and ensure that ABCON members play their roles professionally and strategically in the interest of the market and economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that de-marketing of BDCs by regulators and security agencies is not good for the stability of the market. The suggested the strengthening of over 4,500 BDCs to bring forex closer to the retail end users and boost market liquidity.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has said that with the establishment of world class healthcare facilities in Nigeria, the country was set to become a destination for medical tourism, in addition to reversing the brain drain in the health sector.\n\nMohammed who spoke after a media tour of Duchess International Hospital in Lagos, said the world class healthcare facilities springing up in Nigeria will also curb medical tourism abroad, conserve foreign reserves and create jobs.\n\n\u201cToday, we are here at the Duchess International Hospital. During the guided tour, I am sure you all saw that this is indeed a purpose-built, state-of-the-art, 100-bed hospital, which is aimed at delivering the highest standard of healthcare, using the most advanced technology and treatments to provide Nigerians with the best medical expertise available anywhere in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that according to available records, Nigerians spend between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion on medical tourism annually, a development he described as a huge drain on the country\u2019s foreign reserves.\n\nHe expressed delight that many of the doctors at Duchess International Hospital, a subsidiary of Reddington Hospital, are Nigerians who had\n\ntrained and worked abroad, but who have now decided to return home because of the availability of healthcare facilities with standard equipment and a good work environment.\n\nThe Minister said the Federal Government, through the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Bank of Industry, provided financial support for Duchess International Hospital, as part of its intervention in the health sector.\n\n\u201cThis is not new. Recall that in the wake of Covid-19, the CBN set up the N100 billion Healthcare Sector Intervention Fund, now expanded to N200 billion, to provide credit support for the healthcare sector through long-term, low-cost financing,\u201d he said, listing other interventions by the Federal Government, through the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority, NSIA, as including a total of $22.5 million which was spent in establishing two diagnostic centres in Kano and Umuahia ($5.5 million each) and the NSIA-LUTH Cancer Centre in Lagos ($11.5 million)\n\n\u201cThe essence of these financial interventions and projects in the critical healthcare sector is to fast-track the evolvement of world class healthcare facilities like the Duchess International Hospital.\n\n\u201cWith that, we can conserve our foreign reserves, earn foreign exchange for the country, create jobs, reverse brain drain, become a destination for medical tourists and also ensure affordable and standard healthcare for Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed commended the management of the hospital for making their world class services affordable and accessible to ordinary Nigerians, particularly with the launching of the \u2018World Class Affordable Healthcare Programme that coincided with the visit of the Minister and the over 30 journalists who accompanied him on the tour.\n\n\u201cWith what we have seen here today and the programme that has just been launched, Nigerians can now get access to affordable and world class treatment in whatever is ailing them in many areas, including emergency medicine, women\u2019s health, paediatric care, cardiovascular medicine, kidney dialysis, dental treatment, eye care, etc,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minister said the visit to the hospital was in continuation of the media tour of the development projects of the Buhari Administration, disclosing that in the past 40 days, he had taken the media on a tour of the Dangote Refinery and Petrochemical Project as well as the Dangote Fertilizer Company in Lagos; the Lekki Deep Seaport and the Duchess Hospital, in addition to the tour of road, rail, bridge and other projects across the country.\n\nThe essence of these tours he further explained was to showcase what the present administration has achieved in the various sectors adding that even where the project was private-sector driven, the Federal Government has either provided the enabling environment or, in some cases, supported such projects with funding,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chief Executive Officer of the hospital, Dr. Tokunbo Shitta-Bey, who conducted the Minister round the hospital, said the multi-specialist hospital, which was already attracting foreigners coming for treatment, is poised to make its advanced elite service affordable and accessible to Nigerians, who would pay only N5,000 for registration and 5,000 for consultation.",

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nHALO Financial Services Ltd, a fintech start-up has launched with an innovative approach to help Nigerians manage and grow their money.\n\nSpeaking at a media round table to introduce the company, the Chief Executive Officer and co-founder, Chidimma Onyeokoro disclosed that Halo enables communities to provide financial services to their members. Halo defines a community as any group of people with defined membership and identifiable leadership. This includes professional or trade associations, cooperatives, social clubs, unions, even old boys and girls associations and more. Community members are able to leverage the strength of their union for better financial returns. By focusing on communities, Halo will be able to scale faster.\n\nShe said, \u201cNigerians, have always understood that we progress faster when we do things together. From traditional groups savings schemes like \u2018ajo\u2019, to communities putting money together for community development projects, even friends pooling resources to help one of their squad. There\u2019s strength in numbers. We are using technology to harness that strength to drive wealth creation for individuals through their communities.\u2019\n\nAccording to her, trust is the bedrock of all financial services. By leveraging existing trust networks, Halo will be able to reach more people with the products, tools and knowledge to meet their wealth creation goals.\n\n\u2018One key differentiator for us is that we hold two licenses. We have a micro finance bank license and an asset management license. This allows us to offer a full spectrum of financial services from basic banking to sophisticated investments. It also means we are regulated by both SEC and CBN, so our risk management and corporate governance is very rigorous.\u2019\n\nNoting that the company is keen on serving as many people as possible, she explained that Halo offers multi-channel access. For those comfortable with technology, there is an app, mass market customers can transact with Halo via a nationwide network of agents, and high net worth communities can access a managed service.\n\nShe stated that the fintech space in Nigeria is extremely competitive, so to meet Halo\u2019s very ambitious goals they have built a team of dynamic, knowledgeable, and committed professionals with a deep understanding of market realities, and more importantly, possess the right skills and experience to help communities and their members navigate the financial landscape and reach their goals.",

This is addition to his huge investments in education, agriculture, security and infrastructural developments. The World Bank accountability ranking of states in Nigeria evaluated Kogi as 2nd in 2017, 1st in 2018 and 2019.\n\n\u201cThe draft report for 2021 shows that Kogi scored 100 per cent in all the areas and from indications, the state will maintain the first position in 2021, judging from the draft report that was released just yesterday.\n\n\u201cI am proud of GYB because of his development records in Kogi. This is a governor that is always looking for progress and the development of lives of his people. This is me, a Yoruba, supporting someone from North Central.\n\n\u201cThere is no progress without demands, I lost my both parents, though unfortunately, because Nigerians believed in them. I\u2019ve been working with GYB for a while and I have seen that he has the courage and intelligence to deliver Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShe said as one of the foremost presidential aspirants of the party, Governor Bello had reached out to party stakeholders in nearly all parts of the country, adding that he stands a better chance to clinch the party\u2019s ticket than others.\n\nThe Director-General said, in terms of insecurity, the governor had been able to bring down the crime rates to the barest minimum, adding that through a well crafted management system, he had united all the groups in the multi-ethnic state.\n\nAbiola-Costello said the campaign team of Governor Bello had been interfacing with critical stakeholders of APC to present his development credentials, which would be replicated at the federal level.\n\n\u201cGoing into the presidential primaries, we are on a good footing. If you plant a good seed very early, you will reap better than those who plant late,\u201d she noted.",

          "title": "Online Diary: Buffalo Gunman Plotted Attack for Months",
          "text": "The white gunman accused of massacring 10 Black people at a Buffalo supermarket wrote as far back as November about staging a livestreamed attack on African Americans, practiced shooting from his car and traveled hours from his home in March to scout out the store, according to detailed diary entries he appears to have posted online.\n\nThe author of the diary posted hand-drawn maps of the grocery store along with tallies of the number of Black people he counted there, and recounted how a Black security guard at the supermarket confronted him that day to ask what he was up to. A Black security guard was among the dead in Saturday\u2019s shooting rampage.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe diary taken from the chat platform Discord came to light two days after 18-year-old Payton Gendron allegedly opened fire with an AR-15-style rifle at the Tops Friendly Market. He was wearing body armor and used a helmet camera to livestream the bloodbath on the Internet, authorities said.\n\nHe surrendered inside the supermarket and was arraigned on a murder charge over the weekend. He pleaded not guilty and was jailed under a suicide watch. Federal authorities are contemplating bringing hate crime charges.\n\nCopies of the online materials were shared with The Associated Press by Marc-Andr\u00e9 Argentino, a research fellow at the London-based International Center for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence.\n\nA transcript of the diary entries was apparently posted publicly sometime ahead of the attack. It was not clear how many people might have seen the entries. Experts said it was possible but unlikely the diary could have been altered by someone other than the author.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s top agent in Buffalo, Stephen Belongia, indicated on a call with other officials Monday that investigators are looking at Gendron\u2019s Discord activity, citing posts last summer about body armor and guns and others last month in which he taunted federal authorities. Belongia gave no details in the call, a recording of which the AP obtained.\n\nBut in an April 17 post apparently by Gendron, he exhorted readers to kill agents from the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nMessages seeking comment were left with Gendron\u2019s lawyers. No one answered the door at his family\u2019s home.\n\nThe violence spread grief and anger in Buffalo and beyond.\n\nFormer Buffalo Fire Commissioner Garnell Whitfield Jr., who lost his 86-year-old mother, Ruth Whitfield, in the shooting, asked how the country could allow its history of racist killings to repeat itself.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just hurting. We\u2019re angry,\u201d Whitfield said at a news conference with civil rights attorney Ben Crump and others. \u201cWe treat people with decency, and we love even our enemies.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you expect us to keep doing this over and over and over again \u2014 over again, forgive and forget,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhile people we elect and trust in offices around this country do their best not to protect us, not to consider us equal.\u201d\n\nThe victims also included a man buying a cake for his grandson; a church deacon helping people get home with their groceries; and a supermarket security guard.\n\nThe online diary details a March 8 reconnaissance visit the writer made to Buffalo, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) from Gendron\u2019s home in Conklin, New York.\n\nBuffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said at a news conference that there was information indicating Gendron was in Buffalo in March, but Gramaglia declined to say more.\n\nThe commissioner said numerous investigators are working to obtain and review Gendron\u2019s online postings.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of social that\u2019s being looked at, or that\u2019s being verified, captured,\u201d Gramaglia said. \u201cSome of that takes warrants that have to be served on various social media platforms.\u201d\n\nThe author of the diary talked about checking out targets including the Tops Friendly Market and said a security guard asked what he was doing after his second visit of the day. He gave an excuse about collecting data and soon left \u2014 \u201ca close call,\u201d he wrote.\n\nA 180-page document purportedly written by Gendron said the attack was intended to terrorize all nonwhite, non-Christian people and get them to leave the country. Federal authorities said they are working to confirm the document\u2019s authenticity.\n\nGendron had briefly been on authorities\u2019 radar last spring, when state police were called to his high school for a report that the then-17-year-old had made threatening statements.\n\nBelongia, the FBI agent, said Gendron had responded to a question about future plans by saying that he wanted to commit a murder-suicide.\n\nA December Discord post that Gendron apparently made said he had given that answer to a question about retirement in an economics class and ended up spending \u201cone of the worst nights of my life\u201d in a hospital.\n\nGramaglia said Gendron had no further contact with law enforcement after a mental health evaluation that put him in a hospital for a day and a half. On the call with Belongia, Gramaglia said state police \u201cdid everything within the confines of the law\u201d at that time.\n\nIt was unclear whether officials could have invoked New York\u2019s \u201cred flag\u201d regulation, which lets law enforcement, school officials and families ask a court to order the seizure of guns from people considered dangerous.\n\nFederal law bars people from owning guns if a judge has determined they have a \u201cmental defect\u201d or they have been forced into a mental institution. An evaluation alone would not trigger the prohibition.\n\nAt the White House, President Joe Biden, who planned a visit Tuesday to Buffalo, paid tribute to the slain security guard, retired police officer Aaron Salter.\n\nSalter fired repeatedly at the attacker, striking his armor-plated vest at least once before being shot and killed. Biden said Salter \u201cgave his life trying to save others.\u201d\n\nAuthorities said that in addition to the 10 Black people killed, three people were wounded: one Black, two white.\n\nZeneta Everhart said her son, supermarket employee Zaire Goodman, was helping a shopper outside when he saw a man get out of a car in military gear and point a gun at him. Then a bullet hit Goodman in the neck.\n\n\u201cMom! Mom, get here now, get here now! I got shot!\u201d he told his mother by phone. Goodman, 20, was out of the hospital and doing well Monday, his mother said.\n\nIn livestreamed video of the attack circulating online, the gunman trained his weapon on a white person cowering behind a checkout counter, but said, \u201cSorry!\u201d and didn\u2019t shoot. Screenshots purporting to be from the broadcast appear to show a racial slur against Black people scrawled on his rifle.",

          "text": "Ukraine has confirmed that hundreds of its fighters trapped for more than two months in Mariupol\u2019s Azovstal steelworks have been evacuated.\n\nDeputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said 53 badly wounded soldiers were taken to the town of Novoazovsk, held by Russian-backed rebels.\n\nShe said another 211 were evacuated using a humanitarian corridor to Olenivka \u2013 another rebel-held town.\n\nRussia earlier said a deal had been reached to evacuate the injured troops.\n\nAbout a dozen buses carrying Ukrainian fighters who were holed up beneath the besieged plant were seen leaving the huge industrial site in the southern port city on Monday evening, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nRussian state-run media outlets also posted footage of what they say were injured Ukrainian soldiers being evacuated from Azovstal.\n\nMs Maliar said the troops would be exchanged for captured Russian soldiers.\n\nIn his video address after midnight local time on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukrainian military, intelligence and negotiating teams, as well as the Red Cross and the UN were involved in the evacuation operation.\n\n\u201cUkraine needs its heroes alive,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he cautioned that the Ukrainian troops may not be freed immediately and warned that negotiations over their release will require \u201cdelicacy and time\u201d.\n\nHundreds of Ukrainian soldiers \u2013 the Azov regiment, the National Guard, police and territorial defence units \u2013 as well as a number of civilians have been holed up at the site since advancing Russian troops encircled the southern city in early March.\n\nThe sprawling four-square mile complex is a maze of tunnels designed to survive a nuclear war.\n\nLast month Russian President Vladimir Putin called off a planned assault on the site, citing fears of high Russian casualties.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many people still remain in underground bunkers.\n\nMs Maliar said Ukraine\u2019s military, intelligence, National Guard and Border Service were \u201ccarrying out joint efforts to save\u201d those left behind.\n\nShe also hailed the actions of the plant\u2019s defenders, who she said had \u201cfully accomplished all missions assigned by the command\u201d. But she noted that their position had become untenable after it became \u201cimpossible to unblock Azovstal by military means\u201d.\n\nIn a message posted to Facebook on Monday night, Ukraine\u2019s General Staff called the troops \u201cheroes of our time\u201d and said their efforts had helped Kyiv organise the defence of its southern flank.\n\n\u201cMaintaining their positions at Azovstal, they did not allow the opponent to shift the grouping of up to 17 battalion tactical groups (about 20,000 personnel) to other directions. Thereby hindered the implementation of the plan for the rapid capture of Zaporizhzhia,\u201d military chiefs said in the post.\n\nMeanwhile, the Azov regiment, a National Guard unit which once had strong links to the far right, appeared to confirm that its fighters had agreed in a social media post to lay down their arms.\n\nThe group\u2019s commander, Lt Col Denis Prokopenko said his priority was saving the lives of \u201cas many lives of personnel as possible\u201d.",
