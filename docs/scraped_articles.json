          "text": "The Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, Mahmood Yakubu on Saturday assured Nigerians that the ongoing continuous voter registration would not end on June 30 as earlier announced.\n\nYakubu disclosed this on Saturday during the Youth Vote Count Mega Concert 2.0 organised by the commission in partnership with Yiaga Africa and funded by the European Union at the old parade ground, Abuja.\n\nYakubu, who was silent on the duration of the extension, said the commission would decide on the timeframe and communicate the outcome to Nigerians.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe second thing is you want to know when will this registration end? Is it going to end on the 30th of June in the next five days?\n\n\u201cOn behalf of INEC, let me assure you, e no go end for 30th June for as long as we have you people trying to register to obtain your Permanent Voter Card, we will continue to register you and we will continue to make sure that you get your PVC.\u201d\n\nThe INEC chairman said 14, 000 Nigerians were registered in five days at the venue of the concert.\n\nMahmood assured that the commission would deploy more machines to register Nigerians.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn the place (Old Parade Ground, Abuja), in the last five days \u2013 from Monday to Friday; we have registered over 14, 000 Nigeians in this place alone. In this place, we have 50 voter registration machines.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks ago, we deployed more machines to the states; more machines left yesterday (Friday) and more are leaving today (Saturday). By Monday there will be more machines to register Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe will not stop the registration until we are satisfied that those who wish to register are given the opportunity to do so.\u201d\n\nWhile responding to chants of no rigging from the crowd, the INEC chairman said, \u201cFor those of you who registered on the INEC Result Viewing Portal, you were seeing the results from the polling units on election day in Ekiti State.\n\n\u201cThe Ekiti governorship election was good. Osun is going to be better and 2023 general elections will be the best.\n\n\u201cYour votes will count. But for those who have not yet registered, kindly do so to vote. We promise you your votes will count.\u201d\n\nAmbassador of the European Union to Nigeria and to the Economic Community of West African States, Samuela Isopi, urged Nigerians not to sell their vote.\n\nIsopi said the EU would stand by Nigerians to make Nigeria\u2019s democracy stronger.\n\nShe said, \u201cThis is the start of a great change.\n\n\u201cWe can feel the energy. Nigerians are mobilising and the feeling is that this time they are ready to be the driver of change. You have the power to drive positive change. Get your PVC and use it.\n\n\u201cYour votes will count and make a difference. Don\u2019t give up your power. Don\u2019t sell your votes because if you sell your votes you sell your future.\n\n\u201cGo out and challenge your leaders and stand for your values. This is the way to build democracy, to have better governance and a better Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe EU will stand by you and all Nigerians to make Nigeria\u2019s democracy stronger.\u201d",

          "text": "The European Union Ambassador to Nigeria and the Economic Community of West African States, Samuela Isopi, has said that it is important that the forthcoming elections in the country are \u201cgood, peaceful, credible and transparent.\u201d\n\nIsopi stated this during an interview on AriseTV, on Saturday, which was monitored by our correspondent.\n\nShe stated that the recent \u2018Youths Vote Count\u2019 campaign was a huge success, and a great move to encourage the youth population to participate in the forthcoming polls.\n\nThe campaign was organised by Yiaga Africa, the EU, and other development partners to encourage voter registration and youth participation in the electoral process through music.\n\n\u201cOne of the key points of the recommendations of the European Electoral Observation Mission was the low turnout. When you have a population that is composed of 80%, 70% of young people and you see that the interest for elections is very low and they do not participate, that is a problem, and so we felt, together with INEC and civil society, that we should do something.\n\n\u201cThe message is to remain engaged, and most importantly they have to vote on the day of the election. This is the message today, Don\u2019t sell your vote,\u201d she said\n\nAlthough the Ambassador said that the EU, the USA, Yiaga Africa, and other partners were working to increase voter turnout in the North and the rural areas through other means, she stressed that the internet penetration and the influential status of the performing artistes will go a long way to encourage young people in the rural areas to vote.\n\n\u201cWe are also in partnership with the other partners. For example, the United States is working with the same civil society, YIAGA, to mobilise young people in the rural areas especially young people in the North. Not just music, but other means to reach out to them,\u201d she said.\n\nIsopi also spoke on the effect the 2023 election would have on the West African Sub-region, and added that Nigeria must get it right.\n\n\u201cThe political development in the region is not good for the country and the continent.\n\n\u201cWe want Nigeria to get it right, Nigeria, according to the latest figures I got from INEC, has 80 million registered voters, which is more than all the voters in all of West Africa. It is important that these elections are good, peaceful, credible, and transparent,\u201d",

But they need our backing to do so.

          "title": "Is PDP on auto-pilot mode?",
          "text": "By Tony Iredia\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has served as Nigeria\u2019s main opposition party since she lost the 2015 presidential election.\n\nThe party had previously formed the federal government of the country for 16 years from 1999-2015. Against the backdrop of the failure of the current ruling party, the All Progressives Congress, APC, to meet the expectations of some Nigerians, there were hopes that the PDP might return to power.\n\nBut only last week, one of her activists in my neighbourhood expressed pain that his party was no longer her vivacious self. In his words, \u2018PDP has been on auto pilot mode\u2019 in the last six months.\n\nNo one should misunderstand my friend; he was not referring to the auto pilot system that is used to control the path of an aircraft without a human operator. He was only trying to describe a phenomenon that functions without thinking about what it is doing or without making a conscious effort to act. The rest of our discussions forms the content of this article.\n\n\n\nApart from across-the-nation sentiments about seasonal zoning of political positions, PDP is probably the only party that specifically provides for zoning in her constitution.\n\nSurprisingly, when some of the leaders saw the need to break the provision, they took no step to appropriately amend that aspect of the constitution. Rather they went ahead to throw the presidential election open whereas it was specifically zoned for the 2019 contest.\n\nOf course, clumsy arguments such as calculating the duration of certain office-holders or that zoning was not cast in iron are not viable defences to constitutional breaches. As a way out, the party purported to have set up a zoning committee as if that was a necessary procedure for rotation.\n\nIn addition, it was clear that the unwieldy committee could never have done justice to the subject. At the end of the day, the same area to which it was zoned four years earlier was formally given a chance to participate in the 2023 contest thereby hurting some feelings.\n\n\n\nAs if working to the answer, a decision on zoning was not made until after many aspirants from different zones had been allowed to pay huge sums to procure nomination forms. Everyone knew that the party had gone beyond a level where she could stop persons who already had nomination forms.\n\nUnfortunately, rather than calm frayed nerves, the PDP moved on to the next stage with some injuries that became exacerbated by the election of an aspirant not from the South as canvassed by the majority of PDP governors but from the North.\n\nThe hopes of those who thought the candidate that emerged would take steps to unite the party, were dashed as the naming of the running mate which was expected to be done by the candidate was again subjected to two unnecessary committees.\n\nThe one that was to advise the candidate having found an opportunity to function like 2022 party delegates poorly handled it by making their choice known to the world at large.\n\n\n\nThe second committee which was reportedly set up to screen less than 5 PDP governors who are well-known to themselves and to the candidate was patently unnecessary. All it achieved was to make the energetic Nyesom Wike and his supporters to feel humiliated thereby increasing the number of aggrieved party members.\n\nIt would have been a win-win situation if the candidate had personally handled the subject, by making his choice to the understanding of others. The entire story depicts a new Atiku quite different from the master-strategist I knew as Vice President in the Obasanjo administration.\n\nOne can only hope that some praise singers and hangers-on have not cornered him. Whatever the situation, he needs to quickly take control from the autopilot and stop all those who have a private agenda.\n\n\n\nCandidate Atiku should not allow a repeat of the type of intervention by former Niger State governor Babangida Aliyu which virtually complicated negotiations and unity in the party. As one can see now, such careless talks have widened the gap and turned government house Port Harcourt into Nigeria\u2019s political Mecca that is now open to all politicians who are anxious to woo a hitherto inviolable party man.\n\nAny person who canvasses the idea that Wike is dispensable is working for Atiku\u2019s opponents. The same is true of the argument that the man is ungovernable. He was Chief of Staff to a former governor to whom he showed no insubordination, he was Minister of state for Education without fighting the main Minister.\n\nHe was later mandated to take control of the same Ministry and never gave the president cause for regret. The aggressiveness portrayed by him as governor merely underscores his capacity to fit into every new role.\n\n\n\nThe issues that some party members are using to challenge PDP\u2019s cohesion exceed the candidature of the president and his vice.\n\nA good example of poor handling of party matters is easily seen in how the party performed at the recent Ekiti governorship election. PDP had no business allowing a contentious primary election that drove away Chief Segun Oni to another party while front-runners like Senator Biodun Olujimi who stayed back were pushed into the fringes of the party with suppressed anger.\n\nThe case of Oni was particularly unwise because he had become a sought-for political aspirant in the state. A special report by some analysts had indeed revealed that Oni was more the candidate to beat. This has been confirmed by the fact that he left the PDP to a less-known Social Democratic Party SDP, yet garnered more votes at the election than the PDP candidate.\n\n\n\nTo make matters worse, the national body of the PDP virtually abandoned their candidate during the election. The usual presentation of flag to the party\u2019s candidate was not done just as the practice of a mega rally a few days before the election to boost the chances of the party and invigorate her members did not also happen.\n\nThere was an unconfirmed rumour during the election that a grant from the party headquarters to the state branch was not delivered in full making state party executives to return the money. Even if the only interest of the PDP is next year\u2019s presidential election, it is obvious that the party\u2019s candidate can only do well in Ekiti if the state branch is viable.\n\nPDP\u2019s lukewarm posture seems to confirm the charge that she is on autopilot mode. This becomes more obvious when it is realized that APC\u2019s Bola Ahmed Tinubu that the PDP mocks as weak put up a strong showing along with governors of the party from different states who added ample elegance to the mega rally of the eventual winner of the election.\n\nIt is obvious that all is not well with the PDP.\n\nFor example, some members from the Southern zones may work against the interest in the party if the North schemes to hold-on to both the presidential candidate and national party chairmanship positions. Already some leaders in the South are waiting anxiously for Iyorcha Ayu to step down as he once promised now that the North has produced the presidential candidate.\n\nThis has to be resolved without delay if the PDP wants a united national party. It makes very little sense to continue to argue that such primordial issues are no longer relevant in a multi-ethnic and multi-religious entity like Nigeria where now and again, centrifugal forces keep stretching the nation to breaking point.\n\n\n\nAtiku Abubakar must rise up now to save his party if he intends to successfully wrestle power from the incumbent APC. On the basis of first things first, he has to remove his party from autopilot mode and take control of fence-mending to create a formidable team by stopping pockets of crises.\n\nFor instance, although the government of Edo state was formed by the PDP in 2020, the party has since remained an atomistic entity that is permanently at war with itself. But if however, the PDP is complacent about taking over government at the federal level in 2023 she should endeavour to at least help deepen Nigeria\u2019s democracy by remaining a daunting opposition that can put the ruling party on its feet.",

Tambuwal\u2019s commitment to boosting education through various initiatives is on track as evidenced by the success stories shared by these fresh medical graduates.\n\nThis strategy has also been responsible for the repositioning of the medical profession as well as bridging the gap of manpower in the health sector.\n\nThis is coming a week after Tambuwal approved the release of N1,000,000,000 for the payment of registration fees and upkeep allowances to the sponsored state students both within and outside the country.\n\nThe approved fund included N188.5 million for the payment of registration fees to 5,643 state students in Sokoto State University (SSU), N312.9 million for 7,096 students in Usmanu Danfodiyo University (UDUS), $89,100 and \u00a315,000 for tuition and upkeep allowances of some regular students in various institutions in London, Canada and other countries.\n\nOthers include $570,000 equivalent to (N342,000,138) for the payment of tuition and upkeep allowances for both new students studying various medical courses in the Republic of Sudan.\n\nGovernor Tambuwal also approved the redeployment of the evacuated Ukraine students to other countries and assigned top government officials to travel to Sudan, Egypt and Turkey so as to ascertain the best institutions as part of preparation for their redeployment.\n\nThe Tambuwal\u2019s educational innovation extends beyond the health sector as it recently championed the sponsorship of three Sokoto State indigenes to study two-year standard Pilot course at the International Aviation College Ilorin, Kwara state.\n\nTheir tuition and upkeep allowances will gulp N42.1m during the period.",

          "title": "Generational responsibility to salvage the Nigerian Civil Service The Nation Newspaper",
          "text": "The reform and transformation of the public service system in Nigeria is essentially unfinished. Consequently, the urgency of the reform of the system is caught between two imperatives. The first is the unfolding dynamics of the Fourth Industrial Revolution around which the good governance of any state is securely tied. All good governance frameworks require the operational capacity generated by new technologies to become efficient. The public service is not least in this regard. The second imperative is democratic. One significance of democracy is to empower the citizens. Indeed, democratic governance demands the efficiency of a capacitated public service to deliver the dividends that will transform the lives of the citizens.\n\nOne aspect of the elements of public service reform that I want to stress in this contribution has to do with relationship between the public administration professional community and the reform of the civil service system. The argument is that the community of service and practice has a fundamental role to play\u2014indeed carries a burden of generational responsibility\u2014in resuscitating the public service as a professional calling. Let me elaborate. After many years of consistent reform efforts, bad implementations and lack of constant political will to carry reform implementation through to its logical conclusion, the public service system still remains in a near comatose state of dysfunction. Its thriving bureaucratic culture has denied the profession of its vocational reputation. In the Nigerian public service, practically anything goes! The sense in which the system has been invaded by mediocre and charlatans with a strange and confounding mission and work culture which keep running down the vocational capital of the system. The system has unfortunately traded its professionalism for rent-seeking in the context of the politics that the Nigeria plays with the destiny of her citizens to be discerning enough to see the extent of degeneracy and rot.\n\nIf we do a reality check, the overwhelming and incontestable evidence that condition public perception of public administration is that neither can government get the work of development done, nor are public institutions working. And the proliferation of private educational institutions, private security service providers, electricity distribution companies, etc. affirm this pervasive theory. Apart from the fact that government has gotten used to delivering on its policies and programs through a task force approach, and at that with the technical support of policy experts and consultants, governments, and indeed the public service, tend to look at implementation and service delivery as an afterthought, rather than as policy priority. This whole coping mechanism, and dependence by government on management consultants, think tanks and policy experts who deploy predominantly industry tested techniques and diverse concepts-rooted management tools to drive implementation dynamics and change management has certainly become an issue which require the public service to deepen institutional capacity for learning and skills transfer.\n\nThe point here is that whereas there is no lack of ideas and expertise, but most of those inputs provided by consultants, without insider-experts collaboration, do hardly translate into deep enough contents and solutions to address first-hand, the issues and problems which governments in Nigeria are seeking for solution. Sadly, MDAs, in turn, lack appropriate skills to use these universal frameworks nor do they have overarching theory of change to guide the functional integration of the new tools, techniques and shared experiences and learning in the dynamics of MDAs\u2019 programme and project management. Thus, making alignment between plans, strategies and implementation to be at best ad hoc, fragmented and incoherent\n\nThe bureau-pathology of the system has been deepened by the substitution of instant or immediate reward, deriving from the undermining of public service principles and rules, for deferred gratification. The virtue of public service has been eroded by the need to make ends meet through corrupt means. This inevitably created the deep-seated moral deficit in work culture that supports the dysfunctional cultural fixation at the root of bureaucratic corruption. And it inevitably increases the degeneration of the value framework that upholds a selfless profession. Existential concerns to make ends meet instigate public servants to undermine the legacy potentials of a system that ought to be the bulwark of democratic governance. It is therefore so easy to see how the public service, through government and politicians\u2019 reductionist thinking, could be politicized so much to the point of being mere lines and graphs in organizational and governance charts. In other words, no matter the earnest efforts of the government to reform the system, its dysfunction keeps solidifying.\n\nAlbert Einstein once remarked that \u201cthe world as we created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.\u201d To recuperate the vocational essence of the public service, as essentially a spiritual calling\u2014a professional space where only those with the training, orientation and discipline to create public value alone should be found\u2014then, there is the need for out-of-the-box reflection that targets the communities of service and practice, and task them on how we got to where we are as a profession, and what we need to do to renegotiate the future.\n\nThe public service is founded on a deep understanding of public-spiritedness. This is a virtue that differentiates the profession from a mere career trajectory. It renders the public service as a calling devoid of instrumental thinking or the vagaries of market dynamics. Public-spiritedness situates the responsibility of the public servant within the ambit of public accountability, and instigates her to an efficient, effective and equitable management of the civil service system. As an ethical frame, the public spirit ensures that the civil servant is not so preoccupied with the technical details of her responsibilities to the exclusion of their human concerns and the public trust. It is this deep-seated professional and vocational virtue that has been badly eroded. Most Nigerians now believe that the civil servants are the most corrupt professionals in the country. The profession therefore requires a fundamental rebranding and reprofiling through significant reform to increase its IQ, restore the public service cherished values and ethics, meritocracy-propelled professionalism and its stewardship relationship with the public\u2014the very reason for its existence as a profession and management\u2014if it would ever regain its prestige as the guardian of the democratic governance codes, institutional memory and continuity in governance.\n\nWhat are we doing to harness our collective strengths as bureaucrats, academics, researchers, development workers to give our profession the future it deserves? This question becomes important given the near-absence of any gatekeeping capacity for public administration and the public service in Nigeria. As one of the professions in Nigeria without a professional body charged with the responsibility of setting standards, maintaining codes of practice and keeping the intellectual contents of its knowledge pack at the cutting-edge of global administrative and governance developments, the public service is abjectly left without any institutional integrity that protects its sacred calling from infiltrators. The profession that the administrative pioneers built with so much candour, sacrifice, foresights and energy has thus been transformed into what will make them turn in their grave.\n\nThis is the challenge, precisely. At independence, the public service was handed to Nigeria as a colonial legacy that could assist in the task of nation-building. The generations of pioneers and forebears who laid the foundation for this profession\u2014Simeon Adebo, Jerome Udoji, Sule Katagum, Allison Ayida, Joseph Imoukhuede, Samuel Manuwa, Augustus Adebayo, and many more, struggled not only to retain the ethical and professional codes of the vocation, they handed over to us a formidable instrument for good governance (think about the great infrastructural transformation of the old Western Region, for instance), what excuse will this generation of public servants have for resting on our oars? What would we count as our institutional and administrative legacies? What, in other words, will be the civil service that we will be able to trumpet as the embodiment of our collective professional oversight for the coming generation to assess? What, with all the advantages of intellectual and professional education, creative and disruptive technologies, and the competences necessitated by the knowledge age we operated, will our generation be remembered for as our significant contribution to a profession with an undeniable future, relevance and possibilities?\n\nThe first pioneering generation of public administrators and public servants had a sense of the enormity of the task ahead of them, and saw the significance of communities of service and practice as the context within which they could channel their collective efforts. This was the reason for the emergence of the National Association for Public Administration and Management (NAPAM) as a gatekeeping structure. It was clear to them that without a body that guards the cherished values and virtues of the professional, the task ahead would be daunting, if not impossible. NAPAM is meant to be the backbone for a community of practice that allows practitioners, students and scholars of public administration to share experience on the nature, challenges and future of administration in Nigeria. But with NAPAM dead and buried, vast and formidable body of public administration practitioners, scholars, researchers and development workers are left without a structural collective to channel their thoughts and action plans on the reform of the system and the profession. At a critical level, the gatekeeping responsibility of NAPAM involves a deep reflection on the image of public administration in Nigeria. This is defined by the need for a fundamental cultural change that will transform attitudinal and behavioral of public servants, which is the first step towards reinfusing the public service with the sense of public-spiritedness and professionalism that could deliver efficiency and productivity.\n\nGiven the critical nature of the gatekeeping imperative towards reprofiling the public service brand, it becomes urgent for the convening of a public service reform conference. Let us take this as the first leg in not only the jumpstarting of the communities of service and practice to their urgent responsibility to public administration, but also opening up the space of administrative reform of the public service system beyond the public servants themselves. The conference will be broad-based not only in its composition but also objectives, ranging from a panoramic survey of past reform efforts, to a deep diagnosis of the dysfunctional dynamics of the public service and public administration in Nigeria, to multifaceted discourses on the directions for transformation. One critical objective of the conference is an animated discussion on the role of a national integrity system (NIS) as the framework within which to solidify institutional integrity, not just of the civil service, but all public services. The NIS constitutes a strategic structural framework for safeguarding important institutional reform and values, especially against the scourge of bureaucratic and political corruption. It facilitates a wide-ranging transformation of the work culture, grounded in a national value dynamic, which will check the tradition of immediate gratification which leads public servants to undermine public service efficiency and growth capabilities.\n\nThe conference should serve as the marching order for the resuscitation and functional imperative of NAPAM and other communities of service and practice. This should include other platforms like the Conference of Retired Permanent Secretaries, states\u2019 equivalent associations for heads of service, the academics and public administration scholars, researchers and department worker to initiate required conversation that will help us to regain the soul of the Nigerian civil service and reshape the future of the profession. This is the urgent imperative if the labor of our national and administrative heroes and heroines will not be in vain.\n\nThe vision and strategy for where we want the civil service to be in the foreseeable future are not hard to craft. What is difficult is the will to push the vision to its logical conclusion by implementing its roughest details. Indeed, most visions have died because they had no good soil in reality to aid their survival. Going forward therefore, a key feature of new direction to transform the public service\u2019s business model is applying corporate governance principles and structural changes to align operations to the growing frontiers of technology and e-governance, while at once mainstreaming new tools and techniques to reprofile MDAs\u2019 standard operating systems as whole-of-government transformation initiatives.\n\nAs part of instituting a new productivity paradigm in Nigeria therefore, there is the compelling need to take more serious the whole issues of policy implementation i.e., MDAs\u2019 institutional capability readiness and result-orientation towards overall progress in the achievement of outcomes \u2013 financial and performance reporting, better annual reports, bottom-line reporting, quality of services reporting, outcome reporting, state of the public service reporting \u2013 much more than ever before. Besides, governments should no more be satisfied with mere reporting of efforts \u2013 motion without movement \u2013 to reform the public service and to transform it as pronounced at publicized events and through press statements. Rather, it should seek a cultural renewal in the public service and a rekindling of a sense of serving the public that is rooted in social compact-enhanced stewardship that is measurable and evidence-based. Capacity of public servants must be built to better understand and manage transaction costs, manage the different forms of risks in policy implementation; deploy capacity to better evaluate outcomes and to be savvy in managing collaborative partnerships and synergies like PPPs, and for better relationship management. They also need to be more skilled in tracking and managing projects when they drift from the intentions of government and objectives of policy.\n\nThe emergence of the twenty-first century public service manager involves arming public managers with new competences that allow them to manage old and the news skills required to manage the new workplace and workforce. Beyond instituting a new performance management culture, the public service must develop a corporate governance policy in managing the expanding frontiers of public sector contractual relationships \u2013 grants to non-profit organizations, social impact bonds, PPPs. Making it urgent for the administrative leadership in the civil service to build required commercial, legal and regulatory skills to design and manage complex projects, skills for knowledge management and sharing, the incubation of social innovation around open government partnerships, training issues around results, citizens engagement through social media, crowdsourcing, ethnography, opinion research, branding and user data analytics. Essential to this new strategic intelligence central to the transformation in the nature of government which subscribing to Open Government Partnership enables. The public service should deepen institutional capability to utilize the fundamental benefits of the public-private partnership framework to strengthen its capability readiness to take on governance and policy challenges.\n\nTransiting the public service to the next level in its change agenda demands serious work where all hands\u2014political and bureaucratic\u2014must be on deck. Whatever stage a public service system gets to in its administrative transformation, there is always more reform to be done to get the system always ready for more challenges, and the tasking demands of democratic governance.\n\n(Being excerpt from the 2022 African Public Service Day Lecture Delivered at, the Commemorative Event Organized by the Ekiti State Government and, to Celebrate the Retiring Head of Service, Mrs. Peju Babafemi, on Thursday, 23rd of June, 2022 in Ado Ekiti)",

          "title": "Reviewing Prof. Bala\u2019s tenure in FUTMINNA The Nation Newspaper",
          "text": "A five-year single tenure of Prof. Abdullahi Bala as the seventh Vice Chancellor of Federal University of Technology, Minna (FUTMINNA) is gradually coming to a glorious crescendo in conformity with the popular saying that every beginning must have an end. Prof. Bala was appointed in 2017 to lead the specialized institution to higher heights with his academic and administrative acumen, having towered above other candidates at the interview.\n\nWithout doubts, Prof. Bala has not only improved the lot of the University with various achievements recorded in all areas, he has sufficiently proved his mettle as a leader with the fear of Allah as he is leaving with his head held high, clean conscience without any abandoned capital project despite myriad of challenges including paucity of funds. One of the pillars of his strength since he became VC has been the culture of his transparency.\n\nProf. Bala radiates peacefulness of mind. Irrespective of any circumstance, he largely remains unruffled. Nothing intimidates him. Prof. Bala never bothers about the trappings of power. He is not given to tooting his own trumpet. Yet, his temper constitutes the template for enviable conduct as he is always on his best behaviour in all situations. Prof. Bala is ever constantly seeking an unbeaten path to tread and unusual course to chart, to the extent that he has thus elevated the university campus to a place of scientific information, reformation, innovation and transformation.\n\nMore strikingly is the culture of broad consultations he introduces to the university administration. He encourages all stakeholders including students, staff members, parents, alumni, traditional rulers, host community to make contributions to his policies, thus, promoting sense of belonging and inclusiveness. No wonder there has been peaceful coexistence in the university since he assumed office.\n\nHere is a man who pays unscheduled visits to various Centres, Departments and Directorates so as to deracinate the workers of lame ducking. As much as he wants maximum comfort for the University workers, he is never at home with people who are bereft of sure footedness in their duties. Following deep-rooted lethargy in the system, the VC has developed all kinds of therapy to prevent inherent atrophy in the university. In his determined effort to get the best from every worker and lift the system higher than he met it, Prof. Bala has not only been proactive, he has been innovative.\n\nIn a letter of commendation by the Education Minister, Malam Adamu Adamu dated 15 May, 2019, Prof. Bala was applauded for ensuring peace among all stakeholders in the university including council members, maintenance of academic standards and quality of graduates as well as issuance of certificates on the day of convocation. This letter eloquently testifies to the quality of leadership Prof. Bala has brought to FUTMINNA.\n\nWitty and humorous, the Prof. Bala proves that he is familiar and conversant with every issue, having done his home work thoroughly. There is hardly any issue that catches him napping. He is always a step ahead. An attribute of a prepared leader you may say. To those who asked him to give them fish, he is always ready to teach them how to fish.\n\nAgain, from various interactions one has had with him, it is obvious that Prof. Bala is a man of irresistible influence with a rich possession of people management skill. This attribute must have accounted for his ability to hold his administrative team players in synergy. There is no crack in the wall of their unity while they treat one another with mutual respect.\n\nOne of the legacies Prof. Bala is leaving behind as he rounds off his tenure is his dedication to the completion of all projects. As earlier said, he is not leaving behind abandoned projects. Of interest to this writer is his efforts in the construction and the provision of building complexes to enable the relocation to Gidan Kwano campus of additional Schools. His efforts to institutionalize Public Private Partnership which can pave ways for more hostels for the students is highly commendable.\n\nHowever, when it comes to discipline, Prof. Bala does not take nonsense. As jocular as he may appear to be, he is also firm and decisive regarding rules and regulations. Under his stewardship, the university developed its Sexual Harassment Policy to respond to Gender Based issues and sexual misconduct. Early in 2020, the VC set up the Sexual Harassment Policy Implementation Committee charged with prevention and response to sexual and gender- based issues. The Committee is really working as the case of sexual harassment is minimal on campus.\n\nBy and large, Prof. Bala has done quite well in the last five years. He deserves a national recognition for serving meritoriously. He could be given another national assignment to do more as the reward of hard work is an opportunity to do more.\n\nProf. Bala, is a consummate researcher of international repute with over 30 years of scholarship experience. He is a superb mentor who has made tremendous contribution to expanding the pool of indigenous scholars and professionals in the field of Soil Science and Land Management in Nigeria. He was born in Suleja, Niger State, on March 27, 1967. He attended Dawaki Primary School, Suleja from 1973 to 1979 emerging as the overall best student. He had his secondary education at the famous Federal Government College, Minna from 1979 to 1984. He also emerged as the best graduating student with a distinction in the General Certificate of Education (GCE) O\u2019Level.\n\nA First-class graduate of the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Prof Abdullahi Bala is also an alumnus of the University of Reading and the University of London, the UK where he obtained his Master\u2019s and Ph.D. degrees respectively with distinctions. May God continue to give Nigeria quality men to mount the leadership positions. Prof. Bala remains a huge honour and pride.",

          "title": "Britain\u2019s Rwanda Shame: Growing anti-migrants\u2019 image? The Nation Newspaper",
          "text": "Britain is fast losing its credential as a human rights defender and promoter. Through a raft of questionable policies and avoidable scandals, successive governments are doing more harm to the country\u2019s reputation than any hostile country could manage. The recent decision by the Boris Johnson\u2019s government to send refugees to Rwanda is, frankly, reprehensible. As if this isn\u2019t enough, the Home Office announced that it will now electronically tag new arrivals seeking asylum. This criminalisation of other human beings, whose only offence, in some cases, is fleeing political persecution and civil conflicts, is immoral and utterly shameful.\n\nIn spite of Britain\u2019s role in the transatlantic slave trade and its history of imperial conquest (there are only 22 countries in the world that have never been invaded or colonised by Britain), it has managed to whitewash its sordid past with good deeds. It led the global abolitionist movement, banned the trade in slaves in 1807 and completely outlawed slavery across the British empire with the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833\u2014the United States\u2019 emancipation proclamation that freed slaves was not until 1863. Britain even used its formidable naval power, often at great cost to its naval officers, to patrol international waters and to enforce the ban.\n\nThe country also has a history of contributing to international human rights legislation. The Magna Carta, a royal charter detailing liberties and political rights has inspired international human right laws. The drafting of the European Convention on Human Rights was largely supervised by a British man, Sir David Maxwell Fyfe. The country was also the first to ratify the Convention in 1951. Ironically, like a petulant child, it now rails against the same convention and threatens to withdraw from it because the European Court of Human Rights has ruled against its policies.\n\nThe truth is that the Rwanda policy is not completely out of character. It is a restatement of the \u2018Hostile Environment Policy\u2019 that former prime minister, Theresa May, pushed as Home Secretary. In May 2012, Theresa May granted an interview where she explicitly claimed that the aim of the new policy was to \u201cgive illegal migrants a really hostile reception.\u201d That policy heralded a culture change within and outside the institutions of government. Within government, there was an overzealous effort to be seen as tough on immigration and to attract more right-leaning voters.\n\nUnsurprisingly, such efforts inevitably culminated in the Windrush scandal that made illegals out of legal residents. Generations of decent and hardworking Caribbeans who came to the country at the behest of the British government between 1948 and 1971 to fill post-war labour shortages were harassed out of the country because of a government\u2019s politicisation of immigration to improve its electoral chances. The same hostile environment policy was behind the shameful stop and search of \u2018suspected\u2019 immigrants on the streets of London in the 2010s. Of course, it was black and brown people who were often targeted as \u2018suspected\u2019 immigrants.\n\nMore ignoble actions followed, including the \u2018go home or face arrest\u2019 adverts on buses and vans in boroughs dominated by minority groups. Immigration enforcement did not happen only on the streets, it was brought into people\u2019s homes. The government weaponised anti-immigration sentiments by co-opting ordinary citizens and imploring them to \u2018double\u2019 as immigration control officers. For instance, landlords were expected to determine the legal status of their tenants or face severe fines. It is not shocking that such overtly racist and deeply problematic policies have fed into public consciousness with several surveys indicating a rise in racism in the United Kingdom in recent years. A report by the lInstitute for Public Policy Research declared that the \u2018hostile environment policy fostered racism\u2019 and encouraged discrimination.\n\nWho can forget that at the height of the migrant crisis in 2015, a few days after 800 refugees lost their lives off the coast of Libya, Katie Hopkins, a prominent columnist in the UK, compared migrants to cockroaches. Where previously one thought that these policies and rhetoric were isolated and did not reflect the true image of Britain, with the Rwanda decision, there is now little doubt this is the new image of Britain. Britain appears less concerned about living up to its reputation as a country that traditionally upholds and promotes human rights. It increasingly focuses on policies that pander to sections of the society that are avowedly anti-migrants.\n\nThe Rwanda policy is morally dubious not only because it criminalises people seeking refuge, but also because it overstates the scale of the responsibility that countries like Britain bear and outsources the international obligations they hold. Supporters of the initiative argue that without such policies to discourage refugees, developed countries would inevitably be overrun by \u2018hordes of human caravan\u2019 seeking protection. The infrastructure would experience severe strain. Such arguments do not stand up to scrutiny. In the first place, poorer countries shoulder greater responsibilities for refugee resettlement. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 4 out of 5 refugees stay in the region of displacement and seek protection in neighbouring countries. It is why Turkiye (formerly Turkey) hosts more than 3.8 million refugees (most of them from Syria), and why there are more than 1.5 million refugees in Uganda.\n\nThe irony is that states like Britain that have done the barest minimum in taking in refugees are outsourcing responsibilities. In the year ending September 2021, Britain resettled only 1,171 individuals seeking protection. It is unconscionable that Rwanda, a country more densely populated than Britain is being seduced by the promise of slush funds.\n\nAs the post Brexit era begins in earnest, Britain must be reminded that what has always been attractive about it is the promise that human rights are important enough to be promoted and protected. Openly disparaging its human rights record and reputation will not win it friends or consolidate its global leadership. If the government is as keen to expand and deepen its relationship with the global south as it professes, then it must reverse this ill-advised Rwanda policy that portrays it unfavourably and undermines its global image as a truly welcoming society.",

          "text": "A fresh battle appears to be brewing between former President Olusegun Obasanjo and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, ahead of the 2023 presidential election.\n\nObasanjo, in a scathing remark yesterday, said he made a mistake picking Atiku as his running mate for the 1999 election.\n\nHe said it was one of the many genuine mistakes he has made in the course of his public life.\n\n\u201cOne of the mistakes I made was picking my Number Two when I wanted to become the president,\u201d Obasanjo told students from select secondary school students that participated in the final of the National Exhibition and Awards organised by Students for the Advancement of Global Entrepreneurship (SAGE) in Abeokuta, Ogun State.\n\nHe added: \u201cBut because it was a genuine mistake, God saved me.\u201d\n\nAlthough the former president did not mention his former right-hand man by name in the statement, Atiku was his running mate in that election and that of 2003 before their relationship went sour.\n\nAnother costly mistake Obasanjo said he made, was not taking seriously a warning he got from an American ambassador that the late military head of state, General Sani Abacha, was planning to arrest him.\n\nHis words: \u201cWhen Abacha wanted to arrest me, I was told by the American ambassador that they would arrest me and that America had asked that I should be given an asylum.\n\n\u201cI said no. It could have been a mistake because I could have lost my life.\n\n\u201cI will say there are many things that could have been a mistake but God saved me from them all.\u201d\n\nHe wondered how Nigerian youths could assume leadership positions in various cadres of governance when those contesting elective offices in the forthcoming 2023 general elections are largely septuagenarians.\n\n\u201cAnother thing inhibiting the youth from running is the amount of money involved in going into politics. I hope that things should not continue like this.\n\n\u201cI was 39 years old when I became the military head of state.\n\n\u201cTwenty years later, I came back as civilian president, but those there now do not want to allow the youths.\n\n\u201cIf things continue like this, I do not know how you can come in,\u201d he said.\n\nOn religious tolerance, he advised the youth not to see their own religion as superior to that of another person.\n\nObasanjo said: \u201cI have no right to say what another man believes in is inferior to mine.\n\n\u201cIf God had wanted all of us to be of the same religion, he would have made it so. And since He did not make it so, no person should attempt to make it so.\n\n\u201cYoung people should learn at a very early age in life that if there are five religions in the world, that is how God wants it to be. If there are 10, that is how God wants it. All religions originated from the same source.\n\n\u201cIf you are a Muslim and you do not live the way God wants you to live, you cannot enter Aljannah (Paradise). If you are a Christian and you do not live the way God wants you to live, the same thing, you will not enter Paradise.\n\n\u201cIf the basis of religion is doing the right thing for the benefits of mankind, you don\u2019t have to condemn any person because of what he believed.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that any religion is superior to mine, and I don\u2019t believe that mine is superior to another person\u2019s belief.\n\n\u201cI will not allow any person to cast aspersions on my religion and will not do same to another person. Practice your religion the way God wants you to do it and don\u2019t condemn another person.\u201d\n\nObasanjo had in an earlier brutal assessment of Atiku, said he would not have had any second thought making Atiku his successor if he had \u201cbeen a loyal, faithful, dutiful and committed second-in-command.\u201d\n\nRecalling how he settled for Atiku as his running mate in the 1999 election, the former president said: \u201dI considered all candidates that were available and what I knew about them. I had earlier collected information about some to beef up my knowledge of them.\n\n\u201cThat night, I settled for Atiku Abubakar. Some of the reasons were: he worked hard for the project; he never indicated interest in the job to me; he had worked closely with Shehu Yar\u2019Adua and Shehu never passed any adverse comment on him; he had been elected as a governor, which already put him on the pedestal to move up politically, but he had been short-changed in the election that would have put M.K.O. Abiola in power, and he seemed to have some national outreach.\u201d\n\nStill on his assessment of Atiku, Obasanjo in his memoirs, My Watch, said: \u201cFor instance, until later, when a distinguished chief from Bauchi pointed out to me the value of pedigree queried Atiku\u2019s pedigree and blamed me for making a wrong choice.\n\n\u201cI did not pay attention to Atiku\u2019s parental background. Furthermore, until all efforts to help Atiku change had failed \u2013 having stumbled upon a report of inquiry carried out on him \u2013 I asked one of my predecessors why he did not inform me of how bad the report was and he said that he thought I knew.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThis was a man I wanted to dismiss and jail but for the intervention of Shagaya and Shehu Yar\u2019Adua. I took him at face value.\n\n\u201cHowever, if his appointment was an error, I fully accepted responsibility for the genuine mistake.\n\n\u201cAnd knowing all that I discovered about him, what would have been an unpardonable mistake and sin against God would have been to foist him on Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMy mistake was containable and it was contained\u2026\n\n\u201cAs I moved on with my programmes for the second term, I had no clear indication about who would succeed me.\n\n\u201cIf Atiku had been a loyal, faithful, dutiful and committed second-in-command, I would not have doubted. After all, I picked him purposely for that in mind.\n\n\u201cWhat informed my position was the question my Chaplain, Rev. (Dr.) William Okoye, asked in the beginning of May 2006 about who I had anointed to succeed me, since we were almost one year away to the election. I told him no one yet. He was curious but he believed me.\n\n\u201cWe moved on as all sorts of clouds started to gather around Atiku if not at home, surely in the US, with his newly acquired wife to complete his total Nigerian husband outlook. \u2013 Yoruba, Hausa, Fulani and Igbo wives. Here, he achieved Federal character.\n\n\u201cIn addition, he acquired indiscriminately chieftaincy titles all over the country.\n\n\u201cBy 30 May, I told Revd. Okoye at a morning devotion session in my residence that I wanted to embark on one month fasting and praying in June for God to show us (PDP) how to proceed in getting a successor candidate. He joined me in the fasting and prayer with some other members of the Red Carpet Prayer Group.\n\n\u201cWithin three weeks of our fasting and praying, we received a letter dated 22 June, 2006 written by the US Department of Criminal Justice Office of International Affairs, which was brought to me by Nuhu Ribadu, the Head of EFCC, requesting us to investigate a number of Nigerians for suspicion of criminal activities in the US.\n\n\u201cAtiku Abubakar\u2019s name was among the names sent to us. Up to that time, EFCC had enjoyed a close cooperation and collaboration with law enforcement agencies in the UK and the USA.\n\n\u201cI gave the green light to Nuhu for the investigation as requested by the US Authorities. He carried out the investigation and forwarded his report to the US. The report was a bit uncomfortable and unsavoury for Atiku and his associates.\n\n\u201cI thought it was bad enough that the Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria was under investigation for corruption, when my Administration had made fighting corruption one of its cardinal objectives.\n\n\u201cAs it turned out, the investigation in Nigeria and in the US led to Atiku\u2019s house being searched by the US Bureau of investigation (FBI), the arrest and detention of his newly married wife, Jennifer.\n\n\u201cShe was also declared wanted at one time. It was so embarrassing for our Administration and Embassy in Washington under Ambassador George Obiozor.\n\n\u201cI believed that Atiku, for reasons not unconnected with the investigation, ceased from going to the US and put up his expensive house in an exclusive area of Washington DC for sale.\n\n\u201cHe bought the house early in our administration, and I blamed him for his poor judgement, though he tried to justify it by saying that he sold a smaller one to buy a bigger one; all the same, the timing was wrong. Congressman Jefferson eventually went to jail.\n\n\u201cWhat that request for investigation from the US did was start a process of elimination in the transition process. Since Atiku did not raise or discuss any issue concerning his matter in America with me except what I read in the local and foreign newspapers and reports, I did not ask him about anything.\n\n\u201cBy then, I had come to know Atiku for his connivance in covering up and not being straightforward on matters requiring truth and candour.\n\n\u201cOn a number of occasions, I had told him to his face that I saw him differently from Shehu Yar\u2019Adua, who was partly his political mentor and my second-in-Command during my military administration.\n\n\u201cShehu would never lie to me. Atiku would look at me in the face and say no when the answer should be yes. I found it curious and inexplicable.\n\n\u201cAfter I had confronted him on a number of occasions, inviting my Chief of Staff, Abdul Mohammed, to witness by joining the two of us to iron out some of his dubious actions; after I reported him to his father-n-law, the Lamido of Adamawa, I gave up on him.\n\n\u201cHe believed that denigrating me with his battery of media men and women was the surest way to succeeding me. I wished him well and moved on.\n\n\u201cSometime in the fourth quarter of 2004, an associate of Atiku came to my residence at the Aso Villa from Atiku\u2019s official residence. He felt uncomfortable and I tried to make him feel at ease.\n\n\u201cThen, he settled to tell me the story of what had just transpired in Atiku\u2019s residence. I listened with rapt attention.\n\n\u201cHe went on to say that Atiku told him that for him to become the President of Nigeria, the 2007 elections were only a formality.\n\n\u201cThe seven ingredients he needed for his enthronement were already in his hands. He controlled the National Assembly because both the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives were in his pocket. He controlled twenty-eight out of thirty-six governors. He had control of the media. His influence over the judiciary was overwhelming.\n\n\u201cWhat he needed was foreign endorsement, and for that, he had employed two lobby groups in the US and one in the UK. And finally, the money for the elections was in the purse.\n\n\u201cWhen the man finished, I thanked him without passing any comment. The man was surprised at my reaction and asked, \u2018You have nothing to say to these?\u2019\n\n\u201cI said I had nothing to say, and I immediately called my ADC, Chris Jemilola, to play a game of squash with me.\n\n\u201cOn our way to the squash court with my ADC, I said, \u2018People at times make plans and leave God out of their plans.\u2019\n\n\u201cMy casual remark struck Chris and he said, \u2018Sir, that was a profound statement.\u2019 I said that I made the statement because of what I had just heard of Atiku\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cI was not convinced he had put God in his plans. Atiku was confident and God was laughing.\n\n\u201cMost of Atiku\u2019s ingredients soon started to fall out of place one by one.\n\n\u201cThe first was the party, PDP. He thought I was powerless and had no clue about the execution of his plan with his group; part of his attack on me was for National Chairman of the Party to give the first salvo, then other things would follow as his grip on the Party would be firm and consolidated.\n\n\u201cThat salvo came in the form of a letter to me from the Chairman of the party, Audu Ogbeh, who had fully defected with Ayu to Atiku.\n\n\u201cThe letter, which was not the product of any issue or matter discussed with or at any party meeting, came suddenly.\n\n\u201cWhen I received it, I could read the sinister intention behind it. And I told Remi Oyo, my media person, that the letter would be out in the media within the couple of days. Remi doubted it would happen.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, I spent that night writing my reply, and I sent it in the morning.\n\n\u201cMy reply was clear. I wondered why Atiku and his group did not realise that with my reply, the battle line was clear or maybe they thought that the seven ingredients would remain intact to the end.\u201d\n\nHow political parties can substitute vice-presidential candidates \u2013INEC\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has clarified the conditions under which the political parties can substitute candidates whose names have been forwarded to it.\n\nSpeaking against the background of the debate over the right of the parties to remove and replace the names of candidates, INEC National Commissioner, Festus Okoye, said on Friday that the parties can make substitution if the nominated candidate dies or if the nominated candidate withdraws from the race.\n\nFielding questions on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today, Okoye said: \u201cThe issue of withdrawal is at the absolute discretion of the duly nominated candidate and no one else.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cAs far as the law is concerned and as far as the commission is concerned, the commission makes it mandatory that the moment a presidential candidate emerges, such a presidential candidate must nominate an associate who shall run with him/her as a vice-presidential candidate.\n\n\u201dAnd so, both are seen as Siamese twins; they move together, and they fall together.\n\n\u201cIn the forms submitted by the various political parties, they submitted forms relating to their presidential candidates and they also submitted forms relating to their vice-presidential presidential candidates, and that is in compliance with the provisions of the constitution and in compliance with the provisions of the law.\n\n\u201cThere is a provision in the Electoral Act for withdrawal of candidates validly nominated and the law provides that a political party cannot substitute a candidate that has been validly nominated except in two instances; if the nominated candidate dies or if the nominated candidate withdraws from the race.\n\n\u201cAnd in terms of withdrawal, the nominated candidate shall \u2013 in his own writing \u2013 write a letter to the political party that nominated him, indicating that he has withdrawn from the race and that must also be accompanied by an affidavit duly sworn to by the said candidate.\n\n\u201cThen the political party that nominated the candidate will now forward same to the Independent National Electoral Commission, saying that our presidential candidate has withdrawn, or our vice-presidential candidate has withdrawn, and these are the documents of withdrawal and this is the person we are using to replace.\n\n\u201cBut as of today, the political parties nominated their presidential candidates and nominated their vice-presidential candidates, so the issue of withdrawal is at the absolute discretion of the duly nominated candidate and no one else.\u201d",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja and Gyang Bere, Jos\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has hailed Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu\u2019s visionary leadership. The President made the observation in a goodwill message to the governor who turned 57 on June 25, 2022.\n\nIn a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Buhari expressed joy over Sanwo-Olu\u2019s remarkable strides of service in the private and public sector.\n\nThe President noted that the governor\u2019s visionary leadership had made impact in infrastructure, security, business outlook and public service, creating opportunities for Nigerians and foreign investors to benefit from the economic vibrancy of the state.\n\nHe said that Sanwo-Olu\u2019s vast experience in the private sector will always be relevant in pursuing competence and excellence in governance, after working successfully with the big financial institutions in the country.\n\nExpressing similar warm felicitation to the Lagos State chief executive, former governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Orji Kalu congratulated him on the occasion of his 57th birthday anniversary, describing him as a pragmatic and astute public administrator.\n\nKalu applauded the leadership qualities of Sanwo-Olu, stressing that the governor has sustained the foundation laid by the Bola Tinubu administration in Lagos State.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn behalf of the people of Abia North Senatorial district, I congratulate Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State as he clocks 57.\n\n\u201cThe governor has over the years demonstrated good character and pedigree in serving Lagos State in various positions.\n\n\u201cUnder his watch, Lagos State is witnessing robust transformation in all ramifications.\n\n\u201cThe governor has not deviated from the ideals of his predecessors and as such has consistently done Lagosians proud.\u201d\n\nNoting that Sanwo-Olu has carved a niche for himself in politics, leadership and governance, Kalu prayed that God would strengthen the governor in his endeavours.\n\nAlso celebrating the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, Kalu described him as a progressive politician with passion for a united and prosperous Nigeria.\n\nExtolling the virtues of the Speaker, Kalu stressed that Gbajabiamila\u2019s role in promoting a healthy relationship among the three tiers of government is remarkable and patriotic.\n\nHe called on the Speaker not to relent in using his position to advance the cause of Nigerians, adding that his leadership style is highly commendable and worthy of emulation.\n\nThe Chief Whip made these assertions in a goodwill message to commemorate the Speaker\u2019s 60th birthday anniversary.

Nobody should think that he has monopoly of violence. That we are peaceful does not mean that we are weak or senseless.\n\n\u201cMr Peter Obi as a bonafide citizen of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and born in Nigeria has the Constitutional right to contest for any political office he deems fit and nobody can stop that.\n\n\u201cObi is a successful man is all sense of the word. He agreed to contest for the office of the president of Nigeria not because he needs anything from the said office, but he made himself available because of the call on him by Nigerians who want to salvage our dear nation from collapse both economically, educationally and security-wise.\n\n\u201cAnyone who thinks he wants to attack such a peaceful and fulfilled man is sick and his sickness will be treated appropriately at the right time.\n\n\u201cOnly a wicked and idiotic person will be comfortable with the current state of the nation .

          "text": "By Rita Okoye\n\nNollywood actress, Chigozie Stephanie Alichi aka Chizzy Alichi-Mbah is not scared of husband snatchers.\n\nIn this chat, the movie star reveals reasons why no woman can dare take her man. She also shed more lights on her upcoming kids show and why she rejected many wealthy suitors before meeting and finally marrying her husband. Here are excerpts:\n\nHow has it been shuttling between Lagos and Asaba for movies?\n\nIt\u2019s not that hard because I have a supportive husband. He comes around sometimes when he is free and of course, there is a functioning airport in Asaba. I can easily breeze in and out. Although, right now, I want to stay more in Lagos, make more contacts, do more movies and focus more on my show.\n\nWhat does it take to maintain a happy marriage?\n\nMaintaining a happy home starts from the person you got married to. I had many suitors, people richer than my husband but I chose my husband because he is my best friend, my play and gossip mate. He\u2019s rich of course. He is somebody I have known because I learnt that in marriage, sometimes love vanishes and friendship sustains; secondly, he supports my dream. Some of my colleagues stopped acting as soon as they got married, but my case is different. In fact, I became a producer after marriage and I started a TV show because of him. So, my husband is my best friend and he always wants to see me happy and vice versa. And to me, that\u2019s how to maintain a happy marriage.\n\nBut you have made your husband stay off social media?\n\nI didn\u2019t, he is not a social media person. In fact, I am the one that brought him out. He is a quiet and reserved person. He\u2019s very simple, calm and calculated.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have a social media account, are you scared of husband snatchers?\n\nYes, my husband doesn\u2019t have a social media account. He is only on Facebook, and no, I am not scared of husband snatchers. I mean who will snatch my husband? She carry 10 heads? I am a whole package and my husband is forever grateful. He is the one scared of losing me.\n\nSince Korra Obidi\u2019s marital issues, some celebrities have stopped posting their happy moments on social media; did her marriage crash affect you too?\n\nNot at all, they have issue obviously. Their marriage didn\u2019t crash because of online show off. Although, too much of everything, is bad. Marriage wey go last go last, whether you show off online or not.\n\nCan you forgive and take back a cheating partner?\n\nI have this orientation while growing up that all men cheat, men are polygamous in nature. And believe it or not, most men cheat. Though, there are still good ones and my husband is number one. If you leave a cheating partner, what is the possibility that the next person will not cheat? To me, it depends on what and how it happened.\n\nDoes your relationship status affect the kind of roles you accept?\n\nKind of, because even if my husband does not complain, my fans will be like \u2018she is married, why is she doing this?\u2019 And even, when I am doing some kind of roles like the \u2018sexy girl\u2019, I can\u2019t expose too much. You can cover or wear classy clothes and still be very sexy.\n\nHow about kissing scenes?\n\nDeep kiss? No!\n\nTell us more about your show. What inspired it?\n\nIt\u2019s divine. The inspiration came when I was cooking rice on a Sunday. I told my husband about it. He said I should give him few days to think about it, and boom, he said it\u2019s wonderful. We bought equipment, set up our stage and by God\u2019s grace, it would soon be airing on Africa Magic. It\u2019s a children\u2019s reality TV show (The Xperience) unscripted.\n\nWhat are the things kids will learn after watching the show?\n\nBoth children and adult will learn a lot. It will carry everybody along. It will also bring peace to most homes. Children are smart and they know everything; because it\u2019s unscripted, they open up as it is, and their parents always make amends after hearing them out. For instance, a child said his father is always angry and shouting, of course the father won\u2019t shout again. He will make amends after hearing from the son.\n\nIt seems you\u2019re a lover of kids, how many do you plan to have?\n\nYes, I am. I want to have five children and they are coming soon by God\u2019s grace. We are finally ready.\n\nYou intentionally didn\u2019t want to have kids immediately after marriage?\n\nIt\u2019s personal.\n\nWould you allow your child join the movie industry if he or she expresses interest?\n\nOf course, the movie industry is a great industry. I will gladly show my full support.\n\nWhat\u2019s your current relationship with Zubby Michael after the social media clash?\n\nWe are good now. We met at the airport and hugged it out.\n\nWhat are the three things about your husband that makes you love him specially?\n\nHe is very smart, calculative and intelligent. He is also quite simple and a selfless man, loving and caring. He caries me like an egg.\n\nDespite being married, do men still run after you?\n\nYes, as long as you are a pretty woman, men will always come around, including admirers and some wishing they married you instead.",

          "title": "DEMOCRATIC REVERSALS AND THE CRISIS OF GOVERNANCE \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "Wealth D.Ominabo argues that ECOWAS needs independence to enforce its protocols\n\nDemocracy in West Africa is in crisis, it is threatened by insecurity, human rights violation , digital repression, electoral fraud, institutional weakness and state capture. The region is becoming a flourishing ground for unconstitutional transfers of power, compounding the security challenges of the region. Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea are now governed by military leaders and ECOWAS has for the last two years been searching for a sustainable solution to the political impasse in the countries.\n\nAt the foundation of the issue of democratic reversals is the crisis of governance. The inability of States to function effectively; the lack of capacity of institutions to carry out their functions, the inability of political leaders to safeguard and protect the lives and properties of citizens is also seen as a major threat for the survival of democracy. Peace and security are the primary responsibilities of a State, and the government\u2019s relevance is to the extent to which it can guarantee the basic rights of people. The crisis of governance is better explained in the context of the current reality in many countries, where citizens are daily confronted with miseries such as poverty, unemployment, insecurity and hunger. This has created a trust deficit between the government and the citizens. Trust is the threshold upon which the legitimacy of a government is built and sustained and the deficit of trust portends a crisis of legitimacy.\n\nDemocratic sustainability is tied to adherence to democratic principles which include the rule of law, separation of powers, credible elections, access to justice, equality and inclusive governance. These virtues help to reinforce the wheel of governance and maintain state on the path of stability and national cohesion. Dictatorial instincts by political leaders have made many citizens lose faith in democracy , making citizens resort to the search of hope by all means even outside the constitutional democracy. In Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso citizens trooped out to the street to celebrate when democratic governments were overthrown. In some instances like Mali, civil society groups and political party leaders were reported to have endorsed actions of the putschist.\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is threatened with legitimacy and governance crises \u2013 this impacts on its ability to deliver on its mandate and enforce its protocols. Democracy and security are major areas of interest of ECOWAS, regrettably the region has been a melting pot for insecurity and flashpoint for democratic decline in recent years. Part of the challenge lies in the lethargy of presidents from member states to uphold democratic principles in their countries. Another factor lies in the absence of strong institutions in many countries which has made many presidents manipulate the state institutions for their interests.\n\nThe inability of ECOWAS leaders, especially those within the ranks of the Authority of Heads of State and Government, the highest decision organ of the body comprising serving presidents to enforce its laws and protocols, has created a crisis of governance for ECOWAS. In recent times, most presidents of ECOWAS nations have defaulted ECOWAS Protocol on Democracy and Good Governance through electoral malpractice and tenure elongation.\n\nSome leaders have also captured democratic institutions in their countries subjecting State institutions to act according to their whims and caprices. President Alpha Conde\u2019s decision to seek a third term has always been cited as the major reason for the coup in Guinea. ECOWAS today faces a legitimacy issue because many citizens in member states do not see the body as representing their interests because of their silence on the illegality of sitting presidents. For example, ECOWAS maintained sealed lips when Alassane Ouattara amended the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s Constitution and sought a third term .\n\nThis practice by ECOWAS signals a departure from the old tradition when ECOWAS used to be assertive on issues of democratic principles involving member states. In 2009 ECOWAS suspended President Mamadou Tandja of Niger after the expiration of his two terms despite orchestrating a referendum and conducting a sham election to validate his third term. In 2010, ECOWAS also asserted its power and compelled President Laurent Gbagbo to vacate office after he was defeated by Alassane Ouattara in the 2010 Presidential Election of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Also in 2016 ECOWAS restored the presidential mandate of Adama Barrow of Gambia after Yahya Jammeh refused to vacate office after he was defeated in the presidential polls.\n\nThe deviation from this time tested practice is what has created a legitimacy gap for ECOWAS among citizens of member states. Today, ECOWAS finds it difficult to enforce its policies and protocol on dissenting members . The failure and refusal of military authoritarians in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso to abide by ECOWAS timeline of political transition despite sanctions imposed on them signals the irreverence of the body in the region.\n\nFor democracy to flourish in the region, presidents from member states must commit to democratic principles in their own countries, this will translate to wider democratic gains in the region. One way to achieve this is through the strengthening of democratic institutions in a way that it can withstand pressures from African Strongmen and authoritarians. Strong institutions are the bulwark upon which democracy is preserved. The ECOWAS Commission and ECOWAS itself is in need of urgent reforms that will guarantee its independence, from internal and external influences, so it can enforce its protocols without fear or favour.\n\nLastly, West African nations need to improve their level of statecraft, such that the government is able to deliver basic social goods to its citizens; this will help ensure trust and build faith in the hearts of citizens on the benefits and relevance of democracy.",

          "title": "Africa as Dumping Ground for European Wastes: From Toxic Wastes to UK Unwanted Refugees \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "INTERNATIoNAL\n\nBola A. Akinterinwa\n\nOnce upon a time, Africa was the darling of Nigeria. Africa was first made the cornerstone of Nigeria\u2019s foreign policy and that was from 1960 to 1976. Anti-apartheid policy stand of Nigeria was the major dynamic. In 1976, following the Professor Adebayo Adedeji report, Africa seized to be the cornerstone and became the centrepiece of Nigeria\u2019s foreign policy. As centrepiece, Africa was given greater prominence in Nigeria\u2019s foreign policy calculations. This was one major rationale for the nationalisation of the British Petroleum and the Barclays Bank, which became the Union Bank in 1977 and 1978.\n\nAs from 1994, with de-apartheidisation, Nigeria does not have any meaningful foreign policy to reckon with. When Dr. Okoi Arikpo was Commissioner for External Affairs under General Yakubu Gowon, he made it clear that Nigeria would not allow the use of Africa simply as a source of raw materials for the development of Europe and America. In fact, Nigeria was vehemently opposed to the exploitation of Africa by the colonial masters in many ways. It was against this background that Nigeria opposed French Atomic Tests in the Reggane area of the Sahara desert in February, April and December 1960, as well as the eventual rupture of diplomatic ties with France in January 1961.\n\nToday, Nigeria\u2019s foreign policy does not have any focus or anything to defend. Nigeria is even aligning internationally contrarily to the established non-alignment policy put in place in 1960. Although the policy does not imply that Nigeria must never align, it simply says that such alignment must be a resultant from Nigeria\u2019s sovereign decision. The decision must not be as a result of international pressure. Whether Nigeria\u2019s support for Ukraine against Russia is sovereignly taken is a separate debate on its own. However, it is on record that the US government is currently making efforts to sanction any African country that is supporting Russia. And most unfortunately in this case, voting against Russia is, grosso modo, not in Nigeria\u2019s national and African interest.\n\nAnd perhaps most disturbingly, not only are Nigerians mistreated in many parts of Africa, the same African continent has become a terra cognita for dumping of anything unwanted in Europe and America. It is sufficient to attach monetary compensation to any unwanted thing for African leaders to accept acts of wickedness for their own people. The most recent example is the controversial plan of the British government to deport all unwanted migrants from the UK border to Rwanda. With the dumping of toxic wastes in 1988, new approaches to people deportation, visible efforts at re-colonisation in 2022, and without Nigeria vigorously reacting, Africa as centrepiece of Nigerian foreign policy in defending Africa and its people has become meaningless. This is most unfortunate.\n\nAfrica as Dumping Ground\n\nIn January 1988, an Italian company dumped more than 2000 drums, sacks and containers of hazardous wastes in Koko, a small fishing village in the rain belt of the then Bendel State in Southern Nigeria. The drums and containers were presented as containing fertilisers for farmers and meant to assist them. From various accounts, there is no disputing the fact that the importation of the toxic waste was in collaboration with Nigerians. Not only were the host community more interested in the inducements to be given for the dumping of the toxic wastes, apparently for ignorance of the toxicity and its implications for the environment, but the Government of Delta and the Federal Government under General Ibrahim Babangida showed a lackadaisical attitude to the issue.\n\nIn an interview granted by an indigene of Koko fishing village and former President of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights, Professor Lucky Oritsetojumi Akaruese, to the The Punch newspapers, the attitude of the governments was shameful. As he put it, \u2018it was some Nigerian students in Italy at the time that exposed the dumping of the waste and possibly in conspiracy with some Nigerians that were highly connected. A Nigerian newspaper reported the issue. I think it was the Sunday Guardian newspaper. Note that the waste passed through the Koko seaport with the full compliments of the officials of the Federal Government that owned the port.\u2019\n\nWhat is particularly noteworthy about this quotation is the fact of negligence to control the toxic drums. In other words, the government officials did not know about the contents? If they did not know, what did they do when eventually the matter was brought to its attention? An overview of the situation is disheartening as told by Professor Akaruese: \u2018it is a community that has been abandoned and sacrificed by the duo of the State and local governments on the altars of greed, selfishness and political electoral interests. It is a community that has been sold to merchants of death by its local leadership for peanuts and a community that will constitute the future metaphorical \u201cguinea pig\u201d for research into the effects of industrial toxic wastes.\u2019\n\nAnd most unfortunately too, another toxic waste dumping in the same Koko village took place in 2017. How do we explain this recurrence? Why the choice of Koko again for the dumping? Why the complicity of the Governments of Nigeria? Who is to blame in this regard for the policy of fresh dumping in exchange for money?\n\nIn the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, a United Nations Press Release of 30 January 2018 had it that in August 2006, a cargo ship, Probo Koala, a Panama registered tanker and chartered by the Singaporean-based oil and commodity shipping, Trafigura Beheer BV, offloaded toxic waste to an Ivoirian waste handling company, Tommy. Tommy took delivery and disposed the waste in 12 sites in Abidjan which created unwarranted health hazards. In fact, about 100,000 Abidjanais had to seek medical attention when the Prime Minister, Charles Banny, opened hospitals and offered free healthcare to all residents of Abidjan.\n\nExpectedly, Trafigura Beheer BV initially denied any importation of toxic wastes from the Netherlands. When it eventually accepted knowledge of it, it claimed not to know that the toxic waste would not be properly disposed off. The Ivoirian government made the Trafigura to pay damages to the tune of US$ 198m. Besides, more than 30,000 Ivoirians embarked on a law-suit in 2008 against the Trafigura in London. Trafigura had to pay \u00a330m (US$ 42.4m) in settlement of the suit.\n\nIn the context of the toxic waste in Koko village in Nigeria, the story is completely different. There is nothing like sanction or trial of anyone in the spirit of Nigeria being a fantastically corrupt country. It is collective thieving and institutional corruption. In Abidjan, more than 100,000 suffered ill-health. There is no official record of victims of the toxic waste in Nigeria.\n\nBut true enough, there is the Convention on the Control of Trans-boundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, which was adopted on 22 March 1989 by the Conference of Plenipotentiaries in Basel, Switzerland. The Convention was prompted by public outcries following the discovery of deposits of toxic wastes in Africa and many parts of the world. The Convention was done to reduce hazardous waste generation and to promote \u2018environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes wherever the place of disposal; the restriction of trans-boundary movements of hazardous wastes except where it is perceived to be in accordance with the principles of environmentally sound management\u2019; and to regulate the system applying to cases where trans-boundary movements are permissible.\n\nMost unfortunately, however, many of the signatories to the convention breached the obligations created for them by the Convention. While the challenge of how to dispose industrial waste in the developed countries, and particularly the high costs of their disposal in Europe and coupled with the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) syndrome, industrialists have to seek cheaper ways of disposing their toxic wastes, which mainly was to turn to Africa. Nobody wanted toxic wastes in their backyard in Europe, but craftily negotiated with African leaders to accept and which the African leaders happily accepted for their people because of money.\n\nIt is against this background that the Bamako Convention was conceived in 1991 and negotiated by 12 OAU countries. The Convention entered into force in 1998 and has six main purposes: prohibition of importation of all hazardous and radioactive wastes into African continent for whatever reason; minimizing and controlling trans-boundary movements of hazardous wastes within Africa; prohibiting all ocean and inland water dumping or incineration of hazardous wastes; ensuring that disposal of wastes is conducted in an environmentally sound manner; promoting \u2018a cleaner production over the pursuit of a permissible emissions approach based on assimilative capacity assumptions\u2019; and establishing a precautionary principle. In essence, Member Signatories are required to ban the import of harzardous and radioactive wastes and all forms of ocean disposal.\n\nEven though the Bamako Convention drew a lot of inspirations from the Basel Convention, especially from its Article 11 which requires its signatories to enter into bilateral, multilateral and regional agreements on Hazardous Waste to help achieve the objectives of the Convention, the Bamako Convention provides for stronger restrictions on import of hazardous wastes to Africa, For instance, it makes no exceptions on certain hazardous wastes like those for radioactive materials provided for in the Basel Convention. It prohibits all imports of hazardous wastes.\n\nAgain, most unfortunately, Nigeria has not ratified the Bamako Convention since 1998 while the developed countries have continued to import hazardous wastes to Africa. This cannot but be an expression of failure of Nigeria\u2019s foreign policy, especially in light of the fact that Africa is considered as the centrepiece of foreign policy. What is again staring Nigeria in the face is the shift from importation of toxic wastes to importation of refugees of mixed personality and whose future has the great potential to threaten continental stability in a very serious manner.\n\nRefugee Deportation and Implications for Africa\n\nThe refugees are comprised of Afghans, Syrians, Arabs, and Muslim in the main, and will be expected to constitute in the long run a new colony, in addition to the minority Tutsi and majority Hutus, in Rwanda. Both Tutsi and Hutus are basically Roman Catholics. When the population becomes inclusive of people of different background and possibly of extremist religious beliefs, the current myopic policies of President Paul Kagame of Rwanda will be another internal strife from which future lessons will be drawn.\n\nBefore then, questions ought to be raised on the choice of donation of money to Rwanda in exchange for accommodating unwanted refugees in the United Kingdom? In an agreement done on 14 April, 2022 and signed by the British Minister of Interior, Priti Patel, and Rwandan Foreign Minister, Vincent Birutaare, Britain offered to give $157m \u20ac144m to Rwanda. Explained differently, Britain will first pay \u00a3120m to Rwanda for economic development and will then pay thereafter for the operational costs of the program along with accommodation and integration expenses. This is necessary because the asylum is not for a temporary period but one designed to be permanent.\n\nThe refugees are by implication to become Africans by conferment of Rwandan nationality on them. Additionally, even though the Rwandan government is looking at the current small number of the refugees, the moment the foundation for settlement of the asylees is well laid, a gradualist further repopulating of Rwanda must be expected\n\nIn this regard, why is it that the opposition to the deportation of the refugees has become an issue in the United Kingdom? There is rivalry between British courts, on the one hand, and the European Council of Human Rights (ECHR), on the other. While the ECHR issued a last minute injunction to stop the deportation of the thirty migrants initially earmarked to be flown to Rwanda, two British courts did not accept to block the deportation.\n\nMany of the deportees themselves have been protesting vehemently against their deportation. They complained about unfairness, warm welcome to Ukrainian refugees and better treatment for them, but such good treatment was not given to them. The Kurdish and Syrian migrants who spoke to Al Jazeera said they fled joining the army in Syria and would prefer to take their lives rather than accept to stay in Rwanda. While the UK-Rwandan deal is an expression of human trafficking, the Boris Johnson government argues that the cardinal objective of the deportation is to prevent such human trafficking. It is to ensure their protection.\n\nAs reported by Al Jazeera, one 23-year Kurdish detainee from Iran, Ferhad, was quoted as saying that \u2018when the war in Ukraine started, all Ukrainians were welcomed and given better treatment. Since we are all refugees, I didn\u2019t understand why I would be relocated to Rwanda when Ukrainians are welcomed, given a better life, shelter and everything they need.\u2019 More important says the quote, \u2018regardless of our origin, we are all human beings, Kill me here or let Iran kill me, instead of taking me to Rwanda.\u2019 The implication of this position cannot be far-fetched. If the protesting migrants are forcefully deported to Rwanda, their anger has the potential to impact negatively on political governance in Rwanda.\n\nWhatever is the case, Britain had to comply with the judgment of the ECHR because of the supranational authority of the ECHR. Indeed, the ECHR is not part of the European Union from which the UK Brexited. Even though the UK government has indicated that the deportation of the migrants would still continue and several British notables have been considering the possibility of Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the ECHR, the point remains what future for the refugees in Rwanda? And what future if Rwanda is inviting insecurity to his country by not seeking to know the quality of migrants being planned to be sent to Rwanda? What if the migrants to be sent to Rwanda are extremists, especially those of them coming from terrorist zones? Will the money given and to be given to Rwanda be adequate to contain the would-be insecurity? This scenario is most unfortunate for various reasons.\n\nThere was the time the United Kingdom promised to give more than \u00a375m to the Government of Zimbabwe headed by Robert Mugabe in compensation for acquired land for White Zimbabweans. This was in resolution of the Chimurenga crisis. Britain, after paying the first tranche, made no further payment and this led to a serious political misunderstanding between the UK and Zimbabwe, and which also impacted on British relations with the entire African continent because African leaders pitched their tent on the side of Zimbabwe.\n\nIn this regard, Africa is considered the cornerstone and centrepiece of Nigeria\u2019s foreign policy, which Nigeria does not want to be exploited for the development of Europe? Nigeria\u2019s foreign policy is therefore necessarily challenged directly.\n\nA second implication is that the principles of territorial asylum are directly denatured. It is useful to differentiate between territorial, extra-territorial, and neutral asylum in understanding the implications of the relevant principles. Territorial asylum is when the refugees are on the territory of the receiving State, meaning that territorial asylum is granted within the bounds of the country granting asylum. In this regard, territorial asylum is necessarily an exception to the rule of extradition. On the contrary, extra-territorial State is when an asylum is granted in Consulates, Diplomatic Missions or Legations, all of which are generally referred to as diplomatic asylum; warships and merchant vessels in a foreign country and still considered to be granted within the territory of the State from which protection is sought. Neutral asylum which occurs when a state offers an asylum within its territory to troops of belligerent States subject to acceptance of internment of troops during the period of the war.\n\nThus, Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution\u2019 but that \u2018this right may not be involved in the case of prosecutions genuinely arising from non-political crimes or from acts contrary to purposes and principles of the United Nations.\u2019 And perhaps more importantly, Article 3(1) of the Declaration on territorial Asylum (UNGA Resolution 2312 (XXII, 22UN GAOR sup. (No.16 at 81, UN Doc A/6716 (1967), clearly stipulates that \u2018no person referred to in Article 1 paragraph 1, shall be subjected to measures such as rejection at the frontier or, if he has already entered the territory in which he seeks asylum, expulsion or compulsory return to any state where he may be subjected to persecution.\u2019\n\nBased on this provision, the UK has acted contrarily to this provision and its international responsibility can be called to question, despite its exclusive right to accept or not to accept refugees. Asylum offences can include treason, desertion, espionage, sedition desertion etc., prompting the quest for an asylum or a refugee status. The basic principle involved here is the right of access to the asylum process upon setting foot on the territory of the intended Asylum State, but which the UK has set aside by sending away refugees that have stepped on its soil.\n\nA third implication is the likelihood of political magouilles in Rwanda because President Paul Kagame is a condoned dictator. The UK-Rwanda agreement is simply a Memorandum of Understanding and therefore not enforceable. In paragraph 1.6 of the MoU, it is clearly stated that \u2018this arrangement will not be binding in International Law. Additionally, paragraph 2.2 says, \u2018for the avoidance of doubt, the commitments set out in this Memorandum are made by the United Kingdom to Rwanda and vice versa and do not create or confer any right on any individual, nor shall compliance with this Arrangement be justiciable in any court of law by the third parties or individuals.\u2019 Thus it simply remains a non-justiciable bilateral arrangement which gives room for future manoeuvres. In this regard, for how long will Africa remain a land for dumping of Europe\u2019s unwanted toxic wastes? Will the relocation of the UK\u2019s unwanted refugees to be sent to Rwanda not be the beginning of another process of re-colonisation of Africa with the complicity of Africans this time? But before time will tell, UK and others should send their unwanted refugees to the Maghreb countries where they can fit in well, being mostly Arabs, rather than to Rwanda.",

          "text": "ENGAGEMENTS BY Chidi Amuta\n\nThe recent presidential nomination primaries of the two big parties and the just concluded Ekiti state governorship elections are united by a paradox. In both, Nigerian democracy recorded some dubious progress. An orderly and fairly credible electoral processes seems to have finally evolved. Correspondingly, however, the monetization of the electoral process hit the highest peak in our history.\n\nIn a sickening Arab street bazaar at the presidential nomination conventions, APC and PDP delegates exchanged their convictions for wads of dollar bills reportedly ranging in value from $5000 to upwards of $35,000. In the Ekiti governorship election, the entire state became a retail market place for haggling over the price of each vote and finally settling for a range between N3000 and a princely N15,000 per vote cast.\n\nAs things stand, our electoral outcomes are beginning to look more like validations of financial prowess rather than vindications of genuine intentions of public good. In both the APC and the PDP presidential primaries, the two presidential candidates that finally emerged happen to be the richest citizens among the aspirants. In Ekiti, it seems that a well to do candidate backed by the treasury prowess of the incumbent state administration also won. In both sets of elections, therefore, we may have reached that point in our descent into decadence where electoral victories may have acquired a new Nigerian name: Coronation of the Highest Bidder.\n\nAt the centre of this aberration is a helpless acceptance of vote buying and selling of votes as a legitimate seasonal trade. As has been variously reported, serial bribing of delegates and retail vote buying at polling sites dominated both exercise. Most observers have concluded that the outcome of the presidential nomination conventions of the two big parties merely confirmed the primacy of cash as the deciding factor in the outcome. This is only a foretaste of what is likely to transpire at the real general elections in 2023.\n\nOn the scale of state governorship elections, the Ekiti governorship election now holds the gold trophy in retail direct vote buying and selling. From informed reports, pay masters of the leading candidates were located strategically at vantage points in the vicinities of the polling booths with cell phone cameras focused on the balloting point for verification. Once the voter thumb printed the correct party emblem, he/she qualifies to received the agreed price of the vote at the point of exit from the polling area. Eye contact and thumb signals were the confirmation signals. Reportedly, the going rates in Ekiti ranged from N3,000 to N15,000 depending on the depth of the candidate\u2019s pocket. The highest rate guarantees the more certain win. In one epic unguarded moment, a social media viral photo showed a leading candidate personally openly handing out wads of naira notes to a throng of supporters at a last minute campaign. No one has cared to deny that footage!\n\nIn all this drama, we need to accord INEC its deserved credit. It may have finally made election rigging and vote robbery less attractive than ever before. So far, hardly anyone has alleged that either the presidential primaries of the big parties or the Ekiti governorship election was rigged in any material way. The announced results have so far corresponded neatly with the numbers of accredited delegates and voters in each case. INEC\u2019s adoption of new anti fraud technologies seem to be working. In Ekiti, tallying of votes and the issuing of results were completed in about one day. Some INEC staffers still function as facilitators of residual electoral fraud. But most importantly, potential election riggers and vote thieves now need to think faster than INEC and its new devices. That is bad news for habitual election fraudsters and other ugly Nigerians.\n\nIn all fairness, INEC\u2019s contract with us ends with delivering credible, accurate, free and fair elections. It has no responsibility when it comes to regulating the conduct of voters and the behaviour of candidates and party supporters. Security is the business of the security people. The brazen monetization of our elections is a matter of social deviance that ought to preoccupy government and the political parties that give birth to them. And yet it is the very parties themselves and their leaders that are the source of the brazen monetization of the electoral process.\n\nWe have every cause to celebrate the general acceptance of orderly electoral process as the best way to advance the cause of democracy. Already, lovers and champions of democracy have saluted the progress and success in Ekiti. The United States government has congratulated Nigeria on the success in Ekiti. Even the habitually litigious Nigerian politicians in Ekiti have carefully focused their attention on the open vote buying and selling than on the credibility of INEC\u2019s procedures and processes. The complaint seems to be that they were out bidded in the bazaar!\n\nBut we should all be ashamed that our endemic corruption culture has assumed a permanent seat in something as strategic as our electoral process. Democracy dies the moment the choices made at elections do not reflect the genuine wishes and aspirations of the people but accord with a market logic. Worse still, when cash stands between political aspirants and the genuine feelings of the people, it is hard for electoral outcomes to reflect the desirable direction of public policy. The aberration befuddles the real needs and urgencies of the society and fuels the existing decay of the state.\n\nThere is yet another way of viewing the matter. As it stands now, the quantum of monetization in the recent electoral contests indicates the emergence of the vote trade as something of a new economic trend and nascent sector. We may in fact have indirectly created a seasonal economic sector with a quantum cash turnover. An industry of sorts has found a place among the gamut of new nefarious undertakings now struggling for prominence in our infinitely entrepreneurial nation.\n\nThe trade in votes has just joined the ranks of other illicit trades now thriving in our midst. Cyber crime, trading in babies produced by \u2018baby factories\u2019, trade in human body parts, human trafficking across state and international boundaries, online fake celebrity endorsement scams and circuses etc. These are the faces of the \u2018new economy\u2019. Add these to the already flourishing lethal sectors of transactional kidnapping and industrial banditry.\n\nThe vote trade is the complementary face of our new era politics. Let us call it transactional politics. It is informed by the Nigerian craze of \u201ccash and carry\u201d or \u201ccarry go\u201d in popular parlance. The \u2018Ghana must go\u201d politics is the unofficial certification of a cargo cult political culture that feeds on compulsive corruption. While the new INEC is the face of a promising future for democracy in our country, the rise of transactional politics is the death knell of democracy as well.\n\nThe unscripted understanding is that politicians have no moral obligation to attend to the needs of their constituents once they have bought off their votes at election time. The business of the next four years becomes how to recover the investment made at election time and ensure some return on investment. The avenues for investment recovery are well known in our political economy. Inflated and phantom contracts, dubious claims of perks and entitlements, padding of annual budget provisions, countless official trips and tours to all corners of the earth in the name of either finding foreign investors or learning new tricks in nation building or institution management. There is of course the familiar serial scam of oversight visits to public institutions and departments by federal and state legislators. It is an endless cesspool.\n\nOnce sold, the citizens\u2019 vote is a blank cheque that relieves the political office holder of all responsibility for delivery of the benefits of democracy and accountability to the electorate as citizens. The insensitivity of politicians is only complemented by the indifference of an electorate that has sold its votes for a pittance or was absent on election day.\n\nInterestingly, neither politicians nor the general public find transactional politics unusual or minimally offensive. Our politicians have no qualms about openly negotiating or bidding to buy your votes. Neither do voters feel any moral reservations about selling their votes. It is an anomaly that has found a fertile ground in an atmosphere and culture of endemic corruption. The unwritten common wisdom is that the public sphere is a no man\u2019s land, a place where the treasure of the nation belongs to no one and in which politicians once in office are entitlement to help themselves to the public till. Since the citizens\u2019 vote is the only ticket that grants access to the feast called government, politicians and the citizens have vicariously placed a monetary value on the vote as the ticket to political power. The trade in votes therefore becomes a normal transaction process in the business of political exchange. There is a desperate demand for votes by politicians and a ready supply by voters eager to cash out and move on.\n\nIn the business of the vote trade, then, we are dealing with a market situation. Able buyers and willing sellers which is the basic requirement for the creation of a market. Never before in the history of electoral democracy in Nigeria has adversity created such a thriving ready market in a basic instrument of democracy: the vote.\n\nHere then is one toxic dividend of Nigeria\u2019s democracy under Mr. Buhari\u2019s presidency. The democratization of abject penury and crippling poverty, the generous distribution of misery among the populace has created a country in which the distrust of politics and politicians is so thorough that people only believe in instant encashment of their citizenship rights in order to survive in the present as against belief in a forlorn hope that things will get better any time soon. Ultimately, the article of trade here is power, the sovereign power to decide the fate of a nation of over 200 million people most of whom are held hostage in the fangs of poverty and desperation.\n\nThe currency is the vote now symbolized by the Permanent Voters Card or PVC. The raging demand for PVCs is driven by two opposing forces. One is the desire by more citizens, especially the youth, to genuinely vote their convictions hoping it will change this ugly present. The opposite is the existence of humongous troves of cash in a few political hands ready to buy any number of PVC carrying voters in order to gain or retain power.\n\nIn the election season, however, the trade in votes becomes brisk business with a fleeting expiration date. The day after the election, life resumes. Delegates smile home and to the banks while bribed voters content themselves with perhaps \u2018one nice pot of soup\u2019 in the parlance of former Ekiti governor, Ayo Fayose, who invented the term \u2018stomach infrastructure\u2019 to capture the politics of instant gratification of the poor electorate in a period of ravaging hardship and virtual mass starvation.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of every monetized election, politicians tally their vote haul. The highest bidders head for the streets to celebrate. Those who could not hit the benchmark going prices for votes on sale quietly head home to lick their wounds, recalibrate their depleted bank accounts and console their disappointed spouses.\n\nIt is futile to continue to deny the existence of the vote trade, the unbridled unregulated free market of vote buyers and sellers. After all, this is a free market (free racket!) economy. Instead, perhaps what we urgently need is to recognize and perhaps regulates the vote trade as a seasonal sub sector of our economy. In terms of quantum of cash in circulation, the election season witnesses such a high volume of transactions in a regime dominated by a largely of invisible trade. The greater part of the money movement is undocumented and part of our robust underground economy. It is all about of cash, undocumented unofficial transfers via numerous electronic and human channels. The benefits of these transactions do not accrue to the official public treasury.\n\nPerhaps the best way to re-inject the monetary benefits of this vast seasonal economic activity is to recognize the vote trade as a legitimate activity. Why deny the existence of something you know will always be there? Let us \u2018legitimize\u2019 vote buying, delegate payouts, etc as legitimate transactions in the political sector of the economy.\n\nTherefore, payments to delegates should be declared just like gratuity is entered in your hotel meal invoice. There should be a tax on both the paying party and receiving parties. There should be extra taxes levied on bank accounts with unusual traffic during election seasons.\n\nBeyond this cynical suggestion, I recognize the urgent need to save our democracy from the scourge of monetization. But sermons and preachments will not do it. Legislation will not do it either. Existing anti graft agencies are as useless as they have been in fighting corruption. Instead, it is better to fight what money has caused with money in the form of higher prices for votes and open declaration of transactions in the vote trade.\n\nFirst, vote buying and selling need to attract heavy financial penalties for its perpetrators and beneficiaries alike. The political parties should lead the charge. They should fix the applicable rates. After all the parties fixed the price tags for their nomination forms for all elective offices which may have helped to exclude those who could not afford the princely sums.\n\nSince voters now know the rate of return on investment by politicians, they should charge appropriate prices per vote. Let us ask politicians to pay each voter say a minimum of N100, 000 per ballot. That way, the average voter can set up a small cottage business to take care of their needs since the politicians will not look their way once in power. Let the parties ask each governorship aspirant to pay each nomination delegate a minimum of N20 million. Similarly, each presidential aspirant should pay each nomination delegate a minimum of N50 million. At least those who trade their votes and their conscience will become players in the Small to Medium Enterprises sector instead of waiting for government patronage. If the financial cost to individual politicians is high enough, perhaps it might become a disincentive to discourage the survival of the vote trade. Confronted with such high price tags, politicians will come to value each vote and opt to discuss with their constituents instead. I believe such dialogue will lead to the death of transactional politics as both sides will realize that it is cheaper to revert to the original intention of democracy which insulates it from undue financial influence.\n\nIt is time to kill the vote trade by granting it terminal license.\n\nBeyond nominations and primaries, the rates and price tags for buying and selling of votes in general elections should perhaps be fixed and controlled by market forces determined by the wealth and status of previous holders of the office being sought. Those vying for re-election as councilors, state assembly members, federal legislators, governors and presidents should pay higher than new entrants. But in general, there should be a graduated sliding rate scale for the different levels of public office determined by their potential for return on investment. These rates should be so high in anticipation of the dividends to be reaped as to discourage the faint hearted.",

          "text": "BY Debbie Peters\n\nAs a new Rotarian, I attended the 2022 Rotary International Convention in Houston the first week of June and of the 11,000 delegates who attended, there was a sizable contingent from Africa. After flying from Washington DC, I was excited to see so many people from my home continent but after the opening assembly, many of them left the convention center to go shopping and attend personnal meetings. Apparently, the Zimbabwean delegation received their visas on the last minute, which had been stressful, and some never even received their visas so they did not come. A Ugandan told me that you only attend these conventions for the social life and East African Rotarians tend to be far younger than their American counterparts. Nigerians were in the majority, of course, and there was no way of telling how many were MIA during the sessions. The point was that Africans made the most of that opportunity to visit the US under the guise of attending the Rotary convention. There is a much easier way of gaining access to the US without going through all the hassle of paying for conferences and applying for visa then being at the mercy of US consulates in Africa.\n\nAnyone can invest in real estate in the US and at a certain threshold of investment, you can even get permanent residency as an investor. Thanks to rising interest rates and the impact of Covid, the real estate market in America is in turmoil right now. Another little-known fact is that there are lenders who will lend money to foreigners wanting to buy real estate in the US. There is negligible risk to the lenders because the property acts as collateral for the loans. Culturally, Nigerians and other Africans like to hold their money in real estate so there are individuals from Africa who now hold real estate assets in the US within their portfolio. I started out in real estate as a loan signing notary in Washington DC a year ago, and I have done several closings with Nigerian Americans. Some invest purely under limited liability companies, and some are buying property for their primary residence.\n\nThe housing market has slowed down so much due to rising interest rates, but it is helping to cool down prices. Many professionals fled from large cities during the early days of the pandemic leaving more stable apartment prices behind. The biggest impact of Covid is on the commercial side where there are large vacancies in retail and office spaces. Less than 40% of workers in Washington DC have returned to the office. The government has tried unsuccessfully to bring in all workers who are work from home. Whenever employers offer ultimatums, people quit and in a tight labor market, US employees cannot afford to lose those workers. The industrial sector offered more upside as companies like Amazon leased or built warehouse space but last week Amazon admitted they will have to sublet that space as they committed to more space than they need. Their stock tanked!\n\nBriefly, the biggest opportunities for foreign investors in the US lie in the commercial real estate space because there is a glut of properties available for sale. The District of Columbia is urging investors to buy office towers for condominium conversions since there is still a shortage of housing. They are trying to attract new companies to come into DC, but they are competing with neighboring states like Virginia which are more business-friendly. The biggest challenge with downtown Washington DC is that there is extraordinarily little foot traffic. I was at the \u2018Downtown DC Business Improvement District\u2019 breakfast last week where the panel brainstormed ways to bring more economic activity into the area. The city needs more cultural diversity, dining options and shopping destinations. Washington is known as \u2018Chocolate City\u2019 but due to gentrification and decision-makers who do not live in the community, the city has become bland and mostly deserted. It is a vicious cycle because people feel unsafe when they are walking alone on empty streets.\n\nWhen you look at major capitol cities like London, on a recent visit there I found that the top restaurants include Nigerian restaurants such as Ikoyi, https://ikoyilondon.com/ and when I went shopping in Selfridges I even found designer African print ankara labels. DC is trying to bring in African culture, with restaurants like \u2018Swahili Village\u2019 and the new \u2018Moi Moi\u2019, on K Street but it does not yet have the flavour that Harlem\u2019s 116th Street have. The city has a few popular street markets which draw crowds and if it were up to me, I would put them into a permanent building like the Union Market in the north east of the city. If an investor bought the right strategic building downtown to create another food hall, it would create an instant destination for residents. The area around the White House is a ghost town in the evenings and weekends, except for the odd tourist or the days when there is a protest.\n\nSmart investors could scoop up those vacant shops all over downtown central business districts in the US and fill them with ethnic garments that you find in fair-trade shops like Global Mamas in Accra, https://globalmamas.org/ or big markets like Balogun Market in Lagos. In fact, the stalls selling African wear at the exhibition in Houston were inundated with buyers. A savvy Zambian Rotary club had printed aso ebi fabric with the Rotary logo and they were sold out quickly. Everyone went around wearing African-print Rotary shirts like they were in Hawaii. Young designers and foreign brands might be risky for tenants which is why you can try them out with pop-up shops or co-sharing spaces.\n\nThere are endless possibilities with what you can do with all this excess commercial real estate stock in the US and the benefits of investing are endless. With an investment of $800,000, you get the EB-5 investor\u2019s visa which gives you permanent residency and is helpful for those whose children are going to college at state universities because they pay lower tuition fees than foreigners. You can also get non-immigrant visas which make it easier to come and go into the US. A good immigration lawyer like Maryland-based Nigerian-born, Isaac Falusi, can help you navigate the application process. Even a lower entry point of investment will eventually add up to an easier path to permanent residency later. The pandemic coupled with inflation has created a perfect storm for commercial real estate in the US. This is a rare opportunity in the economic cycle to pick up some property bargains in a sector that has been traditionally hard to penetrate. As a new estate agent, I prefer dealing with commercial tenants because they know what they want.\n\nThey are much more decisive when the premises suit their functions so as a landlord, you need not worry about income once you have the right tenants in your premises. As an African investor, never before has it been possible to get a foothold in the heart of the American capitol. I have been a real estate fund manager in Nigeria and I currently hold a small portfolio in Southern Africa, so I am excited to bring African investors into a market which is more stable and where the currency holds its value. This is the same strategy that Chinese and other investors have been using for years and there has never been a better time for Africans to acquire investment real estate in the US. Rising interests rate work in your favour and you can always refinance later once interest rates start coming down again.\n\nDebbie Peters is a commercial real estate agent and advisor in Washington DC, www.Longandfoster.com/DeborahPeters.

          "text": "The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) appears to be doing the bidding of the former Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Tukur Buratai (retd.) whose house, being used by a proxy, was busted in the Wuse area of the Abuja as the agency gave inconsistent figures of the amounts it found in the recovery of cash, vehicles and other items worth billions of Naira.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that while the ICPC granted bail to the military contractor, claiming that N30 million was found in the apartment, the agency later said in an official release that N175 million was recovered.\n\nBuratai, a retired Lieutenant General was the COAS between 2015 and 2021.\n\nSee Also Exclusive Revealed: Buhari's Chief Of Army Staff, General Buratai, Wives Own Dubai Property\n\nAzuka Ogugua, the spokesperson for the commission, had disclosed on Friday how the apartment was raided but did not give the details of Buratai\u2019s links to the recovery.\n\nTop sources told SaharaReporters that Buratai, despite denials by his lawyer and other faceless individuals already told a newspaper that the property was his and no search warrant was obtained before it was raided.\n\nOne of the sources further revealed that the ICPC figures of recovery had discrepancies all in a bid to cover up for Buratai who is at the heart of the massive corruption unfolding.\n\nOne of the sources said, \u201cBuratai spoke to People\u2019s Gazette saying ICPC had no search warrant contrary to denials by his lawyer that the property was not his.\"\n\n\u201cICPC granted administrative bail to Buratai\u2019s front claiming that they only found N30 million. They then issued a statement claiming they found N175 million.\n\n\u201cThey did not submit the money to the CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria) but kept it in the facility, trying to move the money. Two boxes were found but they (the ICPC) can\u2019t open the second one still,\u201d the source continued.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Anti-graft Agency, ICPC Uncovers Billions In Cash Meant For Arms, Ammunition To Fight Boko Haram In Abuja Home Of Ex-Chief Of Army Staff, Buratai\n\n\u201cThis is the not the first time Buratai would be involved in such a massive scandal. Buratai\u2019s first issue was with a businessman who fronted for him in Kano but took away his loot. Buratai got military intelligence to arrest the guy but covered up the issue when the man threatened to spill.\n\n\"They advised Buratai to let him go or find amicable way of settling the matter. Those involved properties are in Kano and Abuja,\u201d another top source told SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters on Friday reported that the ICPC confirmed the recovery of cash, vehicles and other items worth billions of Naira from a military contractor fronting for Buratai.\n\nAzuka Ogugua, the spokesperson for the commission, disclosed the arrest in a statement on Friday.\n\nOgagua identified the suspect as the Managing Director of K Salam Construction Company Nigeria Limited, Mr. Kabiru Sallau.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how ICPC officials last Thursday invaded a property in Abuja, recovering cash, vehicles and wrist watches worth billions of naira from a man who said they belonged to Buratai.\n\nSee Also News Nigerian Anti-corruption Agency, ICPC Confirms Arrest Of Military Contractor \u2018Fronting For Former Chief Of Army Staff, Buratai\u2019\n\nSources said the anti-graft agency was tipped off about the cash haul by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) during a probe of Kabiru.\n\nSubsequently, the NFIU transferred the matter to ICPC, which deployed its operatives to invade the property in Wuse 2 of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the huge cash was part of the billions of Naira earmarked for the purchase of arms and ammunition by the Muhammadu Buhari-led government.\n\n\u201cLast week Thursday, ICPC officials stormed a house in Wuse area of Abuja, beside National Open University and arrested a man, Kabiru Salisu (Sallau) after they saw N850 million cash in the house,\u201d a source had told SaharaReporters on Thursday.\n\n\u201cHe claimed the money belonged to Tukur Buratai who was in Cotonou at that time.\n\n\u201cOfficials of the ICPC took him to an office where another N1 billion in cash was also discovered. Also, bulletproof cars, BMW, G-Wagon worth N450m were recovered.\u201d\n\nReacting in a statement on Friday, Ogugua said acting on intelligence, the commission raided the residence in Wuse 2, Abuja, where the expensive items were found.\n\nSee Also Military REVEALED: Identity Of Civil Servant Who Took Bail Of Military Contractor Arrested In Buratai\u2019s Abuja House With Multibillion-Naira Cash, Vehicles, Rolex Watches\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe Commission wishes to state that ICPC operatives raided a property in Wuse 2 of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, on Thursday, 16th June, 2022 between 5:00pm and 12:00am in suspicion of money laundering.\n\n\u201cFacts available for the time being indicates that the property is owned by owner of K Salam Construction Company, a military contractor.\n\n\u201cThe Commission recovered money and other items from the property viz. N175,706,500; $220,965; G-Wagon; 2022 editions of BMW and Mercedes Benz cars; customized mobile phones; several designer wrist watches, including three Rolexes, and some property documents.\n\n\u201cThe Commission arrested the Managing Director of K Salam Construction Company Nigeria Limited, Mr. Kabiru Sallau and investigation is ongoing. The Commission is yet to conclude its investigation and prefers not to preempt its outcome and also avoid the frenzy of a media trial.\u201d\n\nA source had earlier said the commission was under pressure to reduce the amount found in the ex-army chief\u2019s house to as low as N30 million.\n\n\n\n'Missing' Arms Funds\n\nIn March 2021, Nigeria\u2019s National Security Adviser (NSA), Babagana Monguno revealed that funds running into billions of naira meant for the procurement of arms and ammunition under the past service chiefs were unaccounted for.\n\nHis revelation came a few months after President Buhari replaced Buratai and other service chiefs.\n\nOthers were former Chief of Defence Staff, Gabriel Olonishakin; Chief of Air Staff, Abubakar Sadique and Chief of Naval Staff, Ibok Ibas.\n\nAccording to Monguno, neither the money nor the arms were on the ground upon the resumption of the new service chiefs.\n\n\u201cNow that he (President Buhari) has brought new people (service chiefs), hopefully, they will devise some ways\u2026 I\u2019m not saying the former service chiefs diverted the money, but the money is missing. We don\u2019t know how, and nobody knows for now,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cThe President will surely probe this matter. As we speak, the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum too is also wondering where all the money went. I can assure you the President takes issues of this nature seriously.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that preliminary investigation showed the funds are missing and the equipment is nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cWhen the new service chiefs assumed office, they also said they did see anything on the ground.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuratai's History Of Graft\n\nSahara Reporters had in a series of publications in 2016 exposed how Buratai procured expensive assets in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, between 2013 and 2015, from proceeds of crime.\n\nHe and his two wives in 2013 paid the sum of 1,498,534.00 AED (N120 million/$419,000) for the first property, Project TFG Marina Hotel Unit 2711.\n\nSale documents indicated that the first property was handed over to the Buratais on January 13, 2013.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Revealed: Buhari's Chief Of Army Staff, General Buratai, Wives Own Dubai Property https://t.co/Kc5qFjmoEI pic.twitter.com/aAOVXKEsha \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) June 24, 2016\n\nEleven days after he was appointed by President Buhari, the retired Army General made arrangements for the purchase of a second property from the same company in Dubai.\n\nBetween July 24 and August 17, 2015, he paid a total sum of N42.2 million into TFG Sigma 111\u2019s account in Nigeria (Skye Bank 1770380452).\n\nEvidence exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters revealed that Buratai made N10 million payments on July 24 and August 7 respectively.\n\nThree days later, another N10 million was paid into the real estate firm\u2019s account. The phone number on the Skye Bank teller is 08033349740. Saharareporters investigations showed that it belonged to a Nigerian Army Major, Emmanuel G. Adegbola of the Nigerian Army Finance Corps (N/10808).\n\nOn August 17, 2015, the Chief of Army Staff paid the sum of N3,270,000 into the account.\n\nBuratai, who owned up to purchasing the two properties in Dubai, however, claimed that he amassed his wealth through \u201cpersonal savings\u201d and not ill-gotten gains.\n\nHe added he made a lot of money from his snake farm along Keffi-Abuja Highway in Nasarawa, just 50 kilometres from the nation\u2019s capital.",

We don\u2019t know how, and nobody knows for now,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cThe President will surely probe this matter. As we speak, the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum too is also wondering where all the money went.

Adegbola of the Nigerian Army Finance Corps (N/10808).\n\nOn August 17, 2015, the Chief of Army Staff paid the sum of N3,270,000 into the account.\n\nBuratai, who owned up to purchasing the two properties in Dubai, however, claimed that he amassed his wealth through \u201cpersonal savings\u201d and not ill-gotten gains.\n\nHe added he made a lot of money from his snake farm along Keffi-Abuja Highway in Nasarawa, just 50 kilometres from the nation\u2019s capital.",
          "summary": "His revelation came a few months after President Buhari replaced Buratai and other service chiefs.\nOthers were former Chief of Defence Staff, Gabriel Olonishakin; Chief of Air Staff, Abubakar Sadique and Chief of Naval Staff, Ibok Ibas.\nAccording to Monguno, neither the money nor the arms were on the ground upon the resumption of the new service chiefs.\nSaharareporters investigations showed that it belonged to a Nigerian Army Major, Emmanuel G. Adegbola of the Nigerian Army Finance Corps (N/10808).\nOn August 17, 2015, the Chief of Army Staff paid the sum of N3,270,000 into the account.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Kune, a Kenyan food tech startup that delivered ready-to-eat meals at affordable prices, is closing down today, the company\u2019s founder and CEO Robin Reecht announced.\n\nIn a statement posted to his LinkedIn page, Reecht cited a stifled economy and inflated food prices as circumstances that contributed to Kune\u2019s closure. \u201cWith the current economic downturn and investment markets tightening up, we were unable to raise our next round. Coupled with rising food costs deteriorating our margins, we just couldn\u2019t keep going,\u201d he said.\n\nThe announcement comes just 4 months after the startup began its commercial operations at established meal centers around Nairobi. Around that time, Kune leadership also declared its intentions to raise $3.5 million in its second round of funding.\n\nBut while Kune was well-liked by its customers, the startup\u2019s journey wasn\u2019t without its fair share of controversy. Last June, Reecht faced the mighty lash of Kenyans on Twitter (best known as KoT) after he shared in a TechCrunch interview that he was inspired to launch Kune after taking a trip to Kenya in November 2020 and having trouble finding affordable, ready-to-eat meals.\n\n\u201cAfter three days of coming into Kenya, I asked where I can get great food at a cheap price, and everybody tell [sic] me it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible because either you go to the street and you eat street food, which is really cheap but with not-so-good quality, or you order on Uber Eats, Glovo or Jumia, where you get quality but you have to pay at least $10.\u201d\n\nReecht, who is white and French, founded Kune just one month later.\n\nKenyans were aggrieved by his comments, and did not hesitate to voice their critiques. They argued that Reecht\u2019s ability to secure funding so quickly was due more to his white privilege than his business plan, which some believed aimed to solve a nonexistent problem. Those discussions gave way to a larger conversation about white privilege and favouritism in tech, as well as Kenya\u2019s neglect of its local founders.\n\nIn his statement, Reecht said that even though Kune had sold more than 55,000 meals and acquired more than 6,000 individual customers and 100 corporate customers since the start of the year, its $3 per meal price point wasn\u2019t enough to sustain its growth.\n\nAddressing Kune\u2019s investors, he said, \u201cNot only did you invest in Kune but you gave us your time, brain-width, connections, and emotional support. I am deeply sorry that Kune\u2019s vision didn\u2019t come true. To betray your confidence is something for which I will never forgive myself.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "These founders are helping companies make decisions with data",
          "text": "On a drab January day in 2018, in Pamplemousses, Mauritius, 2 friends, Joseph Rutankangwa and Eric Sewankambo, sat in Rutakangwa\u2019s apartment and decided to start a company. It wasn\u2019t their first time venturing into business together; only the previous year they\u2019d tried building an aggregator to curate data from various African countries which multinational companies could use. The problem was: there was simply no available data to be gathered. Generally speaking, data about Africa is scarce, and even when it is available, it can be inadequate and outdated.\n\nAt the time they decided to give their business aspirations a second chance together, Rutakangwa and Sewankambo had been consulting for multinational consumer goods companies that were looking to expand into African markets. In their work, they often encountered the data gaps. Government ministries and countries\u2019 chambers of commerce (did not have detailed information about consumer persona and behaviour in Africa\u2019s markets. While these offices might, for example, present data on what percentage of a country had electricity, they had nothing on how many homes exactly had power, or how many of them experienced power cuts each month, or how long these power cuts lasted. A solar company entering into many African markets would thus have little information to work with. Such gaps in the data cost businesses money in wasted marketing efforts, and make it tough for the continent to attract further investment.\n\nRutakangwa understands why these costly business errors occur: the data the multinational companies rely on\u2014often collected by market research firms\u2014is assumed African countries to be monolithic and did not provide companies with enough detail with which to make market expansion decisions.\n\nAnd so, when Rutakangwa and Sewankambo launched Rwazi, a Mauritian-based startup that provides multinational organisations with on-ground data to facilitate effective decision making, they decided that they\u2019d collate data that dealt in the specifics. \u201cI want to know the details,\u201d Joseph tells me, firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to tell me the market share of this [brand] is 75%. What is 75%? Is it 6,255 outlets? Is it 10,800? I don\u2019t want the percentage. I want the exact number, exact location, exact contact, and exact images [of these shops].\u201d\n\nDespite Rutakangwa and Sewankambo understanding the problems with multinational consumer goods companies accessing useful data, figuring out the most effective way to collect this data was initially challenging.\n\nAt first, they tried using retailers and sales reps to collect information. But both groups proved inefficient as they are incentivised to falsify the data\u2014retailers because claiming that they stock products they actually don\u2019t have gets them freebies from companies; and sales reps because success in their jobs meant reporting, always, that their products were in stores.\n\nThey changed their approach. They figured companies were trying to sell to consumers, not retailers or sales reps; only a consumer would be truthful about the availability of a product and their access to it. So, Rutakangwa and Sewankambo employed regular local consumers, called \u201cmappers\u201d, to collect the data from shops and households.\n\nThese mappers collect data within the neighbourhoods closest to them at any given time. Think Uber, but for data collection.\n\nIllustration: For shops, when a mapper signed up to the Rwazi platform receives a mapping order from a toothpaste company to find out how many shops around them sell toothpaste and what brands they carry, the mapper accepts the request, then proceeds to locate and count how many shops in the area sell toothpaste. They also document what brands they stock, and at what prices. For households, the mappers meet consumers in their homes and quiz them on the brand of toothpaste they use, why they use it, their experience using it, what it costs them, and so on.\n\nA mapper can only submit data while they are still at a shop or household. Every shop is already geotagged on the Rwazi platform. When a mapper submits the data, Rwazi verifies the information by checking that the shop or household\u2019s geocoordinates matches the mapper\u2019s current location.\n\n\u201cSynergy\u201d\n\nFor this story, I spoke to Rutakangwa and Sewankambo 3 days apart, but some of the things they told me could easily have been convergent thoughts from 2 people in the same room at the same time. The week of our conversation, they are in Los Angeles participating in the Techstars Accelerator, and they have been stunned by how differently from the rest of the world success for African founders is defined. They have met with Western founders whose startups make up to $3 million in annual revenue but who consider this feat modest. \u201cBack home,\u201d Sewankambo says, \u201cif you\u2019re making $3 million dollars [a year], you\u2019re a conglomerate!\u201d\n\nRutakangwa and Sewankambo have been friends for 7 years, having met as business management undergraduates on the Mauritian campus of the African Leadership University, where Rwazi\u2019s story first began to shapen. Their roles as COO (Sewankambo) and CEO (Rutakangwa) may state sharply defined responsibilities\u2014Sewankambo deals with operations and customer delivery while Rutakangwa\u2019s handles customer acquisition\u2014but they are not fussy about the demarcation. \u201cWe tend to switch, depending on who can do it faster or better,\u201d Sewankambo says. \u201cSometimes, I talk to clients, sometimes he talks to the operations team.\u201d\n\nThey both say \u201csynergy\u201d when describing their partnership, painting a picture of complementariness, where, during conflict, one founder\u2019s scepticism is another\u2019s faith. A few months into Rwazi\u2019s launch, they had begun receiving mapping orders from clients from outside the consumer goods industry\u2014medicine, pharmaceuticals, hospitality, fintech. Sewankambo was concerned about them servicing these orders that had nothing to do with consumer goods as that could mean Rwazi taking on work in industries they had no prior experience in. But Rutakangwa saw things differently: in principle, mapping data for hospitals and pharmacies was the same as mapping for beverage and liquor companies. They ended up accepting these orders, which they claim increased their revenue and client base.\n\nWhere next, after Techstars?By 2050, Africa will make up 25% of the world\u2019s population; Rutakangwa and Sewankambo have this at the back of their minds as they use the access granted by Techstars to court more US-based clients looking to understand consumer habits and trends in African markets, raise seed worth $3 million, and evolve Rwazi\u2019s product by incorporating machine learning and AI into it so it can perform simulations, make forecasts, and generate automatic reports. Today they have 20,000 mappers spread across 60 countries and over 100 cities; by the end of the year, they aim to onboard 1 million mappers spread across their current coverage.\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "A civil society group known as Centre for Reform and Public Advocacy has issued a 48-hour ultimatum to President Muhammadu Buhari and the Inspector General of Police to arrest and prosecute Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general election for allegedly supplying false information to the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC).\n\nAccording to the group, Tinubu lied in his EC9 form published by INEC when he claimed that he did not attend both primary and secondary school.\n\nThe Centre said the submission of Tinubu contradicted earlier claim, particularly the information he gave to the electoral umpire in 1999 in his form CF 001.\n\nKalu Agu, Legal Adviser of the group, at a press briefing in Abuja on Saturday said that the alleged offence is serious because it breaches both the Constitution and Electoral Laws.\n\nKalu disclosed that the group is drawing attention to the issue because the police was yet to respond to its petition since June 16, 2022.\n\n\u201cWe wrote a petition to the IG on June 16, demanding the prosecution of Tinubu for providing false information on oath in his INEC form CF 001 which he submitted in 1999.\n\n\u201cSince the IG is yet to act on the petition, we are using this press conference to call on the IG to do the needful; he is not above the law, nobody is above the law, Sections 191 and 192 makes it a criminal offence to provide false information on oath.\n\n\u201cWe are also calling on President Buhari to direct the IG to arrest and prosecute Tinubu for perjury, it is a very serious issue,\u201d Kalu said.\n\nHe threatened that if Buhari and IG failed to do the needful, the group in conjunction with other civil rights groups will approach a court of law for judicial review and order of mandamus to order the IG to do the needful.\n\nRead also: Photo story: Jubilation as Tinubu clinches APC presidential ticket\n\nAccording to Kalu, Tinubu had in 1999, claimed to have attended Saint Paul Aroloya Children Home School, Ibadan between 1958 and 1964 and Government College, Ibadan between 1965 and 1969, but turned around in 2022, to say that he never attended any primary or secondary school in his EC9 form.\n\nThe civil rights group\u2019s legal adviser, who quoted the ad-hoc report of the Lagos State House of Assembly, which investigated the former governor in 1999, pointed out that Tinubu clearly admitted discrepancies in his academic qualifications.\n\nHe said the investigation of Tinubu\u2019s academic qualification was the aftermath of a petition written by a foremost legal luminary and social crusader, the late Gani Fawehinmi, SAN.\n\nMeanwhile, the former Lagos State governor in his submission to INEC indicated that his certificates were stolen by unknown persons while he was on self exile.\n\nTinubu in his sworn affidavit in support of his nomination form, said he \u201cwent on self exile from October 1994 to October 1999 (and) when I returned and discovered that my property including all the documents relating to my qualification and my certificates in respect of paragraph 3 above were looted by unknown persons.\u201d\n\nThe APC presidential candidate jumped the information about his primary and secondary education as shown by the list of particulars of candidates for national elections published in the 36 INEC state offices and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nTinubu however, stated that he attended University of Chicago between 1972 and 1976 and obtained B.Sc in Economics and a B.Sc in Business and Administration, as well as certificate in Public Account.\n\nEfforts to get the reaction of the Tinubu Campaign Organisation proved abortive as Bayo Onanuga, its director of media and communication, could not respond to messages sent to him at the time of filing this report.\n\n",

          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has expressed regret at choosing Atiku Abubakar as running mate and eventual Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria between 1999 and 2007.\n\nObasanjo, who remnisced his life and feats both as a military head of state and as a democratically-elected president, stated that one of the costly mistakes he made in life was when choosing his number two when vying for Nigeria\u2019s presidential seat.\n\nAtiku Abubakar, an elected governor of Adamawa State in 1999 was picked by Obasanjo as running mate under the umbrella of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), giving way for Boni Haruna, Atiku\u2019s running mate to eventually become the governor.\n\nRead also: Don\u2019t wait for tomorrow, your future starts today, Obasanjo tells youths\n\nObasanjo\u2019s memoir \u2013 My Watch, revealed some alleged corrupt practices and involvement of Atiku while serving as Nigeria\u2019s Vice President\n\nAtiku, was linked with embezzlement of $20 million earmarked for the Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF) and other $125 million meant to fund PTDF in 2003 fiscal year as well as Atiku\u2019s corrupt practices with iGate, a firm and William Jefferson, a former Congress man that was later jailed for 13 years in the United States.\n\nThe former president, while answering questions from selected secondary schools that participated in the final of the National Exhibition and Awards organised by Students for the Advancement of Global Entrepreneurship (SAGE) at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) in Abeokuta at the weekend, declared that the mistakes concerning the selection of Atiku and his arrest by late Sanni Abacha, former head of state really impacted his psychology.\n\nObasanjo, who interacted with the students during the question and answer session, said, \u201cOne of the mistakes I made was picking my Number Two (Atiku Abubakar) when I wanted to become the president. But because it was a genuine mistake God saved me.\n\n\u201cThe second one was when Abacha wanted to arrest me. When Abacha wanted to arrest me, I was told by the American ambassador that they will arrest me and that America has asked that I should be given an asylum. I said no. It could have been a fatal mistake because I could have lost my life.\n\n\u201cI will say there are many things that could have been a mistake but God saved me from them all\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on opportunities for the youths to take over the leadership of the Country and stated that youths \u201ccan never come into power, if the current trend continues\u201d, saying with, \u201cNot Too Young to Run campaign, and you can see that those that are contesting now are between 70 and 80 years old, how can the youths run?\n\n\u201cAnother thing inhibiting youths from running is the amount of money involved in going into politics. I hope that things should not continue like this.\n\n\u201cI was 39 years old when I became the military head of state. 20 years later, I came back as Civilian President, but those there now do not want to allow the youths. If things continue like this, I do not know how you can come in\u201d, he said.\n\nOn religious tolerance, the former president, asked the students and Nigerians all over, to imbibe religious tolerance, just as he advised Nigerians not to see their religion as Superior to that of another person.\n\n\u201cI have no right to say what another man believes in is inferior to mine. If God had wanted all of us to be of the same religion, he would have made it so and since He did not made it so, no person should attempt to make it so.\n\n\u201cYoung people should learn at a very early get in life that if there are five religions in the world, that is how God wants it to be. If there are ten, that is how God want it. All religions originate from the same source.\n\n\u201cIf you are a Muslim and you did not live the way the God wants you to live, you cannot enter Aljannah (Paradise). Of you are a Christian and you did not live the way God wants you to live, the same thing, you will not enter Paradise.\n\n\u201cIf this is the basis of religion is doing the right thing for the benefits of mankind, you don\u2019t have to condemn any person because of what he believed.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that any religion is superior to mine and I don believe that mine is superior to another person\u2019s beliefs. I will not allow any person to cast aspersions to my religion and will not do same for another person. Practice your religion the way God wants you to do it and dont condemn another person\u201d, he concluded.",

It is the political parties themselves that has been given the locus to submit this particular list and in this case, there is no personal interference between the commission and the political parties.\n\n\u201cWe open the portal \u2014 what we called \u2018candidate nomination portal\u2019 \u2014 and we give an access code to the national chairman of each of the political parties that conducted primaries with which they upload the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates.\n\n\u201cSo, if a political party has uploaded the list and personal particulars of a candidate that did not emerge from valid party primary, INEC is not under a constitutional and legal obligation to publish the particulars of such a candidate.\u201d\n\nOkoye added that a candidate who was validly nominated at a primary, but whose name was excluded by the party, can seek redress from a competent court.\n\nHe also said the list published on Friday is not the final document for the 2023 polls, adding that the final list will be published at a later date.",

          "text": "Ahead of the 2023 general elections, the Center for Reforms and Public Advocacy (CRPA), has said that under the new Electoral Act 2022, running mates nominated by presidential and governorship candidates of various political parties are not subject to withdrawal or substitution.\n\nBoth presidential candidates of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, submitted placeholders with the hope to substitute their running mates later.\n\nBut in a statement released Saturday in Abuja by the Executive Director of the Centre, Ifeanyi Okechukwu, he said the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and the Electoral Act, 2022 make clear provisions on the yardstick for withdrawal and substitution of candidates, adding that the provisions as contained in Sections 28 and 84 of the amended Electoral Act 2022, relate to only the candidate \u2013 presidential and gubernatorial \u2013 and not their running mates.\n\nAccording to the statement, substitution of candidates by political parties becomes possible in cases of withdrawal or death of candidates and these are presidential, gubernatorial, Senate, House of Representatives and State Assembly candidates, who were nominated by political parties through valid primaries in accordance with Section 29 and 84.\n\n\u201cSection 33 of the Electoral Act says \u201cA political party shall not be allowed to change or substitute its candidate whose name has been submitted under section 29 of this Act, except in the case of death or withdrawal by the candidate: \u2018Provided that in the case of such withdrawal or death of a candidate, the political party affected shall, within 14 days of the occurrence of the event, hold a fresh primary election to produce and submit a fresh candidate to the Commission for the election concerned\u2019; and to conform with section 33, section 29 must be adhered to, to ascertain categories of candidates captured.\n\n\u201cSection 29 in subsection (1) says \u2018every political party shall, not later than 180 days before the date appointed for a general election under this Act, submit to the Commission, in the prescribed Forms, the list of the candidates the party proposes to sponsor at the elections, who must have emerged from valid primaries conducted by the political party.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo, it is no more business as usual, the current electoral law is very stringent in many areas especially methods of political parties\u2019 primaries, who are delegates, how withdrawal is done, how substitution is done and transmission of results, among others.\n\n\u201cThe current and subsisting electoral law does not capture a scenario that makes possible a substitution of associate candidates or running mates either by account of voluntary withdrawal or death. Subsequently, any substitution of running mates nominated by presidential and gubernatorial candidates comes flat in the face of the law.\n\n\u201cWhile this might not have been a deliberate oversight, it must be accepted that the law is sacrosanct and nothing can be added or removed from it unless through amendment of sections 31 and 33 to make provision for that in the future.\n\n\u201cUntil then, in accordance with section 31 which says \u201cA candidate may withdraw his or her candidature by notice in writing signed by him and delivered personally by the candidate to the political party that nominated him for the election and the political party shall convey such withdrawal to the Commission not later than 90 days to the election\u201d and section 33, only candidates who were nominated through valid primaries by political parties and whose names were submitted in accordance with section 29 can withdraw and be substituted under the law, not running mates that were not nominated through any primaries but by presidential and gubernatorial candidates.\u201d\n\nWhile commending the electoral umpire for the latest of the activity by the commission in ensuring that the 2023 elections meet with the requirements of the law as established by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Electoral Act 2022, as amended, the group, however, expressed \u201cconcern about the likelihood of infractions that are already being cooked by some political parties as it relates to the issue of replacement of their associate candidates or running mates in the presidential election.\n\n\u201cMany lawyers, legislative experts and even INEC have made it clear that what we are having are presidential running mates, which the Constitution and Electoral Act refer to as \u201cassociate candidate\u201d and \u201crunning mate\u201d and not placeholders.\u201d\n\nThe statement urged cautioned the INEC on \u201cthe catch-word of placeholders as being bandied by some political parties is not known to the law and that the law does not give a room for a substitution of running mates in the 2023 election guidelines.\n\n\u201cWe also wish to impress upon political parties that they must familiarize themselves with the relevant aspects of the new electoral law and avoid actions that are capable of causing infractions.\u201d",

We want to see them. I remember in 1999 when we had the election, when they pulled his paper that he filled with INEC, they now asked him to produce all the papers.\n\n\u201cHe said he went to Government College, Ibadan and Children\u2019s Home School in Ibadan, we went there we checked, what year? Nothing.

          "text": "Lincoln University, United Kingdom has banned Ike Ekweremadu from his duties as a visiting professor pending the conclusion of the organ harvesting allegation leveled against him.\n\nAccording to a report by Daily Mail UK, the ban was imposed by the institution following the arrest and subsequent arraignment of Ekweremadu and Beatrice, his wife, at the Uxbridge Magistrate Court in London for alleged plans to harvest the kidney of Ukpo Nwamini David, a minor, on June 23.\n\nDavid was said to have been trafficked using a fake passport.\n\nEkweremadu and his wife are accused of facilitating David\u2019s entry into the UK to transplant his kidney into their daughter who is suffering from kidney failure. The former Deputy Senate President of Nigeria was recently appointed a visiting professor of Corporate and International Linkages by the British school.\n\n\u201cVisiting professors are often, as is in this case, non-resident at the university, unpaid and advisory,\u201d a Lincoln University spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned about the nature of these allegations, but as this is an active police investigation, we cannot comment further at this stage.\n\n\u201cWhilst this matter is subject to investigation, this person will not be undertaking any duties as visiting professor at Lincoln.\u201d\n\nDavid claimed he did not know he was in the United Kingdom to donate a kidney until he went for a hospital appointment with the Ekweremadus. A doctor at the Royal Free Hospital in Camden, London, was concerned that David might not be aware he was a kidney donor. The doctor also doubted that the minor was 21 as his passport claimed.\n\nWhile appearing in court on Thursday, the senator and his wife, who is a medical doctor, however, denied trafficking David to the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cThe victim was 15. In Nigeria, he was approached by both defendants. He was homeless on the streets of Lagos. They deceived him and promised him a better life in the UK. He was given a passport for a 41-year-old. The passport was illegally obtained by these defendants,\u201d Damla Ayas, the prosecutor, told the court during the couple\u2019s first hearing.\n\n\u201cHe was provided with a medical travel visa saying the purpose of the travel was to provide medical treatment for the defendants\u2019 daughter who was undergoing dialysis about several health issues.\n\n\u201cIt was premeditated; it was planned. Blood tests were obtained in Nigeria and he traveled to the UK in February this year.\n\n\u201cHe was taken to several medical appointments, in particular, a medical appointment at the Royal Free Hospital, and was spoken to by a consultant about the organ harvesting for a kidney transplant.\n\n\u201cThe consultant was concerned about his actual age and was concerned he was not aware he was the donor of the kidney. He only found out that the purpose of his visit was for an organ transplant when he visited the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe Ekweremadus was arrested at Heathrow Airport as they attempted to board a plane to Turkey.\n\nDavid is now under the care of safeguarding authorities and the Metropolitan Police.\n\nFresh twist\n\nDavid\u2019s (the young man who was to donate a kidney to Sonia , daughter of Senator Ekweremadu) passport has emerged, indicating that he is 21 years old.\n\nAccording to information on the data page of Nwamini\u2019s international passport, which Ekweremadu provided in an introductory letter in the medical visa application submitted to the British High Commission in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital, he was born on October 12, 2000.\n\nThe date of issuance of the passport is indicated as November 4, 2021 while his date of birth is October 12, 2000. This puts the age of the passport holder in question at 21.\n\nBut under British law, being above 18 is not enough to be an organ donor, as the question of consent is another burden the Ekweremadus will have to discharge.\n\nYet, questions would remain with respect to whether the birth date on the passport is indeed his real age.",

It is the political parties themselves that has been given the locus to submit this particular list and in this case, there is no personal interference between the commission and the political parties.\n\n\u201cWe open the portal \u2014 what we called \u2018candidate nomination portal\u2019 \u2014 and we give an access code to the national chairman of each of the political parties that conducted primaries with which they upload the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates.\n\n\u201cSo, if a political party has uploaded the list and personal particulars of a candidate that did not emerge from valid party primary, INEC is not under a constitutional and legal obligation to publish the particulars of such a candidate.\u201d\n\nThe INEC spokesperson added that a candidate who was validly nominated at a primary, but whose name was excluded by the party, can seek redress from a competent court.\n\nHe also said the list published on Friday is not the final document for the 2023 polls, adding that the final list will be published at a later date.",

Why would we remove ours now?\u201d What is good for the goose is good for the gander!\u201d The President said.\n\n\u201cWhat our western allies are learning the hard way is what looks good on paper and the human consequences are two different things.\n\n\u201cMy government set in motion plans to remove the subsidy late last year. After further consultation with stakeholders, and as events unfolded this year, such a move became increasingly untenable.\n\n\u201cBoosting internal production for refined products shall also help. Capacity is due to step up markedly later this year and next, as private players and modular refineries (Dangote Refinery, BUA Group Refinery, Waltersmith Refinery) come on board.\n\n\u201cThe exchange rate is still susceptible to external shocks that can suddenly and severely affect Nigerian citizens. As we step up domestic production \u2013 both in fuel (enabled by PIA) and food (agricultural policies) \u2013 the inflationary threat shall diminish, and we can move toward unification.\u201d",

His 15 goals in 31 Bundesliga matches also helped Union Berlin secure a fifth-place finish and qualification for the UEFA Europa League for the first time since 2001-02.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited to be here at Nottingham Forest,\u201d said Awoniyi following his move to The City Ground. \u201cIt\u2019s always been my dream to play in the Premier League and having spoken to Steve Cooper about our ambitions and looking at Forest, with its great history, it\u2019s a club that I want to be part of.\n\nAwoniyi began his professional career at Liverpool, signing for the Merseyside club in 2015 before having loan spells at FSV Frankfurt, NEC, Mouscron, Gent and Mainz 05.

          "title": "Nigeria: President Can\u2019t Ask Court to Remove a Law He Signed, Supreme Court Says",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Supreme Court on Friday struck out the suit challenging section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 banning political appointees from voting at the primaries of political parties, for being incompetent and lacking in merit.\n\nThe Attorney-General of the Federation/Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, on behalf of the federal government, had filed the suit on the grounds that it violates the rights of political appointees and that it is in conflict with provisions of the constitution.\n\nThe section reads: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nIn a counter-affidavit filed by the parliament, the lawmakers argued that the constitution empowers them to make laws, and therefore, urged the Apex Court to strike out the suit instituted by President Buhari and AGF.\n\nThe apex court, in a unanimous decision described the suit as an abuse of court process and subsequently struck it out.\n\nAccording to Justice Musa Mohammed-Dittjo, who led a seven-man panel of the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs having earlier assented to the said section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022, cannot turn around to approach the court to strike it down.\n\nThe apex court faulted the federal government\u2019s request on the grounds that, \u201cthere is no provision in the Constitution that vests the President the power to challenge the constitutionality or desirability of a legislation after he has assented or denied his assent\u201d, especially in the instant case.\n\nThe panel in the unanimous judgment delivered by Justice Emmanuel Agim, agreed and upheld the submission of counsel to the National Assembly, Kayode Ajulo, that the suit is not one of such cases in respect of which the court\u2019s original and additional jurisdictions could be invoked under Section 23(2)(1) of the Constitution and Section 1(1)(a) of the Supreme Court (Additional Jurisdiction) Act 2002.\n\nThe apex court also disagreed with the plaintiffs that the suit was informed by the National Assembly\u2019s failure to give effect to President Buhari\u2019s request that Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act be deleted for allegedly offending the provisions of the Constitution.\n\nAccording to Justice Agim, the suit touched on the essence of the powers given to the President by Section 58(4) of the 1999 Constitution, which he exercised by participating in its making.\n\nJustice Agim held that since the President aided the creation of the Act, with the support of the AGF, both plaintiffs could not turn around to question its legality.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe Constitution did not provide for the involvement of the court by the President after exercising his powers under Section 58(4) of the Constitution one way or the other.\n\n\u201cI agree with the argument by the counsel to the National Assembly (Ajulo) that this suit is a reprobation of what the first plaintiff (the President) had approbated, and this cannot be allowed in law.\n\n\u201cHaven assented to the Electoral Bill 2022 and thereby accepted that it has become law, he cannot therefore bring a suit, contending that the act resulting from his assent is not constitutional, desirable and justifiable, thereby retracting from his assent.\n\n\u201cAs it is, one of the cumulative requirements in Section 1(1)(a) of the Supreme Court (Additional Jurisdiction) Act 2002 for the invocation of the additional jurisdiction of this court to entertain an originating suit between the President and the National Assembly does not exist.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiffs have no legally enforceable legal right or power that gives life to questions raised for determination in the originating summons, and that can be protected or enforced by the reliefs claimed for.\n\n\u201cThe dispute in this case does not involve any question or include the existence or extent of any legal right to the plaintiffs. Therefore, this suit cannot be entertained by this court in the exercise of its additional jurisdiction under Section 1(1)(a) of the Supreme Court (Additional Jurisdiction) Act 2002.\n\n\u201cThere is no part of the Constitution that makes the exercise of the legislative power of the National Assembly subject to the direction and control of the\n\nPresident of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe first plaintiff\u2019s (the President) written request to the National Assembly to amend the Electoral Act 2022 by deleting Section 84(12) therein, is a violation of Section 4(1) of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe court cannot be engaged in this kind of unconstitutional and illegal enterprise. The suit is therefore an abuse of the judicial process.\u201d\n\nHe further agreed with Ajulo that the court lacked the jurisdiction to entertain the suit, and added that there was no useful purpose to be served by determining the case on the merits.\n\nOther members of the panel \u2013 Justices John Okoro, Amina Augie, Mohammed Garba, Abdu Aboki and Ibrahim Saulawa \u2013 agreed with the lead judgment.\n\nPresident Buhari had in February this year signed the amended Electoral Act, 2022 with a caveat that the National Assembly deletes the said section in the interest of deepening the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nAlthough, the National Assembly had declined the president\u2019s request, it was not until Justice Inyang Ekwo of a Federal High Court in Abuja, restrained the lawmakers from acceding to the president\u2019s request.\n\nThe restraining order followed the suit and an exparte application filed by the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) asking the court to forbid the lawmakers from deleting the said section on the grounds that only a competent court can take such action.\n\nBefore the federal government\u2019s suit at the apex court, two separate individuals had approached both the Federal High Courts in Ibadan and Umuahia requesting the court to strike down the section for breaching the Constitution, adding that the constitution had already taken care of the qualification and disqualification of persons seeking political offices.\n\nWhile the Ibadan division of the Federal High Court, dismissed the suit on the grounds of jurisdiction because the plaintiff lacked the requisite locus standi to initiate the suit in the first place, the court in Umuhia, agreed with the plaintiff and ordered the striking down of the section and in addition ordered the federal government to delete it from the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the Court of Appeal in a judgment, set aside the decision of the Umuahia Federal High Court for want of jurisdiction, but agreed that Section 84(12) was unconstitutional and discriminated against a certain class of citizens (the political appointees).\n\nFollowing the conflicting decisions and confusion the three judgments of the Federal High Court and Court of Appeal had created, the federal government accordingly approached the apex court for an interpretation of the said section.\n\nHouse: Judgement is Victory for Democracy\n\nThe House of Representatives has hailed the Supreme Court for striking out the suit seeking to void the provision of section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nSpeaking to THISDAY, the House Spokesman, Hon. Benjamin Kalu described the judgement as \u201cunequivocally lucid, a victory for the advancement of democracy and the nation\u2019s rule of law.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the legislative supremacy of the National Assembly, and has also done that in the spirit of doctrine of separation of powers, understanding that the efficiency of government will be driven by this democratic principle where every arm stays within the parameters of their mandate and to become the best in their assignment.\n\nThe House Spokesman added: \u201cWe have not lost sleep from the time this matter went to the Supreme Court for interpretation, because we knew that what we put together was in consultation with the public that gave us their mandate. And what we came out with was a reflection of the consultation we had with the Nigerian people. It is all about advancing our democracy.\n\n\u201cJust like the mantra of the House has always been, \u201cNation Building a Joint Task\u201d the supreme court has restored the confidence of Nigerians in participatory democracy with the integrity of this judgement, delivered without fear or favor, but with Nigeria and Nigerians at the center of it all.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has reaffirmed the legislative supremacy of the National Assembly, and has also done that in the spirit of doctrine of separation of powers, understanding that the efficiency of government will be driven by this democratic principle where every arm stays within the parameters of their mandate and to become the best in their assignment.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, the Supreme Court has laid their own brick in the efforts towards electoral reform by this judgement. They have added their own bricks to Nation building through the electoral reform and electoral act 2022. So we are glad, and I\u2019m sure Nigerians ought to be glad.\u201d\n\nAlex Enumah and Udora Orizu in Abuja",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Friday published the particulars of the presidential candidates, vice presidential candidates, senatorial and House of Representatives candidates for the 2023 elections with the names of Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan and that of the former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, missing on the senatorial list.\n\nAlso Friday, INEC explained why some of the names submitted by the political parties were missing from the list published by the commission.\n\nLawan, Akpabio and Umahi, had been listed by the All Progressives Congress as candidates for Yobe North, Akwa Ibom North-west, and Ebonyi South senatorial districts, respectively.\n\nAll three had also contested the APC presidential ticket and lost.\n\nBut the leadership of the party decided to compensate them with the senatorial tickets in a manner not transparent.\n\nIt is believed that the three men were excluded on the list placed in various constituencies of the elective positions, because they did not emerge through validly conducted primary elections.\n\nLawan, who obviously did not participate in the Yobe North primary election had his name sent to INEC by the APC at the expense of Bashir Machina, who won the primary.\n\nIn Akwa Ibom State, an earlier primary election held on May 27 had produced Udom Ekpoudom, a retired Deputy Inspector-General of Police.\n\nBut the APC dumped Ekpoudom and allowed an illegal fresh primary that produced Akpabio.\n\nUmahi also had a primary election that produced his brother cancelled for a fresh one, but it was not recognized by INEC.\n\n\u201cLawan, Umahi and Akpabio are not on the list. I can confirm that to you.\n\nThey did not emerge through valid primaries and so, we can\u2019t accommodate them,\u201d a top INEC official told THISDAY Friday night.\n\nEkpoudom and Machina were also not listed by INEC for the elections.\n\nSpeaking Friday on a television programme, INEC\u2019s National Commissioner, Festus Okoye, said the commission was not under obligation to publish the names of candidates submitted by political parties if there are questions over the validity of primaries featuring such candidates.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you look at section 29 (1) of the Electoral Act 2022. Section 29 says \u2018every political party shall not later than 180 days before the date appointed for a general election under this act submit to the commission in the prescribed forms, the list of the candidates they are proposing to support at the election, who must have emerged from valid primaries conducted by the political parties.\n\n\u201cThe commission does not submit the list of candidates. It is the political parties themselves that has been given the locus to submit this particular list and in this case, there is no personal interference between the commission and the political parties.\n\n\u201cWe open the portal \u2014 what we called \u2018candidate nomination portal\u2019 \u2014 and we give an access code to the national chairman of each of the political parties that conducted primaries with which they upload the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates.\n\n\u201cSo, if a political party has uploaded the list and personal particulars of a candidate that did not emerge from valid party primary, INEC is not under a constitutional and legal obligation to publish the particulars of such a candidate.\u201d\n\nThe INEC spokesperson added that a candidate who was validly nominated at the primary but whose name was excluded by the party can seek redress from a competent court.\n\nHe also said the list published on Friday was not the final document for the 2023 polls, adding that the final list will be published at a later date.\n\nMeanwhile, INEC on Friday released the formal report on APC Yobe North Senatorial primary, confirming that Lawan did not participate in the primary held May 28 in Gashua.\n\nThe APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, had last Monday, while presenting the Ekiti State governor-elect (Biodun Oyebanji) to President Muhammadu Buhari, insisted that Lawan participated and won the primary election.\n\nBut INEC, in the Certified True Copy of the Yobe North senatorial primary election report issued to Bashir Machina, did not list Lawan as one of the participants and stated that Machina won primary election.\n\nThe INEC\u2019s report, sighted by THISDAY in Abuja on Friday, indicated that Machina scored 289 votes from the 300 delegates that took part in the election.\n\nThe report dated June 23, 2022, did not corroborate claims by Adamu that Lawan won the ticket.\n\nThe report was prepared by the Resident Electoral Commissioner in the Yobe State through the acting Head of Department of EPM.\n\nThe report read, \u201cThe Senatorial Primary for zone \u2018C\u2019 comprising Bade, Yusufari, Jakusko, Nguru, Karasuwa and Machina local government areas respectively.\n\n\u201cThe primary was held at the Government House in Gashua, the headquarters of Bade Local Government Area.\n\n\u201cThe Primary started by 11am as scheduled. Security agents and respective electoral officers of the affected local government areas were all present at the venue.\n\n\u201cThe primary was conducted by one Alhaji Danjuma Isah Munga.\n\n\u201cThe primary started with opening prayer from the Secretary of the Planning Committee, Alhaji Lawan Modu-Sheriff.\u201d\n\nThe results by INEC showed that 300 delegates were present and dully accredited.\n\nIt also indicated that the poll was conducted by open ballot.\n\nMachina had last Monday vowed not to step down for the Senate President, insisting that he won the primary and that he remained the candidate of the APC for the Yobe North Senatorial District for the 2023 National Assembly election.\n\nAdamu claimed that a primary was held and that Lawan purportedly emerged winner.\n\nInvestigation by THISDAY Friday revealed that Machina would file a suit to defend his alleged stolen mandate at a Yobe High Court next Monday.\n\nLawan lost the APC presidential ticket to Bola Tinubu and returned to his senatorial district for the party\u2019s senatorial ticket but met strong resistance from Machina.\n\nThere was apprehension Friday when supporters of Machina organised a solidarity protest where they swore that their candidate won\u2019t step down for Lawan, who has repeatedly represented the constituency since 2007.\n\nMachina had also written the leadership of the party last Monday, and vowed not to willingly relinquish his mandate.\n\nPart of the letter read, \u201cI write to reaffirm my continual aspiration as the All Progressives Congress unequivocal senatorial candidate for Yobe North Senatorial District, following my clearance and participation at the party primaries, where I pulled 289 votes out of the 300 total votes cast.\n\n\u201cI write to reaffirm that I remain committed to the mandate which I won at the primaries and I have not in form or manner communicated otherwise. I have been informed of a purported malicious and mischievous report and insinuation to the contrary.\n\n\u201cPlease note that I never at any time signed or communicated in any form any intent to vacate the mandate, which was won at the primaries.\n\n\u201cI am totally committed to my mandate and I am working towards delivering Yobe North Senatorial District to our great party, the All Progressives Congress.\u201d\n\nAdamu has however warned Machina, over his insistence on the party\u2019s senatorial ticket for the district.\n\nSpeaking with journalists in Abuja on Thursday, the APC chairman said the issues affecting the party on primaries were not unusual, adding that they had been resolved.\n\nHe said: If you don\u2019t know how to set a trap for a thief, the thief will set the trap for you. Machina should be careful; his issue is getting out of hand. As far I am concerned as chairman, my party did not violate any law.\n\n\u201cIs there any law that says you cannot contest for a position after contesting for another one. No law prohibits anyone from doing so.\u201d\n\nChuks Okocha and Sunday Aborisade in Abuja",
