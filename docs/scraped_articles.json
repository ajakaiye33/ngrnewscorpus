          "title": "Nine missing policemen return to camp after ISWAP attack",
          "text": "NINE police instructors reported missing after scores of Islamic State West Africa Province fighters attacked the Police Mobile Force Training College, Limankara, Gwoza, Borno State, have returned to their camp.\n\nA senior police officer confirmed to our correspondent that the men, who were earlier believed to have been abducted by the insurgents, found their way to the camp on Saturday.\n\nThe insurgents had launched a ferocious attack on the police college on Thursday, with many Rocket-Propelled Guns for almost two hours before they overwhelmed the beleaguered policemen inside the school.\n\nThe Borno State Commissioner of Police, Mr Abdu Umar, had confirmed the attack to journalists in Maiduguri on Friday but denied the abduction of the police officers.\n\nHowever, reliable police sources explained that nine out of the 21 instructors in the school were reported missing after the insurgents broke into the college when the policemen ran out of ammunition.\n\nOur correspondent was informed that the military failed to send reinforcements despite the fact that an army checkpoint was located not far from the school.\n\nShedding light on the attack, a senior police officer said the attackers came from three angles, adding that they would not have overrun the school had there been reinforcement.\n\nThe source stated that the policemen ran out of ammunition and later resorted to smoke gas which prevented the terrorists from entering the college for some time.\n\nHe said, \u201cFrom Gwoza town to Limankara is just 15km and there is an army formation there. The policemen said they called for reinforcement but there was no response. Nine instructors were kidnapped out of the 21 instructors in the camp.\n\n\u201cThe place wasn\u2019t fortified, the authorities only repaired the fence that was damaged by the terrorists during previous attacks. They were about restarting training there before this latest attack.\u201d\n\nAnother source said the school was not properly fortified, noting that the policemen could have successfully repelled the attack if they had a functional armoured tank.\n\nHe also lamented the failure of the military to send reinforcement, noting that help could have come for the policemen within five minutes.\n\nThe officer added, \u201cIf there was coordination among the forces, reinforcements can get to the training school within five minutes because there is an army checkpoint around that place. You know it is between Madagali and Gwoza, that place is the border between Adamawa and Borno but it is under Borno. So, there is a checkpoint close to the place. If the school has a standard armoured tank, there is no way the insurgents can breach the camp.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe senior officer recalled the short time reinforcements took during a peacekeeping operation in Mali.\n\nHe noted, \u2018\u2019When we were in Mali on a peacekeeping operation, when we called for reinforcement whenever we were under attack; from Bamako to our location is one hour, 45 minutes but within a few minutes, the reinforcement will be there. But in Nigeria, it is the next morning reinforcement would come.\n\n\u2018\u2019The instructors ran out of ammo and the insurgents were using RPGs and the policemen did not have any RPG. It was the smoke gas that helped the instructors to resist the attacks for some time. Rivalry (between the security forces) is the issue. Nobody came to the rescue of the men from 8pm when the attack started till around 10pm.\u2019\u2019\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Yemisi Suleiman\n\nIn a bid to attain the nation\u2019s first female president, a former Minister of Women Affairs, Iyom Josephine Anenih called on more Nigerian women to come out and be actively involved in partisan politics, noting that more female state governors should also emerge.\n\nAnenih made this call while delivering the lead paper on the theme, \u201cWomen in Leadership and Governance: Promoting Sustainable Economic Prosperity\u201d, at the 2021 MMS Woman of Fortune Hall of Fame (WoFHoF) Induction Ceremony held in Lagos recently.\n\nShe asserted that Nigeria wouldn\u2019t attain the transformational changes desired by patriots until a female president emerges.\n\nWhile encouraging women to be more involved in politics, Anineh debunked claims that women lack funds to attain the presidency in the nation.\n\nMMS Hall of Fame Induction 2021-2\n\n\u201cThe truth is that women can\u2019t be in the homes or the other room and expect to become president. No, it\u2019s not by appointment. We are making money in the private sector, so it\u2019s time to invest it in politics. We have very rich women and the assertion that there is no money isn\u2019t true,\u201d Anineh said.\n\nShe noted that women are already actively involved in politics because there is no way women could be on corporate boards as directors without some element of politicking, adding that it is time for them to play politics at the big stage in political parties.\n\n\u201cThere is no way you can have the leadership of this country without belonging to a political party. That is what our constitution says. There is no way Nigeria will appoint you President of Nigeria and no one will not appoint you Governor of your state. You have to come out and contest and you cannot contest unless you belong to a political party.\u201d\n\nMMS Hall of Fame Induction 2021-3\n\n\u201cSo, women, come out, join any political party of your choice, use the power, your energy that you are using to excel in the private sector, in your businesses to excel and come on top in the political party, then you can have a say, then, you can have a ticket to contest, then, you can become a Governor, then, you can become a President.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, efforts to use legislative means to get more quotas for women would be less effective when compared to active participation by women.\n\nOn her part, the BoT Chairperson of MMS Women of Fortune Hall of Fame (WoFHoF)Initiative, Mrs. Margaret Orakwusi stated that attaining a female president in the country is the dream of the Initiative even as she lauded the Founder of the Initiative, Kingsley Anaroke for celebrating women for more than ten years.\n\nHer words: \u201cWell, the elections are around the corner and it\u2019s time for women. Somebody said in Nigeria, money plays a huge part, but my position is that we have money because we have husbands and we have sons. Money should not be a problem. We should come together, we should identify those women who will take this country to the higher level and we need to.\u201d\n\nMMS Hall of Fame Induction 2021-4\n\n\u201cLook at what we are going through in this country, look at our children; drugs are taking over, wickedness, evil taking over. It is our responsibility because a bad child has a mother and as a mother, we are all mothers. So, please, we need to change the narrative, we need to key into Kingsley\u2019s dream and make it possible. Whatever it takes that women take over not just in politics, in commerce, and in everything, that we require to make this nation a great country.\u201d\n\nOrakwusi, however, noted that MMS WoFHoF has been promoting women in commerce, transport, and politics. \u201cIt is Kingsley\u2019s dream and I am sure I am right, to have a female President. He has always given us this beautiful platform to excel by identifying women who have done so much, who have excelled in their chosen profession not just in the maritime sector.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of the occasion, Princess Dr. Vicky Haastrup observed that Nigerian women had the capacity to provide solutions to the nation\u2019s problems, stressing that male presidents have failed the country since its independence.\n\n\u201cWe have got to that point where Nigeria recognizes that men have failed us. Women should take over by becoming President, Governors, and everything possible. We are getting there by the grace of God.\u201d\n\nHaastrup who is also the Chairman, Seaport Terminal Operators Association of Nigeria (STOAN) commended Mrs. Josephine Anenih for supporting Mrs. Patience Jonathan amid calls for 30 percent women inclusiveness.\n\n\u201cThe moment women in Nigeria become Governors, become Senators, how many women senators do we have in Nigeria? How many of them are in the House of Reps.? Things must change, women in Nigeria, you must rise up to the occasion. You must empower yourselves, you must be ready. We are not going to fight but we will slug it out with men.\u201d\n\nMMS Hall of Fame Induction 2021\n\nA former Assistant Comptroller-General of Customs, ACG Charles Edike stressed that the recent trend which has seen more Nigerian women as Managing Directors of commercial banks and other multinationals could easily spill into politics with the emergence of the first Nigerian female president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the day Nigeria will have a female president. There are many of them around the world and most of them have been very successful. It\u2019s time to give women the space. If we create an enabling environment for a Nigerian female president, we would be amazed at the wonders God will do with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen are being celebrated today because they are achievers and we expect that this celebration will spur them to do better. This will also motivate others to be successful in their respective fields. Women have proven to be better managers of human and financial resources. Purpose-driven women always make judicious use of their resources and they multiply it. God created them like that.\u201d Edike said.\n\nThe Founder of the MMS WoFHoF Initiative, Mr. Kingsley Anaroke reiterated that men have failed Nigeria for several generations.\n\nHis words: \u201cCan we try women? There may have been cases of one or two disappointments within the female folk. However, when you place them side-by-side with men, we have had more men failures than women. I believe in a woman for the presidency. A woman can lead and let the men guide. What we have done here today is to mainstream women in leadership and governance. A woman who finds herself in a corrupting environment wouldn\u2019t be as corrupt as the men.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking with MMS Plus on the sidelines, three of the 2021 inductees; the President of Women\u2019s International Shipping and Trading Association (WISTA) Nigeria, Mrs. Eunice Ezeoke, President of Jami\u2019yyan Matan Arewa (JMA), Hajia Rabi Musa Saulama, and a Governing Board Member of the Nigerian Institute of Management (NIM), Dr. Mrs. Yetunde Akinluyi affirmed that the time is ripe to achieve a first female Nigerian president.\n\nThe 2021 MMS Woman of Fortune Hall of Fame (WoFHoF) Induction Ceremony, which was held at the Golden Gate Hotel Ikoyi, was graced by top women in the nation\u2019s transport and finance sectors, as well as eminent female politicians, amongst other dignitaries.",

I can\u2019t wait for that night on the 2nd of January, 2022. I\u2019ll be performing many songs I\u2019ve never performed before so it\u2019s going to be super special.\n\nTell us about your latest album? What is the inspiration behind it?\n\nI made my sophomore album during the lockdown in 2020, with the sole purpose of giving my listeners a little peek into my life and personality. My debut was simply an introduction to my sound so I decided to make the next one a bit more personal and introspective.\n\nWhat is the inspiration behind your latest hit \u2018Peru\u2019, how did it come about?\n\nThere is no particular depth to it, to be honest. It was a drunken freestyle\u2014just a young man who had found himself in a foreign land and had decided to enjoy every single minute of his experience there. I was simply telling my truth in melody. I had just landed in San Francisco to pay a courtesy visit to my empire team in the studio. I met Shizzi there, told him to play me a beat and that was it. In 40 minutes, \u2018Peru\u2019 was born.\n\nAnd how would you describe the reception so far?\n\nAmazing! The song has gone on to become a global smash hit! Right now, it\u2019s my biggest song yet. I am super grateful to God, my team and to the fans, media houses, and every stakeholder of the afrobeat genre who made this possible.\n\nTell us about the remix with English singer Ed Sheeran, why Ed?\n\nWhen the team told me it was time to push Peru even further globally, I told them I wouldn\u2019t do a remix with just anybody, no matter how big they were. I\u2019m big on mutual respect and organic energy when it comes to collaborations, so I waited patiently till it came. When the opportunity presented itself, I knew Ed was the one for this song, because he genuinely loves the song and also because I have been a fan of his, for as long as I remember, so I connect with his sound. He made me fall in love with acoustic guitars, and then when we met and shot the video, the energy was amazing. I am super grateful to have him on this project.\n\nHow would you say your style has evolved since the beginning of your career?\n\nFor me, every album is a different era. LTG was the boyish lover boy who just wanted everyone to listen to his sound; APOLLO was the deep, reclusive guy in his introspective bag. This era is different. This is the guy who is more comfortable sonically, the guy who is out of his comfort zone, and more open to different possibilities. My next album will be my most commercial album yet.\n\nWho helped you most in your journey?\n\nOlamide, without a doubt, is a mentor and guide I can never replace. I am forever grateful to him.\n\nWhere and how do you get inspiration for your songs?\n\nFor me, there are no particular perimeters with music-making. As long as I can hear the sound and it\u2019s pleasing to me, inspiration and every other thing comes naturally, it just flows. I can\u2019t explain it.\n\nIs there a particular place where you feel most creative?\n\nAnywhere music plays. I like to constantly surround myself with music and anything that has to do with it keeps me in a constantly creative zone and headspace.\n\nDo you have any hobbies or interests outside of music?\n\nI love football a lot. I love playing and watching. Once a week, I play football with my friends, we even set up a sort of \u201cfootball club\u201d and yes, your guess is right, I am the captain of the team. I also love video games; it\u2019s one of those things I do to unwind. I don\u2019t like going out so it\u2019s mainly indoor activities I do to keep me relaxed. I love to read a lot, and occasionally I write poetry.\n\nWhat strengths do you have that you believe make you a great musician?\n\nSongwriting for sure, I think it\u2019s what sets me apart. I strongly believe that the ability to make music is more important than pure singing ability. Nothing beats being intentional with music-making, and no better way to make music than being an amazing songwriter.\n\nWhich famous musicians do you admire?\n\nI admire a lot of musicians for different reasons but three people stand out for me, and I consider them the foundation of my sound; Passenger, Jon Bellion, and Wande Coal. I admire them for the soul and honesty they bring into songwriting.\n\nWhat is the biggest problem you have encountered in the journey of music?\n\nThe complexity of human beings makes it so difficult to navigate this journey, but the passion and love I have for the craft makes it easy for me to overlook these things. We move, regardless.\n\nIf you could change one thing in the music industry in Nigeria, what would it be and Why?\n\nOur industry is beautiful at the moment, but I think we could do with a better structure. We are definitely getting there, we just need more time.\n\nDo you feel that you chose your \u201cpassion,\u201d or did it choose you?\n\nIt definitely chose me, because I thought my passion would be something else. In the middle of the chaos that was my life, music found me and I found purpose.\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t chosen your field, what would your alternate field have been?\n\nProbably a professional footballer or a professional writer, it\u2019s a weird combo but it is what it is.\n\nWhat accomplishments do you see yourself achieving in the next five to 10 years?\n\nFor myself and for afrobeat, I see myself becoming a bigger and better proponent of the genre, performing on the biggest stages, and becoming a legend.\n\nIt\u2019s Christmas, what does Christmas mean to you and what\u2019s your wish this Xmas?\n\nEven as a kid I was always indoors, probably reading a book or something. But I always loved the atmosphere Christmas brings. There is some sort of peace and joy in the air that I can\u2019t explain and it\u2019s beautiful to see. Right now, I\u2019m all about spreading positive energy and bringing genuine smiles to the faces of my fans and family, with music and genuine affection. My Xmas wish is for this pandemic to completely go away.\n\nTell us your New Year resolutions for 2022 and your plans for the year?\n\nI have no resolutions. As for my plans, I have a lot! I\u2019m having my first headline concert in January, and doing my first USA tour in February. In the 2nd quarter, I will be in Europe touring. After that, I\u2019ll start working on releasing my third album. I\u2019m almost done with it at this moment.\n\nWhat is your motto or good advice you live by?\n\nGood things take time, great things take everything.\n\nTell us a bit about where you were born, your growing up, and how that impacted your career today?\n\nI was born and raised in Ogun state. I grew up in Abeokuta, with my parents and two brothers. As the firstborn, I was always the quiet and responsible one. I never went out or had too many friends and it has shaped me into this reclusive creative. I like it that way, it helps me focus and it keeps me away from a lot of energy I do not need.\n\nWhat is one message you would give to your fans?\n\nThank you for staying with me through this journey. I love you and I can\u2019t wait for you all to experience my next album. Stay masked up this period, and stay close to your loved ones.\n\nHave a happy New Year.",

I can\u2019t wait for that night on the 2nd of January, 2022. I\u2019ll be performing many songs I\u2019ve never performed before so it\u2019s going to be super special.\n\nTell us about your latest album? What is the inspiration behind it?\n\nI made my sophomore album during the lockdown in 2020, with the sole purpose of giving my listeners a little peek into my life and personality. My debut was simply an introduction to my sound so I decided to make the next one a bit more personal and introspective.\n\nWhat is the inspiration behind your latest hit \u2018Peru\u2019, how did it come about?\n\nThere is no particular depth to it, to be honest.

          "text": "The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has said there will be no sit-at-home across the Southeast on Wednesday and Thursday next week.\n\nIPOB relaxed the sit-at-home due to the scheduled judgment of the High Court sitting in Abia State.\n\nThe court will on Wednesday rule on Kanu\u2019s fundamental rights suit.\n\nHowever, IPOB\u2019s spokesman, Emma Powerful, however, limited the sit-at-home order to Tuesday, when Kanu will appear before Justice Binta Nyako of an Abuja Federal High Court.\n\nPowerful explained that the decision was to allow people of the Southeast go about their lawful business as the court rules on Kanu\u2019s fundamental right suit.\n\nIn a statement he issued on Saturday, Powerful said: \u201cWe are the Indigenous People of Biafra IPOB under the command of our indefatigable Leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Following our Leader\u2019s upcoming court proceedings on the 18th, 19th and 20th of January 2022 next week, we wish to remind Biafrans that there will be only sit at home on 18th of January, and not 19th and 20th of January. In keeping with our avowed solidarity with our Leader, the entire Biafra land will be on lock down only on January 18 for obvious reasons.\n\n\u201cBiafrans should understand that 19th January is the judgment day in the suit by our Leader against the Federal Government which is pending before an Umuahia High Court. So, there will be no sit-at-home on that day.\n\n\u201cAgain, we don\u2019t want to compound the pains of our people, hence, we will limit the sit-at-home to only January 18. Biafrans and residents of Biafra are free to go about their businesses without molestations on 19th and 20th January. Anybody found enforcing non-existent Monday sit-at-home on 17th, 19th and 20th is criminal and must be treated as such, IPOB leadership have given order and that order is what signed.\n\n\u201cEverybody must be careful because this wave that is coming will consume many and every principal of IPOB mostly the coordinators must know that it will bounce on their heads if they don\u2019t checkmate the activities of members and call them to order. IPOB is not village or social club where everybody will behave untoward to people like cultists.\n\n\u201cIt is on the table and to the knowledge of IPOB leadership how some principal officers were encouraging evils in IPOB without minding the repercussions and consequences but we want to make categorically known to them that it will come back to him or her that encouraged evil against his or her fellow human beings\n\n\u201cFor clarity sake, we reiterate that there will be no sit-at-home on January 19th and 20th. Nobody is expected to interfere with either human or vehicular movements in those days under any guise. Any detractor or agent of darkness caught obstructing peoples activities in Biafra land on January 19th and 20th in the name of enforcing sit-at-home will regret his or her actions.\u201d\n\nPowerful disclosed that anybody seen enforcing sit-at-home on those days mentioned were not members of IPOB.\n\n\u201cAnybody issuing order for sit at home on 19th and 20th of January is not a member of IPOB. Such persons are working against the interest of our leader and the entire struggle for independence. They should be disregarded.\n\n\u201cFor the umpteenth time, IPOB is under one Central command and Control , and doesn\u2019t have parallel or factional leadership. The Directorate of State (DOS) under the command of our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, is in charge of the global movement of IPOB.\n\n\u201cAnybody who is not loyal to DOS is an impostor and should be disregarded.\n\n\u201cWe expect our people everywhere to adhere to this directive and refuse to be misled by sacked members of IPOB in Europe and America. IPOB remains unshakeable, built and rooted on the rock and will remain so until the freedom for Biafra is fully achieved,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "From Stanley Uzoaru,Owerri\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra(IPOB) has declared a sit-at-home on January,18 ahead of its leader,Nnamdi Kanu court ruling on his fundamental rights at an Umuahia court.\n\nHowever,the group has insisted that there would not be any sit-at-home on January, 19 the scheduled date for the ruling proper.\n\nIn a statement by the spokesperson of the group,Emma Powerful on Saturday,it noted that some disgruntled principal officers of the group is planning to thwart the directive issued by its directorate.\n\nPowerful while advising the people to shun any sit-at-home except that fixed for the 18,warned that the group would deal seriously with any member going against the laid down order.\n\nAlthough he did not state the reason for the lockdown on 18, he urged me!beds of the public to show their solidarity. He said \u201cFollowing our Leader\u2019s upcoming court proceedings on the 18th, 19th and 20th of January 2022 next week, we wish to remind Biafrans that there will be only sit at home on 18th of January, and not 19th and 20th of January. In keeping with our avowed solidarity with our Leader, the entire Biafra land will be on lock down only on January 18 for obvious reasons.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cBiafrans should understand that 19th January is the judgment day in the suit by our Leader against the Federal Government which is pending before an Umuahia High Court. So, there will be no sit-at-home on that day.\n\n\u201cAgain, we don\u2019t want to compound the pains of our people, hence, we will limit the sit-at-home to only January 18. Biafrans and residents of Biafra are free to go about their businesses without molestations on 19th and 20th January. Anybody found enforcing non-existent Monday sit-at-home on 17th, 19th and 20th is criminal and must treat as such, IPOB leadership have given order and that order is what signed.\n\n\u201cEverybody must be careful because this waves that is coming will consume many and every principal of IPOB mostly the coordinators must know that it will bounce on their heads if they don\u2019t checkmate the activities of members and call them to order. IPOB is not village or social club where everybody will behave untoward to people like cultists.\n\n\u201cIt is on the table and to the knowledge of IPOB leadership how some principal officers were encouraging evils in IPOB without minding the repercussions and consequences but we want to make categorically known to them that it will come back to him or her that encouraged evil against his or her fellow human beings\n\n\u201cWe realise that some unscrupulous and traitors are trying to create confusion about these days and dishing false information and propaganda trying to create confusion in Biafra land. IPOB never declared sit at home on 19th and 20th of January 2022. Therefore, we want all Biafrans to go to their normal business on these days without fear.\n\n\u201cWe expect our people everywhere to adhere to this directive and refuse to be misled by sacked members of IPOB in Europe and America. IPOB remains unshakeable, built and rooted on the rock and will remain so until the freedom for Biafra is fully achieved.\u201d Powerful stated.",

          "title": "2023: Yoruba spilt over 2023 presidency",
          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan and Sunday Ani, Lukman Olabiyi, Lagos\n\nMany pan-Yoruba socio-cultural and political organisations have stated their stance following the declaration, earlier in the week, by a former governor of Lagos State and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubh, to contest the 2023 presidential poll.\n\nThere are also claims in some quarters that pressure is being being mounted on the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, to also publicly declare his own intention.\n\nThe groups include Afenifere, Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE), Oodua People\u2019s Congress (OPC), the Agbekoya Farmers Society (AFS), and the apex Yoruba self-determination organisation, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO). So, if eventually Osinbajo gets to make public his own declaration, which of them, will the Yoruba as represented by these groups support? That was the question that Saturday Sun put to some of their leaders. National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Mr. Jare Ajayi, said: \u201cFor now, Afenifere does not have a position on any presidential aspirant. Our position is that the 2023 presidency must come to the southern part of Nigeria. The talk on whether we have narrowed it down to any part of Southern Nigeria has not come up at all.\u201d\n\nSecretary-General of YCE, Dr. Kunle Olajide, on his own part, told Saturday Sun, in a phone chat, that both Tinubu and Osinbajo have capacities to govern Nigeria very well. He noted that Tinubu has made his intention known that he would contest for the plum job, while Osinbajo has not made any such declaration. Asked the position of the Yoruba Council of Elders on the duo, he simply said: \u201cIt is premature to make comments on whom to support between the two of them. So, let us leave it like that.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nIn his contribution to the debate, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye, Communication Secretary, the Ilana Omo Oodua, under the leadership of Prof Banji Akintoye, said that the organisation would not support any presidential aspirant or candidate because it does not believe in the 2023 elections and it does not want it to hold, including the governorship polls in Ekiti and Osun States billed for later in the year. But he was quick to add that the organisation has nothing personal against Tinubu or any other person who wants to contest the 2023 presidential poll.\n\n\u201cOur position is very clear,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not believe in the constitution of Nigeria. We are calling for a sovereign national conference or a transition government that will preside over the conference, and we will discuss on our sovereignty. The Ilana Omo Oouda already said we want to leave Nigeria. So, when we get to the negotiation table, we will discuss how we want to peacefully exit Nigeria. So, we have made it clear that we are not interested in the 2023 elections. In fact, we are starting with Ekiti and Osun governorship elections. We will not participate in any election that will be conducted through the 1999 constitution. It is a rape on our people and a fraud.\u201d\n\nOther groups like Agbekoya Farmers Society (AFS) and Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) also made their intentions known. While the National Secretary of Agbekoya, Prince Adegbenro Ogunlana, said that the group did not care where the president comes from or who emerges as president as long the current constitution, which he said was foisted on Nigeria by the military, is not reviewed, Publicity Secretary, OPC, Yinka Oguntimehin added that the group\u2019s position on the future of Nigeria is clearly stated in their belief in restructuring. \u201cThat is why we root for regionalism as the best option for peace and stability in the polity. Even if an angel emerges the president of this nation today, without restructuring, nothing will change for better.\u201d Former Minister of Works and National Chairman, Southwest Agenda for Tinubu (SWAGA), Senator Dayo Adeyeye said that the 16 All Progressives Congress (APC) governors are solidly behind the presidential aspiration of Tinubu.\n\nHe disclosed this in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, on Thursday while inaugurating the parallel APC ward and local executives, adding that they have a keen interest in the actualisation of his presidential bid. In his view, former chairman of APC in Lagos State, Henry Ajomale, noted that although both have the rights to contest, Tinubu has always nursed the ambition to be president of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf Osinbajo happens to be Tinubu\u2019s political son and he installed him as the Vice President because he didn\u2019t want to be the Vice President and decided to wait for his turn to run as President, I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with that. Osinbajo is aware of this right from the beginning.\u201d\n\nThe Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), confirmed its endorsement of Tinubu as a presidential hopeful while noting that it fits into its long-term aspiration of having a Yoruba Muslim rule the country.\n\n\u201cThis is the time Yoruba Muslims need the support of their Muslim brethren all over the country to ensure that Tinubu emerges as the candidate of his party at the primaries,\u201d it said in a public statement. \u201cThey should also vote for him massively during the presidential elections to ensure that he emerges as the president of Nigeria to be sworn in on 29th May, 2023.\u201d",

          "title": "2023: Why South East must produce president \u2013 Asari Dokubo",
          "text": "Alhaji Mujadid Asari \u2013 Dokubo, an Ijaw nation freedom fighter, is a staunch supporter of former President Goodluck Jonathan. But in this interview with Femi Folaranmi at his country home in Harry\u2019s Town, Asari- Toru Local Government Area of Rivers State, he advised the former president not cave to pressure to contest the 2023 Presidential. Rather he said Jonathan should back any South- Easterner for the topmost job in the country.\n\nAsari- Dokubo who insisted that the South- East is the most qualified region to produce the Presidency in 2023, said the South- West has no right to contest after former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who he described as a mischief maker, had done eight years.\n\nRecently there was a face-off between former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Chief Edwin Clark on who owns the oil resources in Niger Delta. What is your take on this?\n\nGeneral Olusegun Obasanjo is a mischief maker. He makes mischief at all times. If Nigeria is a federation, the resources found in a place belong to the federating unit. In Zamfara, they are extracting their gold and selling, but Obasanjo is too afraid to talk. And I blame our leaders for what is happening. A situation when they brought amnesty, I told them this is wrong, that we are being criminalised but people jumped at the money. It is we that did not jump at the money; we that we did not expect it were regarded as betrayers. Those who accepted the money were celebrated. Our father, Chief Clark also celebrated these people, giving them accolades and so on. Now the chicken has come home to roost. Obasanjo is a mischief maker, the oil belongs to the people under whose land it is found and there is nothing you can do about that.\n\nYou are known to have been against a Buhari Presidency. Do you have any regrets?\n\nI did not support Muhammadu Buhari but people were supporting him. Even those who pretended not to support him supported. People were cutting deals. I was tagged being antagonistic, bearing in mind that I have more affinity with him than any of them. I am a Muslim for crying out loud. So for now I have decided that I don\u2019t want to be in that sort of situation where I would be on one side and other people would be enjoying and I would abuse him, and others would be cutting deals. I won\u2019t be in that sort of condition again. For me, since everybody is enjoying him, we are all going to enjoy it together.\n\nWhat is your take on rotational presidency?\n\nIn every heterogeneous society, leadership positions ought to be assigned in a way that every part of the society would feel a deep sense of patriotism and hold the state dear. But a situation where one party takes at the expense of others fraudulently, then there would be dissent and people would not recognize the authority. Like what is happening in Nigeria, if one section takes upon itself to rule at the expense of others, it would create resentment.\n\nIn your honest view, which of the Southern regions \u2013 South-East, South-South and South-West should go for the Presidency in 2023?\n\nIt should be South- East. They are the most qualified. It is the same thing we are saying. If we are accusing the North of grabbing power, why would the South-West go? Obasanjo has done this for eight years. Why would South-South go? Goodluck Jonathan has done six years. So it should be South- East.\n\nWhy South-East?\n\nBecause if we want national integration, if we want everybody to be on the same page, then why would we leave out the South-East? Since after the Biafra Civil war, no South-Easterner has become President or Head of State or Head of Government of any kind. So why should they be excluded if they are part of Nigeria.\n\nBut there are arguments in some quarters that the South- South did not complete its mandatory eight year tenure?\n\nIt is not the fault of anybody that Jonathan did not complete his two-term tenure. Jonathan sat down there with all the AK 47 and allowed himself to be chased away with sticks. It is not the fault of the South- East. Jonathan served, but he did not protect the Presidency. It is the truth. I am a Goodluck supporter but that is the truth.\n\nThere have been insinuations that Goodluck Jonathan is being pressured to defect to the APC to run again for president. What is your take on this?\n\nHow can Goodluck ever contemplate going to APC? That is why some of us have come to see ourselves as being foolish. How can Goodluck, after all the quarrel, abuse, some of his supporters starved, lost their businesses and suffered, then all of a sudden without any consideration, we are hearing through the social media that he wants to go to APC. Go to APC to do what? So his interests override all of our interests. All the sacrifices we made, lost our businesses, became hungry would be in vain.\n\nSo what is your advice to him?\n\nThere is nothing I can say other than it is in bad taste if he contemplates joining APC.\n\nSo if he goes to APC to contest, won\u2019t you support him?\n\nI have only one vote.\n\nAre you going to support him with one vote?\n\nI have only one vote. The one I supported, I am starving. Now I am not being consulted, I am not considered as being important to be consulted. I have not been told. So why should I make that sort of sacrifice. Buhari has stayed six years, I did not die. So if Goodluck comes for another four years, I would also not die.\n\nSo you will be backing a South-Easterner for Nigerian Presidency in 2023?\n\nYes, if a South- Easterner comes and he is serious. They are the most qualified people to contest.\n\nYou supported former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar in 2019.\n\nNo, I did not support Atiku.\n\nBut you rooted for him. I had an interview with you where you backed to get the PDP ticket.\n\nYes, I said he was the best the PDP could present. But during the election I did not support him. I didn\u2019t vote in the Presidential elections. I only voted in the governorship election. Atiku did not say anything that makes me feel if becomes President, things would change. He did not say anything to that effect.\n\nWhat if PDP presents him in 2023?\n\nI will still not vote for him, because up till now he has not said anything that would give us assurance that he meant well for Ijaw people.\n\nSouth-West is seriously clamouring for the Presidency through Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\nSouth-West has no right to clamour. It is this nonsense that should stop. They have no right, no reason whatsoever to clamour for the Presidency. Obasanjo ruled for eight years. When you assume that you are more important, more entitled than other people, it breeds problems. What makes South-West think they are more entitled than the South-East to be President? In 2015 it was almost 50-50 votes. So what votes do they have that they are bringing to the table? The South-East voted overwhelmingly for the PDP. South-West voted 50-50 for APC and PDP. So what gives South-West this entitlement mentality that they are more entitled than the South- East?\n\nWhat is your view on the spate of insecurity across the country?\n\nThat is what you get when some people feel they are stronger and can do whatever they like. That is the situation in which we found ourselves. President Buhari campaigned on the mantra that he is going to do this and that. And some of us were saying it is not possible. But they told us to shut up and were abusing us. It is this thing that makes you feel that you are more than others that triggers resentment and people pick arms to fight. This gave rise to people like Nnamdi Kanu to appear to put Igbos under bondage. This system creates monsters because there is so much lopsidedness in appointments and all the things that are going on and the people say it and you are not doing anything to correct it.\n\nComing to Nnamdi Kanu, don\u2019t you think a political situation would be the best solution? You were also incarcerated by Obasanjo.\n\n(Cuts in). I was incarcerated not as someone who was molesting his people.\n\nSo you want him to face justice?\n\nYes\n\nDon\u2019t you think that would be too harsh for him? A political solution would have been ideal to bring peace back to the South-East.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nSo what of the people that have suffered and died? Where is the justice for them?\n\nWhat is your view on Sunday Igboho?\n\nI don\u2019t know anything about Sunday Igboho. He might be a more honest, humane and considerate person. But Nnnamdi, I know him and I know what he is doing in Igboland. But I don\u2019t know anything about Sunday Igboho.\n\nAt what point did you disagree with Nnamdi Kanu?\n\nKanu said he is a god. He said Biafra is a Jewish State and that there would be no Islam. And I am a Muslim. If he says there would no Islam, he has said he is my enemy. That was how we parted ways. When Obiano was going for a second term, Kanu said there would be no election and I said the election would hold.\n\nWhat is your take on the quality of Ijaw leadership in all ramifications?\n\nI cannot assess the Ijaw leadership now, the reason being that I have not been participating in the activities for some time. I think the President of the Ijaw National Congress is doing well. But I cannot say the same about Ijaw Youth Council. I think that the IYC is dead. We now have a group of people who have turned our council, which we laboured, got injured and died for, into something else. It is terrible. For some of us, we are so pained with it. But what can we do? Majority believes that is what the organisation ought to be. That it should be a money making organisation. That it should be an employment bureau. So that is it.\n\nWhat is your assessment of the National Assembly members who are Ijaws?\n\nThere are few National Assembly members who are Ijaws. They are like a drop in the ocean. And most of them are doing their best. They are in the forefront fighting for the people. But the present leadership of the National Assembly is a rubberstamp, a total rubberstamp.\n\nYou were part of those that agitated for the establishment of the NDDC, but are you not concerned with the current situation?\n\nI am concerned. But as I am concerned, what is the majority view? Many prefer to go and collect peanuts. I don\u2019t want to be involved in all those things again. At times, you come to a realisation that all this while you were working your heart out, the people don\u2019t even acknowledge it. What do Ijaw people want? When Ijaw people make decisions on what they want, then we would all get up. I don\u2019t know what Ijaw people want. I cannot impose my will on Ijaw people on what I want. That would be dictatorial.\n\nWhat is your relationship with Former President Jonathan?\n\nI have seen him several times. We have a very good relationship. Whenever I want to see him, I see him and he treats me well.\n\nSo don\u2019t you think you would need to advise him on this rumoured 2023 Presidency?\n\nI will try and see him. Or rather he should invite me too. I am also a former President of the IYC. If I have not held any other position before, that qualifies me to be an opinion leader in Ijaw land. So if he wants to consult and if he has respect for me, he should call me.\n\nSo if he consults you what are you going to tell him?\n\nI will tell him not to contest. I will tell him that the South- East supported him and this is their turn and so we should join hands together to support a good person from the South- East.\n\nBut some Jonathan supporters believes he was pushed out because of his perceived favourable disposition to the South-East?\n\nJonathan was pushed out because he was too soft for Nigeria. Jonathan is a good man, a good man that did not want to harm anybody. Then people like Olusegun Obasanjo and others kept lying. Where is the list of snipers that Obasanjo talked about? Now he is not talking. Now it is not snipers but you travel on the road and you are kidnapped. Generals are being murdered, traditional rulers are being murdered, clergymen are being murdered; now Obasanjo has lost his voice. God has given Jonathan the position he is in today, let him stay where he is. If Goodluck comes, I would gain more. I might not meet Goodluck to give me something but there are some of my associates that would get into Goodluck\u2019s government, I would walk to them and get things easier than if a South-Easterner is President. But that is not important. I survived six years of Buhari\u2019s government. I did not die. So I can survive eight years of someone who does not know me. I should not take my personal interest above all other peoples. If we are talking about fairness in Nigeria, the people most entitled to the Presidency at this point in time are the South- East. Goodluck and all of us should join hands to support a good person that can bring everybody together and heal the wounds.\n\nSome of you were accused of benefitting immensely from Jonathan and were part of his problem that led to his ouster from the Presidency by turning the government into an Ijaw affair.\n\nJonathan is an Ijaw man. Is Buhari not a Fulani man? Who has accused Buhari? These are people that did not contribute anything. If anything happens in Ijaw land, they would be in the comfort of their homes. Are they better than us? What pedigree do they have? I am Amachree. My father is Justice Melford Goodhead. Have they gone anywhere we have gone? They stay in the comfort of their homes and talk rubbish. Where have they gone to suffer for Goodluck or done anything. Did they go to prison? Did I go to prison as a criminal? Who are they? How did we turn Goodluck into an Ijaw President? When wicked men like Obasanjo were lying, satanic lies, so people should keep quiet because it is Obasanjo? How did we make him Ijaw President? What did Goodluck do for me? I am gaining more now than I gained under Jonathan. I am getting more recognition than I ever got under Jonathan if that would strike you. I am being celebrated more than I was ever celebrated under Goodluck.\n\nWhat is your relationship with Tompolo and other ex-militant leaders?\n\nI am not an ex-militant leader. But I and Tompolo have a very good relationship, because as far as I am concerned, it is just the two of us that are on the same path. The others, I don\u2019t know what they are involved in. I don\u2019t really know what they are involved in. I know Tompolo and he knows me. We interact and have the same ideology, we might disagree in some areas but it is core Ijaw national interest that we stand for. Others, I don\u2019t know what they do or what they stand for. Most of them have confiscated the resources of their communities. They are the Alpha and Omega of controlling the oil resources of their communities. When it comes to standing for Ijaw interest, it is me and Tompolo. Maybe there are others, I don\u2019t have their names.\n\nYou had a running battle with Henry Okah on ideology\n\nYes Henry Okah is not different from Nnamdi Kanu. They are people that want to lead and take complete charge of things. I am not interested in such things. I am not in competition with anybody. As a journalist, you have known me over years. Even when I was fighting, you were in the camp to see me. When I was in the creeks, I allowed you to come. You have always been there. I am not in competition with anybody but I stand by my ideology even if the whole world goes a different way.\n\nRecently, Governor El Rufai said Nigerians should think about merit for the 2023 Presidency. Do you share this view?\n\nSo in Igboland there is no merit? How can El- Rufai evaluate merit? Who is he compared with the avalanche of scholars in Igboland? When Igbos are talking, the quota system too would talk. Is El Rufai competent? He has been in government living off government. It is we that have never been in government that should talk. When you talk about South- East and competent people, you are talking about people that have produced Azikiwe, Prof Dike etc. If Yorubas are talking with Igbos, we know two elephants are talking, not people that rely on quota system.\n\nYou are not known to be a politician, but which party do you have affinity for?\n\nI have an affinity for the Young Progressive Party (YPP).\n\nSo in a way you are rooting for Prof Kingsley Mogalu?\n\nHe is not a member of our party, He left our party. He used our platform and after, he left without anything. He is good riddance to bad rubbish\n\nSo what if he comes back\n\nWe won\u2019t take him. Our party would not take him. He looks down on other people. So who does he want to lead?\n\nPresident Buhari, in his latest interview, said he has done his best for Nigeria. Do you agree?\n\nYes, we knew this was going to be his best. We said it that this was going to be his best. We said it.\n\nHe said he does not expect praise from Nigerians\n\nWe are praising him for doing his best. We said it.",

K. Clark, Ayo Adebanjo, George Obiozor and Dr. Pogu Bitrus, reads: \u201cThe meeting extensively discussed various issues on the state of affairs in the country, particularly, the security situation, restructuring, preparations for the 2023 general elections and zoning.\n\n\u201cArising therefrom, the meeting resolved as follows: That the extant Constitution and Structure of Nigeria are grossly flawed and lopsided. Accordingly, Forum restates its demand for the fundamental restructuring of the country by enacting a new Constitution that would enthrone equity, fairness and justice. It must be One Nation, One System.\n\n\u201cCites that the northern part of the country would have fully enjoyed the office of the presidency of the country for the full statutory period of 8 years by 2023, hence, the presidency should rotate to the South.\n\n\u201cThat any political party that does not zone its presidential ticket to the South should not expect support from the four regions.\n\n\u201cTherefore, unequivocally, and in full resolve, call on all political parties in the country to zone their presidential tickets to the South.\n\n\u201cNotes that the basis of any viable democracy, especially in a diverse and complex country as Nigeria, is fair and even sharing of power.\u201d\n\nThe Forum also condemned \u201cthe senseless killings of innocent citizens across the country by terrorists and criminals, especially in the North-west zone\u201d and called on the government and security agencies to redouble efforts to safeguard the lives and property of Nigerians.\n\nSMBLF cautioned the National Assembly to only give consideration to Bills that would promote equity, justice, peace and national cohesion, \u201cinstead of issues that will exacerbate conflicts and crises in the country.\u201d\n\nIt urged governors and members of the National Assembly from the four regions to commit themselves to the subject of restructuring and reaffirmed its commitment to the unity of Nigeria, \u201csituated on the tenets of equity, fairness, justice, and the principle of federalism.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was held under the chairmanship of its leader and elder statesman, Chief Dr. E.

I hope God will listen to our prayers.\u201d\n\nThe President appreciated the Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, who brought the Grand Khalifa to Nigeria, saying:\n\n\u201cWe thank you for inviting them to come to pray for peace and stability in our country. We are grateful that they agreed to come.\u201d\n\nHe joined them in praying that God gives guidance and strength to leaders to be accountable and do right in all the things that they do.\n\nEarlier in his speech, Ganduje, while introducing the Khalifa and his delegation, which included the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero and Sheikh Dahiru Usman Bauchi, the leader of the Tijjaniyya Islamic Movement in Nigeria, said the government of Kano State invited the Tijjaniyya World Leader to the country to lead the faithful in prayer, considering the complexities around security in particular.\n\nAccording to him, the visit of the Grand Khalifa had also rekindled the old ties between the Tijjaniya and the many cultural and educational institutions in Nigeria.\n\nAlso speaking, the Tijjaniyya leader in the country, Sheikh Dahiru Bauchi and the Grand Khalifa, Tidjani Ali Bin Arabi extolled the existing cordial relations between Nigeria and Algeria and prayed for guidance and blessings for the country and its leaders.\n\nWhy Kano State Invited Arabi\n\nCommenting on the reason the Kano State Government invited the Grand Khalifa, Ganduje said it was aimed at developing a good relationship between Algeria and the city of Kano.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is a kind of rekindling of the relationship because Kano is an old civilization, with so many Ulama (Ismamic scholars) from Algeria hundreds of years ago, who came to Kano to assist the development of Sharia leadership in Kano State.\n\n\u201cSo, the invitation to the world leader of Tijanniyya Islamic Movement is a welcome development for the people of Kano State and for the people of Nigeria. We invited him and his team to pray for Nigeria for peace, stability and prosperity, and also to pray for peace and stability of Kano State and the whole of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are all aware of the security challenges we\u2019re having at the federal government and state governments levels; we are all doing our best. But praise to Allah subhana wa taala. He will also assist because Allah requested us to request from him, and he can grant us our request. So, as you can see, he was in Kano for four days. We were together until Friday prayers. In the Emir\u2019s Palace, he offered prayers and we had a grand occasion at Sani Abacha Stadium attended by many Ulama from all over Africa, from Nigeria, and from 44 local governments.\n\n\u201cLectures were delivered for peace and stability of this country and also, prayers were offered. Also, we decided to use the Tijanniyya Islamic Movement as a tool for building relationships. We organised a lecture with Bayero University, where we examined the history, the origin and the spread of the movement in Africa.\n\n\u201cAlso in Kano State, we constituted a committee with his team in order to look into issues of education, commerce, and agriculture. So, we have developed a very well-coordinated synergy in order to improve the quality of life of the people of Kano State. And by extension, we offered national prayers for peace and stability of this country.\n\n\u201cTo round it off, we decided to have a courtesy call with Mr. President, where they prayed for him, where they indicated the importance of the relationship between Algeria and Nigeria, and where they indicated their continued cooperation in prayers for peace and stability of Nigeria. That is what brought us to the villa.\u201d\n\nGanduje: Kano Has the Highest Number of Almajiri\n\nGanduje also stated yesterday that his state has the highest number of Almajiri children among the Northern states in the country.\n\nHe, however, stressed that most of the Almajiri, who are in millions, were not citizens of Kano State but from other states and neighbouring countries like Niger and Mali.\n\nThe governor, who spoke with newsmen at the State House, Abuja after meeting with President Buhari, said necessary steps were being taken by the state\u2019s government to resolve the Almajiri issue.\n\nAccording to him, the measures include introduction of compulsory free education up to secondary level, reformation of the Almajiri system of education in the state and repatriation of some Almajiris to neighbouring Cameroun and Niger Republic.\n\nGanduje said: \u201cBut as you will know, unless there\u2019s a universal legislation, preventing the movement of school-aged children from one state to another, it is a problem that will continue to be here for a long time because Kano is a commercial nerve centre of the Northern part of this country and also a commercial nerve centre of some West African countries.\n\n\u201cSo, you can imagine people coming to earn their livelihood. They usually come with children, but we have enacted a law, any parent that does not put his child into school will be prosecuted. So, now, we have established a whole agency that is now evacuating the Almajiri to their respective states. And those who are in Kano enjoy the free education facilities.\n\n\u201cThat is the effort we are making. But as I told you, unless there is universal synergy, especially among the Northern states\u2019 governors, where there is legislation preventing the movement of Almajiri from one state to another, Kano will continue to bear this problem.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Deji Elumoye and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe Southern and Middle Belt Alliance (SaMBA) has condemned the killing of 13 people in some communities in Tal, Banganje and Kalmai Districts in Billiri Local Government Area of Gombe State by suspected herdsmen.\n\nThe group in a statement issued yesterday by its Spokesman, Rwang Pam, berated the state Governor, Alhaji Inuwa Yahaya, saying his silence was a sign of nonchalance and disdain towards the loss of innocent lives of those he swore to protect.\n\nAccording to the group, the failure of security agencies to arrest the perpetrators of these killings is a clear sign of the governor\u2019s nonchalance.\n\nSaMBA therefore appealed to the conscience of members of the security agencies to fish out these killer-herdsmen in Southern Gombe.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cOur attention has been drawn to the killings in Southern Gombe by suspected Fulani herdsmen these past three weeks and the deafening silence from the Executive Governor of the state, Inuwa Yahaya. As the governor is aware, these attacks occurred just one week after an Intelligence Report by the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence (NSDC) was leaked to the public, that Fulani herdsmen had a secret meeting within Yamaltu terrain in Yamaltu -Deba Local Area and shared kola nut among themselves in preparation for the attack on the aforementioned locations in Billiri Local Government Area. Following this leak, Samuel Wabulari, the Gombe State Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, quickly denied the viral memo which suggested that Fulani herders had prepared to launch an attack on Billiri Local Government Area.\n\n\u201cIt is of grave concern that few days after that memo was leaked to the public, attacks were carried out in Tal, Banganje and Kalmai Districts, Billiri LGA, Southern Gombe State by suspected Fulani herdsmen. Based on reports received so far, the names of the 13 people killed in Billiri communities are Paul Ambore, Titus Marwa (Kolokkwannin Village); Nitte Kada, Zayo (Ayaba Village); Ibrahim Alhamis, Nitte Buba (Poshulte Village); Silas Shirwa (Pokuli Village); Nadab Na\u2019aman (Prison Service officer on Christmas break, Popandi village); Biryam Jeji, Buba Akadaya, Jacob Piyau Kwakbente, RSM Jonathan Dale (rtd) (Kalmai District) and Samaila Daulu Banganje District. Those injured were Salom Gideon, Samkong Samuel Bataliya, Julius Samuel, Paris Bitrus, Baba Lamido Kwarau, and Richard Iliya.\n\n\u201cAgainst this backdrop SaMBA is gravely concerned regarding the silence, the inaction and nonchalance of the Executive Governor of Gombe State to the killings going on in Billiri Local Government Area. The governor should be called to order; his attitude is not in sync with conduct expected of anyone occupying the highest office of Gombe State. There is no doubt that the governor has failed in his constitutional duties to protect innocent lives and properties of the Gombe people. He is making the situation worse by failing to condole with the family of the victims and people of Gombe State, the least expected of the occupier of the highest office in the State. The governor\u2019s omission is an act of negligence and dereliction of duty. The Inuwa Yahaya-led government must perform its primary duty of protecting the lives and properties of the people of Gombe. He must also provide immediate relief to the affected communities.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The situation we met on ground revealed several anomalies in the system operations at Area C.\n\n\u201cOn reaching the cells, we found them mostly empty, contrary to earlier reports of overcrowding. Even the detention board was wiped clean. The magistrate enquired as to the whereabouts of the 19 suspects previously in brief custody as at her last visit on Monday 10th January 2022, as well as eight others in prolonged custody since the 24th December 2021, totaling 27 suspects in all.\n\n\u201cShe was told that the suspects in custody had been released, to which she promptly demanded evidence of their release either in a letter, or their respective bail applications, or any other form of release records. Only one bail application covering two inmates was produced in respect of the eight which were detained since the 24th December, which left 25 suspects unaccounted for.\n\n\"The shocker was that the Station Officer had no record of these suspects, nor any statements obtained at the time of their arrest, showing that nothing had been done.\n\n\u201cFurther previous report from the magistrate on her engagement on Monday, revealed that the arrests were randomly done on suspects of all ages, charged with no particular offence, without being informed of the reason for their arrest, and picked up while going about their normal private lives. Not even their IPOs were known to them.\n\n\u201cAfter waiting indefinitely for the police records of release which were not forthcoming, our suspicions were raised as to the truth of the suspects\u2019 release. Some of us then quietly conducted a surprise search of the premises and found a room where some of the missing suspects had been hidden.\n\n\u201cThe magistrate had to embark on an exercise educating the officers on the need to keep such important, documentary records, and very briefly, gave a template on such guidelines.\n\n\"In another room where a female suspect was undergoing interrogation, it was discovered that she had been arrested since November 2021 and had been charged to court as an accused person, yet for inexplicable reasons was still sleeping in the cell as a suspect. This was a mother with children. There were others like herself being held beyond the acceptable time.\n\n\u201cA further search of the various floors of the facility revealed the other female suspects, one of whom was still a minor.\n\n\"It was also discovered in the process that some cases which the officers claimed had been charged to court were in fact charged to a court without a sitting magistrate.\n\n\"Several other suspects were also discovered, having been transferred from Ikorodu, and still being held beyond time.\n\n\"We were, however, able to gather the names and particulars of all the suspects we found in the Area C facility for immediate action on their cases.\n\n\u201cIn the end, and after several interrogations, we were able to come to the conclusion that all these anomalies result from the directives of the CP, who gave orders for the suspects not to be released or formally charged to court and who is fully aware of the consequent situation, and that the officers at Area C Command are only following orders.\n\n\u201cHopefully, the DSN can look into and remedy this situation with the CP, even as we follow up on the respective cases at the facility.\n\n\"It is important to note that if not for the provisions of the ACJL and the Police Duty Solicitors Scheme, we wouldn't have been able to discover these horrible activities perpetrated by the Nigeria Police.\u201d",

          "text": "After 6 months, the Nigerian government has lifted the suspension of Twitter operations in the country following approval by President Muhammadu Buhari. The removal of the suspension took effect from 12 AM Thursday, January 13, 2022.\n\nThe announcement was made on Wednesday by the Chairman Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement and Director-General National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi.\n\nAbdullahi stated that the approval was given following a memo written by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Ibrahim to the President. In the memo, the minister updated and requested the President\u2019s approval for the lifting of the suspension based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\n\nRecall that the Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operation on June 4, 2021, following the platform\u2019s decision to remove a controversial tweet by the Nigerian President, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The Nigerian government has insisted the suspension is a matter of national security and not related to the president\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to ban Twitter triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits filed against the Nigerian government; and national assembly hearings held to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nMy heart and tweet goes out to all the small businesses that lost revenue and opportunities during the #TwitterBan. May you find creative ways to recover speedily.

The execution timeline for the conditions begins from this week.\n\n\u201cConsidering Twitter\u2019s influence on our democracy, our economy, and the very fabric of our corporate existence as a nation, our priority is to adapt, not ban, Twitter,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn wake of removal of the suspension, Nigerians have come online to celebrate the end of an era of using VPNs to access Twitter. They\u2019ve also pointed out that the suspension was unnecessary and wonder if the removal was incentivised by the desire to use the platform to campaign for the country\u2019s upcoming elections next year.\n\nNot FG lifting the #TwitterBan 13 months to election, so they can come back and use this same social media to campaign.\n\n\n\nAffliction shall not rise a second time.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe#KeepitOn \u2014 QueenEsther Iroanusi (@QueenExtha) January 12, 2022\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Tarneem Saeed: The entrepreneur at the forefront of Sudan\u2019s economic renaissance",
          "text": "She left law in the UK, returned to Sudan, and built the largest online marketplace in the country. Now, she\u2019s building the biggest fintech startup in the country. How\u2019s Saeed doing all of this in Sudan, one of Africa\u2019s most conflict-torn political landscapes?\n\nIn the media, Sudan is often portrayed as an unstable country. In October last year, it made the news again; this time, not for the civil unrest that has engulfed the Northeast-African nation for the past 40 years but for alsoug, a marketplace startup in the country, which closed a $5 million institutional funding round.\n\nThis investment is the first of its kind since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period. So, it isn\u2019t only a big deal for the startup but for the entire ecosystem. It is a milestone that marks the beginning of a new era for business in Sudan.\n\nalsoug, founded in 2016 by Tarneem Saeed, is reportedly the biggest tech startup in the country; the funding round speaks to this fact. What is surprising, however, is that, in a conservative and conflict-torn nation like Sudan, a woman-led company is at the forefront of bringing Sudan\u2019s economy back to health.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTarneem Saeed and founding alsoug\n\nSaeed left Sudan for the first time when she was 14. Her father was a successful Sudanese businessman and her mother a top professional in the humanitarian space. At the time, the Sudanese educational system had gone to shambles, so Saeed\u2019s parents shipped Saeed and her brother to Canada to continue their education. From Canada, Saeed proceeded to the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) where she studied law and served as the president of the Arabic Society.\n\nShe worked as a corporate lawyer at Allen and Overy, a global law firm present in over 60 countries, for 4 years. In 2014, she took a sabbatical to visit Sudan to help a family friend put together a collection of coffee table books focused on Sudanese\u2019s artists.\n\nUpon getting to Sudan and staying a few days, she began to see how disconnected the country was from the digital economy.\n\n\u201cSudan felt so cut off from the world. It was like in the 1990s; people and businesses weren\u2019t harnessing the full power of the internet. Coming from London, Sudan just felt really empty,\u201d Saeed said. \u201cOne thing that irked me the most was how difficult it was to find out the price of anything. You had to ask someone to get the price of a car, house, and even cattle.\u201d\n\nThis didn\u2019t sit well with Saeed. Sudan has a staggering 64% of its population under the age of 24 and boasts a mobile penetration rate of 73%\u2014so, why was it still living in the 1990s?\n\nSaeed decided to do something about it. Throughout 2015, she and her small team were building a broker platform where people could check the prices of goods and services. In 2016, alsoug was launched as a classified marketplace.\n\n\u201cWe chose the classifieds model because Sudan was quite unstable and the internet wasn\u2019t great,\u201d said Saeed. \u201cThe beauty of the online classifieds platform, however, is that it doesn\u2019t require heavy tech, and you can do a lot on it while keeping costs fairly low.\u201d\n\nTarneem Saeed, founder/CEO of Alsoug\n\nIn 2016\u20132017, the telecommunication companies present in Sudan were in survival mode. They were cutting operation costs and not reinvesting in the country. As a result, the country\u2019s tech got old and any mass digital product had to be light so that people could access it with their 2G and not-so-strong 3G.\n\nalsoug continued as a classified platform where people would go to check out the price of things\u2014as Saeed had envisioned it\u2014and connect with sellers. Saeed and her team took to the streets to onboard offline merchants, educating them about alsoug\u2019s value. The team also doubled down on SEO since they couldn\u2019t advertise on social media because Facebook won\u2019t allow them to target Sudan. After a while, the platform started picking up momentum.\n\nAfter the success of the classifieds model, Saeed\u2019s thesis that Sudanese aren\u2019t suspicious of tech and would embrace it, if provided, was now proven, and it was time for alsoug to pivot into a scalable business model\u2014where the platform facilitates more than just discovery but also payments and fulfillment.\n\nA big problem is a big opportunity\n\nalsoug has pivoted into a marketplace that facilitates an entire e-commerce value chain, but there\u2019s a problem: there aren\u2019t any existing digital payment options to plug into. \u201cThere was no M-Pesa or Paystack,\u201d Saeed said, so the company couldn\u2019t process payments online and had to settle for cash on delivery.\n\nAfter using this model for a while, the company realised that they\u2019d have to build their own payment gateway. After all, this wouldn\u2019t be the first time they\u2019d build supporting tech from scratch: Saeed said they\u2019d earlier built their own SMS tool after a series of terrible experiences with some third parties.\n\n\u201cSo, we started looking into building our payment gateway, obtaining licenses, and talking to potential partners. Then we met Ashraf Sabry Fawry CEO and some other key shareholders, who convinced us that if we were going into the payment space, we\u2019d have to spend more money,\u201d said Saeed.\n\n\u201cWe realised we could build a payment network across Sudan. We decided to raise capital, but we were keen on bringing in adventurous VCs with high ethical standards who\u2019d understand that doing business in Sudan is a long-term play. It took a while to close, but it\u2019s worth the time.\u201d\n\nalsoug now has a payment gateway called Cashi that facilitates payments on its marketplace; and the company is also on the brink of rolling out its POS machines across the nation. What started as a buyer-seller matchmaking site has morphed into a full-blown e-commerce and fintech powerhouse.\n\nThe alsoug roadmap is very ambitious. However, building as a woman in Sudan is a tough call. This is not only true for Sudanese women, it\u2019s the reality of every female founder across the world.\n\n\u201cThere are places I can\u2019t go to and have to rely on male employees to go there. For example, I can\u2019t go to the car market because it\u2019s a male-dominated market and women aren\u2019t taken seriously there.\u201d\n\nAlsoug team at work\n\nSaeed also narrated how in most meetings with regulators or government officials, they directed their questions to her male employees rather than her. She, however, isn\u2019t deterred by this because instead of taking it as an insult, she\u2019s turned it into fuel driving her ambition. She said one way to look at it and not feel disrespected is to consider that Sudan is majorly an Islamic environment where it\u2019s believed that men should lower their gaze.\n\nAccording to Saeed, the company has managed to capture the biggest market share because of their operational strategy. Though there are some Arab marketplaces competing with them, they are not bothered. Over the years, a number of companies have come, launched, and then shut down within a short period of time. Before anyone knew what was happening Sudan had eaten them up whole and spit them out of its borders.\n\nThe Sudan market is tough, and what helped alsoug was building light as they grew; they didn\u2019t try to overweigh the market all at once. Now the market trusts them to deliver even on other fronts\u2014like fintech.\n\n\u201cNo one has managed to penetrate the offline market and sustain growth the way we have. We have gone from people throwing us out of their shops to them coming to us,\u201d Saeed said with a faint giggle. \u201cAt the beginning, a lot of people didn\u2019t understand. For example, real estate brokers thought we\u2019d come to steal their jobs, but when we encouraged them to get on the platform, they realised an increase in their sales exponentially in the course of a year.\u201d\n\nalsoug has used its empathetic offline education to turn competitors into customers and partners not only in the marketplace section, but also in the fintech division. According to Saeed, the company is not trying to compete with the banks, telecoms, and the budding fintech ecosystem; it just wants to fix the black holes by playing in a space where none of them is playing. \u201cDigital cash in and cash out,\u201d she said.\n\nSudan in retrospect\n\nTo really understand how much of a hard ground Sudan was and still is to do business in, a little context is necessary.\n\nSudan is the third-largest country in Africa: it has a landmass the size of Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Liberia, and Rwanda put together. But unlike other nations who have since moved on from their civil war days, Sudan is still stuck on hers.\n\nSince 1956 when Sudan first gained independence from the UK, there\u2019ve been only 11 years of peace. The initial attempts to build a parliamentary democracy in Sudan was met by coups in 1958 and 1969. However, in 1972, the Addis Ababa Agreement enforced a peace agreement between the government and separatist southern rebels.\n\nIn 1983, another civil war broke out when the military regime tried to impose Sharia law as part of its overall policy to \u201cIslamicise\u201d all of Sudan. The policy was pushed back by a rebel force called Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army from the south.\n\nThis event marked the end of the 11 years of nationwide peace but didn\u2019t mark the beginning of the conflict-laden nation that we know today. What turned Sudan to a bonafide hotspot, therefore, was the 1989 coup led by Omar al-Bashir, a politically and religiously extreme military leader.\n\nThe then ruling government and the southern opposition were reaching a compromise, but al-Bashir overthrew the government and declared himself chief of staff, prime minister, and chief of the armed forces\u2014positions he occupied for 30 years until 2019 when he was forced to resign.\n\nThe al-Bashir administration, in 1990\u201391, supported Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War. This made Bill Clinton to blacklist and isolate the country, and christen it a rogue state. Clinton also prohibited US investment in the country and reportedly sponsored neighbouring countries to repel Sudanese incursions.\n\nA little over 2 years since al-Bashir vacated the seat, the country is still in a mess. Abdalla Hamdok, the civilian prime minister installed to take the country back to democracy, resigned last week. The resignation that came amid further political deadlock and widespread pro-democracy protests has derailed the country\u2019s fragile transition into democratic rule.\n\nFor 50 years, the political landscape in Sudan has been everything but stable and peaceful.\n\nThis seems like a lot but no Sudanese story will be complete without the mention of years of horrific governments that performed a tribal cleansing on its people, starved and killed children, raped women, and rendered its citizens homeless in their country.\n\nSaeed returned to Sudan in 2014, the same year the international criminal court suspended its case with al-Bashir\u2014after two unsuccessful arrest warrants\u2014because of lack of support from the United Nations Security Council.\n\nSo, when Saeed says that \u201cif anybody built a thriving business in the midst of this persistent chaos that is Sudan, it is the alsoug team,\u201d she is right because it has been done and all the facts are there.\n\nThe vision that drives alsoug is bigger than any bottleneck. Apparently, the same passion that drives the CEO is what drives her employees\u2014building a company that makes life easy for every Sudanese and ushers the country into a prosperous era.\n\nalsoug has positioned itself as the answer to Sudanese intra-country commerce. It has provided a platform to sell and buy; an infrastructure that powers payment; and a logistics arm that fulfils last-mile delivery\u2014the three arms of commerce.\n\nSaeed is giving entrepreneurs in the country\u2019s nascent tech ecosystem and some government officials a fresh set of beliefs in building reputable businesses in the country. However, this is just the beginning because Saeed doesn\u2019t want alsoug to just be a champion in Sudan but also become a household name in Africa, like M-Pesa in Kenya, Flutterwave in Nigeria, Wave in Senegal, and even their major backer, Fawry in Egypt.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "ThankUCash targets the BNPL opportunity in Africa after raising $5.3m seed",
          "text": "Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), a short-term consumer financing that allows shoppers to purchase products online and pay in installments with nominal or no fees, is sweeping the global e-commerce sector. Afterpay, Klarna, Affirm, and Zip are some of the players leading this charge while tech and payments giants Apple, Square, PayPal, and Visa have their respective BNPL initiatives as they look to get a slice of the action.\n\nIn Africa, where most people are credit-averse, BNPL activity is just beginning to pick up. But there\u2019s a sense that consumers on the continent will embrace low or no-interest point-of-sale financing options, going by the rate at which Africans now take on loans at ridiculous interest rates to finance their needs. Last September, Australian company Zip acquired South Africa-based BNPL player Payflex, a deal that indicates Africa may be ripe for buy-now-pay-later services.\n\nA number of companies\u2014including neobanks, payment service providers, and traditional banks\u2014have already launched or are looking to roll out BNPL services in Africa. ThankUCash, a Nigeria-based multi-merchant rewards platform, this week said it has raised $5.3 million in seed funding, part of which it plans to spend on adding BNPL infrastructure to its suite of services, which already includes cashback on purchases and deals from merchants.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have gone into lending and it is gaining traction, but the main issue has been using the loans for other things rather than for why it was obtained,\u201d co-founder and CEO Simeon Ononobi told TechCabal. \u201cSo we had two options: build out the infrastructure for collecting and paying merchants directly (BNPL) or give out the tokens for such ourselves.\u201d\n\nConsidering there are already several companies offering consumer loans, ThankUCash decided to play in the infrastructure side of things. \u201cWe already have a merchant network and we will keep building it out, so why not use and extend that to our merchants?\u201d the CEO said.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThankUCash will provide the tech infrastructure that will connect merchants with loan facilities such that customers can pay directly for goods and services through its Super App, with loans. The company expects to kick off with the Beta \u201cin a few weeks\u201d, according to Ononobi.\n\nIn Nigeria, the majority of existing BNPL services are manual, provided by asset financing companies and sometimes merchants themselves. ThankUCash\u2019s platform will automate this process for its users and merchants. In line with its mission to build infrastructure that powers the emerging industry, Ononobi reveals the startup is currently approaching most players within the space.\n\n\u201cWe will have our machines in stores. So, as customers request loans, we generate a code for it; customers input it into the POS machine and the merchant gets credited directly. The code can only be used in the store chosen and only for the loan amount requested. Ultimately, the customer is buying straight from the merchants,\u201d Ononobi explained in a statement.\n\nThe opportunity to spread payment over an agreed period is sure to appeal to African consumers, especially in Nigeria where paying the total cost of acquiring high-ticket products at once has become more difficult, due to high inflation (currently at over 15%) and declining purchasing power. For merchants, embracing BNPL helps drive sales and bring in new customers.\n\nThankUCash has already signed a partnership with Nigerian fintech Interswitch to onboard all of the latter\u2019s merchants to boost its network. The company is also in talks with \u201cabout 7 other national and multinational banks\u201d for potential partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re opening this infrastructure to everybody and want to actually give that platform to loan companies,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Ononobi, Suraj Supekar (Chief Technology Officer), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP, Engineering), Connected Analytics, the parent company of ThankUCash, currently operates in 3 of Nigeria\u2019s major cities\u2014Lagos, Abuja, and Port-Harcourt\u2014with a staff strength of about 45 employees.\n\nThe startup claims to have recorded over 600,000 users, with more than 1,000 stores on its platform and processed $80 million-plus in transaction volume within 2 years. Part of the fresh capital will be used to scale operations to other cities across Nigeria, expand to Ghana and Kenya, as well as add a new remittance product.\n\nThe ultimate goal for ThankUCash, according to Ononobi, is to create sustainable solutions for small businesses and merchants to succeed while increasing customer buying power. \u201cThe vision for us is not just for our merchants to be happy because they are staying in business and making money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also want to make spending fun, because with us there is always an opportunity for you\u2014be it cashback, deals, BNPL, or remittances.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s problem is more about revenue management than managing it \u2013 Rewane",
          "text": "Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Financial Derivatives Company, Bismarck Rewane has differed with comments made by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed that Nigeria has a revenue problem and not an expenditure problem.\n\nAt the public presentation of the approved 2022 budget, Ahmed had decried the falling revenue of the Federal Government which has been compounded by erstwhile declining oil prices at the heights of the Covid-19 pandemic and as a consequence, the eventual shrinking of the Nigerian economy following the 2020 recession.\n\nShe followed up earlier forewarnings given to Nigerians to expect to pay more tax with actual amendments made to the Finance Act resulting in changes made to tax laws and in particular the addition of new taxes like the Sugar Tax which imposes a N10 VAT per litre on all consumed non-alcoholic and sweetened beverages even as the focus of the government is now geared towards opening up strata of new revenue generation sources to support the execution of the 2022 budget.\n\nNotwithstanding a 97.5 percent increase in the actual oil price to $79.31 per barrel recorded at the end of 2021 from a $40 oil price benchmark in appropriated 2021 budget, oil revenue fell 47.4 percent from that expected at the start of the year. This accounted for the bulk of the 74 percent decrease in expected Federal Government of Nigeria\u2019s Aggregate revenue which was N5.51 trillion as of November 2021.\n\nThe Minister while presenting the budget assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari, barring a pending amendment and/or virement request to be made to the National Assembly, had noted that the Federal Government\u2019s share of oil revenues was N970.3 billion representing a 53 percent performance of the prorated sum in the 2021 budget.\n\nRead also: Oil prices to decline in 2022, 2023 \u2013 EIA\n\nQuite notably, however, of all the Federal government revenue generation sources, only the Minerals and Mining, customs, Companies Income Tax (CIT), and Value Added Tax (VAT) revenue sources that comprised the non-oil revenue were viable. The federal government\u2019s share of this revenue source totalled N1.62 trillion representing a 118.8 percent over and above target.\n\n\u201cCompanies Income Tax (CIT) and Value Added Tax (VAT) collections were N718.58 billion and N360.56 billion, representing 115 percent and 165 percent respectively of the prorated targets for the period.\u201d Mrs Ahmed clarified during her presentation.\n\nRewane, therefore, finds it ironical that the federal government will have a revenue generation problem only.\n\nCommenting on the statement of the Minister at the Nigerian-British Chamber of Commerce (NBCC) 2022 Economic Outlook held on Thursday, Rewane stated that \u201cin addition to a revenue generation problem, there is a revenue management problem.\u201d He berated the government for the inability to save for the rainy days, allocate and put into productive uses the extra revenue generated by the economy even in times of wants.\n\nThis is as the Minister also disclosed plans to reduce the size of government\u2019s annual recurrent expenditure by cutting down on the workforce with fears in some quarters that this will exacerbate the current unemployment situation in the country which stands at 33 percent as of Quarter 4 2020 according to the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS)\n\n\u201cThere is a special committee, led by the SGF that is working on the review of agencies, with a view to collapsing them partly using the Oransanye Report. At the end of it, what we want to do is to reduce the size of government and also to reduce the size of personnel cost and part of it will be designing the exit packages that are realistic.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ahmed, the basis for the proposed cut down of the workforce was the dwindling revenue situation of the government. \u201cWe are revenue challenged. So everything we do, we can\u2019t put an exit package if you are not willing to cash it immediately. So, when you are asking people to exit by choice, you must be able to give them that package as they are exiting\u201d. She noted.",

          "text": "Apart from the coronavirus outbreak which adversely impacted the business activities of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, several government policies constituted a major setback to their operations and growth in the 2020 fiscal year.\n\nAccording to the 2020 National Survey of MSMEs report, released by Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) in collaboration with the National Bureau of Statistics, high fuel price, high taxes, high electricity tariff and high interest rate and insecurity led to a compulsory shut down of over 1. 8 million Enterprises across the country.\n\nThe Survey which was conducted in all the 36 States of the Federation and FCT, covered enterprises in Nigeria employing below 200 persons (i.e. nano, micro, small and medium enterprises \u2013 MSMEs) and aims to generate up to date data on MSMEs with a view to determining the effect of the recent socio-economic development as well as global occurrences like Covid 19 pandemic.\n\nDetails of the report obtained by BusinessDay shows that the total number of MSMEs as at December, 2020 stood at 39,654,385, with total assets valued at N8.41 trillion.\n\nA breakdown of the value showed that Non-residential building accounted for the highest value (N5.6 trillion) representing 66.9 percent, followed by residential buildings at N1.8 trillion (21.1 percent), while office Furniture 55.3 billion (0.7 percent) recorded the least.\n\nSimilarly, a breakdown of the total number of MSMEs showed that micro enterprises were 38, 413,420, while small and medium enterprises were 1,240,965.\n\nRead Also: GIZ, Edo empower 445 MSMEs with digital marketing skills\n\n\u201cThe 2020 National NMSME Survey Report revealed a significant shrink in the total number of NMSMEs in Nigeria from 41.5 million in 2017 to 39.6 mlllion in 2020, representing a 4.5% decrease.\n\n\u201cIn addition to government\u2019s unfavorable policies, other reasons for the drop in the number of NMSMEs cannot be totally divorced from the open global competitiveness that has had negative impacts on the NMSMEs and also the worsening case of insecurity,\u201d it stated.\n\nAccording to the report, the COVID 19 pandemic also had a great impact on MSMEs nationwide as most SMEs (53.2 percent) were temporarily closed while 37.3 percent of MEs were permanently closed.\n\nCommenting in the report, Statistician-General of the Federation, Simon Harry stressed the importance of MSMEs to the growth of the economy which is evidenced by its contributions to the Nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employment and exports over the years.\n\nHarry, however regretted that in spite of the contribution of the sector to economic growth, there are still challenges hindering its rapid growth and development and key among them is the dearth of robust, timely and reliable data on MSMEs.\n\n\u201cIt was in attempt to address this problem that the fourth round of MSMEs was conducted nation-wide so as to generate up to date data on MSMEs with a view to determining the effect of the recent socio-economic development as well as global occurrences like Covid 19 pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nDikko Umaru Radda, Director General/Chief Executive of SMEDAN, in his remark stressed on the need for more collective and sustained actions aimed at creating the enabling environment for NMSMEs especially in the areas of funding, compliance, infrastructure, technology and markets.\n\nHe said the new survey was necessitated by the need to provide realistic, robust and useful data to economic planners given that the previous reports in 2010, 2013 and 2017, had been outdated.\n\nRadda said, \u201cThis is an area that the agency has been assiduously working on to address even in the face of dwindling resources.\u201d\n\nHe said the absence of data that clearly profile NMSMEs or adequately explain the peculiar challenges they face in their operating environment, had been a major source of worry to SMEDAN.\n\nApart form businesses that were shut down, the sectors contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)declined. This is despite a marginal increase of 3.7 percent in the sector\u2019s employment within the period, there was however a decrease of 3.5 percent in the contribution to GDP in 2020 compared to 2017.\n\nAlso identified as a problem was the financial challenges faced by MSMEs, which was reported to be workers\u2019 wages and social security charges and rent.\n\nStates with the highest distribution of business enterprises in Nigeria are Lagos State (91,097 entities), Rivers State (84,613 entities) and Kano State (79,328 entities), while, states with the least number of enterprises were Bayelsa State (15,758 entities) and Kebbi State (17,305 entities).",

          "text": "Nigerians are now becoming an important asset to the United Kingdom (UK), especially its universities as the developed country has become more lenient in opening its borders to them.\n\nAccording to Information from the UK\u2019s immigration statistics government, in the top five nationalities, Nigerian nationals saw the largest increase of 368 percent in sponsored study grants compared in September 2021 from 7,860 in the same period of 2019.\n\nLikewise in terms of visas issued to the UK, Nigeria recorded a rise of 234.7 percent to 18,580 in the first nine months of 2021 from 5,551 in the same period of 2019.\n\nIn March last year, the UK government issued a Graduate Route post-study work visa. The visa helps bachelors and masters graduates to be able to live and work in the country for up to two years, while Ph.D. Graduates can live and work for up to three years.\n\nHere are five reasons why the UK is scouting for NigeriansBright TalentsNigeria is known to have a high intellectual capacity and this has reflected in the UK, where many in a highly-educated diaspora work in financial services, Information Technology, and the legal and medical professions.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria sees the largest increase in UK scholarships\n\nSome Nigerian outstanding individuals such as Oluyinka Olutoye, Joseph Ladapo, Njideka Udochi, Onyema Ogbuagu among others have worked hard to distinguish themselves and have earned the respect of their contemporaries in countries such as the United States of America, Canada, Australia, Europe among others.\n\nFor example, in 2016, Olutoye, a renowned foetal and pediatric surgeon successfully operated on a baby-in-utero. For this groundbreaking feat, he was appointed surgeon-in-chief at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in the US. He now leads one of the largest children\u2019s hospital surgery departments in the world.\n\nLikewise, in the literary field, 10-year-old Nigerian twins made waves in the UK United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2018, Hills and Wills Nwokedi, authored Dominik\u2019s Diaries (Grandma: Desperate Measures), a book written to inspire other children. The book has gained popularity in the UK.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s intellectual capacity makes it attractive to offer scholarships because their good result makes the schools in the UK look good, thereby making them get more funding and be more popular,\u201d Jennifer Oyelade, director of Transquisite Consulting, a UK and Nigerian registered Recruitment and Training Consultancy said.\n\nCheap LaborNigeria has one of the lowest minimum wages in the world. An average government worker earns $73 per month; this is lower than its African peers such as Morocco ($310), South Africa ($277), Ethiopia ($144) and Egypt ($174).\n\nThe country\u2019s low wage is often tagged as a non-living wage as it is not enough to meet the basic needs of people thereby affecting their standard of living.\n\nAlthough this may be a disadvantage to the country, the reverse is the case for the UK looking for cheap labour.\n\nLarge working PopulationNigeria\u2019s population of over 200 million is the most populated in Africa and it has been projected by the United Nations to become the world\u2019s third-largest population of 410 million by 2050.\n\nIts working population is also estimated to be more than double, while other developed countries would have reduced their working population.\n\nAccording to data from the population estimates and projections from US Census Bureau International Data Base (IDB), the estimated working age (15-64) population of Nigeria will increase by 120.8 percent in 2050, while the UK will increase marginally by three percent.\n\nOther countries like South Korea, Japan, Spain, Germany, China, Russia and Italy will reduce by 27.3 percent, 26.3 percent, 25.4 percent, 21.0 percent, 19 percent, 18.3 percent and 14.4 percent respectively.\n\nBrexitThe withdrawal of the UK from the European Union (EU) on 31 January 2020 (Brexit) made many businesses move their headquarters to the EU.The impact slowed its economy, causing some impact on jobs. Employers are having a harder time finding applicants. This has hit the low-skilled and medium-skilled occupations the most.\n\n\u201cBrexit created job vacancies at the middle and low level. So they need to fill those positions and Nigerians are usually the ones that fill those areas,\u201d Olugbenga Ogunbode, the chief executive officer at International Education Corporation Group said.\n\nHigh Diaspora RemittanceThe Nigerian diaspora community acts as an important asset in bilateral relations and development efforts.\n\nWorld Bank data shows that in 2018, the Nigerian diaspora in the UK transferred over \u00a32.8 billion in remittance payments to Nigeria, accounting for one percent of the country\u2019s GDP.\n\n\u201cThis figure alone illustrates the economic weight the UK-based Nigerian diaspora holds both in the UK and in Nigeria,\u201d the World Bank states.",

          "text": "Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Financial Derivatives Company, Mr Bismarck Rewane has projected Nigeria\u2019s financial services industry to grow by 8.32 per cent in 2022, going by the increased partnership and collaborations by Fintechs in promoting financial inclusion.\n\nRewane who spoke in a keynote address at the Nigerian Economic Outlook 2022 webinar organised by First Bank of Nigeria Ltd. on Thursday in Lagos, hinged the predictions on increased partnership and collaborations by Fintechs in promoting financial inclusion.\n\nHe added that there would be rationalisation and drift within the industry, stressing that Tier 1 banks would leverage their robust customer base and balance sheet size.\n\nAccording to him, there would be aggressive digital innovation and lending solutions as a well as possible mergers and acquisitions within and across tiers to boost capital structure.\n\nRewane said the manufacturing sector would likely grow by 4.70 per cent in 2022, while predicting that improved foreign exchange liquidity and increased product innovation would boost the sector\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cPlayers would benefit from volume and value growth. Top players (Nestle Nigeria and Unilever) will report profit growth of 20 per cent in 2022,\u201d he said. \u201cAgriculture sector is likely to grow by 1.6 per cent in 2022, an efficient rail system will ease logistics constraints and boost productivity.\n\nRewane added that the ICT industry would likely to grow by 9.72 per cent in 2022 with telephone penetration on the rise.\n\n\u201cThere will be surge in Fintech and mobile payments, while increased level of activities will be supported by 5G operations, the sector will consolidate within the year,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, telecom infrastructure will expand with cable acquistion. He noted that the nation\u2019s economic performance would be largely determined by the successful implementation of the 2022 budget and the newly approved five-year development plan.\n\nHe explained that the declining inflation would be positive for consumer purchasing power, adding that monetary tightening in advanced economies could trigger capital outflows.\n\nHe also said oil price would remain relatively stable, adding that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth would be sublime.\n\nAccording to him, in 2022, competition between traditional banks and Fintechs will intensify, while banks with constant innovation and regional diversification will remain resilient.\n\nHe further noted that reform could be impeded by political considerations and labour union activities within the year, saying that insecurity could prove tricky to contain and would become a political campaign tool for the opposition.\n\nRewane also said the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) would likely increase foreign exchange suppy to manufacturers to ease currency pressures.\n\nRewane stressed that pre-election spending would be positive for aggregate demand and would as well boost corporate performance.\n\nOn the exchange rate outlook he said, the CBN would likely step up efforts towards exchange rate convergence.\n\nHe also noted that political jitters would heighten foreign demand pressures in the fourth quarter of the year.\n\nOn the risk matrix in 2022, he listed policy reversal and delayed reforms, heightened social unrest spurred by high unemployment and poverty levels and financial sector crisis, among others as things to watch out for.\n\nEarlier in his opening remarks, Chief Executive Officer, FirstBank, Dr Adesola Adeduntan, said the webinar provided the opportunity to assess the performance of the Nigerian economy across key indices in 2021 and benefit from expert opinions on the expectations and forecast for 2022.\n\nAdeduntan said it would also provide excellent insights on the key factors that would shape both the global and local economic landscape in 2022.\n\nHe noted that in 2021 global outputs rebounded and recovery was strong following improved vaccination efforts, as well as support from the monetary and fiscal authorities.\n\nAccording to him, the fourth wave of COVID-19 omicron variant created some level of caution, impacting the activities of the fourth quarter of 2021 and leading to the push for booster jabs and reinstatement of COVID protocols.\n\nAccording to him, specific key lessons can be gleaned from the economic and related activities of 2021.\n\nHe noted that these lessons and other expected occurrences in 2022 were vital ingredients to the planning processes of the bank\u2019s esteemed customers and stakeholders.\n\n\u201cAs a Bank, we have a legacy of supporting the growth of businesses as the engine for economic growth and development in Nigeria and across Sub-Sahara Africa.\n\n\u201cIn line with our renewed vision \u2018to be Africa\u2019s bank of first choice,\u2019 FirstBank will take the lead in driving the development of the different sectors and industries within the economies where we operate to support overall economic growth and sustainability.\n\n\u201cAs a bank that is woven into the fabric of society, this webinar is further reinforcing our support and collaboration with stakeholders as we demonstrate our commitment and willingness to be the partner of first choice to our customers,\u201d he said.\n\nHe hoped that at the end of the webinar, participants would have gained valuable insights into the global and local economic direction.\n\nHe said the participants would as well understand how to strategically position their businesses and personal endeavours to harness the opportunities that would arise all through the year, NAN reported.",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe Federal Government has assured it will continue to equip students and citizens with ICT skills such as machine learning and artificial intelligence to facilitate ICT adoption in teaching and learning in order to prepare them for a future that will be strictly driven by technology.\n\nThe Federal Government gave the assurance at the commissioning of the Digital Nigeria Centre (DNC) by the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, who represented President Muhammadu Buahri, GCFR, at the event which held at Ijesa Muslim Grammar School, Ilesa, State of Osun, on Friday.\n\n\u201cI am aware that the programme was conceptualized to promote the availability and utilisation of ICT and resources of the Internet in teaching and learning in public schools in underserved, unserved and rural areas. In order words, this Digital Nigeria Centre has been designed to promote the connection of public secondary schools to broadband internet in Ilesa community, and the goal is to equip beneficiaries with 21st Century skills,\u201d Aregbesola said.\n\n\u201cMore concretely, the specific objectives of Digital Nigeria Centre include; increasing ICT literacy among school teachers and students, providing a platform for accessing online educational resources, equiping students with ICT skills, facilitating ICT adoption in teaching and learning and ultimately to increase pass rate in mathematics, English language and other science subjects.\u201d\n\nIn his speech titled, Digital Skills and Literacy for Jobs and Social Inclusion, the Minister described the thorough and timely execution of the project as significant and commendable, noting that it prepares Nigerians in advance with digital skill and literacy for a future that will soon be driven strictly by technology, saying some major auto makers have decided to stop the production of combustion engines in the next 40 years.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, at least six major automakers, including Ford, Mercedes Benz, General Motors and Volvo joined the governments of 30 countries in November last year to pledge to stop the production and sales of internal combustion engine cars by 2040.\n\n\u201cThe implication is that even a mechanic should be ICT compliant. Any mechanic that can\u2019t use ICT tools will find himself out of job. Indeed, in the next 20 years, anyone not ICT compliant may not be part of humanity again, considering that it will be impossible to function and interact with other humans,\u201d Ogbeni Aregbesola stated.\n\nThe Minister, also noted that the project is also a testament to the unwavering commitment of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration to deploying technology to better the citizens\u2019 quality of life and experience, saying It also goes to emphasise the preeminent role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for improving standards of living as a people.\n\n\u201cI would like to express my profound gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, for his relentless commitment in ensuring delivery of gains of democratic order to the generality of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cTo him, the welfare of Nigerians, especially our teaming youths remains a top priority for this administration. The continuous benefits the country has been deriving from effectively leveraging ICT to run governance more efficiently has been phenomenal,\u201d the Minister remarked.\n\nThe minister said according to a 2018 report by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), titled: Digital Skills Critical for Jobs and Social Inclusion, major technology breakthroughs in next 10 years will impact forms of work and the structure of labour markets as well as other aspects of life such as education, health, and agriculture.\n\n\u201cFrom a skills development perspective, the implications of technological change are expected to be profound, both for the re-skilling and up-skilling of our adults and for the education of the youth and children.\n\n\u201cIn this context, developing capacities for anticipating the changing needs for digital skills for work and life is crucial for all countries and that should be of interest to all of us,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, who was represented by the Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Nigeria Communication Commission, Prof. Adeolu Akande, stated that the DNC centre will no doubt help in fast-tracking the acquisition of digital skills required for the implementation of the digital economy drive of the Federal Government especially to the younger generation.\n\nProf. Pantami added that the digital skills which are a range of abilities and aptitudes required by users of digital devices, communication applications, and networks to access and manage information will also in-turn boost National Security and enhance National Growth and Progress.\n\nThe Governor the State of Osun, Mr. Gboyega Oyetola represented at the event by his Commissioner for Innovation, Science and Technology, Dr. Babatunde Olawale opined that Nigeria cannot be left behind by the digital revolution of the world noting that his administration also focuses on building a sustainable economy through e-government which is government is grateful to the Federal Government for siting the DNC project in Osun.\n\nResponding to the gesture of the Federal Government, the Principal, Ijesa Muslim Grammar School, Mrs. Ramota Ilesanmi, thanked the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Government for selecting the school for the project saying it will go a long way in meeting the ICT needs of not only the students, but select residents of the city.\n\nThe representative of the president subsequently announced the establishment of President Muhammadu Buhari N100 million Technology Empowerment Fund to create world class technology experts, targeting 2000 youths in the next two years in Ijesaland who will be provided with devices for training in different areas such as software development and design, amongst others.\n\nThe Digital Nigeria Centre (DNC) is a project facilitated through the Universal Service Provision Fund of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) under the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy.\n\nIn attendance at the event were, the Senator Representing Osun West, Sen.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has applauded the current National Assembly and particularly the leadership style of it\u2019s chairman, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan.\n\nBuhari\u2019s message was delivered by his Chief of Staff, Professor Ibrahim Gambari at a birthday get-together hosted Wednesday night by the Senate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu in honour of Lawan who clocked 63 on Wednesday.\n\nKalu and Lawan have been close friends since their school days at the University of Maiduguri in the early 80s.\n\nProfessor Gambari said the President sent him to deliver a congratulatory message and express his admiration about Lawan\u2019s personal achievements.\n\n\u201cThe third dimension of Mr President\u2019s message is to commend the celebrant for the very able manner in which he has steered the affairs of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cSome people assumed that the role of the Legislative arm of government is to oppose government. That is not the President\u2019s understanding.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly is an arm of government just as the Executive is. Just as the Judiciary is. That means the three arms of government are to work in a complimentary manner.\n\n\u201cTherefore Mr President view the kind of flare, the commitment, the passion, the constructive engagement with the Executive under his leadership, the cooperation with the Executive as a sign, not of weakness but strength.\n\n\u201cIt is easy to be critical. It is easy to be negative but it is a lot more difficult and more challenging to have a constructive engagement and cooperation with the Executive. But the beneficiary of such constructive engagement and cooperation is the nation.\n\n\u201cOne of the achievements is that we now have a budget that runs from January to December and Mr President has just signed the finance bill and budget for 2022.\n\n\u201cSo the President really commends the way in which he handles the affairs of the National Assembly and looks forward to many more periods of cooperation with your leadership,\u201d Professor Gambari said.\n\nSpeaking at the occasion, the Senate President passionately appealed to politicians irrespective of their political affiliations to work towards building consensus on critical national issues.\n\n\u201cPoliticians across board must learn to arrive and achieve and sustain consensus on issues. Our country first. You can\u2019t be President, you can\u2019t be Senator, you can\u2019t be member of House of Representatives, you can\u2019t be Governor, you can\u2019t be anything unless there is a country.\n\n\u201cSo we must build and sustain a consensus on certain fundamental issues about our country, irreduceable minimum below which nobody should go.\n\n\u201cWhether you are PDP or APC or APGA or whatever you are, because that will infringe on the very fabric of our country. So it is very important that we achieve that. Democratic countries elsewhere that are successful have largely achieved those kind of consensus.\n\n\u201cWhether you are Party A or Party B, if you are voted into office, there are certain things you cannot afford to do. Political capital can be made from anything but certainly not those kind of issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking the opportunity today to appeal to all of us, politicians across the country, across board, to work for our country to achieve consensus on certain fundamental issues.\n\n\u201cOur people look up to us. They do what we give them education to do. Sometime they go beyond what we think they will do. At times, it becomes much more costly to deal with the consequences or repercussions. I advise that we should build consensus.\n\n\u201cIn the Senate, we have been able to achieve some kind of formidable unity and consensus on what we must do for our country. We believe that this country can only be better if political leaders decide to do the right thing.\n\n\u201cRegardless of our political affiliations, in the ninth Senate, we have always approached issues mainly in national interest,\u201d Lawan said.",

          "text": "Nigeria will hope to make it two wins from as many games when they take on Sudan in their second Group D game of the Africa Cup of Nations at the Roumde Adjia Stadium on Saturday (today).\n\nThe Super Eagles got their 19th AFCON campaign off to a fine start with a 1-0 victory over Egypt in their Group D curtain-raiser on Tuesday.\n\nCarlos Queiroz\u2019s side were second best for virtually the entire game as a Kelechi Iheanacho wonder striker got the Eagles on the right foot in the 33rd edition of the AFCON.\n\nFresh off the back of the impressive win against the seven-time African champions, Nigeria now turn their attention to the game against Sudan, and know that a win will earn them a spot in the knockout stage.\n\nNigeria, who are seeking their fourth title, are now unbeaten in all but one of their last seven games in all competitions, claiming five wins and one draw in that time.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference ahead of the game, interim Eagles coach, Austin Eguavoen, said his side would approach the game against Sudan with all seriousness.\n\n\u201cWe all know what it means to win the next game and it\u2019s not going to come easy and I think the sooner the better for everyone,\u201d Eguavoen said.\n\n\u201cCameroon already sailed through to the knockout stages and we will try to follow suit. It is not going to be easy but that is our mission.\n\n\u201cWe are going to approach the Sudan game with all seriousness and a lot of respect as well.

          "text": "The Super Eagles of Nigeria and the Falcons of Sudan will clash today in their second match in Group D at the ongoing African Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon.\n\nThe Eagles are clearly the favourite to carry the day as everything favours them in today\u2019s epic clash.\n\nThe Nigerian side soared over the Pharaoh of Egypt 1-0 in their opening match in Cameroon while the Sudanese side played out a goalless draw with Guinea Bissau.\n\nCurrent form, history and everything favour the Eagles to win today. If the Nigerian side will play Sudan the way they played Egypt in their opening match, the Sudanese side will surely crash by many goals, but the Eagles can be complacent at times and if that happens today, there may be surprise.\n\nNigeria and Sudan have met 14 times with the Super Eagles winning eight of such encounters, drawing four and losing two.\n\nThe Eagles rank 5th in Africa and 36th in the world according to FIFA, while Sudan rank 33rd in Africa and 125th in the world.\n\nSudan have failed to win any match against teams currently ranked inside FIFA\u2019s top 50 since October 2014, though encouragingly for them, that win came against this game\u2019s opponents Nigeria.\n\nThe last time Nigeria and Sudan played was in African Nations Cup in 2018, which the Eagles won 1-0.\n\nThe only two times Sudan beat Nigeria were in an AFCON qualifier in 2014 reverse fixture in Sudan which they won by a lone goal after having lost 3-1 in Nigeria; the other time was 28 November, 1963 when Sudan won 4-0.\n\nBut today, there is no escape for the Falcons of Sudan as the Eagles set to to soar over them and qualify for the knockout stage.\n\nIt will be a shock if the Eagles do not win today. Even a draw will be a disappointing result for the Nigerian side.\n\nKey battle: Albeit without scoring, Moses Simon was instrumental against Egypt on Group D matchday one. He has seen three of his five goals in Nigeria colour come as their last strike, as have his two league goals for club side Nantes this season. He will be up against talented Sudanese stopper Ali Abdallah Abu-Eshrein, who kept a clean sheet on his AFCON group stage debut.\n\nHot stat: Nigeria have kept a first-half clean sheet in 23 of their last 25 AFCON group phase matches.\n\nPrediction: Super Eagles will emerge victorious today against Sudan.\n\nKick-off time: 5.00pm Nigeria time",

          "text": "The Indigenous People of Biafra has asked its members and supporters in the South-East to boycott social and economic activities on Tuesday in solidarity with their detained leader, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nAccording to the group, the January sit-in will allow Biafra agitators to show sympathy with Kanu, who will appear before Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court in Abuja on that day.\n\nIPOB, on the other hand, clarified that there will be no sit-ins on Wednesday and Thursday, stating, \u201cWe do not want to compound the pains of our people, so we will limit the sit-ins to only January 18.\u201d\n\nIPOB\u2019s spokesperson, Emma Powerful, said in a statement on Saturday that another court in Abia State was expected to deliver a judgment on Kanu\u2019s fundamental human rights filed by his Special Counsel, Barrister Aloy Ejimakor, on Wednesday.\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cWe are the Indigenous People of Biafra IPOB under the command of our indefatigable leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Following our leader\u2019s upcoming court proceedings on the 18th, 19th and 20th of January 2022 next week, we wish to remind Biafrans that there will be only sit at home on 18th of January, and not 19th and 20th of January. In keeping with our avowed solidarity with our leader, the entire Biafra land will be on lock down only on January 18 for obvious reasons.\n\n\u201cBiafrans should understand that 19th January is the judgment day in the suit by our leader against the Federal Government which is pending before an Umuahia High Court. So, there will be no sit-at-home on that day.\n\n\u201cAgain, we don\u2019t want to compound the pains of our people, hence, we will limit the sit-at-home to only January 18. Biafrans and residents of Biafra are free to go about their businesses without molestations on 19th and 20th January. Anybody found enforcing non-existent Monday sit-at-home on 17th, 19th and 20th is criminal and must treat as such, IPOB leadership have given order and that order is what signed.\n\n\u201cEverybody must be careful because this waves that is coming will consume many and every principal of IPOB mostly the coordinators must know that it will bounce on their heads if they don\u2019t checkmate the activities of members and call them to order. IPOB is not village or social club where everybody will behave untoward to people like cultists.\n\n\u201cIt is on the table and to the knowledge of IPOB leadership how some principal officers were encouraging evils in IPOB without minding the repercussions and consequences but we want to make categorically known to them that it will come back to him or her that encouraged evil against his or her fellow human beings\n\n\u201cFor clarity sake, we reiterate that there will be no sit-at-home on January 19th and 20th. Nobody is expected to interfere with either human or vehicular movements in those days under any guise. Any detractor or agent of darkness caught obstructing peoples activities in Biafra land on January 19th and 20th in the name of enforcing sit-at-home will regret his or her actions.\n\n\u201cWe realise that some unscrupulous and traitors are trying to create confusion about these days and dishing false information and propaganda trying to create confusion in Biafra land. IPOB never declared sit at home on 19th and 20th of January 2022. Therefore, we want all Biafrans to go to their normal business on these days without fear.\n\n\u201cAnybody issuing order for sit at home on 19th and 20th of January is not a member of IPOB. Such persons are working against the interest of our leader and the entire struggle for independence. They should be disregarded.\n\n\u201cFor the umpteenth time, IPOB is under one Central command and Control , and doesn\u2019t have parallel or factional leadership. The Directorate of State under the command of our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, is in charge of the global movement of IPOB.\n\n\u201cAnybody who is not loyal to DOS is an impostor and should be disregarded.\n\n\u201cWe expect our people everywhere to adhere to this directive and refuse to be misled by sacked members of IPOB in Europe and America. IPOB remains unshakeable, built and rooted on the rock and will remain so until the freedom for Biafra is fully achieved.\u201d",

We pray for the entire country to be stable, and if the enemies refuse to stop the carnage, we shall eliminate them,\u201d stated the former Lagos governor.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe believe in President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s ability to restore law and order and bring back our country to stability and tracks of development.\u201d\n\nHe was accompanied on the visit to Gusau by Kashim Shettima, former Borno governor, the former chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Nuhu Ribadu and former APC national vice chairman, South-west, Pius Akinyelure.\n\nMr Matawalle, who received the APC leader, said his visit would further console the bereaved communities.\n\n\u201cIt is my pleasure to welcome His Excellency, Sen. Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Jagaban Borgu, who has spared time out of his tight commitments to visit the state to commiserate with our people over the recent tragic incident of banditry attacks in some communities of Anka and Bukkuyum Local Government Areas,\u201d said the Zamfara governor.\n\nThe governor noted that the problem of banditry in the state had persisted for over a decade.\n\n\u201cWhen I assumed office in 2019, I made it my utmost priority to address this issue as no meaningful development could be accomplished in an atmosphere of insecurity. Considering the reality that the conflict is tied to ethnic fault lines, I initiated a dialogue and reconciliation programme, which leaders of thought overwhelmingly accepted all over the state,\u201d the Zamfara governor explained.\n\nWith dialogue and reconciliation, hostilities ceased for over nine months and \u201chundreds of kidnapped persons were unconditionally released by their captors,\u201d stated Mr Matawalle.\n\nHe, however, expressed sadness that the achievement became bad news for some \u201cself-serving politicians\u201d in the state.\n\n\u201cThey, therefore, perfected plans to sabotage the peace process. In some cases, security reports fingered them as having direct involvement in the planning and execution of kidnapping, ostensibly to embarrass the government,\u201d claimed Mr Matawalle.\n\n(NAN)",
          "summary": "Bola Tinubu, the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has promised that the federal government will wipe out Boko Haram insurgents and bandits terrorizing the country, while also announcing a N50 million payment to Zamfara villages recently ravaged by bandits.\nAfter commiserating with Governor Bello Matawalle in Gusau, Zamfara, Mr Tinubu announced the donation.\nThe APC national leader pleaded for continued prayers to help the state overcome its insecurity.\nMr Matawalle, who received the APC leader, said his visit would further console the bereaved communities.\nConsidering the reality that the conflict is tied to ethnic fault lines, I initiated a dialogue and reconciliation programme, which leaders of thought overwhelmingly accepted all over the state,\u201d the Zamfara governor explained.",

BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report examines some of the challenges faced by women in uniforms.\n\nHer release\n\nA source in the army had disclosed that the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt.-Gen. Faruk Yahaya, pleaded with the military authorities to pardon her in the spirit of the Christmas season.\n\nHe said Gen. Yahaya made overtures to the leadership of the armed forces, requesting that the soldier be pardoned. But despite the intervention, the COAS maintained that the erring soldier should be strongly reprimanded against engaging in any kind of act that contravenes the military code of conduct for its officers and men.\n\n\u201cLt.-Gen. Yahaya\u2019s \u2018appeal for mercy\u2019 for the female soldier may not be unconnected with the fact that the Christmas season presents an opportunity for persons who erred to be given clemency.\n\n\u201cThe Military authorities have considered the appeal of the Army Chief and ordered the release of the soldier to enjoy Christmas with family and friends,\u201d the source said.\n\nImmigration officers too\n\nSimilarly, three female officers of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) were in 2020 queried for partaking in Bopdaddychallenge (a trending dance competition on social media).\n\nAccording to the query letter shared by OluwaseunOwosobi, the founder of Stand to End Rape Initiative, the female officers were accused of indecent flaunting of their bodies and desecration of the NIS uniform in the video.\n\nThe letter stated that their action was serious misconduct liable to dismissal from service. The erring officers were asked to give reasons a disciplinary action shouldn\u2019t be taken against them.\n\nThey had shot a 57-second video to participate in a social media trend. Three of the officers were identified as Priscilla Irabor, Catherine Bakura and Blessing Udida.\n\nIn the video, the officers wore their uniforms, switching to mufti at every 12 to 15 seconds interval while dancing to \u2018Bop Daddy,\u2019 a recent song by Nigerian rapper Falz.\n\nA similar video uploaded on YouTube showed American service members changing their outfits while a soundtrack \u2018Don\u2019t Rush\u2019 played in the background. The officers did not face any disciplinary action by the authorities.\n\nBut the NIS in a query letter said the video \u201chas caused a lot of embarrassment to the NIS and in line with our standard as a paramilitary organisation is considered scandalous and an act unbecoming of an Officer and therefore a violation of Public Service Rule (PSR) 030401 and 030402.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a serious misconduct liable to dismissal from Service.\u201d\n\nThe officers were asked to present themselves to the authorities \u201cwithin 72 hours on receipt of the letter, why disciplinary action should not be taken against you for violation of the following: Immoral Behaviour, Sabotage and any other act unbecoming of a public officer.\u201d\n\nArmy lists offence\n\nExplaining why it arrested and detained Sofiyat, Army spokesman Brig.-Gen. OnyemaNwachukwu said the female officer violated extant military laws by getting involved in a public display of relationship with a paramilitary trainee, a corps member.\n\nHe added that the female officer violated the Nigerian Army\u2019s rules and regulations guiding the codes of conduct of military personnel when deployed for duty.\n\nAccording to him, Sofiyat violated some rules of the Nigerian Army, including indulging in an amorous relationship with a trainee; indulging in romance while in uniform; disobeying the Armed Forces standing guidelines and directives for the use of social media, among others.\n\nDefence\n\nHowever, a member of Sofiyat family who spoke to a national daily said she was shocked and joyful when she got the proposal for marriage and that was why she reacted the way she did.\n\nSpeaking on the condition of anonymity because of the nature of the matter, the close family member said Sofiyat and Remi had lost each other\u2019s contacts, but were surprisingly brought together by fate at the NYSC camp late November.\n\nHe said, \u201cThey have known each other before they got to camp. They met in Abeokuta over three years ago before she joined the Army, but lost contact sometime ago. So, their meeting at the NYSC camp was like a re-union.\n\n\u201cThey have been friends all along and Remi thought it wise to seize the opportunity of their meeting again to propose to her. He had to walk up to her as a man and not worry about her new status as a soldier because she would eventually get married. He got the courage and proposed to her with a ring which she accepted. The whole thing was totally a surprise to her.\n\n\u201cIt happened after the passing out parade on December 14, 2021. She was at the Mammy Market pressing her phone, she was just on her own and she never knew something of such would happen.\n\n\u201cWhen he walked up to her, she was over joyous and dumbfounded at the same time. She is a lady and her reactions were triggered by emotions. Like men, women are still emotional beings no matter who they are.\n\n\u201cRemi was not holding any phone and did not record the moment. He didn\u2019t post anything on social media and she didn\u2019t also post it on social media. It was the fellow corps members that did the posting on social media.\u201d\n\nLawyers\u2019 take\n\nIn a chat with this reporter, a former chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Barrister Chibuzor Felix, faulted the military authorities for the treatment meted out to Sofiyat.\n\nHe stated that it was imperative to remind leaders of these institutions that Nigeria was not under any military dictatorship, but under civilian democracy.\n\nHe also condemned the operations of the military in recent times, particularly with the way it illegally detained citizens for an indiscriminate number of days with scant or no regard to the provisions of the Constitution.\n\nHe stated that it was imperative to remind leaders of these institutions that Nigeria was not under any military dictatorship but under civilian democracy since 1999; that the provisions of the 1999 Constitution as amended, particularly Chapter 4, guarantee the right to personal liberty, right to a fair hearing, right to dignity, right to movement among others.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen one thought that we have seen the worst concerning Cute Abiola\u2019s case, yet another wild \u2018drama\u2019 in terms of brazen violation of a right of a citizen happened to one Private Hannah Sofiyat who accepted a marriage proposal from a male corps member.\n\n\u201cThe institution implicated here is the Nigerian military authority. Again, this young female officer is said to have violated military rules and regulations. She was detained after video clips of her being proposed to by a male corps member at the National Youth Service Corps orientation camp in Yikpata, Kwara state, went viral on social media. One Captain M.M. Abdullahi, Kwara state NYSC Camp Commandant was alleged to have ordered her detention in the detention facility in Ilorin pending further investigations.\n\n\u201cPart of the offence she is allegedly guilty of includes but not limited to an amorous relationship with a trainee, not yet eligible for marriage as she was expected to have served for three years before she can qualify for marriage and romancing while in army uniform plus other sundry offences.\n\n\u201cWhilst one cannot interrogate the rights of these agencies to maintain discipline in their organisations, one is astonished at the alacrity with which these citizens are thrown into illegal detention for an indiscriminate number of days with scant or no regard to the provisions of the constitution that guarantees several basic rights to the citizens including those who serve these security institutions.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cIn case those who are in the leadership of these institutions have forgotten or are not in the know, may we remind them that we are not under any military dictatorship but under civilian democracy since 1999. The provisions of the 1999 constitution as amended, particularly Chapter 4, guarantees right to personal liberty, right to fair hearing, right to dignity, right to movement etc. These rights are in existence and have not been abrogated.\n\n\u201cNo one today can be punished for any crime in Nigeria that is not properly defined by our Criminal or Penal Code. If these citizens who are employees of these institutions have committed any crime or breached any of their administrative rules or regulations, we demand fair, transparent and open trial process in accordance with the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which is the ground norm of our jurisprudence. Anything short of that is unacceptable, illegal, and remains questionable.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in a chat with Blueprint Weekend, a lawyer Kabiru Sanni, criticised the military for detaining a personnel just for accepting a marriage proposal.\n\n\u201cThe human rights community finds it difficult to accept the fact that a citizen can be taken hostage in an opaque manner and it has to take some days before the authorities could confirm that they are the one holding the citizen hostage in their facility.\n\n\u201cSo also is the idea of throwing a young military officer into detention simply because she accepted a marriage proposal which is approved by God and laws of the land.\n\n\u201cAssuming but not conceding that she breached any of their regulations, can she not be punished without throwing her into detention for an indefinite period? \u201cWhat makes her marriage acceptance too offensive that warrants these draconian measures meted out to her? Can\u2019t our leaders and institutions sometimes play the role of \u2018God\u2019 just as we see in other countries in forgiving people when their error is not too grave to affect national interest? Has the country descended into fascism and dictatorship where leaders are banishing joy, happiness and smiles as if we are in North Korea? Is Nigeria now the Banana Republic?\u201d\n\nOmokri\u2019s take\n\nLikewise, a Nigerian socio-political activist, Reno Omokri, lambasted the Nigerian Army for poor handling of the Sofiyat case.\n\nIn a post on his verified Facebook page on Tuesday, Reno said the Nigerian Army \u201cshould have promoted the love story as a recruitment tool\u201d to build more morale.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Nigerian Army, which is currently rehabilitating Boko Haram, is penalising Private Hannah Sofiyat for accepting a proposal from a corps member; is that not madness?\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army should have promoted the love story as a recruitment tool. They should have brought in the cameras and celebrated the couple. It would have built morale. But instead, they chose to punish love!\u201d\n\nDiscrimination\n\nMeanwhile, a group, Women Empowerment and Legal Aid (WELA), in a petition, noted that Sofyiyat has not contravened the regulation on the restriction of marriage for three years.\n\nIn the petition signed by FunmiFalana to the Chief of Army Staff, Farouk Yahaya, WELA stated that the restriction of female military personnel from contracting any marriage for three years upon enlistment, which is not applicable to male military personnel, is illegal and unconstitutional.\n\nIt stated: \u201c In the case of Women Empowerment and Legal aid v. Attorney-General of the Federation (2015), the High Court held inter alia; \u201cin the instant case, the discrimination is not as to the fact that women were not recruited into the police force, but that they were recruited and subjected to some restrictions and disabilities as regulation 124 is the requirement that a woman police officer cannot marry, until a written application is made to the Commission of Police, and the Commissioner not only approves request to marry but must approve the choice of the man to be married. This with all respect is bizarre.\n\n\u201cAny Law or Regulation that makes or attempts to make the Commissioner for Police a plenary Guardian or a Guardian Angel to make or approve suitors for female police officers is not only unlawful, but it is also repulsive to the right of the woman police officer as a human being to make her own self-choice of suitors without the intervention of the state machineries.\n\n\u201cThe most fundamental issue is if this is the policy laid down for the police, does it apply to the menfolk. It is not. So, it is only issued to women police officers because of their gender as women and it is very much unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nNigerians divided\n\nMeanwhile, the development stimulated controversies across the country as some Nigerians argued that the army had violated the fundamental human rights of the female soldier while others blamed Sofiyat for not respecting the uniform she was wearing.\n\nBumiBalogun said, \u201cI think the lady (soldier) has the right to accept the proposal but shouldn\u2019t be in public with an Army uniform or not outside with a camera. The Army is an organszation with unique rules and regulations with culture. I think that\u2019s gross misconduct in the military.\u201d\n\nAlso, Cecelia Phillip said, \u201cI think that is out of order, it tells a lot that while on duty she was having an affair with a Corp member. And in reality that behaviour does not reflect a positive attitude toward the military rules of engagement. She needs to face discipline in accordance with the army rules.\n\n\u201cI think why she was detained was because of the manner at which she displayed her happiness. Military personnel are not allowed to demonstrate excessive joy or happiness in a dictatorship government like that in Asia and Africa.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ishaku Dantani said, \u201cSeriously, she is above 18 and has the right to accept or reject love proposals, either public or private. The only thing that I can fault is using an army uniform but detaining her is the height of it. We need to wake up from the oppressive mentality in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso, Monday Ejale said, \u201cThe army is a discipline setting. She has a right to accept even a toddler for marriage, but hey, not with army uniform and in public? No. That is gross indiscipline.\u201d",

          "text": "The Super Eagles of Nigeria face Sudan in their second Group D match at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) on Saturday, eyeing a berth at the knockout stage of the biennial soccer competition.\n\nNigeria, three-time AFCON winners, had gotten off to a good start in the tournament following a 1-0 victory over record-holders Egypt in their first tie a few days back.\n\nThree points against the Falcons of Jediane at the Estadio Roumde Adjia, Garoua, will see the 2013 champions book a spot in the round of 16.\n\nNigeria\u2019s preparation for the competition had been marred with tussles over the release of players.\n\nWhile Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen, was left out based on health grounds; Watford did not release in-form forward, Emmanuel Dennis, a development that raised concerns among fans.\n\nREAD ALSO: [Egypt, Sudan, And Guinea-Bissau] How Tough Is Nigeria\u2019s AFCON Group?\n\nAside from player availability, the sacking of long-time coach, Gernot Rohr, less than two months before the tournament also cast doubt on Nigeria\u2019s participation. In his stead, former international, Austin Eguaveon, was named to handle the side.\n\nBut in their first game on Tuesday, the Eagles deservedly defeated the record-winners 1-0 after a dominant display.\n\nNigeria Key Men And Team News\n\nEguaveon\u2019s side have an abundance of attacking options to do the damage against Sudan. Iheanacho is expected to continue his goalscoring form in Saturday\u2019s game while winger, Simon Moses, who was a thorn to the Egyptian defence in the first match, has his work cut out for the day.\n\nMidfielder Joe Aribo \u2013 the provider of the assist for the goal against Egypt \u2013 will carry much of the team\u2019s creative weight while Leicester City\u2019s Wilfred Ndidi shields the defence.\n\nAhmed Musa, the team\u2019s captain, who missed the first game, could have a chance of adding to his international cap.\n\n\u2018Completely Focussed\u2019\n\nBut there might not be a change of guard to the lineup that featured against Egypt. Defender Kenneth Omeruo is also expected to be fit for the match after he was stretchered off the pitch on Tuesday.\n\nIn a pre-match briefing, Eguaveon said the Super Eagles will not be carried away with the win against Egypt.\n\n\u201cI am happy with the players and their ability to give their best on the pitch. I am focused on winning against Sudan at the moment,\u201d the 1994 AFCON winner said. \u201cI am not thinking about anything else or how we will start our third match. We are completely focused on our match against Sudan. Beating Egypt was not easy, and we are looking forward to continuing our victories and qualifying for the next round.\u201d\n\nSudan\n\nThe Super Eagles opponents are only returning to the continental fiesta since 2012 and will want to make a statement in a group containing some of Africa\u2019s soccer heavyweights.\n\nThey hosted the maiden edition of the competition in 1957 and won the AFCON in 1970 also on home soil.\n\nBut a lull saw them miss the competition for 32 years, only to qualify in 2008 as Ghana hosted the continent.\n\nIn 2012, the Sudanese reached the quarter-finals of the biennial fiesta, one of their best outings in recent years.\n\nEn route to Cameroon, they earned 12 points from Group C, beating South Africa to finish second. They also scored nine goals in the qualification series.\n\nBut just weeks before the tournament, Hubert Velud was dismissed following the country\u2019s poor outing at the 2021 Arab Cup. They lost all group games, conceded 10 goals but scored none.\n\nThe development, however, is not deterring new coach, Burhan Tia, who insists his young side should not be underrated.\n\n\u201cOur team is young, and we are building for the future. The spirit, ambition, and motivation will be our strong weapons in the tournament,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing impossible in football. The group might be strong, but with good preparations and concentration we will be able to make it to the knockout stage.\u201d\n\nHis team seem to be repaying his confidence in them as they battled hard to draw Guinea-Bissau in their first game. While Nigeria is a tougher opponent, the Falcons are hoping to give Nigeria a run for their money on Saturday.\n\nSudan Key Men And Team News\n\nThe Sudanese side will be missing the service Mohamed Abdelrahman who netted a third of their goals during the qualifiers.\n\nRamadan Agab, and Nasr Eldin El Shigail are the other men the Falcons of Jediane will rely on to cause a major upset against Nigeria. Sudan are ranked 33rd in Africa and 125 in the world.\n\nOpportunity For Youngstars\n\nTia will be banking on goalkeeper Ali Abu Ashren to continue his fine form when the match kicks off at the Roumde Adjia, Garoua. His sterling showing in the first fixture helped the Falcons earn a point against Guinea-Bissau.\n\nAlthough Coach Tia admitted that Sudan will miss Rahman, the team, he noted, can spring a surprise.\n\n\u201cWe play with a great team with high-level stars, but we will play with a balance between defense and attack,\u201d the coach told CAF ahead of the game.\n\n\u201cThe absence of Mohamed Abdel Rahman is impressive, but we have a number of young players waiting for an opportunity to appear.\u201d\n\nNigeria vs Sudan Head-To Head\n\nNigeria and Sudan have met 14 times at the international level out of which the Super Eagles won eight. Two of the games were draws while the North Africans have won twice.\n\nNigeria Vs Sudan Match Time\n\nThe game between Nigeria and Sudan at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nation (AFCON) will start at 5:00 pm (WAT).",

          "title": "Djokovic Detained Ahead of Deportation Appeal",
          "text": "Novak Djokovic has been detained in Australia ahead of a court hearing that will determine whether the unvaccinated tennis star can stay in the country.\n\nThe Serbian faces deportation after his visa was cancelled for a second time, with the government labelling the 34-year-old a threat to public health.\n\nHis lawyers are appealing against what they called an \u201cirrational\u201d judgement, with the hearing set for Sunday.\n\nDjokovic is still scheduled to play the Australian Open on Monday in Melbourne.\n\nIf he were to win the tournament, he would become the most successful men\u2019s tennis player in the history of the sport with 21 major titles.\n\nBut Sunday\u2019s hearing, which has been scheduled for 09:30 local time (22:30 GMT on Saturday), is crucial if Djokovic is to be able to compete just hours later.\n\nIf he loses the appeal, the world\u2019s top-ranked men\u2019s tennis player faces deportation and a three-year visa ban.\n\nOn Saturday, shortly after an online pre-trial hearing, Djokovic returned to the immigration detention hotel where he was held earlier this week. He will remain there until his final appeal on Sunday.\n\nAt the procedural hearing, Justice David O\u2019Callaghan set the time for Sunday\u2019s proceedings but said it was yet to be decided whether it would be heard by a single judge or a full court.\n\nDjokovic\u2019s visa was first revoked shortly after his arrival in Melbourne on 6 January, after Australian Border Force officials said he had \u201cfailed to provide appropriate evidence\u201d to receive a vaccine exemption.\n\nThe tennis star was detained for days at an immigration hotel, before his visa was reinstated by a judge, who ordered his release, ruling that border officials ignored correct procedure when he arrived.\n\nBut on Friday evening, Mr Hawke once again cancelled Djokovic\u2019s visa under separate powers in Australia\u2019s Migration Act.\n\nThe act allows him to deport anyone he deems a potential risk to \u201cthe health, safety or good order of the Australian community\u201d.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said the decision followed \u201ccareful consideration\u201d.\n\nAlluding to the heavy criticism his government has faced for allowing the unvaccinated player into Australia, Mr Morrison said: \u201cAustralians have made many sacrifices during this pandemic, and they rightly expect the result of those sacrifices to be protected.\u201d\n\nBigger than sport\n\nMinutes after we started reporting the news of Djokovic\u2019s second visa cancellation, motorists leaned from car windows, honking their horns and shouting their approval.\n\nMost people I\u2019ve spoken to are pretty outraged that an unvaccinated player was ever allowed here in the first place.\n\nOthers have a more nuanced view. Sure, this is a shambles, they say, but the government overturning the ruling of an independent judge is pretty questionable too.\n\nIt\u2019s clear, then, that this is not just about sport. It\u2019s headline news and a major topic of conversation.\n\nAnd the background is important, too, as Australia struggles with Covid-19.\n\nMany people are getting jabbed after months of living under strict restrictions. Intensive care wards are filling up, daily deaths have hit record levels, and some might say you\u2019ve got less chance of finding a Covid test kit in a pharmacy than Djokovic has of playing on Monday.\n\nGiven the seriousness of the Omicron wave, there\u2019s another sentiment that you hear often: this drawn-out saga has become a distraction from far more important issues.\n\nline\n\nCourt documents were released later on Saturday that showed Immigration Minister Alex Hawke chose to cancel Djokovic\u2019s visa because \u2013 in his view \u2013 the unvaccinated player\u2019s presence could fuel opposition to Covid-19 vaccination.\n\n\u201c[I] consider that his presence may be a risk to the health of the Australian community,\u201d he wrote in a letter to Djokovic and his lawyers, adding that he believed it could also provoke \u201ccivil unrest\u201d because he is \u201ca person of influence and status\u201d.\n\nDjokovic\u2019s legal team say their grounds for appeal will centre on the \u201cinvalid and illogical\u201d rationale of Mr Hawke\u2019s decision, which lawyer Nick Wood said was based on the threat of \u201cexciting anti-vax sentiment\u201d.\n\nMr Wood said he believed deporting the Serbian player would potentially do the same thing.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic, meanwhile, condemned the Australian minister\u2019s decision, telling Djokovic in an Instagram message: \u201cNovak, we stand by you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you wanted to ban Novak Djokovic from winning the 10th trophy in Melbourne why didn\u2019t you return him immediately, why didn\u2019t you tell him \u2018it is impossible to obtain a visa\u2019?\u201d Mr Vucic added.\n\nSpanish tennis star Rafael, one of Djokovic\u2019s biggest rivals, said on Saturday: \u201c[The] Australian Open is much more important than any player. If he\u2019s playing finally, okay. If he\u2019s not playing, the Australian Open will be great\u2026 with or without him.\u201d\n\nJapanese player Naomi Osaka described the controversy surrounding Djokovic as \u201can unfortunate situation\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a great player and it\u2019s kind of sad that some people might remember [him] in this way. But I also think it\u2019s\u2026 up to the government how Australia is deciding to handle it,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "Boko Haram fighters late on Thursday attacked the Mobile Police Training School in limankara, Gwoza Local Government Area of Borno State, but the police authorities denied reports that 13 trainers were abducted by the terrorists during the attack.\n\nIn a related development, another terror group, the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) on Friday released a video of its fighters attacking Tukur Yusufu Buratai Institute for War and Peace (TBI), a research Institute of the Nigerian Army University, located in Buratai Village, Biu Local Government Area of Borno State last Monday.\n\nSources said Boko Haram attacked the Gwoza Mobile Police Training School with gun trucks and shot sporadically into the air before allegedly kidnapping the instructors.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists overpowered the policemen guarding the school with ease, some instructors were abducted,\u201d said the source.\n\nThe Borno State Commissioner of Police, Abdul Umar, yesterday confirmed the attack at the training school, but said nobody was abducted by the terrorists.\n\nThe Borno police chief said the insurgents were successfully repelled by policemen.\n\nUmar, while addressing a press conference in Maiduguri, said: \u201cThe attention of the Borno State Police Command has been drawn to news making the rounds on social media, alleging that an undisclosed number of PMF personnel were abducted at the Police Mobile Training College, Gwoza.\n\n\u201cThe Command wishes to categorically debunk the news, consider it as fake news, and also to inform the general public that the insurgents, who attacked the PMF training college on the 13th January, 2022 at about 2022hrs were successfully repelled by our gallant officers and men. The police did not record a single casualty or loss of firearms.\n\n\u201cOn this note, I am using this medium to call the attention of the general public to disregard any misleading information that may likely cause panic and disturb the peace of innocent citizens who are roaming endlessly in search of greener pasture, and to assure them of our commitment, focus and determination towards bringing an end to the insurgency and other crimes and criminality in Borno State.\u201d\n\nThe training school is located 25 kilometres from Gwoza town. It is a border town between Borno and Madagali LGA of Adamawa State.\n\nISWAP Releases Video of its Men Ransacking Army Institute\n\nMeanwhile, ISWAP yesterday released a video of its fighters attacking Tukur Yusufu Buratai Institute for War and Peace (TBI), in Biu Local Government Area of Borno State.\n\nThe army institute is located in the hometown of the immediate past Chief of Army Staff and current Nigerian Ambassador to the Republic of Benin, Tukur Buratai.\n\nIn the video, the insurgents were seen firing in different directions, with no resistance from troops. They pulled down flags on the campus and torched some military vehicles.\n\nA security source said: \u201cMost residents have fled to Moringa, another town in Biu. The ISWAP came in large numbers shooting RPGs and anti-aircraft guns.\u201d\n\nReacting to the attack, the management of Army University in Biu confirmed that two civilians lost their lives but that normalcy had since returned.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cThe terrorists who came in their numbers were met by superior firepower forcing them to retreat in disarray. Unfortunately, two civilian staff of the Institute paid the supreme price.\n\n\u201cManagement wishes to commend troops for their gallantry during the attack and to commiserate with families of the fallen staff.\n\n\u201cFinally, management wishes to assure the general public that the Institute remains 100% operational as security has been beefed up in the general area.\u201d\n\nChibok LGA Attacked\n\nFour persons have been found dead, while a search for missing persons is ongoing, following an attack by ISWAP in Kautikari community, Chibok Local Government Area of Borno State yesterday.\n\nAccording to residents, the insurgents invaded the area around 5pm with different of weapons and started shooting sporadically.\n\nThe terrorists thereafter set houses ablaze, and residents had to run to the bushes for safety.\n\n\u201cThey first went to the market area as today is our market day, and they looted almost everything. After that, they set the market on fire. And then they started burning the houses. They also burnt this big church in the village, one of the villagers said.\u201d\n\nAnother source said when the insurgents arrived, the army\u2019s 28 task force brigade headquarters was contacted but there was no immediate response \u201cand the attack lasted more than two hours\u201d.\n\nAlthough the village is about 17 kilometres away from the army brigade headquarters in Chibok, there is an army company under the 117 battalion stationed in Kwada, not too far from the scene of the attack.\n\nA company is a military formation usually made up of at least 80 soldiers.\n\n\u201cWe know it could take time for troops to mobilise from the brigade, but we were shocked that the company that was just one kilometre away didn\u2019t move an inch to help,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe villagers said they had also reached the air force, and a fighter jet came to the area after the insurgents had left.\n\nMeanwhile, troops are on the ground conducting a search-and-rescue operation.\n\n\u201cFour dead bodies have been found, and an unknown number of women and girls have been abducted. The insurgents also took a number of tricycles belonging to the villagers,\u201d another resident added.\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos and Michael Olugbode in Maiduguri",

          "text": "The Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, on Friday pledged the loyalty of the military leadership to democratic rule in the country.\n\nIrabor, who was speaking on a television programme, ahead of the Armed Forces Remembrance Day, also stated that the military was now well-focused on performing its constitutional roles.\n\nHe declared: \u201cToday, I believe that Nigerians are no longer in doubt as to the subordination of the military to civil rule; I believe that no one is in doubt that democracy has come to stay.\n\n\u201cI believe that no one is in doubt any longer that the current military leadership, and of course, since the democratisation in 1999, that the military is well-focused on performing its constitutional roles.\u201d\n\nThe CDS admitted that some Nigerians might still be struggling with the experience of military involvement in politics in the past.\n\nIrabor\u2019s declaration is coming amid recent military coups in West African countries such as Mali and Guinea; as well as North-Eastern African country of Sudan.\n\nSpeaking on the significance of the Armed Forces Remembrance Day, Irabor stressed the need to educate the coming generation about the nation\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, I believe that some of these misperceptions that some Nigerians have had with respect to military engagement will begin to change.\n\n\u201cI am sure you also know that issues that have to do with civic responsibilities still require a little push; I am sure you know that literacy level in the nation still requires a little push; and so when you bring these factors among several other things, you know that quite a lot of work needs to be done,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on the crackdown on the use of military gear by civilians, the CDS stated that the present security situation \u201cdoes not allow the use of military gear by people who are not personnel of the Defence Headquarters (DHQ).\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cThe criminals among us have had to take advantage of the military, police, and other security agencies\u2019 gear to perpetrate crime.\n\n\u201cWe live in a peculiar society. I do not need to restate what the make-up of our society is, what the level of discipline is generally.\n\n\u201cAnd when you compare it (Nigerian structure) to some places where a few individuals believe that whatever practice goes on in those societies should be replicated here, the other elements of social life in those societies; they do not bring that to bear right here.\u201d\n\nHe also assured Nigerians that the DHQ would continue to take appropriate actions to ensure that they don\u2019t see the military in a bad light when they wear its gear.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, we will be glad to see that our symbol (gears) is being used for good causes.\n\n\u201cA good number of those who use them have used them for ignoble causes and so, that brings us to a state where you begin to make certain assumptions.\n\n\u201cSo, it is better for you to be safe first, then by virtue of your investigations, you can exonerate those who are using them for good causes. This is where we are.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY",

          "text": "The Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) has met in Abuja and once again demanded the return of power to the South in 2023, while also reaffirming its stance on restructuring.\n\nIn a communique issued at the end of the meeting, which ended late on Thursday, and attended by former governors, ministers, federal and state legislators, top politicians and professionals from the Southern and Middle Belt regions, the Forum also called on all political parties to zone their presidential tickets to the South.\n\nIt warned that any political party that fails to heed its demand should not expect support from the four regions in the 2023 general election i.e. South-west, South-east, South-south and North-central.\n\nSMBLF also maintained that the extant Constitution and Structure of Nigeria \u201care grossly flawed and lopsided\u201d and restated its demand for a fundamental restructuring of the country \u201cby enacting a new Constitution that would enthrone equity, fairness and justice.\u201d\n\nThe Forum agreed on the country\u2019s indissolubility.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9, jointly signed by the leaders of the Forum, Chief Dr. E. K. Clark, Ayo Adebanjo, George Obiozor and Dr. Pogu Bitrus, reads: \u201cThe meeting extensively discussed various issues on the state of affairs in the country, particularly, the security situation, restructuring, preparations for the 2023 general elections and zoning.\n\n\u201cArising therefrom, the meeting resolved as follows: That the extant Constitution and Structure of Nigeria are grossly flawed and lopsided. Accordingly, Forum restates its demand for the fundamental restructuring of the country by enacting a new Constitution that would enthrone equity, fairness and justice. It must be One Nation, One System.\n\n\u201cCites that the northern part of the country would have fully enjoyed the office of the presidency of the country for the full statutory period of 8 years by 2023, hence, the presidency should rotate to the South.\n\n\u201cThat any political party that does not zone its presidential ticket to the South should not expect support from the four regions.\n\n\u201cTherefore, unequivocally, and in full resolve, call on all political parties in the country to zone their presidential tickets to the South.\n\n\u201cNotes that the basis of any viable democracy, especially in a diverse and complex country as Nigeria, is fair and even sharing of power.\u201d\n\nThe Forum also condemned \u201cthe senseless killings of innocent citizens across the country by terrorists and criminals, especially in the North-west zone\u201d and called on the government and security agencies to redouble efforts to safeguard the lives and property of Nigerians.\n\nSMBLF cautioned the National Assembly to only give consideration to Bills that would promote equity, justice, peace and national cohesion, \u201cinstead of issues that will exacerbate conflicts and crises in the country.\u201d\n\nIt urged governors and members of the National Assembly from the four regions to commit themselves to the subject of restructuring and reaffirmed its commitment to the unity of Nigeria, \u201csituated on the tenets of equity, fairness, justice, and the principle of federalism.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was held under the chairmanship of its leader and elder statesman, Chief Dr. E. K. Clark.\n\nAlso in attendance at the meeting were delegations from the four regional socio-cultural organisations \u2013 Afenifere for the South-west; Ohanaeze Ndigbo for the South-east; Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) for the South-south; and the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) for the Middle Belt.\n\nThe delegations were led by Chief Ayo Adebanjo, leader of Afenifere; Professor George Obiozor, President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo; Dr. Pogu Bitrus, President of the Middle Belt Forum and Senator Emmanuel Ibok Essien, National Chairman of Pan Niger Delta Forum, PANDEF.\n\nThe meeting was also attended by former governors, ministers, federal and state legislators, top politicians and professionals from the Southern and Middle Belt regions, including Obong Victor Attah, former governor of Akwa Ibom; Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu; Alaowei Broderick Bozimo; Senator Femi Okurounmu; Nze Ozichukwu Chukwu; Simon N.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Super Eagles know they will have both legs firmly in the tournament\u2019s Round of 16 if they scoop all three points against Sudan in their second match of Group B at the 33rd Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon on Saturday evening.\n\nThree preious points off arguably their fiercest opponents in the pool, Egypt on Tuesday have boosted the confidence and bounce of the three-time champions, and the training sessions of Wednesday, Thursday and Friday have sought to increase the tempo rather than encourage any form of complacency.\n\nWith the Falcons of Jediane and the Wild Dogs of Guinea Bissau ending their tie scoreless, the door is open for the Eagles to become the first qualifiers for the Round of 16 in Group D as they confront the Sudanese, who will be looking for a win to boost their chances of reaching that stage.\n\nAll 26 players (bar the injured defender Chidozie Awaziem) were on duty on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, with Head Coach Augustine Eguavoen telling the boys clearly that they are yet to win anything, but on the way to doing great things if they keep level heads.\n\nThe enthusiasm is palpable. At the pre-match press conference on Friday, Eguavoen maintained his trademark calm mien and assured that his boys will go out to play positively to win on Saturday, with discipline and focus being the watchwords for them within the 90 minutes.\n\nAccording to Eguavoen, \u201cWe saw the game between Sudan and Guinea Bissau on Tuesday and what I can assure you is that we will not be under-rating them. We are taking it one match at a time and will approach this game differently from how we set up against Egypt. We will throw in our very best.\u201d\n\nVictory will not only assure the Eagles of a place in the Round of 16, but also brings closer the possibility of topping the group and therefore retaining the familiar surroundings of Garoua as venue.\n\nWinger Moses Simon, who was a thorn in the flesh of the Egyptians on Tuesday, told media representatives on Friday that he has never been happier in the Nigeria camp in past two years, being able to play in his preferred position and with the players given a say in what formation they desire to set up on the terrain.",
