          "text": "The Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum has said Nigeria stands the risk of dying if it is not restructured quickly.\n\nThe National leader of the forum, Chief Edwin Clark, while giving his opening remarks at the expanded meeting of the SMBFLF in Abuja on Sunday, urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to address Nigerians on the state of the nation.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe purpose of this meeting is very clear. Where are we going in Nigeria? Some are asking for secession, others for a breakup, others are running a unitary system of government.\n\n\u201cTime is moving fast and there is the need to state our position very clear to Nigerians. Mr President is not an emperor. Mr President is not a king. Mr President is not a monarch; he is a politician. He should come out and meet some of us who were here even when he was an ordinary soldier. This country belongs to all of us; the north alone cannot rule this country, the south alone cannot rule this country.\n\nClark stated that the country needed a brand-new constitution, adding that the 1963 Constitution recognised the country as a four-legged country where each region developed at its own pace, which was not the case in recent times.\n\nAccording to him, the situation of things is such that one state that is not developed would be dragging a developed state down.\n\nClark continued, \u201cWhat the National Assembly has been doing is fraudulent. For five years now, they have amended the (1999) Constitution five times; they spend N1bn every year and nothing comes out of it. As Governor Fayemi said, it is fraudulent.\n\n\u201cAny amendment on the 1999 Constitution, we have no confidence in it. We must restructure Nigeria. If we do not restructure Nigeria, Nigeria will die. Without restructuring, we are going nowhere.\u201d",

Topmost among those issues are the security of our members who work in the university environment.

By doing this, security challenges in our institutions will reduce. \u201d\n\nThe association bemoaned the government lack of sincerity in keeping to agreements it entered with unions, warning that the government should not paralyse academic activities in tertiary institutions again with its lackadaisical attitude towards the implementation of the Memorandum of Action, MoA, both parties signed.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nHe noted with dismay that out of the demands SSANU made, only three have been addressed partially by the government, insisting the suspended strike may resume soon if the issue of IPPIS and others that have continued to make SSANU members poorer than expected were not quickly addressed.\n\nRecall that the leadership of SSANU, had on February 5, directed all its branches to commence strike with a view to pressing home their demands bordering on alleged injustice on sharing formula of N40 billion Earned Allowance and non-payment minimum wage arrears.\n\nOther contentious issues raised include: inconsistencies in the implementation of the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS), delay in renegotiation of FG/NASU and SSANU 2009 agreement, non-payment of retirement benefits of outgone members among others.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

The untoward intervention of external forces within the progressive fold should be resisted by all and sundry.\u201d\n\nHowever, the party urged aggrieved aspirants to approach the Electoral Appeal Committee headed by Mr. Lawal Pedro (SAN) to lodge formal complaints for redress.\n\n\u201cThe party calls for the traditional united front as we prepare for the fast approaching Local Government elections, \u201d APC stated.\n\nMixed feelings\n\nAn APC Acting Chairman, Animashaun Kendoo, Oshodi-Isolo, has commended the party leadership on the primary election process and electorate, describing it as free, fair and credible.\n\nAccording to him, \u201d W had a peaceful exercise on Oshodi-Isolo LGA. We await final results to be announced at the Secretariat of the party.\n\nIn a different experience, a Chairmanship aspirant in Ejigbo LCDA, Lagos, Peter Ajayi, has alleged the party chairman of the council of diverting electoral materials and officials to his house.\n\nAjayi, who made the accusation while speaking with journalists on Saturday at Ejigbo playing ground, said the chairman was not neutral in the primaries and that he redirected the officials to unknown areas of the local government.\n\nHe said over 30 of his supporters were unduly arrested by the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of the area but that with his intervention they were later released.\n\nAjayi explained that the incumbent chairman, Monsuru Bello, popularly called \u201cOne\u201d induced the electoral process in a manner that contravenes the APC guidelines, adding that open membership cards were hoarded, thugs instigated and umpires were from the camp.\n\nHe alleged that the electoral officials were substituted with party LGA executives and Ward executives who are loyalists.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral and Returning Officers left Acme at about 8am and got to Ejigbo at 8:45am, they were in the house of the LGA Chairman till 12noon they have not started the process and people are not happy.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cSome of my supporters were arrested for doing nothing by the Ejigbo LCDA and I have called him to release them. This shows my opponent has influenced him. Those arrested are not thugs, they are eligible party members with cards to vote.\n\n\u201cBased on reports reaching me, the names of party executives who are been used as electoral officials by the accused chairman are: Agiri Adeola, Akeem Oduyoye and Olabisi Muritala (Oke Afa ward), Jimoh Aleshinloye (Fadu Ward) while Olufemi Ibine popularly known as BamBam was used to intimidate and harass my supporters in Oke Afa ward.\u201d\n\nAlso, suspected hoodlums were said to have disrupted the primary elections in all the seven wards of Agege Local Government Area of Lagos State.\n\nSome aspirants vying for the chairmanship position in the LGA alleged that electorate were chased from polling units and the whole process manipulated.\n\nAording to them, while some electorate were dispersed by hoodlums, other voters insisted on voting of which still later resulted to chaos.\n\nMr Sola Osolana, a Chairmanship Aspirant, said: \u201cIn spite of the zeal and aspirations of people at the early hours to cast their vote, the exercise was disrupted by hoodlums.\n\n\u201cThere was no primary election in Agege; actually people came out early in the morning to cast their votes but were later scattered by some sponsored hoodlums.\n\n\u201cThe exercise was also manipulated as wrong accreditation sheets were brought and the electorate could not find their numbers and names on the sheets.\n\n\u201cThe activities of the hoodlums affected all the seven wards across the local government,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAccording to him, the accreditation sheets should have been sent to and pasted at the different polling units to ensure easy process of the election.\n\nOsolana said that the hoodlums touched all the wards in the council from A-G to ensure the election did not hold or was cancelled.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to the party leadership to shift the primaries to the State Secretariat of the APC, Acme in Lagos.\n\n\u201cIt is very clear that some people want the genuine change but few want to disrupt the change thereby manipulating the progress of the party,\u201d he said.\n\nPrince Abiodun Ogunji, Vice Chairman, Agege Local Government, who is also an aspirant, decried the activities of the hoodlums during the primary election.\n\n\u201cThere was no election in Agege.

I would have continued to keep watching and observing, but for love of the region and the country.\n\n\u201cThe continuous running of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) by a sole administrator at the instance of the minister of Niger Delta Affairs Senator Akpabio, is undemocratic and anti-development, hence unacceptable to the people of the region.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe people of the region are averse to a one man show in a commission that is supposed to attend to the developmental needs of nine states, namely, Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Imo, Ondo and Rivers. It will likely set the region on fire, sooner than later.\n\n\u201cThe act establishing the commission provided among other things that it will be administered by a board comprising a Chairman, Managing Director, Executive Directors and Commissioners who will be drawn from the nine states that made up the region.\n\n\u201cThere is no provision for either interim management committee or sole administration in the act that establishes the NDDC.\n\n\u201cClearly, the present state of the commission is abnormal and could throw the relatively peaceful region in the country into chaos and acrimony\u201d.\n\nTompolo added: \u201cThere is no way things will continue in this manner. I am surprised at the recent silence of highly placed persons from the region on this matter.\n\n\u201cIt is against this background that I wish to call on Mr President, members of the National Assembly and Security Agencies to work towards the constitution of the substantive board of the NDDC within a few days to avert a total breakdown of law and order that will equally affect crude oil exploration and exploitation activities in the region.\n\n\u201cI hereby proclaim a seven days ultimatum starting the date of this publication to inaugurate the substantive board of the commission\u201d.",

Any amendment of the constitution, I have no confidence in it. We are here for two things: Nigeria should be restructured. President Buhari once said if we don\u2019t kill corruption, corruption will kill Nigeria. I say if we don\u2019t restructure Nigeria will die.

          "text": "\u2022El Rufai: Bitterness of the last few weeks, now over, would set the backdrop for positive achievements in their lives\n\n\u2022We paid N180 million, received no help from govt, say parents\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nAll the remaining abducted students of the Greenfield University, Kaduna, have been released after spending harrowing 40 days in captivity, the authorities of Greenfield University, confirmed this in a statement last night.\n\nThe registrar of the University, Mr. Mohammed Bashir, in the said statement stated that all the remaining students and non academic staff that were abducted by the bandits were released and had been reunited with their families.\n\nAlso, confirming the news, the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai assured the studentsthat, \u201cthe bitterness of the last few weeks, now over, would set the backdrop for positive achievements in their lives, as he wished them well for the future.\u201d\n\nBut some of the parents of the released students have expressed disappointment in the government at all levels for allegedly leaving them to their fate, saying they had to cough out a whopping N180 million to the bandits before they released their children.\n\nHowever, part of the statement by Greenfield stated thus: \u201cAs you are aware that on Tuesday, April 20th, 2021 armed bandits attacked Greenfield University and abducted 20 students and three non academic staff. Five out of the abducted students and a Male warden were grossly murdered by the bandits.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to inform you that, today, being Saturday, May 29, 2021 that all the remaining students and non academic staff have been released by the bandits and they have already been reunited with their families.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the Board of Trustees, University Council, Management, Staff and Students of our university, we wish to thank all Nigerians and well wishers all over the world for standing by us during this trying times\u201d.\n\nBandits had on April 18 invaded the university located along the dreaded Kaduna-Abuja road about 8:30pm and abducted 23 students. Few days after the abduction, the bandits, who had demanded N800 million as ransom, killed five of the students, when negotiations were still going on.\n\nOn April 23, the bandits killed three of the students, five days after their abduction. Their remains were found in Kwanan Bature village, close to the university. On April 26, two more students were killed and security personnel recovered their corpses in the bush.\n\nOne of the parents was said to have paid a ransom of N20 million for the release of her son.\n\nOn its part, the Kaduna State Government said in a statement by the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, \u201cThe kidnapped students of the Greenfield University, who had been held hostage by armed bandits, have been released by their abductors.\n\n\u201cThis was reported to the Kaduna State Government by security agencies. According to the reports, about 2pm today, Saturday, the hostages were found released along the Kaduna-Abuja road. Fourteen persons were released in total, comprising students and staff.\n\n\u201cIt would be recalled that they were abducted by armed bandits in April and had been in captivity since then. Five students were gruesomely killed by the bandits in the period.\n\n\u201cGovernor Nasir El-Rufai welcomed the news of the students\u2019 release, and conveyed solace and encouragement to them following their harrowing ordeal.\n\n\u201cHe assured them that the bitterness of the last few weeks, now over, would set the backdrop for positive achievements in their lives, as he wished them well for the future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in a short video that went viral last night, two of the parents of the abducted children, a man and a woman, who were bitter about their experience so far despite the release of their children confirmed that they paid some N180 million before the release that was later celebrated by government and security agencies.\n\nThe parents, who alleged neglect by the government both confirmed that neither the state nor the federal government participated in the process that led to the release of the children, particularly, that the security agencies refused to help in whatever form of shape.\n\n\u201cN180 million, that\u2019s what we paid; that\u2019s what they collected. One hundred and eighty million, that is they collected from us \u2013 from the parents without the help of a government. None of the government officials that has come to our aid since the 20th of April that they took these children. No single one policeman that the government has released to go after them,\u201d the male parent told a reporter, shortly after the children were released.\n\nSimilarly, spokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command, Mohammad Jalige, also confirmed the release of the 14 students, when contacted by telephone. Jalige, who said the students were released Saturday evening, added that three of them were still being held.\n\n\u201cYes, 14 of the students of the Greenfield University were released from captivity this evening (Saturday), remaining three of them still in captivity,\u201d Jalige explained. He did not give details of the students\u2019 release and why three were still being held.\n\nWhen contacted, Registrar of the university, Mr. Mohammed Bashir, said he was busy and promised to confirm later. \u201cYes, we are still on it. I am very busy right now. You can call me back later to confirm,\u201d Bashir said by telephone.\n\nOne Sani Idris Jalingo, who claimed to be the leader of the bandits that abducted the students, had in an interview with the Voice of America (VOA), Hausa Service, on May 3, threatened to kill the students if a ransom of N100 million in addition to 10 new Honda motorcycles were not provided the following day.Jalingo had disclosed during the interview that the families of the abducted students paid N55 million.\n\nHowever, in a statement on May 14, the spokesman of parents of the students, Mr. Marcus Zarmai, said the parents contributed N60 million as ransom for the release of the students but failed to secure their release.\n\nAfter series of negotiations, the bandits were said to have demanded the sum of N10 million from each of the parents of the students for their release.\n\nIt could not be immediately established how much each parent paid for the release of the students and why three of them are still in captivity.\n\nThirty-nine students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, Kaduna, had also be kidnapped on March 11 in a similar manner, when bandits invaded their school about 11: 30pm. The last batch of 27 of the students was released about two weeks ago after spending 56 days in captivity. Their parents were said to have paid millions of naira before they were released.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Troops kill 17 insurgents, IPOB members in Borno, Rivers\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, said yesterday that the armed forces would not relent in their onslaught against terrorists until the enemies of the Nigerian state were defeated. Irabor said despite the risk of paying the supreme price, the security personnel remained unrelenting in their resolve to keep the peace in Nigeria and deal with the security challenges facing the country.\n\nHis position came as troops killed 17 insurgents and members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in Borno and Rivers states.\n\nAddressing a group, God Bless Nigeria, which organised a solidarity march to the Defence Headquarters complex in Abuja, the defence chief vowed that enemies of the state would be brought to their knees.\n\nThe marchers carried banners with the inscription, \u201cArmed Forces Appreciation Day\u201d, in support of the country\u2019s security forces.\n\nThe defence chief, who was represented by the Director, Defence Information (DDI), Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu, said the military was committed to defeating the adversaries.\n\nNwachukwu stated while receiving the group, \u201cI welcome the God Bless Nigeria group on behalf of the Chief of Defence Staff, service chiefs and the entire military. We thank this very important group for taking time to appreciate the armed forces of Nigeria, to appreciate the conduct of operations we are carrying out around the country and the sacrifices our men are making in the conduct of those operations.\n\n\u201cRound the clock, our troops are engaged. We are not resting on our oars because we want to surmount this contemporary security challenges even though we are to pay the supreme price.\n\n\u201cWe can, of course, take a cue from what happened recently when the late Chief of Army Staff and a group officers were on a visit to Depot Nigerian Army (Kaduna) when they had the unfortunate mishap.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cLives were lost, families were orphaned, wives are widowed. We are paying expensively to ensure that we have peace in this country.\n\n\u201cI want to seize the opportunity on behalf of the Chief of Defence Staff and the leadership of the armed forces to assure Nigerians that we will not rest on our oars until we bring our adversaries to their knees.\u201d\n\nEarlier, spokesman of the God Bless Nigeria group, Mr Eric Ogolo, said, \u201cNo duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. We have come together to express our profound gratitude for the sacrifices, contributions, strength and commitment that you all display every single day.\n\n\u201cWhenever this country calls, you all are the ones who answer, no matter the circumstance, no matter the danger, no matter the sacrifice, and this you do with high morale.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian armed forces is not only our pride but also our super heroes, who fight all those hostile enemies, both external and internal.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, just hours into the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff, Major General Faruk Yahaya, Boko Haram fighters attempted an audacious attack on troops of Operation Hadin Kai in Rann, the headquarters of Kala Balge Local Government Area of Borno State. An army statement said the terrorists came in their numbers with gun trucks and attempted to infiltrate the main entrance to the town.\n\nThe statement signed by Army Spokesman, Brigadier-General Mohammed Yerima, said, \u201cThe highly spirited troops were right on hand to counter the move and inflicted humiliating defeat on the terrorists who abandoned their evil mission and took to their heels.\n\n\u201cThe troops chased the retreating terrorist and ensured there was no further threat to the town and its residents. Troops successfully destroyed one of the gun trucks and recovered multiple weapons, including one anti aircraft gun, two machine guns and eight AK-47 rifles, neutralising 10 terrorists in the process.\u201d\n\nIn Port Harcourt, troops of 6 Division Garrison, Port Harcourt, and 29 Battalion in conjunction with operatives of Nigeria Police, Directorate of State Services (DSS), and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) conducted a clearance/raid operation at suspected IPOB/ESN enclaves at Agbomchia Forest along Pipeline Road, Ogali/Komkom Boundary, between Eleme and Oyigbo local government areas of Rivers State.\n\nAn army statement said, \u201cIn the fire fight that ensued during the clearance/raid operation, seven IPOB/ESN members were neutralised while five suspects arrested.\u201d\n\nIt also said, \u201cVarious items belonging to the criminals, including arms and ammunition, were also recovered by the security forces. The camp was promptly destroyed while suspects and corpses were handed over to the police for further action.\n\n\u201cThere was no casualty on own troops and other security operatives as they have returned back to base in high morale.\u201d\n\nThe army urged members of the public to help the troops with accurate and timely information that would assist them in tracking down and neutralising the criminal elements.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We have also seen that you lack the capacity to manage both the staff and the product you are selling. May we shock you a little. Your organisation gave a bill of over N100,000 to a house that has not been electrified. Where is the place and position of integrity and value for humanity in the act of your staff in this issue?\n\n\"Therefore, in view of the above, all of us in the above communities are pleased to tell you that we are tired of your incompetence and insincerity. By this, we are no more interested in the service of your organisation known as IBEDC. You are free to take us off your grid. As from now, we will not allow any of your staff members within our communities to continue to carry out this criminal act.\"",

          "text": "The Nokia X20 is your chance to use a high end smartphone with many features that are likely to help with your content creation, gaming, and overall selfie experience.\n\nEarly in April, HMD Global announced the launch of six new Nokia Android smartphones. I got my hands on one of the phones in the X Series and explored some of its features.\n\nIts major selling points include 3 years worth of Android updates from Nokia, cinema mode and dualsight camera, 2-day battery life and a large screen that allows you to watch virtually anything in full HD+.\n\nSo let\u2019s get into it.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the box?\n\nThe front of the box is branded with Nokia\u2019s logo and a photo of the phone. The phone is available in both Midnight Sky and Nordic Blue.\n\nThe Nokia X20 retails for about $480.\n\nOn the box, there\u2019s also a circle that tells you that you\u2019ll be getting 3 years of Android updates but that\u2019s for a different section of this review.\n\nFinally, inside the box we have the following:\n\nThe Nokia X20 : I mean, it would be extremely awkward if this was not in there.\n\n: I mean, it would be extremely awkward if this was not in there. USB-C Cable: It\u2019s helpful to note that there is no wall charger.\n\nIn a world that is currently piling up more and more e-waste, the makers of Nokia figured everyone already had some type of wall charger in their homes so they decided to not include them in the packaging.\n\nI for one know that I have enough standalone wall chargers as is so this was actually a welcome development.\n\nCompostable case: Remember what I said about avoiding e-waste, well they also added a biodegradable phone case that shouldn\u2019t be a menace to the environment if you were ever to throw it out.\n\nSim Slot Pin : personally I would really love it if more phone manufacturers imitate the Sony Xperia 1ii \u2013 which allows you eject your sim slot without a need for a very easily misplaced pin.\n\n: personally I would really love it if more phone manufacturers imitate the Sony Xperia 1ii \u2013 which allows you eject your sim slot without a need for a very easily misplaced pin. There are the warranty papers but that\u2019s not what you\u2019re here for is it? Thought as much. Onward!\n\nThe Look, The Feel, The Heft\n\nI will start by saying the Nokia X20 is a large phone. With a 6.67-inch screen, it is quite hard to operate it entirely with one hand \u2013 I couldn\u2019t reach the top left corner with my thumb when I held it in my right hand.\n\nThe back of the phone is Nordic Blue and has four cameras (main \u2013 64MP, ultra-wide \u2013 5MP, macro \u2013 2MP, depth \u2013 2MP) surrounding the ZEISS logo that most Nokia users have come to know and expect on Nokia phones.\n\nOn the left, we have the sim slot which allows for two sims but if you only need one sim, you can also put a MicroSD card in the space created for the second sim.\n\nThere\u2019s a dedicated button for the Google Assistant on the left of the phone as well. I think this button is overkill mostly because on the phone you have two other ways of accessing Google Assistant \u2013 you can click the actual Google Assistant app or you can swipe up from the bottom right corner. Thankfully this button can be deactivated in your settings.\n\nLeft showing sim slot and Google Assistant button\n\nOn the right side of the phone, there are volume control buttons. There\u2019s also the fingerprint sensor (which is also the power button).\n\nOn the bottom of the phone, we have our old friend the 3.5mm headphone jack \u2013 it feels like more phones are leaving this guy out. We also have the USB-C port and mono speakers.\n\nAnd finally, the screen. The first thing I notice is the pre-applied screen protector \u2013 good looking out, Nokia.\n\nThe screen has thick bezels and the manufacturers went for a hole punch (with a 32MP camera) instead of a notch. I\u2019m yet to decide which of those I prefer.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen, we have some extra Nokia branding \u2013 just in case you forgot you were holding a Nokia phone.\n\nThe phone feels a bit heavy but not so much that it grows uncomfortable. I put the compostable case on almost immediately because I like my phones protected at all times.\n\nCan we turn it on now?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWhen you press the power button the screen goes white and you see the \u201cAndroidOne\u201d logo. The startup time is slow so you see that logo for a couple of seconds. By my count, I would say about 14 seconds of waiting before you hear the oh so familiar Nokia starting tune.\n\nAfter that, the phone is on and you can set up your fingerprint AND face recognition. Both of them are quite responsive and don\u2019t take long before your phone is unlocked.\n\nX20 showing volume controls and fingerprint sensor\n\nWhat\u2019s under the hood?\n\nThe Nokia X20 is running Android 11, the latest version of the Android OS.\n\nRemember how I mentioned the 3 years worth of Android updates? Well, users of this phone do not need to worry about software or security updates for the next 3 years. This is probably one of its biggest selling points.\n\nThe phone comes with 128GB of storage but this is expandable (up to half a terabyte) through the MicroSD card slot I mentioned earlier. It also has 8GB of RAM.\n\nChipset for this gigantic phone? Qualcomm Snapdragon 480. The phone also allows 5G. I guess we\u2019ll be patiently waiting till we get that now, won\u2019t we?\n\nChipsets usually determine how fast your phone works and while the Snapdragon 720g (which can be found on other phones in this price range) has better CPU performance, the 480 uses less battery life.\n\nThe phone\u2019s 60Htz screen and Snapdragon 480 chipset allow it not to use too much of its 4470 mAh battery (with 18W fast charging), thereby allowing you to use it for up to 2 days.\n\n2-day battery life? For real?\n\nImmediately I saw it on the box I knew it was something I had to check out so as soon as I got the phone out, I charged it fully \u2013 this was on Monday night.\n\nI downloaded a few apps and just went to town \u2013 mostly watching Netflix and playing some Call of Duty.\n\nI didn\u2019t need to charge the phone till about Thursday night and even then the phone still had some juice.\n\nSo if you don\u2019t use your phone for much more than texting and calling, you can very easily get more than 2 days out of it.\n\nFor you gamers and perpetual video watchers, you\u2019ll probably get a full day\u2019s use without frantically searching for your USB-C cable.\n\nDisplay, Audio and Camera\n\nThe Nokia X20\u2019s 6.67-inch screen\u2019s resolution is 1080 x 2400 and it\u2019s also full HD+. What this means is that you can very comfortably watch your favourite videos on YouTube or Netflix in great quality.\n\nThe phone\u2019s sound comes from a mono speaker that is admittedly quite loud. However, because it\u2019s not a stereo speaker, your audio experience can be a little one-sided when you use it but it shouldn\u2019t affect your listening experience too much.\n\nI did find something peculiar with the videos I shot on the phone\u2019s camera. At full volume, I struggled to hear my voice in these videos. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the phone\u2019s microphone or something else but it\u2019s definitely not great to record videos and barely have enough audio coming from them.\n\nNow that we are at the cameras, I will post two images I took in the different modes below. You tell me what you think.\n\nPortrait selfie mode\n\nMain selfie mode\n\nTwo standouts for me are both video modes on the X20 \u2013 dual sight and cinema\n\nDualsight: This feature allows you to record a video with both your front and back camera at the same time. I find that this will be extremely useful for vloggers who want to be able to capture an event and their reactions to the event at the same time.\n\nStill from dualsight video\n\nCinema mode: This feature can only be used in landscape mode and basically allows you to turn yourself into an amateur filmmaker with access to settings and filters that help give your video a cinematic feel.\n\nStill from video shot in cinema mode with filter\n\nThe phone delivers on many promises but could do better with some of the things I pointed out. Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a phone with a large screen, interesting camera features, Android updates till Android 14, and long battery life, this is definitely a phone for you.\n\nUntil our next review.",

In some countries, these attacks come at a very high cost.\n\nThis reduces the level of trust people have in the internet or systems that use the internet. For instance, when it comes to savings, some people prefer not to save their money in traditional banks; and trusting their savings with a fintech company would probably be their last option.\n\nAnd that\u2019s only one example\u2013 there\u2019s a lot of customer data scattered across other tech-enabled services. Losing your money is perhaps the least harmful way cyber fraud can harm you.\n\nFirstly, your data could be used to carry out illegal activities which could put you in even more trouble. Secondly, your company\u2019s trade secrets or other sensitive business data could be leaked to the public. You could lose your good reputation in a blink.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done to improve cybersecurity measures, and the work of improving these measures isn\u2019t the sole responsibility of tech companies. In our present digital age, traditional sectors like oil and gas need new and more effective ways to protect their customers from cyber fraud, too.\n\nAn estimated $103.1bn was spent on security-related software, hardware and services in 2019 and this spending is expected to increase to $133.8bn by 2022. However, improving cybersecurity measures will not only involve spending more on security but also making it a part of the company culture. Every employee should have a role to play in keeping the organization safe.\n\nTomorrow at 11 am on TechCabal Live, we will be discussing with Adeoluwa, Daniel, Joseph, Sophina and Nick about some of the best practices they\u2019ve picked up in the course of their careers.\n\nRegister here to join the event.\n\nAdeoluwa is a skilled Information Security Professional. He has built a career spanning about 20 years in the field and has honed his expertise in some of the world\u2019s leading organizations, including Barclays, Brown Shipley and the British Council.\n\nDaniel is the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at Evolve Credit, a loan and financial products marketplace. He is responsible for building the backend infrastructure, driving product roadmap, leading the technical team and driving company strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Joseph led the United Capital Group of companies to transition to a 100% remote work structure due to the COVID limitation while improving services and automation, leading to a 61% growth in revenue for the year ended 2020, with customers transacting seamlessly and securely.\n\nSophina is a cybersecurity professional currently working with a leading financial services firm. She has in previous years worked on providing digital and holistic security support to various marginalized communities and NGOs across Nigeria and Africa at large. She also collaborated on creating digital security guides to such organisations and communities to stay safe.\n\nNick Maxwell is a cybersecurity and networking industry professional with a passion for learning, working and creating a better understanding of the concerns and needs of clients and partners, across several regions in a variety of verticals. He has over 13 years experience in the technology industry and has worked for multinational, leading technology companies.\n\nAttendees will be able to ask the speakers questions in an interactive session.\n\nRegister here to join the event.",

          "title": "GovTech In Nigeria: From Regulatory Maze to Models of Good Practice",
          "text": "Nigerian public procurement and regulation can be labyrinthine, but recent policy reforms and the model of good practice provided by Kaduna State hint at opportunities for public-purpose innovation to flourish in the country. The result could be more accountable and effective governance institutions.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic found Nigeria\u2019s health system largely unprepared. When the Federal Government first announced a lockdown in March 2020, the country only had 6 testing centres. With a population of 200 million across 36 states, it needed to expand its ability to test quickly. One of the government\u2019s readiest supporters in this situation, the genomics research startup 54gene, had only been on the scene for a year. 54gene studies the African genome in order to personalise medication for Africans. It put these research capabilities to use establishing its DNA biobank lab as Nigeria\u2019s first accredited private testing centre and\u2013strikingly\u2013converting shipping containers into mobile testing laboratories, helping to augment testing capacity.\n\n\n\n54gene is one of many high-quality startups driving large investments into the Nigerian ecosystem and earning its position alongside Kenya, South Africa and Egypt as Africa\u2019s top four VC funding destinations\u2013Africa\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d. The government partnered with 54gene out of necessity, but broader gains await should it systematically seek out such partnerships as a means to achieving its service delivery and administrative rationalisation goals. Its capacity to deliver on plans to digitise all government operations is questionable\u2013the 2020 UN e-government survey revealed that Nigeria\u2019s online service quality declined from already low levels in 20181. Accountable and well-managed partnerships with innovative startups can tip the scales in its favour, here and in other areas: improving education, promoting sustainable forms of energy and tackling healthcare challenges from both the most served verticals and some of the most pressing governance challenges.\n\n1 According to the UN e-government survey, Nigeria\u2019s online service index declined from 0.5278 in 2018 to 0.5176 in 2020. Scores range from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).\n\n\n\nPolicy progress?\n\nThe Federal Government looks to be aware of this opportunity. Its recently released National Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship Policy aims to prioritise the use of tools developed by Nigerian startups to automate public processes and services, including modifying the Procurement Act to better allow for the procurement of innovation. It has also mandated Nigerian companies with large public sector IT contracts to engage Nigerian startups as R&D partners on the projects. Ideally, a more immediate intervention to consider is introducing the Nigeria Sustainable Development Goals Fintech Hackathon. In its first iteration, the hackathon will allow FinTech startups with innovative approaches to agricultural credit schemes, cash transfers to the financially vulnerable and clean energy to partner with relevant public sector bodies.\n\nThese are all steps that, on their surface, should enable more startups to work with it. However, to truly capitalise on potential gains, the government must focus on unravelling deep-seated behavioural barriers to access. The strength of these biases\u2013such as a preference for partnering with large, established companies and a tendency for harsh regulation of innovation\u2013will determine how well the above-mentioned initiatives play out.\n\nLabyrinths of Procurement and Regulation\n\nThere is plenty of evidence of these biases\u2019 detrimental impact on the potential for partnerships. When the Nigeria Railway Commission (NRC) started the train line between Kaduna State and the Federal Capital Territory, a payments startup called Payant Technologies sent in an unsolicited proposal to handle the digital booking and payments infrastructure. They didn\u2019t receive a response.\n\nUndeterred, Payant sent another in when the official request for Expressions Of Interest came out, but this also went unanswered. Why? The NRC was, according to its eligibility criteria, only looking for companies with an annual turnover of a billion naira ($2.4 million) or more, something only a few startups in Nigeria have. Preferring to work with large firms does more than stymie startup growth. It could lead to vendor lock-in and eventually, bilateral dependence between government and supplier. Both do not bode well for the quality of services rendered.\n\nHarsh regulatory policies also deter local and global partnerships. Like US-headquartered 54gene, many of Nigeria\u2019s best startups have chosen to incorporate outside the country. When one defines startup location as a place of incorporation, Nigeria falls out of the top four African VC funding locations\u2013the most adversely impacted country.\n\nThis year alone, government actors have stopped banks from processing transactions associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and issued a cease and desist to investment startups offering access to foreign securities. Both actions have negatively impacted startups working in those spaces. More importantly, they may signal an unwillingness to cooperate that will put off startups serving the government market.\n\nAso Villa Demo Day \u2013 Enterprise 54\n\nFor Inspiration, Look Local\n\nMitigating these and other negative behaviours will be hard work. But the Federal Government need not look far for inspiration; it can take a page out of the Kaduna State Government (KDSG)\u2019s Govtech playbook. Govtech developments in Kaduna have unfolded as part of a broader governance reform programme; reform has itself been driven by the capable leadership of seasoned public servant Nasir El-Rufai. Elected for a second term in 2019, perhaps the most important quality Governor El-Rufai brings to the table is a capacity for making unpopular but ultimately effective decisions. He previously displayed this capacity as Minister of the Federal Capital Territory from 2003 to 2007; in the face of limited resources, he downsized the civil service, an action he is repeating in Kaduna.\n\nBuoyed by experienced leadership, KDSG is blazing the trail for both digital government interventions and partnering with startups and SMEs. Its globally recognised Eyes and Ears budget monitoring program enables citizens, via a mobile app, to provide feedback on public infrastructure projects. It worked with Yellow Line Services, a Kaduna-based IT company, to facilitate electronic voting during its 2018 local government elections, Nigeria\u2019s first and Africa\u2019s second electronic voting exercise. It has recently signed a deal with drone-delivery unicorn Zipline to deliver Covid vaccines and other on-demand medications. According to the World Bank\u2019s latest subnational Doing Business ratings, Kaduna is the most accessible state to register property and get contracts enforced in Nigeria. Kaduna\u2019s example is an exciting preview of what could be should the Federal Government follow through on a promising start.\n\nWritten by Tolu Segun, Fellow at StateUp.\n\nStateUp is a leading provider of public-purpose technology intelligence. We aim to bridge the gap between the worlds of government and technology through specialist, multi-disciplinary advisory, training, and information services focused on digital innovation that serves a public purpose.",

          "title": "How GOtv Nigeria Built the Widest Coverage in Nigeria with Investments in Local Infrastructure",
          "text": "Nationwide digital terrestrial television operator GOtv has greatly contributed to Nigeria\u2019s digital migration through eye-watering infrastructure investment.\n\nMore often than not, what comes to mind when people think of digital pay-television is its expensive nature. To a great extent, GOtv has changed that notion in Nigeria, where it brings family entertainment and information to millions of homes at ridiculously pocket-friendly prices, essentially becoming a lifestyle choice and transforming the national pay-TV landscape.\n\nGOtv Nigeria is not only affordable, but also widely available. Presently, Nigerians can access the service in over 50 cities across 26 states, which makes it by far the widest nationwide digital terrestrial television (DTT) network coverage, despite not being the first operator to launch in the country.\n\nAchieving this is no mean feat, especially when one considers the challenge of Nigeria\u2019s notoriously acute infrastructural deficit which by itself is enough to discourage any potential investor. But GOtv, launched by Details Nigeria in October 2011, has shown confidence in the local broadcast industry. That is demonstrable in the fact that in a decade, it has spent well over $100 million/N48 billion on investments in broadcast technology and infrastructure in the country, which oustrips those of licensed signal carriers and has significantly contributed to the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nGOtv has been the foremost figure in pushing Nigeria\u2019s drive towards migration from analog to digital transmission after the government joined a host of other countries in signing up to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) agreement of 2006. The company has since worked closely with the government and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) in providing affordable digital television for everyone through unmatched investments in modern broadcast infrastructure.\n\nIn line with Nigeria\u2019s aspirations to get on the digital broadcasting train, GOtv at inception rolled out the DVB-T2 decoder, a second-generation technology platform approved by the ITU as the standard for digital television broadcasting. The DVB-T2 technology allows for up to 20 channels per frequency, compared to DVB-T1 technology, an outdated system that only allows for 12 channels per frequency and was widely used by first movers in the digital migration. It also delivers a vastly superior digital audio-visual quality, a higher number of channels, access to Free-to-Air after subscription expiry, and prevents signal depreciation in adverse weather conditions.\n\nSo with the launch of GOtv came a dramatic improvement on the dividend of terrestrial frequencies available to Nigeria when DVB-T2 was deployed. The company was the first Nigerian DTT provider to offer its service on the modern technology, which is one of the most advanced broadcast systems and infrastructure established in Africa and globally. For Nigerians, it meant access to a premium digital audio-visual quality and enhanced viewing experience at extremely cheap rates. And for Nigeria, that effectively put the country at the forefront of technology on the global digitalisation map.\n\nOver the years, GOtv has continued to invest heavily in the latest technology in digital television, especially on its transmission technology, which it has consistently improved upon. Notable among investments made in infrastructure was the building of 73 transmitter sites between 2011 and 2015 at a cost of $95.5 million, to provide DTT coverage for over 50 percent of Nigeria\u2019s population.\n\nAs the coverage increases, so does the need for similar significantly large investments to maintain the transmitter sites in peak condition for effective transmission. GOtv has not been shy to spend in that regard too. Between 2014 and 2018, more than N8 billion was expended on the maintenance of transmitter sites. In 2014 alone, N572.2 million was spent and the sum rose consecutively in the following years \u2013 to N1.39 billion in 2015; N1.9 billion in 2016; N2.033 billion in 2017; and N2.28 billion in 2018. It is vital to note that the huge sums invested in the provision and maintenance of broadcast infrastructure are exclusive of what was invested in bringing digital broadcasting to Nigeria.\n\nThese investments by GOtv in the local broadcast infrastructure and the expansion of its network coverage have come as the government-driven digital switchover programme (DSO) progresses in fits and starts. The country has missed several deadlines since the digitisation process took off in 2008, mainly because of inadequate funds. Meanwhile, the two signal carriers licensed by the government to spread DTT coverage across the country have not functioned optimally. Set up about five years ago, they have been unable to provide nationwide coverage due to lack of finance and technical capacity.\n\nThe sub-par infrastructure provided by the carriers has led to endless complaints by Nigerians in most states where the switchover programme has been launched. Among those who have bought the device recommended by the National Broadcasting Commision (NBC) as its digital transition vehicle, there have been issues such as partial or total lack of reception, which sometimes lasts for several months, as well as service availability limited to the state capitals.\n\nWhile the heavy investments by GOtv have been crucial in helping the company beat topographical hindrances that most DTT operators face and ensure subscriber access in several cities across the country, they rarely occur without a ripple effect on national development and the impact has been massive, in terms of improving lives and job creation.\n\nAt the heart of it all is a commitment to stimulate the national digitisation process, boost the government\u2019s efforts towards national socio-economic development and impact millions of lives, as GOtv puts pay-TV services at the disposal of as many households as possible that wish to migrate into the digital age.",
          "summary": "Nationwide digital terrestrial television operator GOtv has greatly contributed to Nigeria\u2019s digital migration through eye-watering infrastructure investment.\nBut GOtv, launched by Details Nigeria in October 2011, has shown confidence in the local broadcast industry.\nThe company has since worked closely with the government and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) in providing affordable digital television for everyone through unmatched investments in modern broadcast infrastructure.\nOver the years, GOtv has continued to invest heavily in the latest technology in digital television, especially on its transmission technology, which it has consistently improved upon.\nThese investments by GOtv in the local broadcast infrastructure and the expansion of its network coverage have come as the government-driven digital switchover programme (DSO) progresses in fits and starts.",

          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria. 26th of May, 2021. \u2013 In the recently released Africa\u2019s Best Brands 2021, TECNO ranked for five consecutive years among the TOP 6 brands on the African continent, marking another prestigious recognition of the brand\u2019s leadership in Africa.\n\nEstablished in 2011, the Brand Africa 100: Africa\u2019s Best Brands rankings is the most authoritative survey and analysis on brands and underlying businesses in Africa, based on a study by Geopoll across 28 countries spanning all the five economic regions and analysis and ranking by Kantar and Brand Leadership. Collectively they account for over 80% of the population and over 80% of the GDP of Africa. The 2021 survey was conducted between March and April 2021 and yielded over 80,000 brand mentions and over 3,500 unique brands.\n\nSince its entry into the African market, TECNO\u2019s operations have been customer focused. Year in year out, they have ensured that their offerings are tailored to meet the needs of Africans.\n\nSpeaking to this at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Vincent Uzoegbu, Public Communications Manager, TECNO said; \u201cFrom the first day of our business, TECNO made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.\u201d\n\nTECNO has worked tirelessly all these years to do just that. With the brand\u2019s Phantom, Camon, Spark and Pova smartphone series, TECNO has been able to set numerous records that define its success and popularity on the continent, evident of its dogged resolve to present Africa with the best of technology and innovation. When TECNO launched dual SIM cards in Africa, there had been nothing of the kind before then. TECNO was also the first to develop long-lasting batteries that lasted 3 days to combat the epileptic power supply in places like Nigeria. The brand was also the first to bring camera solutions on their smartphones that suited the predominant African dark skin.\n\nAfter more than a decade of commitment and consistency, the rewards are finally falling in. Earlier in the year, Counterpoint Research ranked TECNO as Africa\u2019s number one smartphone brand in 2020, stating that TECNO made its breakthroughs in mobile photography technology and continued investment in the market throughout the pandemic despite a challenging year. And now, with Brand Africa\u2019s new rankings, TECNO has once again come out tops, becoming a leading player in mid to high-end mobile brand segments in Africa.\n\nAttai Oguche, Marketing Manager TECNO Nigeria said; \u201cWe\u2019re very honoured to be listed again amongst Africa\u2019s Best Brands ranking this year and to be part of the key contributors to the development of African business. Shouldering African consumers\u2019 trust and great support, we will keep the momentum to continuously unlock our best of contemporary products and technologies for consumers across Africa and inspire them to pursue a better life via mobile technology innovations.\u201d\n\nAbout TECNOTECNO Mobile is a smartphone brand from TRANSSION Holdings.

          "title": "The Week Ahead",
          "text": "NERC set to enforce compensation to electricity consumers for power under-supply\n\nThe Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has moved to enforce compensation to electricity consumers for the under-supply of power to their homes and businesses with effect from Tuesday, 1st June, 2021. It can be recalled that in October 2020, NERC warned power distribution companies (DISCOs) that they will compensate affected consumers for defaulting in service delivery if they fail to supply the required quantum of electricity under the new service reflective tariff regime as the commission had deployed a mechanism to monitor the Discos.\n\nThe commission said that it is expected to start monitoring the DISCOs on a monthly basis to ensure compliance by the power firms in terms of meeting the agreement.\n\nThis policy however follows several complaints by energy consumers that the Service-Based Tariff (SBT), which has led to a huge increase in electricity bills paid by customers, only places obligations on them without appropriate sanctions for Distribution Companies (DISCOs) that under-supply. This was made known by the Deputy General Manager, Markets Competition and Rates, NERC, Mr Abba Terab, at the 58th Session of the Power Dialogue organized by the Electricity Hub, who said that for now, compensation will be based on a 60-day cycle.\n\nUnder the policy, customers are to pay for electricity in correlation with the level of service they get and how long they receive power daily. Therefore, it will be based on a minimum average hour of power supply and other metrics.\n\nConsumers are divided into five bands A\u2013E, where band A is for customers who get 20 hours of power and above daily; B is for customers who get power for 16 hours daily and C covers customers who enjoy power for 12 hours and above a day. Also, D is for those that enjoy power for 8 hours and above, while band E is for customers who only get four hours and above but below 8 hours of power supply daily.\n\nFederal Executive Council (FEC) meeting and police council meeting set to hold this week\n\nIn honour of the late Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, and ten other senior military officers and servicemen, who died in a plane crash on Friday, May 21, 2021, President Muhammadu Buhari thus directed the postponement of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting which was scheduled to hold on Wednesday, May 26, to Wednesday, June 2.\n\nSimilarly, the President also directed the postponement of the Police Council meeting, which was earlier scheduled for Thursday, May 27, to Thursday, June 3.\n\nThis disclosure was contained in a circular issued by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Boss Mustapha, on Monday in Abuja.\n\nHigh demand optimism as oil prices rise to 2-year high\n\nOil prices on Friday traded close to its highest in over 2 years, rising amid hopes that an ongoing economic recovery in the United States will have a positive impact on oil demand despite concern that Iranian supplies will increase if sanctions on its crude export is lifted.\n\nBrent crude futures rose by 0.35% with a weekly growth of 4.81% on Friday afternoon to close at $69.70 a barrel, while Western Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures rose by 0.36% to close at $67.21, after having settled at the strongest since October 2018 on Thursday. Also, the Bonny light crude rose by 0.50% to close at $68.01, with the OPEC basket going up by 0.09% to close at $67.47.\n\nThe chief Operating Officer of NNPC, on Thursday, said the cooperation is in advanced talks stage with Dangote Industries to acquire a 20 per cent stake in the 650,000 bpd Dangote oil refinery. He said the decision is majorly to ensure undisrupted product supply to Nigerians and that the risk associated with refinery business does not weigh solely on Dangote Industries.\n\nOutlook\n\nIn the coming week, oil prices are expected to be bullish as strong U.S. economic data and expectations of a rebound in global demand will outweigh concerns about more supply from Iran once sanctions are lifted.\n\nNBS release calendar for the week ahead\n\nThe NBS release calendar for the coming week indicates the following:\n\n\u2022 Monday 31st May, 2021: Nigerian Capital Importation Report (Q1, 2021) & Selected Banking Sector Data: Sectorial Breakdown of Credit, e-Payment channels and Staff Strength (Q1 2021).\n\n\u2022 Tuesday 25th May, 2021: Foreign Trade in Goods Statistics (Q1 2021).\n\n\u2022 Thursday 27th May, 2021: Q1, 2021 Terms of Trade Report.\n\nDespite inflation concerns, gold breaks $1,900 mark\n\nGold prices are expected to rise marginally in the coming week, as U.S. inflation ticks up which is favourable towards the precious metal.\n\nGold was bullish during the Asian session, completely erasing its 2021 losses as signs of inflationary pressures amplify investor concerns while the U.S. Federal Reserve assures investors of the outlook for monetary policy. Gold appreciated by 1.22% Week-on-Week to $1,909.65, soaring past the $1,900-mark and gaining in eight of the past nine trading sessions, while Silver also gained by 1.46% W-o-W.\n\nMore of the same for the naira\n\nIt was a bearish market for the Naira both at the official window and BDC window in the previous week which was attributed to the decision of the CBN adopting the NAFEX rate on its website after the MPC meeting held in the week.\n\nAt the I & E FX window, the Naira was flat on a week-on-week basis. The Naira closed the week at $1/N412.0 at the I&E FX window, at the NAFEX (spot market) it closed at $1/N411.00.\n\nMore of the same is expected in the week ahead as the Naira is anticipated to continue to hover around N406/$1-N412/$1 threshold.\n\nMoney market outlook\n\nFunding rates are expected to trend in double digits in the coming week. Funding rates continued their double-digit trend last week which was supported by constrained system liquidity which opened in a deficit of N296bn last week.\n\nFunding rates rose at the close of the week. Open Buyback (OBB) closed at 18.67% while Overnight (O/N) rates closed at 19.17% indicating a Week-on-Week (W-o-W) rise of +13.15% for OBB and +12.76% for O/N rates.\n\nTreasury bills market outlook\n\nActivity in the treasury bills market is expected to remain subdued next week as system liquidity remains relatively tight. The overall trading session of the Nigerian Treasury Bills market was bearish as investors\u2019 attention was skewed towards the Treasury bills auction by DMO.\n\nAt the close of the week, the average benchmark yield for T-bills was rose by +5.89% to close at 6.10% while OMO bills rose by +3.92% W-o-W to close at 9.59%.\n\nThe DMO sold N151.11 billion worth of notes against N63.16 billion offered at its NTB auction last week. The 91-day, 182-day & 364-day notes were allotted at 2.50%, 3.50%, & 9.65% respectively. Compared to the previous auction, rates on the 91-day & 182-day were unchanged while the 364-day paper fell by 10bps\n\nThe CBN offered N50 billion worth of OMO notes but sold N41.00 billion at its auction last week. The 96-day, 180-day & 348-day notes were allotted at 7.00%, 8.50% and 10.10% respectively.\n\nFGN bond and Eurobond market outlook\n\nWe expect market sentiment to remain soft in the near term in the absence of any trigger. The FGN bond market started the previous week on a relatively quiet note as attention was drawn to the outcome of the MPC meeting, however, towards the end of the week, activity improved which was on the back of liquidity improvement from FAAC disbursement and retail FX refund.\n\nAt the close of the week, the market was bearish with selling interest seen majorly at the short end and mid-end of the curve.\n\nThe overall average benchmark yields closed at 10.00% for the week which increased W-o-W by +5.00%.\n\nThe Eurobond market traded bullish for most of the trading session last week amid a continued drop in US treasury yield and improvement in crude prices, although the bullish sentiment was upturned by a rise in the US 10-year treasury yield, which inched up to 1.62%\n\nThe average benchmark yield closed at 6.08% at the end of the week declining W-o-W by -1.46%.\n\nNigerian capital market outlook\n\nNigerian stocks suffered another week of losses as investors sustained their profit taking on the exchange. The Nigerian bourse closed the week negative with a decline of -0.18%. The Nigerian Stock Exchange lost N34.97bn thus, year-to-date return deteriorated to -5.00%, while the market capitalization settled at N19.94 trillion.\n\nThe volume and value of stocks traded on the exchange last week advanced by +31.19% and +88.01% respectively.\n\nPerformance across sectors tracked was mixed negative last week as the NSE Insurance was the highest gainer for the week with +1.01% while NSE Banking recorded the highest decline with -1.80%. NSE Oil and Gas closed positive with +0.85% while NSE-IND, NSE-30, and NSE Consumer Goods closed the week negative with -0.43%, -0.34% and, -0.07% respectively.\n\nOutlook\n\nIn the coming week, we expect the bearish sentiment in the market to persist however, press releases from listed companies and other macroeconomic developments is likely to impact investors decisions. In addition, we expect investors to monitor the movement of yields in the fixed income market.\n\nThe Nigerian economy in retrospect\n\nNigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by +0.51%(year-on-year) in real terms in the first quarter of 2021, marking two consecutive quarters of growth following the negative growth rates recorded in the second and third quarters of 2020. The Q1 2021 growth rate was slower than the +1.87% growth rate recorded in Q1 2020 but higher than +0.11% recorded in Q4 2020, indicative of a slow but continuous recovery. Nevertheless, quarter on quarter, real GDP grew at -13.93% in Q1 2021 compared to Q4 2020, reflecting a generally slower pace of economic activities at the start of the year.\n\nAccording to the NBS selected price watch data for April 2021, the average price of 1 dozen Agric eggs medium size increased Y-o-Y by +11.26% and month-on-month by +1.13% to N530.40 in April 2021 from N524.47 in March 2021 while the average price of a piece of Agric eggs medium size (the price of one) increased year-on-year by +18.32% and month-on-month by +1.47% to N49.14 in April 2021 from N48.43 in March 2021. The average price of 1kg of tomato increased year-on-year by +0.09% and month-on-month by +3.67% to N277.26% in April 2021 from N267.45 in March 2021. The average price of 1kg of rice (imported high quality sold loose) increased year-on-year by +14.57% and declined month-on-month by -0.67% to N540.58 in April 2021 from N544.21 in March 2021. Similarly, the average price of 1kg of yam tuber increased year-on-year by +9.87% and month on month by +3.26% to N252.80 in April 2021 from N244.82 in March 2021.\n\nThe Bank of Industry reported that its total assets grew by +78.85% from N1.04trn to N1.86trn. The rise was largely attributed to the successful debt syndications of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn and $1bn that was concluded in March and December 2020 respectively. Furthermore, its equity rose by +15.3% from N293.08bn in the previous year to N336.48bn in 2020 while its loans and advances grew by +1.3% to N749.84bn. Its profit before tax declined by -9.6% to N35.54bn, attributed to the challenging environment in the economy. The Chairman of the Bank, Mr. Aliyu Dikko noted that it facilitated the disbursement of N2.5bn and N1.2bn under the N-Power and Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programs to 300,011 and 109,039 beneficiaries respectively.\n\nAccording to its disclosed circular titled \u2018New license requirements for the payment system\u2019, the Central Bank of Nigeria set a new capital requirement for payments firms in the country. It stated that to have a Payment Terminal Service Provider license, a firm was required to have N100m shareholders\u2019 funds unimpaired by losses. It retained super agent\u2019s license at N50m, Switching and Processing firm\u2019s license at N2bn; Mobile Money Operator\u2019s license at N2bn; Payment Solution Services at N250m and Payment Solution Service Provider at N100m. The CBN specified a non-refundable application fee of N100,000 via the licensing fees. According to the capital requirements, the payment firms must have an escrow refundable N2bn into the CBN PSP share capital deposit account.\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted unanimously to retain all parameters constant. This was disclosed by the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele while reading the communique at the end of the MPC meeting on Tuesday 25 May 2021. The MPR was retained at 11.5%, the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR, and CRR was retained at 27.5%.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and Bonga Production Sharing Contract (PSC) partners signed watershed agreements to unlock about $700m revenue to the federation and free the parties from billions of dollars in contingent liabilities. The agreement saw the renewal of Oil Mining Lease 118 for another 20 years.\n\nThe Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) On Wednesday stated that Nigeria requires about $2 billion monthly in revenue to remain sustainable. The Director, DPR, Sarki Auwalu said there is need to upscale the nation\u2019s oil reserve and monetise gas to generate more revenue given the sector\u2019s over 70% contribution to monthly fiscal revenue.",

But the country has yet to wean itself off the problems left behind by the \u201ckhaki boys\u201d.\n\nIn fact, things have grown worse. There can be no better way to put it!\n\nMany Nigerians are today lamenting: if this is living, dying is better! That it is suffocating here is to put it mildly.\n\nIn 22 years, the quality of life of Nigerians has not improved. Nigerians have grown farther apart. The economy has grown from bad to worse, to the point that all the tiers of government are contemplating reducing the minimum wage, which was nothing to write home about in the first place.\n\nThe powers that be have become very nepotistic in all their doings to the point that the country has been further balkanized.\n\nAt the return to civil rule 22 years ago, hope was high that life was going to be grand as the military handed over power to a democratically elected President Olusegun Obasanjo in a colourful ceremony in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nThe mood was upbeat and the new president had promised prosperity to the millions of his countrymen who had massed out at the Eagle Square venue of the inauguration.\n\nThose who had no opportunity to be physically present at the venue glued to their television screen and radio speakers to listen to the speech of the new leader.\n\nToday, such speeches no longer move a needle. Many Nigerians have grown weary of what appear to be empty claims of sterling performance that does not positively change their lives.\n\nThe economy has receded, worsened by the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. In a space of five years in the life of the current administration, the country suffered two recessions.\n\nThe country has an unenviable record of being the poverty headquarters of the world. A country naturally endowed with natural resources has not been able to leverage the blessing to the good of the citizenry.\n\nREAD ALSO: The face of poverty in Nigeria\n\nAlthough the world is shifting attention to crude oil, Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country, is still heavily reliant on oil. Petroleum represents more than 80 percent of total export revenue here, according to the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nNo lesson was learnt in 2016 when the global oil price crashed, terribly affecting Nigeria\u2019s economy. That was when the country went into a recession, its first in 25 years.\n\nThe Covid-19-induced recession of last year could have been avoided if there had been a conscious effort at diversifying beyond the lip service paid to it.\n\nThe advice by experts to government to walk the talk on the diversification of the nation\u2019s economy has not been heeded.\n\nThe experts believe that Nigeria needs to tap into the agricultural sector where the country can put millions of the unemployed to work.\n\nIt is their view that investment in infrastructure will also put many young people to work and reduce inflation.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) figures, unemployment rate in the country increased to 33.30 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 from 27.10 percent in the second quarter of 2020.\n\nThe country\u2019s headline inflation rate for March 2021 rose to 18.17 percent from 17.33 percent recorded in February.\n\nMajor reason for this is that Nigeria\u2019s environment has become so tough for businesses that many companies have either closed shop or executed major salary cuts and layoffs of their employees.\n\nThe situation got worse since the worldwide outbreak of Covid-19.\n\nDespite the booms Nigeria had enjoyed, it did not save for the rainy day, hence widespread extreme poverty among the populace.\n\nThe latest report by World Poverty Clock has shown that more Nigerians have been plunged into extreme poverty since 2019. The latest figure shows that 105 million Nigerians now live in extreme poverty.\n\nAmong other vices that have retarded the economic growth of Nigeria are corruption and nepotism.\n\nThe country still remains one of the most corrupt nations on the planet. Transparency International still ranked Nigeria topmost in its latest corruption perceptions index.\n\nIn one of its reports, some years back, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), a global auditing firm, said if corruption was not dealt with immediately, it could cost Nigeria up to 37 percent of its GDP by 2030.\n\nAlthough all the administrations that had presided over power since 1999 claimed one of their priorities was to rid the country off corruption, they have encouraged corruption in various ways. The current government appears to have taken corruption to a higher level by announcing that whoever that joins their party would not be prosecuted. Hence, the mass defection to the party by politicians that have corruption allegations hanging on their neck.\n\nNigeria has also been overrun by bandits, insurgents and kidnappers, making life so difficult for innocent citizens.\n\nThe Federal Government seems to have been overwhelmed as those expected to lead from the front are now pronouncing openly that the country is at a crossroads.\n\nSince 2009, the North Eastern Nigeria has been hit by security challenges. The Islamist sect, Boko Haram, a group that wants to establish an Islamic state following a strict interpretation of Islamic law, has waged a deadly insurgency.\n\nThe low-grade war has claimed the lives of thousands of people and forced millions of others to flee their homes.\n\nThe activities of bandits and Fulani herdsmen across the country have driven farmers away from their farms. The rampaging of herdsmen has become so rampant that geopolitical zones in the country have resorted to self help as it appears the Federal Government is not sincerely addressing the issue.\n\nAt no other time since the civil war have Nigerians lived in such a fear that people no longer sleep with their two eyes closed than now.\n\nFrom the kidnap of over 270 school girls in Chibok in 2014, kidnapping of school children in various parts of the North has become an everyday affair under the nose of government.\n\nREAD ALSO: Poverty and Widening Inequality in Nigeria\n\nKidnapping for ransom has become the in-thing in Nigeria despite the castrated warning by government against payment of ransom.\n\nTwenty-two years after return to civil rule, Nigerians have grown farther apart, with many more people and ethnic nationalities clamouring for restructuring or outright secession.\n\nThe ongoing constitutional amendment being embarked upon by the National Assembly is a pointer that the country is sick.\n\nEven at that, many people believe that there is no amount of tinkering of the 1999 Constitution that could heal Nigeria\u2019s putrefying sore; they are rather demanding a brand-new document.\n\nAt a public forum recently, Nnia Nwodo, immediate past president of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, said the 1999 Constitution was not a document to be relied upon in the governance of a nation.\n\n\u201cForty-nine people were selected to write a constitution. Forty people in the Supreme Military Council promulgated a constitution under General (Abdulsami) Abubakar, a government in which I served. I was in the Executive Council, I never saw that constitution, but I was the minister of information. It was my responsibility to publicise it to the country,\u201d Nwodo said.\n\n\u201cOn the day of swearing-in of (Olusegun) Obasanjo, we didn\u2019t have a copy of the constitution. I didn\u2019t know who was printing it and my ministry was supposed to pay for the printing. And Obasanjo was sworn in on a constitution that had not been read by anybody, and the National Assembly could not be constituted until four days after his swearing in, because there was no clean copy of the constitution. We cannot build on quicksand. A country can\u2019t live on falsehood,\u201d he said.\n\nTwenty-two years after return to civil rule, there is actually no freedom of speech or association, as government harasses citizens and intimidates those who hold different opinions from them. Many people strongly believe that Nigeria is still under the jackboot.\n\nNigerians are, indeed, yearning for a breath of fresh air.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nChildren are wonderful gifts to their parents and are treasured, catered for and trained, equipping them with the basic needs and characters to face the challenges of life with the hope that they become great leaders of tomorrow to pilot the affairs of the society, states, nation and the world at large.\n\nFollowing the recognition of the role played by children in each family and the need to celebrate and make them feel loved and important, preparing them for leadership positions in future, a day was set aside for them.\n\nA day was set aside to celebrate children, and that day is \u201cCHILDREN\u2019S DAY\u201d. May 27 is traditionally the children\u2019s holiday in Nigeria, a day to celebrate the children.\n\nChildren\u2019s Day began in 1857 by Reverend Dr Charles Leonard in Chelsea, US. Even though Children\u2019s Day is celebrated globally by most of the countries in the world on June 1st, Universal Children\u2019s Day takes place annually on November 20th.\n\nChildren\u2019s Day is a commemorative date celebrated annually in honor of children, whose date of observance varies by countries as the international Children\u2019s Day was first proclaimed in Geneva during the World Conference on Child Welfare in 1952. While United Nations first established the day in 1964, the day remains important in the lives of many Nigerian kids.\n\nIt is a national day to celebrate the importance of children and the day provides policymakers and families with an opportunity to consider the personal development of young Nigerians.\n\nIt is a public holiday for Primary and Secondary school children. Due to the large size of the country, only a few groups of children (schools or other organizations) are selected to participate in march past parade as organised by various states across the federation. The ravaging COVID 19 pandemic has even slowed down the celebration as large crowd is prohibited to check the spread.\n\nOn May 27th every year, children are granted a holiday while several social activities are centred on them. Excused from school, most kids converge at stadiums and centres to commemorate the event. COVID 19 however has changed the way its been celebrated across the globe.\n\nGovernor Godwin Obaseki\u2019s led administration places great premium on the lives of Edo children, preparing them for leadership positions in the state, country and world at large. Flowing from this, the governor introduced Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EDOBEST) programme to lay a good foundation for them.\n\nEDOBEST, is a programme organised to catch the kids young at the basic level educationally with the use of technology in learning. This programme is chaired by a committed, dedicated, selfless, and hardworking Edo woman and the Chairman Edo State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) Dr. Joan Osa Oviawe. Under her dynamic leadership, Edo children have benefited greatly from EDOBEST. They can now read, write, do arithmetic correctly. Most striking is that even primary one pupils in public schools across Edo State are now able to read books meant for their age category.\n\nTo ensure that learning does not just end in the classroom, SUBEB decided to key into 2021 celebration to show and express how important Edo children are to the Obaseki\u2019s administration.\n\nThe children\u2019s day celebration was held across the 18 Local Government Area of Edo State with various activities to spice up the day for the children and make it memorable. Children in Edo South, Edo Central and Edo North were all captured in the celebration galore, thanks to the foresight of Dr. Joan Osa Oviawe.\n\nThe 2021 Children\u2019s Day celebration with the theme: \u201cUnite to reverse the impacts of COVID 19 Pandemic on children,\u201d President Muhammadu Buhari celebrated the Day with a solemn promise to bequeath a better country for the present and future generations. He described children as precious blessings that should be nurtured to carry the burden of the society in the future.\n\nIn a message to celebrate Edo children, Governor Godwin Obaseki assured that his administration will sustain ongoing reforms to strengthen public institutions to guarantee a sustainable future for Edo children. He added that his administration will continue to implement policy reforms to benefit children in the state. \u201cI am delighted to mark this year\u2019s Children\u2019s Day and celebrate our children, who are the future of Edo State and Nigeria\u201d.\n\nHe said Edo children were beneficiaries of very pragmatic reforms that the administration have undertaken in the education sector over the past four years.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed fulfilling that we can see the evidence of the huge investment made in transforming the way our children learn, which is manifest in the outcomes from our basic education sector.\u201d\n\nEdo pupils across the 18 Local Government Area were very much involved in this year\u2019s celebration as SUBEB and Edo State Government engaged them in various activities despite restrictions necessitated by coronavirus pandemic.\n\nUnlike previous celebration held in Benin, the Executive Chairman of SUBEB Dr. Joan Osa Oviawe said the celebration was discentralised in 2019 to ensure children participate across the three senatorial districts. She explained that the COVID 19 pandemic led to SUBEB taking it a step further by organising \u201cmicro children\u2019s day\u201d celebration across the 18 LGA. She noted that a major highlight for the 2021 celebration was launch of \u201cEvery Child a Reading Champion\u201d literacy campaign.\n\n\u201cAs part of the 2021 celebration, we have launched \u2018Every Child a Reading Champion Literacy campaign\u2019. The aim is for our children leaving primary school to know how to read. When leaving primary six our pupils will be able to read fluently and also can author a book. That is the standard we are setting for ourselves. We are also rolling out classroom library where each child take turn to become the class liberian.\n\n\u201cSince 2018 when EDOBEST was launched, over seven million textbooks and instructional materials have been distributed to schools across the State. For the 2021 celebration, we have distributed over 40,000 books and instructional materials.\n\nFrom Ehor in Uhunmwode, Abudu in Orihiomwon, Idogbo in Ikpoba-Okha to Uselu in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State, it was all celebration and fun for the children. Moving to Etsako West in Edo North, Ubiaja in Esan South East, the stories were not different, it was a day to celebrate Edo children.\n\nIn Ehor, Abudu and Idogbo children engaged in match past, poem recitations, football game, cultural display by participating schools. Even pupils from far Central and North did not need to come to Benin City to be part of it the excitement. Edo pupils were celebrated in Ekpoma, Ubiaja, Auchi and other designated locations for the event across the 18 LGA.\n\nIn Ehor, the focus was on parents. They were urged to inculcate fear of God into their children as they mark the day in Uhunmwode Local Government Area. A teacher, Mr Ohenhen Johnson, of Uwa Model Primary school in Uhunmwode local government area, said that it was necessary for all parents and guardians to inculcate fear of God into their children and wards.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe children are the future leaders, so parents must not fail in this direction, our responsibilities goes beyond just housing, feeding and providing shelter for them\u201d.\n\nAnother teacher, Mrs. Francisca Eze of Victory Primary School in Ehor, called on government at all levels to keep investing in the educational sector, adding that education is key to the development and success of the country.\n\nEze said that parents also should keep assisting their children while at home and ensure they bring them up in God\u2019s way.\n\nIn Abudu the administrative headquarters of Orihiomwon Local Government Area of Edo State, the Head of Local Government Administration (HOLGA) and acting Chairman of the council, Dr. Francis Odigie was on ground to celebrate with the children as he mounted the podium to recieve salute from the over 10 schools that participated in a match past at the council secretariat, venue for the event.\n\nHe said children should be celebrated as the leaders of tommorow. He lauded the Governor Godwin Obaseki led administration for creating the platform for children of the state to have access to basic education through the establishment of EDOBEST which has introduced technology to learning.\n\nThe Education Secretary of the council Aghedo Gideon expressed joy for this celebration saying the children has never had it so good. He emphasized that the collaboration between SUBEB and Edo State Government has improved the education system in Edo State.\n\nIn Auchi Edo North, SUBEB focused its celebration on achieving global standard literacy, numeracy skills in the state. It challenged leaders and parents to equip children to enable them compete globally and emerge employable in the digital age and age to come.\n\n\u201cAll the children of Edo represent our future, and we owe it to ourselves and our children to invest wisely and build the right institutions, system and processes\u201d.\n\nMrs. Joy Ojobor who represented the SUBEB Chairman said launching a campaign to make every child in the state a \u201cReading Champion\u201d is to encourage the culture of reading among children of the state.\n\n\u201cThe ability to read is the key that unlocks vast knowledge and capacity that is responsible for shaping a secured future\u201d.\n\nAt Ubiaja and other locations across other four local government area of Esan Central senatorial District, the celebration continued with match past, cultural displays and other activities. EDSG in collaboration with SUBEB also restated its commitment to increase school enrollment in both primary and secondary schools in the State.\n\nParents were urged not to discourage children from attending classes as the governor remained committed in its efforts to direct resources towards the education and welfare of all Edo children. The parents were told that Edo state continues to lead with the lowest number of \u201cout of school children\u201d in the the country.\n\nAcross the 18 Local Government Area of Edo State, on a day meant for them, children expressed their happiness and readiness to step in to leadership positions to pilot the affairs of the State. Some pupils of Uwa Model Primary School, Ikhuenerio including Victory Egberanmwen and Perpetual Osaretin could not hide their joy.\n\nAccording to Victory, \u201cI feel so happy to be here to compete and have fun with other pupils. I thank the governor for EDOBEST which has made my school look so beautiful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will like to thank Governor Obaseki for the gift of books, I feel so excited to be part of this year\u2019s Children\u2019s Day celebration,\u201d Perpetual said.\n\nThis is the first children\u2019s day since the outbreak of Coronavirus and looking at it now, it shows that we are overcoming the COVID, as education stakeholders were all happy that Children\u2019s Day celebration held in 2021.\n\nThe stakeholders also expressed hope that with the launch of \u201cEvery Child a Reading Champion\u201d during the 2021 children\u2019s day in Edo State, the dividends will soon be realized in pupils as they would become not only fluent readers but champions in all aspects of academic disciplines.\n\n...",

After slaughtering them, they entered Odoke, from that Odoke, they went to Obapta,\u201d Nation quoted him as saying.\n\n\u201cCurrently, people that were slaughtered in Ndiobasi are up to 30 according to the video clips on the incident but Odoke and Obapta are very far and nobody was able to entered those two villages to capture those that were killed.\n\n\u201cWhen I received call from one of my villagers over the attack, he told me that the herdsmen are currently at Ojaba forest and that place is their hideout because there is no other way for them to escape.\n\n\u201cThe herdsmen are currently in that forest as at the time I was called on phone\u201d\n\n\u201cI was told our local government Chairman went with some security men but couldn\u2019t get to the affected villages. If there is a way security agents will be sent to the affected villages, it will be good.\n\n\u201cCurrently, I have been trying to reach my family members on phone but their lines are not through and all of them are in the village,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother resident, Onyibe Jeremiah lamented no action was taken to protect the communities despite earlier warnings of thw herdsmen impending attacks.\n\nH\u00e9 said: \u201cOne young man from Enugu state that saw the herdsmen when they were coming into the Ebonyi villages made the voice call that went viral to alert the state but it appears that it was ignored which was why these attacks were recorded despite the alert.\n\n\u201cNobody took that voice serious and the herdsmen came and killed not less than 30 people now. They are currently attacking more villages\u201d\n\nThe Ananda Marga Universal Relief Team (AMURT) confirmed two children were killed while being taken to the hospital for treatment.\n\nIt said it has scrambled a team to the area to help in treatment and evacuation of victims.\n\n\u201cTerrible scenes at Ohagelode Health Center this morning. An attack on an Izzi village inside Benue State, allegedly by herdsmen, resulted in many casualties.\n\n\u201cMany were carried all the way to Ohagelode Health Center. The Uloanwu Ambulance was called and eleven 11 person\u2019s, six adults and five children, were transported to AEFUTHA in Abakaliki.\n\n\u201cSadly two children already died after reaching AEFUTHA. An AMURT team of doctors, lead by Dr. Omogo, the MD of AMURT has rushed to Ohagelode. We are trying to support the wounded carried to AEFUTHA, the statement by AMURT West Africa\u201d, the statement said.\n\nChairman of Ebonyi local government area, Chinyere Nwaogbaga confirmed the incident.\n\nShe said she went to the area and helped to evacuate many of the residents from the area to hospital.\n\n\u201cYes, the communities are Izzi(a clan in Ebonyi) speaking communities but they are geographically located in Benue. Since they are indigenes of Ebonyi though located in Benue, the State governor directed we go and bring them to hospital and treat them and also give them relive materials\u201d.\n\nShe said more buses have been sent to the area by the local government, Ebonyi Speaker and the State Government to evacuate more victims.",

          "text": "Separatist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has condoled with the family of Ahmed Gulak, a chieftain of the All Progressive Congress (APC) who was killed in Owerri, Imo State by gunmen on Sunday.\n\nIPOB in a statement issued by its spokesman, Emma Powerful, said it had no hand in the death of the former Special Assistant on Politics to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, contrary to speculations.\n\nThe group said Gulak was not a threat to the Biafra agitation and moreover, the group is not a terrorist network, so had no reason to assassinate the ex-Presidential aide.\n\nGulak was murdered on Sunday morning in Owerri, the Imo State capital while trying to catch a flight at Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport.\n\nAccording to the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Bala Elkana, Gulak did not inform the security agents of his movement despite knowing the worsening security issues in the country.\n\nReacting on Sunday, the Nnamdi Kanu-led Biafra secessionist group said, \u201cThe attention of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) ably led by our great leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, has been drawn to the untenable allegation by the security agencies that IPOB was responsible for the assassination of former presidential aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Ahmed Gulak on his way to Sam Mbakwe Airport Owerri Imo State.\n\n\u201cWe therefore state without equivocations that IPOB knows nothing about the said assassination. In the first place, what threat did the late Gulak constitute to our cause to warrant his elimination? We had nothing in common with him and could not have in any way killed him.\n\n\u201cPointing accusing fingers at IPOB for this barbaric act is only meant to divert attention away from the real masterminds. This is the same way terrorists in security uniform commit various atrocities in South-East and turn around to blame IPOB for their crimes just to tarnish our global reputation.\n\n\u201cThis is purely a smokescreen to justify their long awaited plan to declare another special military operation in the Eastern region to kill more innocent Biafrans,\u201d IPOB said.\n\nIPOB faulted the security agencies for trying to frame its members without probing the death of the late Presidential aide.\n\n\u201cInstead of the security agencies to properly investigate the incident and possible factors they were switch to accuse IPOB of a crime we know nothing about. Did IPOB have the itinerary of the late Gulak to have waylaid him at the airport?\n\n\u201cBefore linking IPOB with the crime the jaundiced zoo security agencies should have first investigated Gulak\u2019s host, Hope Uzodima, as well as his political opponents to establish their possible involvement.\n\n\u201cThis is akin to the allegation by the Lagos Commissioner of Police who raised false alarm recently that IPOB and ESN were planning to attack Lagos State.\n\n\u201cThis was to conceal the plans by the terrorists patronising Nigerian Government to use their imported terrorists to bomb soft targets in the City of Lagos and blame it on IPOB. But thank God some discerning minds understood their antics and did not fall for their cheap propaganda.\n\n\u201cWe are not surprised that they quickly pointed accusing fingers at us just as they have always looked for every opportunity to incriminate us to frustrate our struggle for Biafra restoration. But this too will not fly because the world is aware that IPOB is a peaceful movement. IPOB is not a terrorist organization and does not spill blood.\n\n\u201cHad the late Chief of Army Staff Attahiru\u2019s plane crashed in the East, definitely, the so-called Intelligence Agency would say it was IPOB that shot down the plane and everyone in Fulani controlled Sharia core North would believe it. For us, linking IPOB with the assassination of Gulak is simply to pitch the East against the core Islamic North as a cover and justification for another round of pogrom against Easterns living in the North.\u201d\n\nWhile saying the group in its mournful mood of its heroes, sympathise with Gulak\u2019s family, it also reiterated that it is after having sovereign nation of Biafra, so killing of politicians is not in its plan.\n\n\u201cWe are only after the restoration of Biafra. Assassination of politicians is not part of our agenda otherwise we would have killed the Efulefu politicians in the Eastern region sabotaging our struggle.\n\n\u201cWe are in mournful mood ahead of the May 31st Biafra Remembrance Day in honour of our fallen heroes. The terrorists in security uniform looking for any slightest opportunity to blackmail us should not cash in on the sit-at-home order given by our Leader for our fallen heroes.\n\n\u201cThe order is for Monday and not Sunday. People were freely moving about on the streets of Biafra without any molestations by IPOB and there was no way we could have singled out Gulak for attack because we a non-violent movement.\n\n\u201cOnce again we urge the illiterate and clearly unintelligent agencies masquerades as intelligence agencies we have in Nigeria to please leave IPOB out of their messy incompetence. We challenge Aso Rock to Institute an independent panel of inquiry to investigate the incident and expose those behind this gruesome murder of an innocent man.\n\n\u201cOur hearts go out to the family of Gulak. May his soul rest in peace,\u201d the statement concluded.",

          "title": "The golden opportunity before Nigeria, By Valentine Ozigbo",
          "text": "Nigeria is a country that tells a story of enormous promise and unimaginable tragedy all at once. While we can boast of numerous bright spots, the most being our tremendous human talent and capital, we also have tales of inexcusable missed opportunities.\n\nIt is a settled fact that a significant part of the dysfunction in Nigeria is a direct consequence of failed leadership. Nigeria became a republic in 1963, and for the first 36 years, our experiments with democracy experienced frequent interruptions by the military.\n\nOur current and longest democratic dispensation, which we call the 4th Republic, began on May 29, 1999, when our last military ruler, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, handed over power to an elected government led by General Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd).\n\nThe military regime led by General Abubakar created Nigeria\u2019s 1999 Constitution, the legal instrument upon which our current democracy is based. Clearly an imperfect document, our constitution has come under intense scrutiny in the past few years. I believe it is now a perfect time for all Nigerian patriots to come together and create an authentic constitution \u201cfor the people by the people and of the people\u201d.\n\nWhile, our National Assembly has begun the process of a constitutional amendment, we cannot ignore the agitations from influential quarters across the country demanding a brand new constitution. One of the recent high-profile interventions on this issue is that of the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, who called for a return to the 1963 Constitution.\n\nOne of the pitfalls we must avoid in charting a new path for Nigeria is to be so hasty in doing away with what no longer serves us without giving careful thought to its replacement. Unfortunately, romanticising about our past is a national habit we have acquired and at times, it has led us down the wrong path. The outcome of the 2015 presidential elections is a clear example.\n\nI do not believe that a 1963 document approved for Nigeria by the British colonial masters will adequately meet the needs of the 21st Century. We have to be surgical in our approach. We have to consider the evolution of our country. We must realise that the Nigeria of 1960 is not the same country of 2021. A lot of water has passed under the bridge. We have experienced a civil war in which more than three million Igbos died. We have experienced some of the most brutal military regimes, ethnic cleansing and genocidal episodes. Our fault lines have been watered by decades of injustice, marginalisation, extremism, corruption and intolerance.\n\nOne of the most critical factors, which we cannot ignore, is the information revolution. Nigerians now have more access to information in one day than they had in one year in the 60s. We cannot afford secretive processes in governance or public policy. It is no longer permissible for a few men to gather and decide on the fate of 200 million people.\n\nOur focus as a country should be to create a more just and inclusive society that works for all Nigerians. We must do away with the system that leaves too many of us excluded and disenfranchised. We must expand the political space to include more women and youth participation. We must create a society where the fundamental human rights of all Nigerians are guaranteed and enforced without favour.\n\nSince everything rises and falls on leadership, as John Maxwell preaches, it is, therefore, crucial that we look into the leadership recruitment process. The system of government matters just as much as the process through which our leaders emerge. We need to reduce the cost of electioneering and create a performance-based governance system. We have to look into the economic and environmental injustice suffered by the Niger Delta region.\n\nIt is my firm belief that Nigeria sits on the edge of history. On one side is a total collapse and on the other side is a brand new country filled with hope and promise. Therefore, the good people of Nigeria need to take the megaphone from those who sing war songs and instead, send a message of peace, unity, and hope to our people.\n\nI believe that peace is possible. But we must first restore justice, equity and fairness. After all, these are the fundamental promise of democracy.\n\nOzigbo is a leading PDP aspirant for Anambra governorship and the immediate past President and Group CEO of Transcorp Plc",

NNPC has not announced it again. So, we cannot say for how long DPR is going to keep paying,\u201d he said.",

These range from pain, swelling at the site of the inoculation, to body pains and nausea.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, 52 cases of moderate to severe incidents of AEFI have been reported. These presented as fever, vomiting, diarrhea headaches, dizziness and allergic reactions.\n\n\u201cFive states have the highest records of the AEFI namely: Kaduna (970) Cross River (859), Yobe (541), Kebbi (511), and Lagos (448),\u201d he disclosed.\n\nAccording to Shuaib, as of today, April 16th, 1,071,346, representing 53.2% of the eligible persons targeted with the AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered their first dose in this vaccination phase.\n\nHe said the data were based on reports received from states through the Electronic Management of Immunization Data (EMID) system only and did not take into account vaccinations that were not yet captured in the system.\n\n\u201cWhat this number means is that these are the people who have their information already uploaded on our data base, while others are awaiting upload, potentially due to network problems and the high traffic of those coming in to take their shots at the same time.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to optimize our registration and immunization data system, we also encourage the state teams to deploy the most suitable internet service for their locations in order to speed up the data entry process, so that we can have the actual number of vaccinated people at any given time,\u201d he said.\n\nShuaib added that in many states, the inoculation of frontline health workers had been completed and that they had begun offering vaccination to the elderly, particularly those that were 65 years and above.\n\n\u201cWe are glad to be able to progress quickly offer immunization to more members of the community.\n\n\u201cOur rollout has been marked by safety, efficiency, best practice, and speed.

Ford told the team that the long duration was due to the challenges of configuring the aircraft to fit NAF\u2019s required specifications.\n\nThe visiting team which also included Honourables Babajimi Benson, Shehu Koko, Abubakar Maki and Honourable Abass Adigun were received on arrival at Jacksonville, Florida by the Nigerian Defence Attach\u00e9 to the USA, Air Commodore Jibrin Usman, the Lead Foreign Liaison Officer on the A-29, Air Vice Marshal Sule Lawal and senior management staff EDSI.\n\nNigPilot, Daily Nigerian Newspaper, Nigerian News Update, Nigerian News Headlines, Nigerian Pilot Newspaper Online,",

New infections are being reported and newer strains are being discovered.\n\n\u201cAlthough vaccines are a powerful weapon against COVID-19, they are not the only tool. We must continue using all the tools at our disposal including diagnostics, therapeutics, and the full range of proven public health measures.\n\n\u201cWe must not stop until the war against COVID-19 is won. There is no doubt that the challenge of delivering COVID-19 vaccines around the region is a colossal one, but we are confident that with the critical steps being taken and with the support of our partners, we would eventually succeed,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his goodwill message at the official opening of the season, the President of the Nigerian Senate, Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan said that this session is taking place as the sub-region, and indeed, the global community is smarting from the Covid-19 pandemic, and the distraction it caused for humanity.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cDespite unfortunate deaths, our response illustrates our resilience in the face of challenges and emergencies. Lessons from the experience are worthy of note and should be useful in our efforts to achieve set goals, and in resolving other trials.\n\nOf primary importance is not only the need to strengthen and grow democracy and its institutions but similarly in ensuring that the advancements we are making is not reversed. We have proved that democracy is representative, inclusive and integrative.\n\n\u201cImplied in these attributes are freedom, rights, happiness and progress. Our nations have showed reasonable commitments to exhibiting these values, and we have a duty as parliamentarians and governments to ensure improved realization of these ideals.\n\nCommon to our illustrious histories is a high regard for the interest of the people, trusting that fulfilment of their quest is a ground for communal and social peace\u201d.\n\nHe also observed that while the ECOWAS protocol on Free Movement of Persons and Goods remains a prized policy, for instance; insecurity, instability, and conflicts are matters requiring continuous attention.",

Hon. Sidie Mohamed Tunis said this at the ongoing 2021 Ordinary Session of ECOWAS Parliament holding in Abuja, the Nigerian Capital.\n\nHe said that it is time the sub regional body takes firm and decisive actions against forces that tend to reverse this trend.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe have been following closely unfolding developments in Mali. Earlier this year, I led a Parliamentary Fact-Finding Mission to that Country and held discussions with all Stake Holders in the transition process. We were assured by all parties of their commitment towards a transition to democratic rule.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we have observed a few days ago, a dramatic shift in the political situation, which led to the arrest of the Transitional President, His Excellency Bah N\u2019Daw and the Prime Minister, Mr. Moctar Ouane. I wish to emphasize that the ECOWAS Parliament condemns, in the strongest terms, the military take over in Mali and all acts in the region that threatens or stalls the process of entrenching Democracy across our States.\n\n\u201cWe have made many efforts in securing a peaceful and stable ECOWAS and it is about time we take firm and decisive actions against forces that tend to reverse this trend\u201d.\n\nThe Speaker added that the ECOWAS Parliament stands ready to support all efforts aimed at putting Mali on the right trajectory of peace and democracy.\n\nThis is even as the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government is to convene an emergency Extra Ordinary Summit in a bid to amicably resolve the political crisis in Mali.\n\nThe Chairman of the Authority of the Heads of State and Government, and President of Ghana, Mr. Nana Akufo Addo,\n\ndecried the development in Mali.\n\nHe said that the summit will deliberate on how to find a lasting solution to the crisis in West Africa.\n\nHe noted that he has authorized the ECOWAS mediation delegation to Mali, which is headed by former Nigerian President, Goodluck Jonathan, to do an assessment of the entire situation.\n\n\u201cI will look at the report and then summon an emergency extraordinary session of Heads of States and Government of the ECOWAS region to review the relationship between ECOWAS and Mali,\u201d he concluded.",

          "text": "Every Manchester City fan I spoke to outside the ground in Porto after their defeat in the Champions League final asked me the same thing \u2013 \u2018why didn\u2019t he play Fernandinho?\u2019\n\nBut I can see why City boss Pep Guardiola left his captain out, and I can understand why Rodri didn\u2019t start either.\n\nPep has thought \u2018I don\u2019t need a holding midfielder in the centre\u2019 because Chelsea play with two men on the outside in Mason Mount and Kai Havertz behind Timo Werner.\n\nPep thought by going with Ilkay Gundogan in there instead, City could be more creative \u2013 but he must have known it would leave them much more open than usual.\n\nChelsea were clever, of course. Although they kept their defensive shape extremely well, they were not passive about it \u2013 they were trying things as well.\n\nThey knew City wanted to press them high, so they pulled Havertz on to Oleksandr Zinchenko to stop him pushing on to Reece James down their right side. That worked going forward as well as defensively.\n\nHavertz was constantly playing on Zinchenko\u2019s shoulder, but the only time he ran inside him was for Chelsea\u2019s winner, when Ruben Dias was dragged away by Werner and it left that big gap down the middle.\n\nMeanwhile, James just had Raheem Sterling to look after rather than worrying about Zinchenko coming at him too, and he dealt with Sterling brilliantly.\n\nIt was the same on the opposite flank, where Mount pushed on to Kyle Walker and Ben Chilwell kept Riyad Mahrez quiet.\n\nSo, out wide, Chelsea were on top. When City\u2019s wingers got in one-on-one situations, they rarely got past James or Chilwell whether they went inside them or outside.\n\nDown the middle, N\u2019Golo Kante was breaking play up so well too, pinching things and stopping City from building any momentum with their passing.\n\n\u2018Tuchel\u2019s masterclass leaves Guardiola in despair\u2019\n\nWe\u2019re the best team in the world \u2013 Mount\n\nUltimately, City will be disappointed they didn\u2019t move Chelsea around more, but you have to give huge credit to Thomas Tuchel for the way he set Chelsea up.\n\nWith five at the back, and two in front, there was no way through.\n\nKante was meant to be a fitness doubt with a hamstring injury but he absolutely bossed the midfield.\n\nI could tell there was no problem with him when he darted into City\u2019s box to get on the end of a cross in the first few minutes. You don\u2019t make runs like that if you are just trying to get through a game, and he ended up playing an integral role.\n\nCity\u2019s line-up was a bold one, but Kante was one of the reasons they ended up barely registering a shot on target.\n\nOfficially they had one, when Edouard Mendy blocked a Sterling flick early on, but James had already got a foot in and the chance had pretty much gone.\n\nThat was the only time Mendy had to make a save \u2013 apart from that there were a couple of dangerous balls across his box, and a Mahrez shot in stoppage time that flew just over.\n\nThat was it, while Chelsea kept getting behind City, and had plenty of other opportunities before and after their goal.\n\nThe lack of an attacking threat wasn\u2019t the only way this was totally different to the kind of display we have got used to seeing from City this season.\n\nPep changed things around a few games into the campaign and basically said his side were now going to stay tight, and allow fewer counter-attacks against them.\n\nCity focused on keeping the ball and grinding teams down from there, and we have seen countless masterclasses in that from them in the past few months.\n\nThis time, though, it was as if Pep thought he had to go and open the game up, because otherwise Chelsea would have just sat in.\n\nI am sure he understood the risks that went with doing that. I\u2019d be amazed if he didn\u2019t \u2013 but for various reasons, his plan did not work.\n\nHe will get some criticism now about changing a winning style because City lost, and are still waiting for their first Champions League triumph.\n\nBut let\u2019s keep some perspective. City have come a long way, and this was their first Champions League final. It came in a season where they have played twice a week, every week, and have ended up with the Premier League title.\n\nLosing will hurt Pep and his players, as much as it will be an amazing experience for Chelsea. who thoroughly deserved their victory.\n\nBut this has still been a great season for City \u2013 one frustrating night does not change that.\n\n*Michael Brown was speaking to BBC Sport\u2019s Chris Bevan.",

          "title": "Champions League: Tuchel\u2019s Masterclass Leaves Guardiola in Despair",
          "text": "Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel was at pains to stress this Champions League final was about so much more than his tactical and personal battle with Manchester City\u2019s Pep Guardiola \u2013 and yet the story of this showpiece will have both cast as its central characters.\n\nTuchel, a loser with Paris St-Germain against Bayern Munich in last season\u2019s final, made no mistake with his second chance as he prepared and plotted to perfection to produce a finely tuned, intensely committed Chelsea side fully deserving the victory that saw them crowned champions of Europe for a second time.\n\nIn contrast, Guardiola chose to select a starting 11 he had never picked before in his time as City manager, gambling on an array of attacking talent to compensate for his decision not to use either of his outstanding midfield anchors Fernandinho or Rodri.\n\nIt was a move that left City riddled with confusion, lacking fluency and attacking threat \u2013 in other words it was a selection that deprived the Premier League champions, so outstanding this season, of some of the elements that make them so special.\n\nAs Tuchel celebrated with his family in front of joyous Chelsea fans gathered in Porto\u2019s Estadio Do Dragao, owner Roman Abramovich beamed from the stands at yet another example of how his club turns the game\u2019s normal rules upside down.\n\nIn Chelsea\u2019s world, out of instability comes success. Managerial dismissals bring trophies, as they have done so regularly.\n\nAs it has done with Tuchel winning the Champions League after replacing Frank Lampard in January, and as it did when Roberto Di Matteo replaced Andre Villas-Boas in 2012 and won this tournament for the first time.\n\nChelsea\u2019s fans had warmly embraced their German manager even before kick-off, huge cheers greeting his appearance for pre-match media duties.\n\nAnd in the closing stages Chelsea\u2019s followers responded with deafening noise when Tuchel turned to them and waved his arms demanding more noise to get his players over the line on this night of glory.\n\nChelsea had heroes everywhere, none more so than the magnificent N\u2019Golo Kante, who delivered the complete midfield performance, this game\u2019s great manipulator and controller.\n\nReece James has found himself dragged into the debate about England\u2019s right-back slot for the Euros and the potential exclusion of Liverpool\u2019s Trent Alexander-Arnold but he stated his case eloquently, snuffing out the threat of a struggling Raheem Sterling to such an extent that it was no surprise when Manchester City\u2019s forward was substituted.\n\nAnd in match winner Kai Havertz, Chelsea have an elegant, dangerous weapon who is now flourishing after a slow start to his Stamford Bridge career.\n\nMason Mount produced yet another mature masterclass that illustrated why he is a certain midfield starter for England in the forthcoming Euros.\n\nIt is Tuchel, however, who must take the greatest credit for restoring self-belief, confidence and organisation to Chelsea after Lampard\u2019s departure, especially by making the common sense moves of putting the combative, edgy Antonio Rudiger back into the heart of defence and putting Kante in the midfield position where he operates to such world-class game-changing effect.\n\nThe champagne-soaked Tuchel was wearing a smile that looked like it might have to be surgically removed as he celebrated and why not? He suffered the pain of defeat in last season\u2019s Champions League final. Here in Porto, he stood among the litter of blue and silver glitter as a winner, the mastermind of a triumph that writes his name in Chelsea history.\n\nWhat a contrast it was to the despair of Guardiola and Manchester City, who will leave Porto accompanied by bitter disappointment and regrets after a night in which they failed to produce the goods.\n\nGuardiola was hoping to write history of his own, putting his name alongside Liverpool\u2019s Bob Paisley, Carlo Ancelotti at AC Milan and Real Madrid, plus Real Madrid\u2019s Zinedine Zidane, by winning this tournament for a third time.\n\nHe last won it with Barcelona a decade ago and cut a despondent figure as he strolled past the giant silver trophy that remains tantalisingly out of reach for City despite all their spectacular domestic achievements.\n\nOne of Guardiola\u2019s great qualities as a manager is his determination to fashion the beautiful game accompanied by attacking football \u2013 but maybe the in-built instincts got the better of him when he chose a line-up that raised eyebrows as soon as the teamsheets landed.\n\nNo Rodri. No Fernandinho. No protection. Attack-minded players everywhere.\n\nChelsea seized on City\u2019s uncertainty.\n\nMount and Ben Chilwell overran City down the left and, to the naked eye, it appeared that even seasoned, experienced operators such as Kevin de Bruyne \u2013 whose final was cut short by a very heavy illegal hit from Rudiger that left him with a swollen eye \u2013 Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva, seemed uncertain of what their actual roles were.\n\nGuardiola\u2019s strategy was high risk and the outcome suggests it was fatally flawed. He cannot escape scrutiny on his own part in a desperate night for City.\n\nHe is one of the great coaches and managers who has shaped the way modern football is played, influenced so many other coaches, but this was a night when the old questions about over-thinking were asked again.\n\nIt is hard to criticise a manager who has won the Premier League for three of the last four seasons but he tried a line-up he had never used before in arguably the biggest game in City\u2019s history after a season of domestic domination.\n\nRodri and Fernandinho have figured in 60 out of 61 games for City this season, either individually or as a pair. Why change the strategy so radically and use this system in a match of such huge significance?\n\nGuardiola\u2019s plan failed and he will have to accept the criticism that will inevitably come his way.\n\nTuchel has now beaten Guardiola three times since he was appointed in January, in the FA Cup semi-final and in the Premier League at Etihad Stadium.\n\nThis was, by some margin, the sweetest victory of all. This is the victory that means Tuchel has already made an indelible mark at Chelsea despite only being at the club a matter of months.\n\nTuchel has reached The Holy Grail in quickfire time. For Guardiola and Manchester City, the wait goes on. The pain will be acute because they will know they are capable of so much better.\n\nChelsea are the champions of Europe \u2013 a statement that might have been ridiculed on the day Tuchel walked through the doors of Stamford Bridge not so long ago.",

          "text": "Israel was gripped by political drama on Sunday over the possibly imminent end of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s record run as the country\u2019s leader.\n\nAfter four inconclusive parliamentary elections in two years, a 28-day mandate for opposition leader Yair Lapid to form a new government runs out on Wednesday, and media reports said he was close to putting together a coalition that would end Netanyahu\u2019s 12-year stretch as prime minister.\n\nLapid\u2019s chances of success rest largely with far-right politician Naftali Bennett, a kingmaker whose Yamina party has six key seats in parliament.\n\nBennett, 49, was widely expected to announce, possibly as early as Sunday, whether he would team up with Lapid, who leads the Yesh Atid party.\n\nBut first, Bennett would have to rally his own party\u2019s legislators behind joining what Netanyahu\u2019s opponents have described as a government of \u201cchange\u201d comprising factions from the left, centre and right.\n\nStill short of a parliamentary majority after a March 23 election that ended in stalemate, such a diverse grouping could be fragile, and would require outside backing by Arab members of parliament whose political views differ sharply from Yamina\u2019s.\n\nBennett has maintained public silence in recent days, with Likud party chief Netanyahu fuelling speculation his own tenure was about to end in a tweet and video on Friday. \u201cReal Alert,\u201d he wrote, warning that a dangerous \u201cleft-wing\u201d administration was in the cards.\n\nYamina announced late on Saturday that Bennett would meet and update its legislators on Sunday, after reports he had agreed to a deal in which he would serve first as prime minister before handing over to centrist Lapid.\n\nA former defence minister, Bennett has reversed course before over ousting Netanyahu, 71, a right-wing leader in power consecutively since 2009 and now on trial on corruption charges that he denies.\n\nWith an agreement with Lapid widely reported to have been finalised just before fighting erupted on May 10 between Israel and Gaza militants, Bennett said during the hostilities he was abandoning efforts to form a coalition with the centre and left.\n\nBut a ceasefire is holding, a recent wave of street violence in Israel between Arabs and Jews has ebbed, and a Lapid-Bennett partnership could be back on course.\n\nIsraeli political commentators, however, were taking nothing for granted.\n\n\u201cThe anti-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu government of change is still not an accomplished fact,\u201d political columnist Yossi Verter wrote in the left-wing Haaretz newspaper on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s premature to pop open the champagne, and also too early to wear sackcloth,\u201d he said, questioning whether Yamina\u2019s lawmakers could withstand pressure from the right against a deal with Lapid.\n\nIf Lapid, 57, fails to announce a government by Wednesday, a fifth Israeli election since April 2019 \u2013 a prospect Bennett has said he wants to avoid \u2013 is likely.",

Belarusian authorities sent a fighter jet to escort the plane down, before arresting journalist Roman Protasevich and his partner Sofia Sapega, a Russian citizen.\n\nBoth are in jail accused of orchestrating mass riots.

          "text": "Colonel Assimi Goita, Mali\u2019s coup leader and newly appointed interim president, has been summoned to an emergency meeting of West African leaders in Ghana.\n\nAt Sunday\u2019s extraordinary summit, the 15-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is set to discuss how to deal with Mali\u2019s second coup in nine months.\n\nGoita left Bamako for Ghana\u2019s capital, Accra, on Saturday after receiving an ECOWAS letter asking for \u201cconsultations\u201d, according to the AFP news agency.\n\nThe office of Mali\u2019s president, in a statement on Facebook, said Goita would take part in the extraordinary summit \u201calongside his counterparts\u201d and would also hold bilateral talks with regional leaders.\n\nThe summit is set to begin at 2pm (14:00 GMT) on Sunday.\n\nECOWAS \u2013 which acted as a mediator last August when Goita and others toppled Mali\u2019s democratically elected president Ibrahim Boubacar Keita \u2013 has warned it may reimpose sanctions after the colonel\u2019s latest power grab.\n\nThe bloc fears the takeover could exacerbate instability in northern and central Mali and undermine a regional fight against armed groups linked to al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS).\n\nECOWAS, the United States and France have all warned of new sanctions.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, during a visit to Rwanda and South Africa, said on Saturday that he told West African leaders they could not back a country \u201cwhere there is no longer democratic legitimacy or transition\u201d.\n\nThe turmoil in Mali began last week when Goita ordered the arrest of President Bah Ndaw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane following a dispute over a cabinet reshuffle that left out two members of the military.\n\nGoita was serving as the vice president at the time.\n\nNdaw and Ouane resigned while in detention on Wednesday and were later released.\n\nThen the constitutional court \u2013 contravening a joint declaration issued following talks in the wake of last August\u2019s coup \u2013 named Goita as Mali\u2019s new transitional president. The declaration, reached between ECOWAS and Mali\u2019s civil and military leaders, said the vice president of the transition \u201ccannot under any circumstances replace the president\u201d.\n\nWith the military going back on its previous commitment to civilian political leaders, doubts have been raised about its other pledges, including holding elections in early 2020.\n\nThe military said this week it would continue to respect that timetable, but added that it could be subject to change.",
