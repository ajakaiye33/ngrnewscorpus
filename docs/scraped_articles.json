          "title": "Illegal mining: Senate summons minister over revenue losses",
          "text": "The Senate on Friday summoned the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite, over activities of illegal miners which was leading to a great loss of the nation\u2019s revenue.\n\nThe joint Senate committees working on the 2022-2024 Medium-Term Expenditure and Fiscal Strategy Paper took the decision following the failure of the Director-General of the Nigeria Mining Cadastre Office, Obadiah Nkom, to furnish the committees with required explanations on the low revenues being generated in the sector and the menace of illegal miners across the country.\n\nNkom had in his submissions before the joint committees said in 2019, N2.58bn revenue was generated and remitted to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.\n\nHe said the amount reduced to N2.3bn in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic but that it had already started increasing in 2021 with N3.166bn realised as of July this year out of the targeted N4bn.\n\nObviously not satisfied with his submission, the Chairman of the joint committees, Senator Olamilekan Adeola, and other members, wondered why the agency could not generate revenue beyond the threshold of N4bn to N5bn.\n\nAdeola said, \u201cThe revenue generation is low and not impressive at all because big companies like Dangote Cement, BUA and others, with combined yearly profits of about N5trn, are under your purview.\n\n\u201cThese are apart from other companies carrying out illegal mining activities across the country that are not captured in your revenue generation.\n\n\u201cA lot of Chinese are involved in illegal mining in the country without your agency or any other one saddled with regulation of the sector, doing anything as far as licensing them and monitoring their explorations in form of collection of royalties are concerned.\u201d\n\nThe Director General, in his response, however, said the mandate of his office was just for licensing of firms and not collection of royalties or monitoring of illegal miners or mining.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur revenue is strictly generated from licensing and annual service fees collected from firms. Royalties and illegal mining are not under my purview and I cannot dabble into them.\u201d\n\nThe committee chairman then ordered the Clerk of the committee to summon the Minister of Mines and Steel Development for required interface on way out of the problem in the sector, particularly as regards illegal mining and low revenue generation.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe minister will have to appear before this committee for required interface on the way out of the problem in the sector.\n\n\u201cAs for the Mining Cadastre Office, N15bn is now fixed as targeted revenue generation for year 2022, because you have the capacity of meeting up with that as against N4bn of N5bn you are proposing.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission says it arrested 402 suspected Internet fraudsters in Lekki, Lagos, between April and June 2021.\n\nIt explained that 64 per cent of the suspects benefitted from dating scams to the tune of N8, 310,000; $349,290; \u00a3 900; \u20ac10 and Cryptocurrency 0.17513.\n\nThis was contained in a statement on Friday by the EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, titled, \u2018Lekki, now a hotbed of cybercrime \u2013 EFCC.\u2019\n\nIt stated, \u201cBetween April and June 2021, the Advance Fee Fraud and Cyber Crime Sections of the Lagos Command recorded a total of 402 internet-related fraud arrests.\n\n\u201cWhile the Advance Fee Fraud Section was responsible for 243 arrests, the Cybercrime Section executed 18 sting operations which resulted in 159 arrests, from which 13 convictions have so far been recorded.\n\n\u201cOf the 159 suspects arrested by the Cybercrime Section, 70 are from Lekki, comprising communities such as Ajah, Badore, Victoria Garden City, Sangotedo and Oniru.\u201d\n\nStressing that Lekki, the fast-developing upper middle-class area of the Lagos metropolis, is emerging as the new hub of Internet scammers, the commission said Ajah accounted for 24 suspects, while Oniru and Sangotedo had 14 and 13 suspects, respectively.\n\nIt added that Badore had eight suspects while the neighbouring Ikoyi and Eko Atlantic had two and one suspects each.\n\nIkorodu and Alagbado on the Lagos Mainland make up the remainder.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe suspects are mostly millennials, with 82 of them aged between 25-34 years, which speaks to the fact that most of the individuals arrested are either still in school, recent graduates or university dropouts.\n\n\u201cAnalysis of the data from the Cybercrime Section further shows that the dominant form of Internet crime is dating scam/online dating scam/romance scam. Sixty-four per cent of individuals arrested are involved in romance scams, followed closely by \u2018MiddleMan Scam\u2019 and \u2018Picking,\u2019 which account for eight and seven per cent, respectively, of those arrested.\n\n\u201cThe 64 per cent involved in the dating scam benefitted to the tune of N8, 310,000; $349,290; \u00a3 900; \u20ac10 and Cryptocurrency 0.17513.\u201d\n\nOther types of fraud identified include forgery, possession of fraudulent documents, spamming, credit card fraud, impersonation, rental scam, loan fraud, Business Email Compromise, hacking, stealing, cheque scam, phishing, and money laundering.\n\nThe data also reveals gift cards, at 39 per cent, as the prevalent method employed by the suspects to access their illicit funds, followed by bank transfers at 27 per cent and Cryptocurrency at 21 per cent.\n\n\u201cA total of $12,512.49 was recovered from the e-wallet accounts of four suspects within the period,\u201d Uwujaren said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment\n\nBy Victor Ahiuma-Young & Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nThe Federal Government has said it did everything possible to stop the ongoing nationwide strike by members the National Association of Resident Doctors, NARD, which has paralysed activities in government-owned hospitals across the country, saying it has spent over N203.3 billion on the striking doctors\u2019 welfare\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, stated this while addressing the Nigerian Health Commissioners Forum quarterly meeting in Abuja.\n\nA statement by the Deputy Director Press and Public Relations, Ministry of Labour and Employment, Charles Akpan, quoted the minister as recalling that the doctors were sleeping on their rights until COVID-19 pandemic broke out last year and the Federal Government felt that the N5,000 hazard allowance paid to them since 1991 was too paltry.\n\nHe noted that the Federal Government paid the doctors and other health workers bumper money as special COVID hazard allowance for three months in the first instance, to the tune of N32 billion, while states were told to pay as much as they could afford.\n\nThe Minister narrated to the Health Commissioners the trajectory of the current strike, saying \u201cIn September 2020, they put a notice of strike, asking for Medical Residency Training Fund, MRTF, by which each of them will get N542,000 to cover cost of books and journals for that particular examination, transportation and lodging for three days.\n\n\u201cLuckily, a supplementary budget was being put together and it was included and was paid to them. They called off the strike.\n\n\u201cBy March this year, they listed other things again. They said the Residency Training Fund is not in 2021 budget.\n\n\u201cThey also needed the hazard allowance to be upgraded and demanded that states should domesticate Residency Training Act.\n\n\u201cThey said some states owed their people long months of salaries. They also wanted skipping allowance and arrears of consequential adjustment to minimum wage.\n\n\u2018We thought it was April fool\u2019\n\n\u201cBefore we could say Jack Robinson, they went on strike on April 1. I thought it was April fool until April 2 when we didn\u2019t see them at work.\n\n\u201cI told them that they didn\u2019t give the mandatory 21 days notice to their employers who have written to me to complain.\n\n\u201cHowever, we returned to the table. Government pledged that the 2021 Residency Training Fund will be captured in the supplementary budget. This has been done and payment ready.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Govenment also approved N11.3 billion for Group Life Insurance in 2020 and renewed in 2021.\n\n\u201cGovernment also held a series of conjoint NMA-JOHESU meeting on hazard allowance until the two disagreed and now asked for separate negotiations.\n\n\u201cThey are the ones delaying action on this. Every other issues bordering on what the states have failed to do with doctors is where our hands are tied, but Federal Government agreed to speak to the Governor\u2019s Forum.\n\n\u201cThe arrears of consequential adjustment to the minimum wage cuts across sectors.\n\n\u201cAnyway, N160 billion earmarked for it has been exhausted and the next thing to do is to push for more.\n\n\u201cBut really, some hospitals have gotten. We also abolished bench fees for Residency Training for those doing specialty. At this, the doctors left the negotiation happy.\u201d\n\nThey asked for more\u2026\n\nNgige said they returned again on July 22, complaining about things that were undone and the government updated them on the efforts being made to address their demands.\n\n\u201cWe told them that the Residency Training Fund is in the supplementary budget signed into law.\n\n\u201cSo, we will now approach the World Bank to lend to CBN and from there, we will obtain the Naira component and it will be paid.\n\n\u201cThey said one hospital, LUTH, charged their member bench fee. We inquired and the CMD LUTH said the person came before the circular was issued.\n\n\u201cSo, the person will be refunded. They said 114 house officers have not been paid out of 3000. The registrar of MDCN said it looks like their particulars were wrong or they did not validate because they are expected to validate on the 15th of every month.\n\n\u201cThey were satisfied. They left only for us to hear that after their NEC in Benin, they went on strike and said it will not be called off until they get alert.\n\n\u201cThey equally said they were removed from the scheme of service. The Head of Service of the Federation now explained to them that career progression should not be for a temporary person.\n\n\u201cThe House officer has a provisional license. An NYSC doctor is on national service. However, we agreed that we should do an addendum circular to explain that they should not be in scheme of service.\n\nLagos influence\n\n\u201cThey said Lagos has started implementing and paying them allowance of N15, 000 as call duty for NYSC.\n\n\u201cI told them that it is wrong if Lagos was doing that because their wage structure is still the same. The Head of Service of the Federation, called Head of service Lagos and she explained, there was nothing like that.\n\n\u201cLagos wrote and we showed it to them but they said the circular must be withdrawn. Government doesn\u2019t function that way.\n\n\u201cIf it will be withdrawn it will go to Council on Establishment. If you cannot wait, we do you an addendum circular on the remuneration. The other money is being processed but you have to call off the strike.\n\n\u201cThey said they will not call off till they get alert. So, by law, we sent them to industrial court. Section 17 of the Trade Dispute Act says if conciliation fails, you transmit to court. They got to court. The court ordered them to return to work while issues are discussed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court said employees cease hostilities with your employer and employer cease hostilities against your employee.\n\n\u201cThey said senior lawyer told them that cessation of hostilities doesn\u2019t mean that they should call off the strike. The court adjourned till September 15.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Nwafor Sunday\n\n\u2026EFCC arrests 402 suspects in three months\n\nAs the case of a suspected internet scamster, Raymond Abbas, aka Hushpuppi, lingers, a United States district judge, William M Ray II, Thursday sentenced Bamidele Muraina, a 34-year-old Nigerian hacker to five years and ten months in prison.\n\nMuraina was sentenced for hacking into multiple tax preparation and accounting firms located in several states, including a Brunswick, Georgia-based accounting firm, between January 29, 2018, and April 2020.\n\nHowever, Muraina fraudulently claimed unemployment insurance benefits worth $2.6 million.\n\nIn a statement issued by the United States department of justice, northern district of Georgia, obtained by Vanguard, Muraina was convicted alongside a 33-year-old Gabriel Kalembo.\n\nRead the statement below:\n\nNigerian hacker and a repeat offender sentenced to federal prison for unemployment fraud and tax fraud scheme\n\n\u201cBamidele Muraina, a Nigerian national who hacked into tax preparation firms and filed fraudulent unemployment benefit claims and tax returns using stolen personally identifiable information, and Gabriel Kalembo, a previously convicted fraudster who laundered the fraudulent assets, have been sentenced to federal prison.\n\n\u201cThese defendants stole funds from programs meant to assist American workers and families seeking to make ends meet during the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Kurt R. Erskine. \u201cThe collaborative efforts of our law enforcement partners were essential to disrupting a sophisticated network of criminals and bringing their leaders to justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect on us all. The enterprise created by these serial criminals further victimized our citizenry by robbing them of financial resources that were intended to help them,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Steven Baisel, U.S. Secret Service Atlanta Field Office. \u201cThanks to our judicial system, justice has been served.\u201d\n\n\u201cBamidele Muraina engaged in a conspiracy to defraud the Employment Security Department of Washington State (\u201cESD-WA\u201d) by filing dozens of fraudulent unemployment insurance (UI) claims in the names of identity theft victims who were not entitled to such benefits. As part of the same conspiracy, Gabriel Kalembo and his conspirators laundered the unlawfully obtained UI benefits from ESD-WA by purchasing and then later negotiating hundreds of money orders. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners and state workforce agencies to protect the integrity of unemployment insurance benefit programs,\u201d said Rafiq Ahmad, Special Agent in Charge, Atlanta Region, U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General.\n\n\u201cThe sentencing of the defendants should serve as a deterrent to all who intend to exploit the COVID-relief programs that were designated to assist those in need during the pandemic,\u201d said Tommy D. Coke, Inspector in Charge of the Atlanta Division of the United States Postal Inspection Service. \u201cPostal Inspectors will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to investigate anyone that steals federal funds to enrich themselves and have them held accountable under the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conspirators not only stole from the government but also victimized individuals and private businesses in this case,\u201d said IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge James E. Dorsey. \u201cRecovering from ID theft often costs time, money, and stress for all parties involved. Thanks to successful partnerships with our agency counterparts and leveraging our financial expertise to serve and protect our communities from further harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese criminals shamelessly stole people\u2019s hard-earned tax returns and money meant to help families during the pandemic, but thankfully they were exposed and are now facing justice,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Katrina W. Berger, who oversees Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) operations in Georgia and Alabama. \u201cHSI and its law enforcement partners will continue to aggressively pursue those that seek to profit from these activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to Acting U.S. Attorney Erskine, the charges and other information presented in court: Bamidele Muraina was a Nigerian national residing in the metro Atlanta area at the time of his offenses. Between at least January 29, 2018 and continuing through approximately April 2020, Muraina hacked into multiple tax preparation and accounting firms located in several states, including a Brunswick, Georgia-based accounting firm. Muraina obtained access to the firms\u2019 accounts with a national tax preparation program, stole personally identifiable information from their clients, and filed more than 275 fraudulent individual income tax returns in their names via the Internet. In total, Muraina\u2019s fraudulent tax returns using stolen identities sought refunds from the IRS exceeding $2.6 million from 2018 through 2020.\n\n\u201cBetween May 9, 2020 and May 16, 2020, Muraina used stolen personally identifiable information from Washington residents to submit false claims for unemployment insurance benefits in Washington. Muraina\u2019s false claims exploited a federal COVID-19 pandemic relief program created by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which expanded eligibility for unemployment benefits and provided an additional unemployment benefit of $600 per week. Based on Muraina\u2019s fraudulent claims submitted in the names of approximately fifty Washington residents over a one-week span, the State of Washington issued more than $280,000 in unemployment benefits.\n\n\u201cMuraina directed fraudulent funds from his unemployment benefits scheme and tax fraud scheme to be deposited into bank accounts set up by co-conspirators, including Gabriel Kalembo, who was convicted in 2017 of conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud in the Northern District of Georgia. Kalembo recruited Zambian nationals to travel to the United States on tourist visas to incorporate sham corporations in Georgia and open business bank accounts in the names of those corporations. After the fraudulent funds were deposited into those accounts, Kalembo laundered the funds by cashing money orders purchased with debit cards linked to the accounts.\n\n\u201cBamidele Muraina, 35, of Oyo, Nigeria was sentenced by U.S. District Judge William M. Ray II to five years and ten months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release, and he ordered Muraina to pay $561,125.62 in restitution.\n\n\u201cGabriel Kalembo, 33, of Atlanta, Georgia was sentenced by Judge Ray to four years and two months in prison to be followed by two years of supervised release, and he ordered Kalembo to pay $298,008.71 in restitution.\n\n\u201cThis case was investigated by the U.S. Secret Service, the Department of Labor Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security-Homeland Security Investigations, and the United States Postal Inspection Service.\n\n\u201cAssistant U.S. Attorneys Nathan P. Kitchens, Chief of the Public Integrity and Special Matters Section, Sarah E. Klapman, and Lauren T. Macon are prosecuting the case.\n\n\u201cAnyone with information about allegations of attempted fraud involving COVID-19 can report it by calling the Department of Justice\u2019s National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) Hotline at 866-720-5721 or via the NCDF Web Complaint Form at: https://www.justice.gov/disaster-fraud/ncdf-disaster-complaint-form.\u201d\n\nEFCC arrests 402 suspects in three months\n\nLekki, the fast-developing upper middle class area of Lagos Metropolis, is emerging as the new hub of internet-related fraud. Data from the investigation activities of the Lagos Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, for the second quarter of 2021, indicates that Lekki District is the preferred location for all manner of cyber fraud syndicates.\n\nBetween April and June, 2021, the Advance Fee Fraud and Cyber Crime Sections of the Command recorded a total of 402 internet-related fraud arrests. While the Advance Fee Fraud Section was responsible for 243 arrests, the Cyber Crime Section executed 18 sting operations which resulted in 159 arrests, from which 13 convictions have so far been recorded.\n\nOf the 159 suspects arrested by the Cyber Crime Section, 70 are from Lekki, comprising communities such as Ajah, Badore, Victoria Garden City, Sangotedo and Oniru.\n\nAjah accounted for 24 suspects, while Oniru and Sangotedo had 14 and 13 suspects respectively. Badore had 8 suspects. Neighbouring Ikoyi and Eko Atlantic had 2 and one suspect each. Ikorodu and Alagbado on the Lagos Mainland make up the remainder.\n\nThe suspects are mostly millennials, with 82 of them aged between 25-34 years, which speaks to the fact that most of the individuals arrested are either still in school, recent graduates or university drop outs.\n\nAnalysis of the data from the Cyber Crime Section further shows that the dominant form of internet crime is Dating Scam/Online Dating Scam/Romance Scam. Sixty Four percent (64%) of individuals arrested are involved in romance scam, followed closely by \u201cMiddle Man Scam\u201d and \u201cPicking\u201d which account for 8% and 7% respectively of those arrested.\n\nThe 64% involved in the dating scam benefitted to the tune of N8, 310,000; $349,290 USD; \u00a3 900; \u20ac10 and Cryptocurrency 0.17513.\n\nOther typologies of fraud identified include forgery, possession of fraudulent documents, spamming, credit card fraud, impersonation, rental scam, loan fraud, Business Email Compromise, Hacking, stealing, cheque scam, phishing, and money laundering.\n\nThe data also reveals gift cards, at 39%, as the prevalent method employed by the suspects to access their illicit funds. It is followed by bank transfers at 27% and Cryptocurrency at 21%.\n\nA total of $12, 512.49USD was recovered from the e-wallet accounts of four suspects within the period.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Though no reason was adduced.\n\nAt a press briefing in Abuja on Friday, Gololo, a former National Coordinator of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), said the removal of the Ministers under President Buhari was a welcome development and \u201clong overdue\u201d.\n\nHe, however, said the President should not have replaced them with other serving Ministers who were also supposed to be shown the exit doors, for \u201clack of performance\u201d.\n\nWhy Nigeria must not hand Abba Kyari over to FBI- Dr. Gololo\n\nGololo stressed that, either the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, the National Security Adviser (NSA), Gen. Babagana Mungono (Rtd.) and all the Ministers had nothing to contribute to this government.\n\n\u201cI have said this before and I\u2019m still emphasising it, all the ministers should be shown the way out.

He tells me the road to ply in Lagos so that I can bypass hold up, most of you here know how terrible Lagos traffic is. Fortunately for me, I don\u2019t experience it because God knows a better route.\n\n\u201cHowever, something happened that made him stop communicating with me. I used to be an interpreter to the general overseer or general superintendent like we call it those days. My father in the Lord then just took a special interest in my interpretation. When other pastors in the church then realised that the general overseer liked my interpretation, they stopped calling me to interpret for them and left me alone for the general overseer.\n\n\u201cI became full of myself and started bouncing around as interpreter to the general overseer but an incident happened one day. We had a program and we invited a guest minister to preach. He made a mistake that day, you may be surprised at my definition of a mistake. The mistake was that he asked me to interpret for himself. I was really angry in my spirit but I couldn\u2019t object because it was too late.\n\n\u201cI stood up and interpreted for him but in my heart, I was murmuring, I said \u2018How could you call me a whole interpreter to the general overseer to interpret for you\u2019. Only if he knew what was in my mind, he would have called another person to interpret that very day.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the programme, I was on my way home and God spoke, he said \u2018Son, you are now too big to interpret to a man of God other than the general overseer?\u201d. After the conversation, God stopped speaking to me, I didn\u2019t hear His voice again.\n\n\u201cI suffered, that whole period was like hell, I became a victim of the traffic in Lagos.\u201d",

          "text": "Momentum swings in favour of Nigerian business mogul Valentine Ozigbo as the Court of Appeal Awka Division sitting in Abuja in its judgement delivered today, Friday, September 3, 2021 declared him the authentic governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the November election holding in Anambra State.\n\nOn July 5, 2021, Senator Ugochukwu Uba, who did not participate in the PDP primary, instituted a suit against the party and its candidate, Valentine Ozigbo and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), challenging Ozigbo\u2019s candidature for the November 6, 2021 governorship election.\n\nIn its ruling, the Court of Appeal recognised the gubernatorial primary conducted by the National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP on June 26, 2021 at the Prof. Dora Akunyili Women\u2019s Development Centre as lawful and was visibly upset with the 1st respondent and his lawyers for forum shopping.\n\nThe panel of Justices presided by Honourable Justice Dongban Mensa, also ordered the national electoral body, INEC, to immediately publish Valentine Ozigbo as the candidate of the PDP, the main opposition party on its website.\n\nThe court awarded a cost of ten million against the Senator Ugochukwu Ubah for being a meddlesome interloper.\n\nThis ruling paves the way for the PDP to launch its promised \u201crobust campaign\u201d for the governorship of the south-eastern state.\n\nMr Alex Ejesieme, SAN, the lead Counsel to Mr Valentine Ozigbo, had argued in the appeal that the judgement of the Awka High Court delivered by Justice Nwabunike was faulty because it was based on a judgement by a Federal Capital Territory High Court which the Court of Appeal had voided.\n\nRecall that barely 24 hours after Senator Uba instituted the suit, Justice O.

          "text": "From Agaju Madugba, Katsina\n\nKatsina Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has claimed the Nigerian Police lack adequate number of personnel to effectively police the area with a population of about eight million people.\n\nMasari spoke when he received the Inspector-General of Police, Alkali Usman Baba, at the Government House, yesterday.\n\nMasari said the policemen in the were not enough to arrest the the security situation in the state.\n\n\u201cKatsina State has a population of about eight million people and how many policemen do we have in Katsina State?\n\n\u201cFrom my assessment of policemen in the local government areas, I don\u2019t think we have up to 3,000 policemen in the entire state. Let us assume that they are up to 3,000, what it means is that we have a policemen to every 200,000 people. How effective can that policeman be? Then, we come to arms and ammunition, what do the police have? And when it comes to modern equipment for combating criminality, how much of it do the police have?\n\n\u201cAnd the same thing goes for all other security agencies. They are in South-South battling militants, they are in the South-East battling IPOB, they are in North-East battling Boko Haram and ISWAP and insurgents and they are in the North-West battling bandits.\n\n\u201cHere, the bandits have infiltrated the communities recruiting young men with as low as N5,000 along with drugs and other intoxicants. We must stop the culture of not reporting criminals because of tribal or family affiliations.\u201d\n\nHe pledged to recruit more vigilantes to strengthen security architecture in the state.\n\nHe stated that the vigilantes would be recruited in all the 34 local government areas of the state.\n\nThe governor said the recruits would be supported financially and logistically.\n\nThe governor also said the vigilantes would be posted to strategic places to help the police and other security agencies with relevant information on security.\n\n\u201cIf they detect any crime or criminalities, they will alert the security in arresting the situation. These initiative will assist in protecting communities from bandits,\u201d he said.\n\nThe IGP said they were in the process of recruiting additional 20,000 policemen from across the country.\n\n\u201cI am in Katsina on a working visit and I will also meet with other arms of security services to see how best to tackle the security situation in the states.\n\n\u201cI came in as IGP at a very difficult time. When I came in, it was in the South-East and South-South that there were series of killings including killing of security personnel and our places of work destroyed.\n\n\u201cWhile the South-South and South-East are stabilising, the situation in the North-Central and the North-West is getting worse.\n\n\u201cWe are going to work harder to see that citizens go about their lawful businesses unmolested. Very soon, we will start our recruitment process. With security policing and the fresh recruitment, we hope that the strength of the Nigerian police will be re-enforced.\n\n\u201cWe will recruit from every local government in the country. It is the directive of the President that we should recruit 10,000 for 2020 and anther 10,000 for 2021. From across all the 771 local government areas. We are going to redeploy these policemen to their local government areas to fight crime,\u201d he said.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

The world is gravitating towards that direction. I can confirm to you that by the time western countries are done vaccinating its people, unvaccinated persons won\u2019t be allowed access into any of the western countries without the vaccine certificate. So, it\u2019s better we begin to prepare our people at home.\u201d\n\nHe, thus, registered his concern that Nigeria has been experiencing an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases lately, but assured Nigerians that the response team are working assiduously with reinvigorated approach to contain the community transmission, thus soliciting for more support from Nigerians.\n\nMinister of State for Health, Olorunnimbe Mamora, said the Federal Government was working towards increasing domestic resources for the health sector by pooling \u2018sin\u2019 taxes on tobacco and other products.\n\nHe said doing so was important because funding has been the major challenge of the health sector, adding, \u201cwe need to begin to tax commodities like alcohol, and cigarettes, among others which causes a lot of damage to the human body.\n\n\u201cThat is why we are saying if people take these things, let us find a way to put some tax on it so that we can get some money to fund the health sector in addition to existing funding structures,\u201d Mamora said.\n\n\u2022 PFN faults plan\n\nHowever, the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), the umbrella body of over more than 65 million people in pentecostal churches in the country, has described as illogical, the move by the Federal Government to punish Nigerians, who have refused to be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nIts President, Bishop Wale Oke, who is also the presiding bishop of the Sword of the Spirit Ministries, Ibadan, made the disclosure at the on-going 39th annual holy ghost convention of the ministry with the theme, \u2018Abundant Rain\u2019, holding at the campus of Precious Cornerstone University, Garden of Victory, Ibadan, Oyo State\n\nHe also cautioned government against molesting or punishing Navy Commodore Kunle Olawunmi (retd), for alleging a cover up by the government of some high profile politicians behind the raging insurgency and banditry in the country.\n\nOke urged President Muhammadu Buhari and his administration to be rational in their approach as regards punishing Nigerians who refused to take the COVID-19 vaccines, adding that the available vaccines could not even go round all the people in the country.\n\n\u201cOne doubts if Nigeria can yet boast of having 10 million vaccines available for a country with over 200million population. If the Federal Government makes available about 250 million vaccines and Nigerians, who are yet to be vaccinated refused the COVID-19 vaccines, then the government can be justified in its action. Unless this be the case, one will be forced to view the whole thing as another subtle move to deliberately punish some sections of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

He said between 2001 and 2019, the Federal Government, approved and released the total sum of N7trillion to the NDDC as income from statutory and non statutory sources.\n\nHe said the the Federal Government was particularly concerned with the colossal loss occasioned by uncompleted and unverified development projects in the Niger Delta Region, in spite of the huge resources made available to it to uplift the living standard of the citizens of the region.\n\nHe also expressed concerns with multitudes of NDDC\u2019s bank accounts amounting to 362 and lack of proper reconciliation of accounts.\n\nBuhari, represented at the presentation ceremony by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), directed that the forensic audit report be forwarded to the Federal Ministry of Justice for legal review and relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to do justice to the findings.\n\n\u201cWe have on record over 13,777 projects, the execution of which is substantially compromised. The Federal Government will in consequence apply the law to remedy the deficiencies outlined in the audit report as appropriate. This will include, but not limited to, initiation of criminal investigations, prosecution, recovery of funds not properly utilised for the public purposes for which they were meant for review of the laws to reposition and restructure the NDDC for the efficiency of better service delivery amongst others. In all these instances of actions, legal due processes will strictly be complied with.\u201d\n\nMinister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, who submitted the report, said though the exercise had a checkered history, the President and all those who supported and ensured its success should be commended.\n\nHe said the audit was not done to witch-hunt anyone, but to ensure that huge sums of funds committed to the development of the region through the NDDC yearly were judiciously used.\n\nHe said the report of the audit committee showed that their were over 13,000 abandoned projects in the Niger Delta, adding that even before the submission of the report, some contractors returned to site on their own and completed about 77 road projects.\n\nHe lamented that the region had remained backwards since 1958 in spite of successive governments efforts through the creation of various interventionist programmes and projects.\n\nLead Forensic Auditor, Alhaji Kabir Ahmed, in a brief overview of the report, said the team recommended managerial and structural changes, chief of which is the downsizing of NDDC board, with members appointed on part time basis.\n\nThe appointment of members of the board of the NDDC had been suspended until the release of the audit report. Ahmed also disclosed that oil companies in the country were still in default of their contributions to the commission.\n\nIt recommended that the government withdraw the licence of any oil company which defaults for a period of three years. It also recommended the deduction of 15 per cent ecological fund at source and paid to the commission as both the federal and state governments have failed to make payments to the commission. The team recommended as a measure of effective revenue collections, that the Federal Inland Revenue Services collects fund on behalf of NDDC from oil companies in the country.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "*Shows evidence of substantial compromise in execution of 13,777 projects\n\n*Criminal investigations, prosecution to follow\n\nNseobong Okon-Ekong in Lagos and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has vowed that the federal government will take necessary measures to recover the over N6 trillion allegedly misappropriated in the running of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) between 2000 and 2019.\n\nTo this end, the president has directed that the report of the forensic audit on the NDDC be forwarded to the Federal Ministry of Justice for necessary action.\n\nThe president who spoke shortly after he received the Forensic Audit Report from the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, claimed that there had been evidence of substantial compromise in the execution of 13,777 as well as the existence of, \u201cmultitude of NDDC\u2019s bank accounts amounting to 362\u201d which lacked proper reconciliation of accounts.\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr Abubakar Malami, who received the report on behalf of the president, therefore assured that the report would be critically analysed for necessary action and implementation.\n\nBuhari had in October 2019, ordered a holistic forensic audit on the activities of the NDDC from when it was established till August 2019, in response to the yearnings of the people to make the commission more effective and result oriented.\n\nAccording to the president, there was nothing tangible on ground to show in the region for the huge funds committed over the years through the Commission, which many had described as a conduit pipe for politicians in siphoning trillions of naira.\n\nThe president noted that his administration was however concerned about the colossal loss occasioned by uncompleted and unverified development projects in the region, in spite of the huge resources made available to uplift the living standard of the citizens, hence the forensic audit of the Commission.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is on record that between 2001 and 2019, the federal government has approved N3, 375, 735,776,794.93 as budgetary allocation and N2,420,948,894,191 as Income from Statutory and Non Statutory Sources, which brings the total figure to the sum of approximately N6 trillion given to the NDDC.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that considerable resources have been channeled by the federal government to the development of the Niger Delta from 2001 to 2019. It is therefore important for the federal government and the public to be properly informed of what has been spent and how that has been spent.\n\n\u201cThe essence of the forensic audit is to ensure probity and accountability in the use of public funds. It is against this background that the federal government will without hesitation strategically implement all aspects of the audit exercise that will promote probity and greater prosperity for the Niger Delta Region and Nigeria as whole,\u201d he added.\n\nSpecifically, Buhari disclosed that his administration would apply the law to remedy the deficiencies outlined in the audit report as appropriate.\n\n\u201cThis will include but not limited to initiation of criminal investigations, prosecution, recovery of funds not properly utilised for the public purposes for which they were meant for review of the laws to reposition and restructure the NDDC for the efficiency of better service delivery amongst others. In all these instances of actions, legal due processes will strictly be complied with,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, while submitting the report stated that the exercise was not done to witch-hunt anyone, but to ensure that the huge sums of funds committed to the area yearly are justified.\n\nHe lamented that the region had remained backwards since 1958 in spite of successive governments\u2019 efforts through the creation of various interventionist programmes and projects.\n\nAccording to him, the report of the audit committee showed that their were over 13,000 abandoned projects in the Niger Delta, adding that even before the submission of the report some contractors have returned to site on their own and completed about 77 road projects. According to Akpabio, the name and identity of a vast number of beneficiary companies were also captured in the report.\n\n\u201cVia Field Verification, the Forensic Auditors established the exact status of all contracts for projects and programmes in all constituent states during the period under review classified into completed, ongoing, abandoned, terminated, taken-over and non-existent, \u201d he declared\n\nThe Minister disclosed that the auditors also focused on funding gaps, irregularities, mismanagement and due process violations/conflicts of interest.\n\nHe added: \u201cA Personnel Audit and Review of the governance and organisational structure of NDDC was also carried out. An operational guideline/manual and a fit-for-purpose organogram that would aid the transformation of NDDC to a globally competitive development agency has been developed as well.\n\n\u201cAvailable financial records of the commission were analysed with the aim of establishing the total amount of funds received by the Commission from all sources, both statutory and non-statutory and the total funds and other resources paid to contractors as well as the total amount outstanding as debts with regards to such projects within the period under reference.\n\n\u201cThe auditors have also provided policy recommendations, in terms of measures that should be taken to ensure the prevention of such irregularities and mismanagement, going forward.\u201d\n\nThe Lead Forensic Auditor, Alhaji Kabir Ahmed, in a brief overview of the report, said that the team recommended managerial as well as structural changes, chief of which was the downsizing of the NDDC\u2019s board.\n\nHe also said to reduce cost, the team recommended that members of the Board should henceforth be appointed on part time basis.\n\nWhile disclosing that oil companies in the country were still in default of their contributions to the Commission, Ahmed recommended that the government should withdraw the licence of any oil company that defaults for a period of three years.\n\nThe report also recommended the deduction of 50 per cent ecological fund at source, which should be paid to the Commission because both the federal and state governments had failed to make payments to the Commission.\n\nIn addition, the auditors recommended as a measure of effective revenue collections, the Federal Inland Revenue Services should collect funds on behalf of NDDC from oil companies in the country. The report further called on the government to recover from contractors and former and present staff of the NDDC, who have been indicted for short changing the NDDC.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says AfCFTA is indispensable if industrial development is to take off on the continent\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo yesterday estimated that the African cross-border informal trade is worth $93 billion.\n\nThis is just as the vice president begins a four-day official visit to Arusha, Tanzania today.\n\nOsinbajo, in a message sent to a roundtable on industrialisation in Africa with the theme: \u201cPositioning African Industries for Economic Transformation and Continental Free Trade,\u201d organised by the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) to celebrate its Golden Jubilee, stressed the need to rapidly operationalise effort by Afreximbank to establish a Pan-African Payments and Settlement Platform.\n\nThis, according to him, \u201cwill go a long way in creating the desired continental payments system and also in facilitating cross-border informal trade which is estimated to be about $93 billion per annum.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President, according to a statement by his spokesman, Laolu Akande, also declared that the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) offers limitless opportunities for the industrialisation of Africa, urging authorities to take the right actions to actualise them.\n\nHe stated that such actions include the protection of local industries and improving value chains.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cfor certain, the AfCFTA is indispensable if industrial development is to take off in Africa because it offers wider markets and economies of scale which are essential for manufacturing to be competitive.\n\n\u201cWe must take policy actions to create an environment in which businesses can thrive. To start with, we must adopt the right type of macroeconomic and industrial policies.\n\n\u201cIt is important for African governments to provide a stable macroeconomic environment which avoids and smoothens out volatility in prices, sharp deteriorations in the current account and budget deficits and of course, rapid accumulation in debt burdens.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on actions that would boost manufacturing, Osinbajo said, \u201con the industrial side, policies like tariffs, quotas, subsidies and non-tariff barriers which protect our infant industries so that they can create jobs and enable learning are vital.\u201d\n\nHe added that, \u201cwell negotiated rules of origin are important in the context of the free trade agreements as they are key to preventing trans-shipment and the deflection of trade. Without them, firms from non-state parties could set up simple labelling operations in one member-state with a view to shipping already finished products to another member State without really adding any value.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo observed that it is important for MAN to involve itself in an advisory capacity to government negotiators \u201cas we go further into the rules of origin negotiations (these rules negotiations have, of course, started), but I think as we go on, we should get more contributions and advise from MAN.\n\n\u201cOur manufacturers must also strive to become competitive after clearly specified time periods so that they can withstand the ever present danger of stiff competition from imports. In other words, while our manufacturing industries must be nurtured and supported, they cannot remain infants forever\u201d.\n\nStressing the need to enhance industrial competitiveness, Osinbajo noted that, \u201cone of the ways to increase the competitiveness of African industries is to develop and deepen regional value chains wherein production systems starting from conception and design right through to supply of raw materials, processing, transport, storage, marketing and sales take place within our countries and continent.\u201d\n\nCiting examples of Nigeria and South Africa, he explained, \u201cwhen we export commodities to the rest of the world, we are also exporting jobs and the positive spillover effects such as learning that come with manufacturing are lost.\n\n\u201cHappily, we are already beginning to see some green shoots emerging in this regard as Nigerian fertiliser blenders obtain phosphates from Morocco for blending with urea produced in our petrochemical plants. Similarly, South African car manufacturers already buy leather for car seats from Botswana. We however need much more of such activities.\n\nHe identified some other things that need to be put in place \u201cif we are to see the kind of manufacturing activity that we desire. First of all, we need to develop a strong infrastructural base. Extensive, cheap and affordable infrastructure is vital for the success of our economies.\n\n\u201cWe must build a network of roads, bridges and rail that will facilitate the movement of goods and people just as we build the electricity plants to power our factories and the broadband networks that lubricate modern business. It would also be essential in the interim to develop sites with dedicated infrastructural and regulatory structures like Special Economic Zones and Shared Facilities for small businesses.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo added that another major objective of policies aimed at preparing industries for AfCFTA \u201cmust be to ease payments across borders and implementation of the protocols on free movement of persons\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the Vice President is going on a brief official visit to Arusha in Tanzania from Thursday (today) to Monday.\n\nOsinbajo, who is expected to be received by his Tanzanian counterpart, Dr. Philip Mpango, will be visiting the African Court of Justice and Human Rights (ACJHR), an African Union agency in Arusha, among other engagements before he returns to Abuja on Monday.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Alleges bandits recruiting more members with as low as N5,000\n\n*IG hints at recruitment of 20,000 men across country\n\n*Police claim rescue of five abducted Zamfara students\n\n*As 900 more terrorists surrender to troops, says DHQ\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja, Francis Sardauna in Katsina and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto\n\nIn his relentless effort to keep Katsina State safe, Governor Aminu Bello Masari of the state, yesterday, identified as part of the problems, the facts that nation\u2019s security forces were not properly armed and largely overstretched as a result of other security concerns across the nation.\n\nThe governor, who lamented the growing insecurity in his state, despite being President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s home-base, alleged that the situation has become so bad that bandits and kidnappers have infiltrated communities in Katsina and recruiting new members with as low as N5,000 along with drugs and other intoxicants to launch onslaught against innocent citizens in the state.\n\nBut the Inspector General of Police, Alkali Usman Baba, has said the force was working with the Federal Ministry of Justice to esnure speedy prosecution of arrested bandits and kidnappers across the country in order to serve as deterrence to other criminals terrorising the nation, even as he hinted at plans by the police to recruit 20,000 more men across the 774 local government areas of Nigeria.\n\nAlso, the Zamfara State Police Command said it has rescued five (5) out of the 73 abducted students of the Government Day Secondary School, Kaya in Maradun Local Government Area of the state.\n\nIn the same vein, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ), yesterday, said 900 more terrorists surrendered to troops in the North Eastern part of the country, bringing the number of insurgents that have so far surrendered in the past three weeks to 5, 890.\n\nSpeaking while receiving the police IG, Baba, at the Government House, who was on a courtesy visit, Masari said security personnel were grossly inadequate to tackle the nefarious activities of the bandits and other criminals terrorising the state.\n\nHe explained that security personnel, particularly, the police were not enough to police Katsina with an estimated population of about eight million people, while the police haveonly 3,000 personnel in the state.\n\nIn addition, the governor claimed that the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) did not have modern equipment to combat criminality, especially, banditry across the frontline local government areas of the state.\n\nHis words: \u201cFrom my assessment of policemen in the local government areas, I don\u2019t think we have up to 3,000 policemen in the entire state. Let us assume that they are up to 3,000, what it means is that we have a policeman for every 200,000 people. How effective can that policeman be? Then, we come to arms and ammunition, what do the police have?\n\n\u201cAnd when it comes to modern equipment for combating criminality, how much of it do the police have? And the same thing goes for all other security agencies.\n\n\u201cThey are in South-south battling militants; they are in the Southeast battling IPOB; they are in North East battling Boko Haram and ISWAP and insurgents and they are in the North West battling bandits.\u201d\n\nHe, however, pointed out that, \u201cHere, the bandits have infiltrated the communities recruiting young men with as low as N5,000 along with drugs and other intoxicants. We must stop the culture of not reporting criminals, because of tribal or family affiliations.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Baba, who assured the governor of speedy prosecution of arrested bandits and kidnappers, said the Nigerian Police Force under his watch had commenced plans for the recruitment of additional 20,000 policemen across the 774 local government areas of the country.\n\n\u201cWe will recruit from every local government in the country. It is the directive of the President that we should recruit 10,000 for 2020 and another 10,000 for 2021 across all the 774 local government areas. We are going to redeploy these policemen to their local government areas to fight crime,\u201d said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI came in as IGP at a very difficult time. When I came in, it was in the South East and South-South that there were series of killings, including the killing of security personnel and our places of work destroyed.\n\n\u201cWhile the South-South and South East are stabilising, the situation in the North Central and the North West is getting worse. We are going to work harder to see that citizens go about their lawful businesses unmolested\u201d.\n\nHowever, in a statement by the Public Relations Officer, Zamfara Command, Superintendent Muhammad Shehu, the police said the ongoing search and rescue mission had started toyield positive result as Five (5) of the abducted female students were yesterday rescued.\n\nShehu noted that the victims were medically checked at the hospital, debriefed by the Police and had been reunited with their families.\n\nAccording to him, the Commissioner of Police, CP Ayuba N. Elkana, has assured the people that, the ongoing search and rescue effort would be sustained, so that the remaining abducted students would be rescued hale and hearty.\n\nMeanwhile, the Defence Headquarters, which disclosed that addition 900 more terrorists had surrendered to troops, said those that surrendered included Boko Haram commanders, fighters and their families.\n\nIt said 560 of them were handed over to Borno State government after \u201cthorough profiling\u201d even though 40 insurgents were killed while 20 others were arrested by troops.\n\nAlso, in a related development, troops of Operation Delta Safe have reportedly deactivated 33 illegal refining sites and 46 refining units in Imo, Akwa Ibom, Rivers and Delta States.\n\nAt a media briefing in Abuja, Director, Defence Media Operations (DDMO), Brigadier-General Bernard Onyeuko, said 900 more terrorists surrendered following intensified air interdiction and artillery bombardment of their enclaves by ground troops and the air force.\n\nHe said a total of 52 assorted arms and 1,977 rounds of 7.62mm assorted calibre ammunition including AK-47 and FN rifles with magazines, hand grenades, commando mortar guns, locally fabricated rifles, Dushka anti-aircraft guns, dane guns and Nigerian Police rifles among other items were recovered from them, while the operations held between August 12 and September 2, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe counter insurgency efforts of the troops through kinetic and non-kinetic operations compelled the terrorists to surrender in large numbers. Suffice to note that within the last few weeks, more than 5,890 terrorists comprising foot soldiers and their commanders have surrendered with their families to own troops in the North-east zone,\u201d he said.\n\nOnyeuko explained that a total of 565 Boko Haram terrorists comprising 12 commanders, their family members were handed over to the Borno State government in Maiduguri for further management after thorough profiling.\n\nSpeaking, also, on the Jos crisis, Onyeuko said troops of Operation Safe Haven had arrested 20 suspects allegedly involved in the attacks, which resulted in the killing of 26 travellers at Rukuba town in Jos North LGA of Plateau State.\n\nHe said the arrested persons had been handed over to the appropriate prosecuting agency for further necessary action, adding that the military had sustained its operations against armed bandits in the North-west within the period under review.\n\n\u201cTroops within the period arrested criminal informants/collaborators, whose activities have been causing setbacks for own troops\u2019 operations in the zone.\n\n\u201cA total of 15 armed bandits, two armed robbers were neutralised, 13 bandits informants arrested, 15 motorcycles were recovered, two AK 47 rifles recovered, 33 kidnap victims rescued, 66 criminal elements were arrested and some vandalised railway sleepers/tracks were recovered within the period in focus,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom the South-south, Operation Delta Safe claimed the raid on illegal refineries within the period of conducting series of anti-illegal oil operations, included such places as Opuoma and Mmahu communities in Ohaji-Egbema LGA of Imo State; Sand Community in Akwa Ibom State; Madangho Creek in Warri South West LGA, Ndoro and Beneside Communities in Burutu LGA as well as Yokri-Egbe Seashore, all in Delta State.\n\nOther operations were executed at Ibaa in Emohua LGA, Iyala, Buguma and Cawthorne Channel Creeks as well as Samkiri, Orutoru and Dema Abbey Communities, all in Rivers and Delta States.\n\n\u201cDuring the operations, troops discovered and deactivated a total of 33 illegal refining sites with 46 illegal refining units, 94 boiler ovens and nine reservoirs.\n\n\u201cAlso, a cumulative total of 139 metal storage tanks and 63 dugout pits, all laden with 440.2 barrels and 1,637,500litres of illegally refined AGO as well as 62.2 barrels and 572,000litres of stolen crude oil and shelter stations were discovered and treated accordingly,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that other illegally refined products intercepted and immobilised were a wooden boat used for transportation of illegal oil products, 321 polythene bags, 16 drums and 15 jerry cans laden with illegally refined petroleum products.\n\nBrigadier-General Onyeuko said the Armed Forces of Nigeria remained steadfast in the fight against all forms of criminality in different parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThe military high command appreciates the continuous sacrifices of the troops in the various theatres of operation across the country. It salutes their courage, resilience and commitment towards achieving sustainable peace in the country.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the general public and the press for their continued support and further encourage all to avail the armed forces with credible and timely information that will facilitate proactive engagements in all the theatres of operation across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Nigerian government has ordered all telecom operators to shut down their networks in Zamfara State.\n\nUmar Garba Danbatta, Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Communications Commission in a letter to all telecom operators on Friday said the action was one of the strategies taken by security operatives in curbing banditry ravaging the state.\n\n\u201cThe pervading security situation in Zamfara State has necessitated an immediate shutting down of all telecommunications service in the state from today September 03, 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is to enable relevant security agencies carry out required activities towards addressing the security challenge in the state, in line with the requirement, Globacom is hereby directed to shut down all sites in Zamfara State and any site(s) in neighboring state that could provide telecommunications service in Zamfara State.\n\n\u201cThe site shutdown is for two weeks (September 03 - 17, 2021) in the first instance. Your urgent action in this regard is required,\u201d a copy of the letter sent to Globacom Nigeria reads.\n\nHowever, checks by SaharaReporters showed that all the major networks were still working as at 11pm on Friday, except Airtel that was off in some areas.\n\nThere is suspicion among the residents that they may shut down anytime soon.\n\nThe Zamfara State Government had last Friday also announced some new measures aimed at tackling the growing activities of bandits in the state.\n\nThese included the restriction of fuel sales to the state capital and the headquarters of the local government areas and suspension of all weekly markets across the state.\n\nSimilarly, the government suspended the transportation of livestock to and from the state, saying the transportation of food across the state and outside Zamfara must be verified.\n\nIt stressed that the destination of the food must be authenticated otherwise, it would be seized and taken to the orphanage.\n\nThe new rules further include the banning of riding on motorcycles and tricycles from 6pm to 6am in the state, except the state capital which starts from 8pm to 6am every day.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, any tricycle that is covered will be stopped to verify its passengers, otherwise will be apprehended,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cGovernor Matawalle reiterated the ban on more than two persons riding a motorcycle and warned that those who break the law stand the risk of being shot at by security operatives.\u201d\n\nThe government urged the people of the state to comply with the measures to avoid unfortunate incidents, saying security operatives would be empowered to treat offenders as suspected bandits.",

          "text": "The Nigerian government has ordered all telecom operators to shut down their networks in Zamfara State.\n\nUmar Garba Danbatta, Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Communications Commission in a letter to all telecom operators on Friday said the action was one of the strategies taken by security operatives in curbing banditry ravaging the state.\n\n\u201cThe pervading security situation in Zamfara State has necessitated an immediate shutting down of all telecommunications service in the state from today September 03, 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is to enable relevant security agencies carry out required activities towards addressing the security challenge in the state, in line with the requirement, Globacom is hereby directed to shut down all sites in Zamfara State and any site(s) in neighboring state that could provide telecommunications service in Zamfara State.\n\n\u201cThe site shutdown is for two weeks (September 03 - 17, 2021) in the first instance. Your urgent action in this regard is required,\u201d a copy of the letter sent to Globacom Nigeria reads.\n\nHowever, checks by SaharaReporters showed that all the major networks were still working as at 11pm on Friday, except Airtel that was off in some areas.\n\nThere is suspicion among the residents that they may shut down anytime soon.\n\nThe Zamfara State Government had last Friday also announced some new measures aimed at tackling the growing activities of bandits in the state.\n\nThese included the restriction of fuel sales to the state capital and the headquarters of the local government areas and suspension of all weekly markets across the state.\n\nSimilarly, the government suspended the transportation of livestock to and from the state, saying the transportation of food across the state and outside Zamfara must be verified.\n\nIt stressed that the destination of the food must be authenticated otherwise, it would be seized and taken to the orphanage.\n\nThe new rules further include the banning of riding on motorcycles and tricycles from 6pm to 6am in the state, except the state capital which starts from 8pm to 6am every day.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, any tricycle that is covered will be stopped to verify its passengers, otherwise will be apprehended,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cGovernor Matawalle reiterated the ban on more than two persons riding a motorcycle and warned that those who break the law stand the risk of being shot at by security operatives.\u201d\n\nThe government urged the people of the state to comply with the measures to avoid unfortunate incidents, saying security operatives would be empowered to treat offenders as suspected bandits.",

          "title": "With Awabah, Tunji Andrews wants to make pensions as popular as banking",
          "text": "Between November and December 2020, Tunji Andrews co-piloted a project to help informal workers save for the future. Those efforts culminated in the January rollout of Awabah, a digital platform that provides micro pension access to self-employed Nigerians and informal workers.\n\n\u201cMany people in Nigeria and Africa do day-to-day financial transactions in markets but don\u2019t have access to the benefits that the formal financial system offers,\u201d Andrews told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cSo when I wanted to get into the fintech space, it had to be something that would drive financial inclusion on a very strong basis.\u201d\n\nA flexible, \u20a6500 plan\n\nCo-founded with Tina Ajishebiyawo and Gboyega Olatunde, Awabah Nigeria automates micro-pensions and target-savings for self-employed Nigerians and workers in the informal economy. An understanding of the unique characteristics of its target market has been key to Awabah\u2019s operations and ensuring last-mile delivery.\n\nLower-income members of the informal economy can be difficult to capture and most engage in local cooperatives and market associations. Awabah has leaned heavily on town hall meetings to reach these people in large numbers, introducing its product via group presentations and one-on-one sessions.\n\nAfter onboarding them, the company uses either its web platform or a network of local banking agents to continue taking collections from, educating, and further engaging with contributors.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIncome levels vary in the informal sector. Thus, Andrews explains that contributors with as little as \u20a6500 can start a micro-pensions account. Subsequent amounts contributed are based on an individual\u2019s capacity.\n\nContributions are also flexible. Taking into account the irregular cash flow of informal workers, they can be made daily, weekly, monthly, or even quarterly, similar to local savings groups (popularly known as Ajo or Esusu).\n\nDue to the constant need for cash flow in the informal sector, users have the option of withdrawing up to 40% of their savings at any point after the initial 3 months of contributions. Whenever someone deposits \u20a61,000, for instance, \u20a6600 is locked in the retirement account while the rest goes into the customer\u2019s mobile wallet as contingent savings.\n\n\u201cThey always come and ask for their 40% after the first three months as a way of testing the product, and we make sure that they get it as quickly as possible,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cOnce they get their money back and see alerts every time they put in their \u20a6500, they\u2019re able to test the system.\u201d\n\nAwabah has achieved impressive results within months of operation, having onboarded more than 5,000 customers so far. It makes money primarily by earning a commission on every contribution made.\n\nAwabah Nigeria Co-founder, Tunji Andrews.\n\nExtending pensions to the informal economy\n\nIn Nigeria, a good number of elderly parents are financially dependent on their children \u2013 partly because societal norms deem it necessary for children to care for aging parents; and also because there is an evident lack of working systems for retirement savings.\n\nEven where pension schemes are available, they often only cover people who are formally employed. Nigeria has a large informal workforce and about 88% of the entire labour force without pensions is from the informal economy. The result? A large group of citizens becomes financially vulnerable as they get older.\n\nWorse still is that relatively young Nigerians currently dominate the labour force and the lack of retirement savings means they are susceptible to living below the poverty line in their old age.\n\nNigeria\u2019s National Pension Commission (PenCom) has a target of growing the country\u2019s pension coverage to 30% of the entire labour force \u2013 formal and informal \u2013 by 2024. As of the first quarter of this year, the figure stood at 12%.\n\nA provision in the Pension Reform Act of 2014 ushered in a new micro-pension plan, effectively opening the door for the informal economy to participate in the national Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). Awabah\u2019s operation is backed by this provision.\n\nThe micro pension scheme was formally introduced in 2019 but is yet to gain traction. Thus, Andrews has made it his and Awabah\u2019s mission to make the services available to those in the informal sector and whose employers are not legally required to deduct and remit pension.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard about the new micro pension scheme two years ago, I was excited as I had been thinking about pensions. But there weren\u2019t a lot of conversations and awareness about it. So for me, it was a no-brainer,\u201d he said.\n\nExpanding Awabah\n\nAwabah is less than a year old and has had to deal with manpower and logistics challenges. Still, Andrews has big ambitions.\n\nGoing forward, the startup plans to leverage the penetration of mobile phones in Nigeria to reach even a wider audience, starting with the planned launch of a USSD option.\n\nThrough a shortcode, existing and potential customers will be able to learn about and sign up to Awabah, as well as get financial literacy lessons in local languages. For those who have smartphones, Awabah will engage them via WhatsApp.\n\nThe Awabah team.\n\nThe startup raised $200,000 from early-stage angel investors ODBA and Co Ventures and Correlation Capital in July, which helped it expand into Ibadan. Awabah also recently gained acceptance into the Techstars London accelerator programme, where it will get some funding.\n\nAndrews reveals that a new fundraising round is in the works, which will help fund a larger expansion. Over the next few months, the startup has plans to enter into five more Nigerian cities. It is also mulling an expansion into Ghana.\n\n\u201cThe bigger goal is to create a larger awareness of micro pensions in Africa,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cWe want pensions to be popular as banking and insurance are.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Awabah has partnerships with three Pension Fund Administrators, including Leadway Pensure, which holds the PenCom license under which it operates; a microfinance bank via which it provides mobile wallets; as well as two agent banking networks.\n\nAndrews aims to expand the list of partner organisations and, in the long term, plans to push conversations with Nigeria\u2019s pensions regulator on the possibility of issuing micro pension licenses for small players like Awabah.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we have a one-size-fits-all pension license, unlike Ghana where there\u2019s a three-tier system,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThe lack of micro pension licenses can be a drawback as we believe we are best positioned to drive the product. But it\u2019s still very early days.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "Nigerian banks sit on an inventory of consumer data that fintech startups in the country can only dream of.\n\nWith more than 70 million active bank customers in Nigeria, banks possess valuable big data, consisting of demographic, personal, and professional information of clients as well as transaction history, consumption patterns, and movements.\n\nThere\u2019s so much that can be done with this data. For instance, lenders can segment their client base to offer personalised savings or loan offers. The data can also be deployed in targeting Nigeria\u2019s huge unbanked population with customised services, based on similar profiles to existing clients.\n\nBut very few, if any, legacy banks in Nigeria actually go out of their traditional ways to innovate using the rich data reserves. However, banks can share the data with third parties that have better capabilities to use them, and that\u2019s the premise of Open Banking.\n\nWhat is Open Banking?\n\nOpen Banking is an emerging global practice of data sharing between banks and other stakeholders in the ecosystem; including third-party financial services providers (TPPs), fintechs, and other institutions.\n\nBy sharing one another\u2019s datasets, the companies can better understand their target markets, acquire more customers, and build out new customer-centric products and services or improve on existing ones.\n\nIfeoluwa Orioke, the Chief Commercial Officer at Flutterwave, explains to TechCabal that one of the ways customers can benefit from open banking is by accessing loans tailored to their needs.\n\n\u201cA lender can understand your credit score from your transaction history and tailor specific credit facilities to you. Or for instance, interest repayments for a farmer whose income is in seasons, and not months, can be structured around the harvest season.\u201d\n\nWhile these are viable use cases, Open Banking is more effective for driving financial inclusion in Nigeria. As of the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult Nigerian population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBanks don\u2019t have incentives to target rural areas, where most of the unbanked population resides. In their place, fintech firms are extending access to financial services in these areas through agent networks and mobile money wallets.\n\nHowever, fintechs need to integrate data with banks before they launch agent locations. A common standard for both parties to share information is needed to help speed up integration.\n\nOpen Banking introduces this common standard, via uniform Application Programme Interface (API), which banks and fintechs all have access to. It aids the latter\u2019s efforts to reach the financially excluded or underserved.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking is a major step forward in solving restricted access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d said Orioke. \u201cThose who do not have bank accounts can participate in the financial ecosystem via Fintechs. Fintechs can provide improved solutions and personalised services to these people by processing data from banks.\u201d\n\nOpen Banking Nigeria, a private initiative building a common standard for Open Banking APIs in Nigeria, has, to an impressive extent, helped standardise API access, thereby easing the process of integration between fintechs and banks.\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank also recently launched draft regulations for Open Banking, which establishes principles for data sharing across the banking and payments ecosystem.\n\nWin-win for all\n\nAccording to Orioke, the Open Banking idea is a win-win for all parties involved in the ecosystem; banks, fintechs, TPPs, the banked, and the unbanked populations.\n\nWith vast and detailed consumer data gathered over the years, Open Banking provides value creation opportunities for innovation-friendly banks.\n\nFintech companies, with access to bank data, could better serve existing customers and even acquire new users in the process.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking equally creates more options for existing customers and could bring in more people into the banking system, simply by tailoring solutions to their needs,\u201d notes Orioke. \u201cWith more customer personalisation comes improved trust in the financial services industry.\n\nOutside financial services, Open Banking has the potential to impact all aspects of the customer\u2019s life, seeing as every activity is connected to finance; whether hospitality, healthcare, or insurance.\n\n\u201cIt can also increase the profitability of all participating parties (including the banks), reduce cost and improve customer experience. Open Banking could be the ultimate solution to all current difficulties with access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d Orioke said.\n\nConsidering its numerous benefits and rapid adoption, Open Banking could potentially revolutionise the financial services ecosystem in Nigeria and go down as one of the most important innovations in the financial inclusion drive.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "title": "Understanding why customers act the way they do",
          "text": "Businesses exist to plug identified holes in the spectrum of human needs with products and services. This is the reason why a business needs to consistently reinvent itself to maintain its relevance. Businesses exist to meet needs. Their job isn\u2019t to create needs for their customers. Customers\u2014humans\u2014do a fine job of that on their own.\n\nThe job of any business or brand is to make its customers aware of their existing needs. When this is done successfully, they trigger motivation in their customers. This motivation leads customers to take action.\n\nA Variety of Customer Needs\n\nSome of these needs are innate or biological. All of us are born with them. They represent survival needs like food, water, breathing, shelter, and safety. Humans don\u2019t like feeling out of control. We constantly seek to gain better control of our environment. Other needs are social, like the need for love, friendship, connection, or belonging.\n\nStill, others are learned or acquired in response to the culture or environment. These needs include external esteem needs\u2014what other people think of you\u2014and internal esteem needs\u2014what you think of yourself. These needs are rooted in achievement\u2014the need for personal accomplishment.\n\n\u2026 and needs create tensions\n\nYour customers start off with an unfulfilled need, want, or desire. When a need is unmet it creates internal tension. When you\u2019re stuck in traffic after drinking five or six glasses of water, the tension to find a restroom escalates with each passing moment. When your colleague buys a brand new, top-of-the-range car and you don\u2019t have one, your need to feel good in comparison to others (external esteem) can create an internal tension.\n\nRead also: BetKing Customer claims life-changing win of N40m\n\nTensions build drive\n\nInternal tensions build energy within your customer. She might want a new lifestyle, a new way of expressing herself. Her thoughts go to the object of desire. She notices things that she desires and doesn\u2019t have. Each thought triggers an emotion. Each emotion adds to the energy reservoir. This energy produces motivation.\n\nMotivation creates behaviour\n\nWhen the energy behind the motivation builds to a sufficient level, it triggers certain behaviours. Mind you, customers\u2019 behaviours vary, and are based on their personalities and lived experiences. But, their behaviours stem from three primary sources:\n\nPrevious learning: the customer learned to act a certain way, in a given situation by watching his or her parents in early childhood, people in his or her social network, or characters on television, in books and films. You can look at your own life and see that these are true of you, too.\n\nCognitive process: if the customer is consciously aware of the tension, he or she can evaluate how to resolve the tension by determining the best course of action or by simply letting the tension go.\n\nArchetypal images: the internal tension can trigger specific emotions and images in the customer\u2019s psyche, activating an archetype that leads to set patterns of behavior.\n\nMost times, the behaviours that are triggered lead to fulfilling the needs, thereby reducing the tension.\n\n\u2026 still, the motivation cycle lingers\n\nThe process, however, doesn\u2019t end there. Although the customer\u2019s tension may be reduced, it\u2019s not eliminated. Their needs, as Maslow discovered, are never fully satisfied. The tension of the unmet need builds energy once more. And the cycle continues.\n\n\u2026 customers\u2019 needs change\n\nJust like your needs and your criteria for fulfilling those needs tend to change over time, it is important for you to understand that, so do those of your customers. When your customers achieve a particular goal, they intuitively set new and higher goals. Your customers, just like you and your organisation, are on their own developmental paths, and the human in them keeps them going, on those paths.\n\nDo well not to forget that change is consistent and constant with your customers. The question is: are you adapting and changing with them? That is one reality check that any business owner or manager cannot ignore or forget.\n\nFrom customer insights to business growth\n\nIf you want to motivate your customers to do business with you, first understand their tensions. This means getting to know your customers on a deeper level. Getting to know your customers\u2019 tensions isn\u2019t always easy. You can\u2019t necessarily ask your customers directly. Many of our tensions are not conscious.\n\nBut what happens when you do uncover the answers? What are you going to do with these insights? Will you use this knowledge to exploit them or elevate them? Will you simply focus on closing the next sale or seek to build long-term loyalty?\n\nLast line: These are big questions that only you, as the leader of your enterprise, can honestly evaluate and act upon. However, I do not think you should be shocked when I say the former choice\u2015transaction/exploitation\u2015 is the default position. Infact, the latter choice\u2015elevation/loyalty\u2015 takes intention, discipline, and creative execution. The end reward is that it guarantees greater sustainability and long-term profitability.\n\nChoose wisely.",

It destabilises, affects behaviour. It also affects body organs, and at some point, it can lead to death.\n\n\u201cSo, while we appreciate those who want to legalise it for financial gains, we have to be careful to reconcile it with life. So it\u2019s money versus life. And up to this point, science has not developed up to the point where it can remove the THC in cannabis to zero.\n\n\u201cTherefore, cannabis is harmful to our health, is a danger to society. We must never allow its legalization. What\u2019s more, Nigeria has 10.6 million cannabis users, this is the highest in the world. Isn\u2019t it sad?\n\n\u201cWe should be the highest in science, technology, mathematics, physics, and stuff that were looked at as highest, that is something we need.\n\n\u201cWe can never support legalization and I don\u2019t see how the National Assembly would pass the act because I know 90 percent or more of the Honorable and Distinguished members of the National Assembly know the implications of this legalization and they dare not go back to their constituencies if anyone signs legalization because we\u2019re seeing the implication on the ground.\n\n\u201cThe youths, the families are being destroyed because of cannabis and drugs. It wouldn\u2019t be legalised by the grace of God.\u201d\n\nMarwa said that he discussed the issue of building barracks for the NDLEA operatives in the 36 states of the federation.\n\n\u201cFinally, and very importantly, I raised the issue of barracks.

All other agencies, armed forces, police, customs, immigration,\n\nroad safety all have estates, and barracks, except the NDLEA, we still don\u2019t have barracks.\n\n\u201cAnd now, considering the hazardous nature of the work that we do, the danger in it, we arrest and jail the criminals and then live among them. When you send operatives, to go into the forest, to go after the criminals, they will be encouraged if they knew that their own families are secure in a barracks somewhere.\n\n\u201cSo clearly, we got a positive response on that, we\u2019re very grateful for it and we look forward to the execution as soon as it is practicable. The economy, I\u2019m sure permitting,\u201d he added.\n\nAsked where the baracks will be sited, he said: \u201cWe have as you know, personnel in 36 states of the Federation and FCT, therefore, we expect barracks in all the locations that as we as having to travel the country, the budgetary provisions is something that I will not comment on at this point.\u201d\n\nOn whether he has received any threat since he assumed office, the NDLEA boss said, \u201cSeverally, it\u2019s almost a daily occurrence because my phone number is open.

Chille Igbawua, has assured that if elected in 2023, his administration will streghthen the traditional institutions through budgetry provisions such that would eliminate financial incumberances to allow them respond promptly to situations related to their constitutional mandate.\n\nThe immediate-past West African Coordinator of Ombudsman and Director at the International Ombudsmen Institute, Vienna, also revealed that his administration will foster greater partnership with development partners with the view to elevate the standard of living of Benue people, particularly in the areas of environmental sanitation for the good and health of the people.\n\nIn a statement signed by the media cordinator of the Chille Igbawua campaign, Mr Andrew Oota, the aspirant made this known when he addressed the Tor Kwande, Tor Sankara and Tor Jechira, His Royal Highnesses Chief Ambros Pine Iotyegh, Chief Abu King-Shuluwa and Chief Clement Uganden respectively with their cabinet members, with the reassurances that the partnerships will save the state more money for other critical sectors, if elected as Benue State governor.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to the statement, Hon. Igbawua believes that the traditional institutions will be charged with enormous constitutional responsibilities such that will require a constitutionally guaranteed financial pool from which they tap to take care of emergencies, especially security related issues that require immediate and prompt actions.\n\nThe former permanent secretary in the State\u2019s Ministry of Finance maintained that he will deploy his state, national and international exposure in addressing the yearnings and aspirations of the Benue people, particularly the challenges of insecurity, mechanised agriculture, foreign trade, investments as well as industrialisation through the cooperatives and the Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) patterns.\n\nHe maintained that his policy to restructure the settlement patterns by creating boarder settlement-towns in Benue State will build a strong resistance to external attackers and pave the way for devopments, reserve vast lands for merchanized agriculture and in turn promote all-season farming that would feed the small industries with raw materials as well as exportation.\n\nHe said Governor Ortom\u2019s vow to speak for the people of Benue State against senseless attacks and insistence that everyone within the state must obey the anti-open grazing law must be commended and supported, adding that his administration will ensure more tough legislations, insisting that the interest, protection and well-being of the Benue people must be paramount.\n\nIn his response, the Tor Kwande expressed happiness that Hon. Igbawua has no record of inefficiency and criminal behaviour in the state, national and international, adding that the promise to restructure the settlement pattern of the Benue people stands amongst the other good intentions of Igbawua if elected.\n\nThe royal father expressed delight that his council members have all give good accounts and testimonies about the aspirant, adding that his international exposure will have a positive influence on his administration if elected as Benue governor even as he offered royal blessings on Igbawua.",

          "text": "Kaduna State will use electronic voting machines for its local government elections which hold today, Saturday, 4 September in all the 23 local councils.\n\nIt\u2019s a remarkable feat as the same technology was rejected by the National Assembly recently.\n\nIn 2018, Kaduna also used electronic voting to conduct its council polls, becoming the first state to do so in Nigeria and the second in Africa, after Namibia.\n\nDr. Saratu Binta Dikko-Audu, chairman of the Kaduna State Independent Electoral Commission (KADSIECOM), said that the Commission was encouraged by Governor Nasir El-Rufai to deploy technology for elections.\n\nShe stated that KADSIECOM therefore acquired electronic voting machines which were successfully used in 2018.\n\n\u201cWhy that happened was because the Governor of this State, Malam Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai, being very progressive and courageous, decided when we came on board to task us with the responsibility of deploying technology to our Local Government Councils election.\n\n\u201cInitially, we thought all he meant was using the smart card reader because it had been such a success in the 2015 elections. But he said no, he wanted us to go the whole hog and have citizens actually vote on a machine and so we set out to develop the voting machine which we eventually presented to the public in 2018.\u201d\n\nThe chairman disclosed that the state electoral body has put lessons learnt in 2018 into its preparations for the 2021 LG elections.\n\nBriefing journalists, Dr. Dikko-Audu explained that the electronic voting machines used in 2018 have been upgraded to prevent multiple voting while preserving speed of voting and the integrity of the voting process.\n\n\u201cEach voter\u2019s card can only be used once, so the machine will not allow multiple voting. The voter is required to touch the logo of the party he wants to vote for, and that choice is registered, and he can see a paper trail generated through a transparent window in the machine showing the party the voter chose.\n\n\u201cThis paper trail can be tallied to compare it to the electronic result if any party agent at the polling unit so requests\u201d.\n\nDr. Dikko-Audu confirmed that the results will be sent directly from the electronic voting machines to the KADSIECOM servers, while party agents and security agencies at the polling units will have card copies of the summary of results printed from the machine.\n\nAt the conclusion of voting, the result from each electronic voting machine is printed in ten copies so that the party agents at the polling unit will have a copy each.\n\n\u201cThe security agents at the polling unit will also have copies and the result is transmitted to our server here in Kaduna. It is also stored in the USB port of the machine.\n\n\u201cYou have four levels where the result is stored: the paper trail, the summary of results, the memory of the machine itself and the transmission to the server at headquarters. It will be hard for anyone to say they want to rig an election and change all those four values.\n\n\u201cRemember that I said we print ten copies of the summary of results, so ten people already have the results out there. How are you going to get all ten and change them? It will be very difficult.\u201d\n\nShe noted that 95% of residents of Kaduna State who voted in the 2018 elections said that they found it easy to use the electronic voting machines during the local government elections of 12 May 2018, and she is confident that the ease of usage has been retained in the upgrade.\n\nApart from Namibia, electronic voting is used in Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Curacao, Mexico, Haiti, Philippines, the United States of America and Venezuela.",

          "text": "Pelumi Olajengbesi, the lawyer for 12 detained aides of Yoruba Nation leader Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, has warned the Director-General of the Department of State Services, Yusuf Bichi, to obey the court order and free the remaining two detainees held by the agency.\n\nAccording to Olajengbesi in a statement on Friday, a contempt proceeding would be instituted against the DSS and its Director-General for failing to release the detainees despite the fact that they had been served with the court\u2019s signed warrant of release.\n\nThe secret police had on August 30 released eight of the 12 aides of the agitator.\n\nIt subsequently released two of the remaining four on Friday but refused to release the other two namely; Amudat Habibat Babatunde and Jamiu Noah Oyetunji, contrary to an order of the court that granted bail to the entire 12 arrested aides.\n\nCondemning the action of the DSS, Olajengbesi said the secret police should stop carrying out its official responsibility with impunity and absolute disrespect to the law of the land especially where the constitutional rights and liberty of citizens are at stake.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe keenly observing world will recall that during our last press briefing on the on-going case of Chief Sunday Igboho\u2019s aides, it was reported that the DSS is yet release four (4) of detainees on their custody on grounds of bail perfection technicality, in which we were allowed to secure the release of others.\n\n\u201cSequel to the refusal of the DSS to release the other detainees, concerted efforts were immediately made to resolve all technical issues raised by the DSS. Accordingly, on Friday the 3rd of September, 2021, all issues raised were resolved and we proceeded to the Headquarters of the DSS to demand the immediate release of the four (4) remaining detainees in their custody.\n\n\u201cRegrettably and in the whimsical habit of the DSS, only two of the remaining four received their freedom while the other two namely; Amudat Habibat Babatunde and Jamiu Noah Oyetunji, remain in the unlawful custody of the DSS. No valid reasons on law were availed the Legal Team for this willful disobedience of the rule of law and court.\n\n\u201cThe DSS\u2019 cherry-picking of an order of court is an open dare and affront on the authority of the issuing court and it lacks legal backing under the extant laws of Nigeria. It is a condemnable action in any sane democratic society and speaks ill of the professionalism of the intelligence agency. The DSS simply have no right nor power to select or unilaterally handpick which order of court is convenient for it to obey or honor. Any iota of non-compliance to an order of court is tantamount to disregard of such an order in its entirety and same is contemptuous.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we want to restate that if by Monday the 6th of September, 2021, the DSS continue with their unlawful detention of the remaining two (2) detainees, we shall not hesitate to proceed with our earlier plans to institute a contempt proceeding against the Director General of the SSS, Yusuf Magaji Bichi.\n\n\u201cThe DSS as a law enforcement agency should not be allowed to carry out its official responsibility with impunity and absolute disrespect to the law of the land especially where the constitutional rights and liberty of citizens are at stake. It is a reprehensible conduct unbecoming of an agency which is itself a creation of the law and it will not go unchallenged.\u201d",

          "title": "BREAKING: Lawless Department Of State Services Releases Two More Sunday Igboho\u2019s Aides",
          "text": "Sunday Adeyemo, alias Sunday Igboho, a Yoruba activist, has released two more aides.\n\nThe two were released by the secret police on Friday, according to their lawyer, Pelumi Olajengbesi.\n\nThe DSS, however, refused to release the remaining two persons, Lady K and one other, contrary to an order of the court that granted bail to the entire 12 aides of the Yoruba Nation agitator in the custody of the agency.\n\nThe secret police had earlier on August 30 released eight of the activists.\n\nThey had met their bail conditions including the provision of 24 sureties but the DSS lawyer, Idowu Awo, kicked against the bail granted by Justice Egwuatu to four of the detainees, claiming that they were heavily involved in the alleged offence of arms stockpiling and other criminal activities of their boss, Igboho.\n\nAwo had filed a remand application for the four detainees saying their release would affect investigation. He had also approached an Appeal Court sitting in Abuja to revoke the bail earlier granted to the four persons.\n\nThe aides were released to Olajengbesi after the Department of State Services (DSS) failed to comply with a court ruling on the matter.\n\nIt would be recalled that the lawyer had issued an ultimatum to the DSS to release the detained aides, who were arrested at Igboho\u2019s house.\n\nHe had said, \u201cIt has become imperative and urgent to make this brief address in light of the vindictive and oppressive conduct of the State Security Service (SSS) (also known as DSS) in the matter involving 12 detained associates of Yoruba Nation activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, aka Igboho.\n\n\u201cIn the wee hours of the 1st of July, 2021, a joint team of men from the State Security Service (SSS) and the Nigerian military, with neither lawful cause nor a warrant of arrest, broke into the Ibadan home of the Yoruba Nation activist popularly known as Sunday Igboho and extra-judicially murdered two of his associates while rounding up, bounding and abducting 12 others to be incarcerated without cause in the dungeons of the SSS where they continue to languish without reprieve to this day.\n\n\u201cAll 12 detainees who were immediately subjected to degrading conditions of detention and torture were denied access to their lawyers by the SSS up until the intervention of the court through an order recognising and re-emphasizing the detainees\u2019 right to legal representation against whatever allegations against them.\n\n\u201cRegrettably and indeed unacceptably, while no charges, in full or tentatively, have been preferred against all 12 detainees, the SSS have failed and refused to honour an order of court which granted bail to and ordered the release of all twelve detainees upon the perfection of the terms of their bail which have now been fully satisfied and duly communicated to the SSS.\n\n\u201cThe refusal of the SSS to honour a clear order of court, though habitual, is not only worrisome and unacceptable but is an affront on the authority of the court and our entire judicial system. Such blatant disregard for, and contemptuous, spiteful and insolent disrespect of an order of court if allowed to fester would undermine the very integrity of the court and breed even newer levels of rascality by state agents. It would also amount to surrendering the freedom and rights of all twelve detainees to the whims and caprices of an agency that has gone rogue and thrives in wilful disobedience of court orders.\n\n\u201cIn light of this, we are giving the SSS, particularly its Director-General, forty-eight (48) hours and not an hour more, within which to fully obey and comply with the release order of the court in favour of all 12 detained associates of Mr. Sunday Igboho or face contempt proceedings before a court of competent jurisdiction with the full weight and recompense of the court brought to bear against his insolence and disregard of court order.\n\n\u201cTake notice that we will not fail to exhaust all legal and social remedy available to the detainees in enforcing their rights in this matter and setting the tone against the SSS\u2019 notorious disregard of due process and the rule of law.\u201d",
          "summary": "Sunday Adeyemo, alias Sunday Igboho, a Yoruba activist, has released two more aides.\nAwo had filed a remand application for the four detainees saying their release would affect investigation.\nHe had also approached an Appeal Court sitting in Abuja to revoke the bail earlier granted to the four persons.\nThe aides were released to Olajengbesi after the Department of State Services (DSS) failed to comply with a court ruling on the matter.\nIt would be recalled that the lawyer had issued an ultimatum to the DSS to release the detained aides, who were arrested at Igboho\u2019s house.",

Marwa as NDLEA Chairman earlier in the year.\n\nThe retired brigadier general who was a former Military Administrator of Lagos State has since taking office, stood his grounds against the legalisation of marijuana.\n\nIn opposing the demands for the approval of cannabis in Nigeria, Marwa would always argue that the nation cannot afford to mortgage the lives of the citizens for financial gains.\n\nFor the NDLEA Chairman, the agency will continue to burn down marijuana farms and prosecute whoever is caught doing the business.",

          "text": "The Department of State Services (DSS) has released two more aides of Yoruba Nation agitator Sunday Adeyemo.\n\nTheir lawyer, Pelumi Olajengbesi confirmed their release on Friday via a statement obtained by Channels Television.\n\nThis comes after the DSS had released eight of Igboho\u2019s aides on Monday.\n\nHe however noted that two other aides \u2013 Amudat Habibat Babatunde and Jamiu Noah Oyetunji \u2013 remain in the unlawful custody of the DSS.\n\nOlajengbesi vowed to file a contempt of court against the secret service.\n\n\u201cSequel to the refusal of the DSS to release the other detainees, concerted efforts were immediately made to resolve all technical issues raised by the DSS. Accordingly, on Friday the 3rd of September, 2021, all issues raised were resolved and we proceeded to the Headquarters of the DSS to demand the immediate release of the four (4) remaining detainees in their custody,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cRegrettably and in the whimsical habit of the DSS, only two of the remaining four received their freedom while the other two namely; Amudat Habibat Babatunde and Jamiu Noah Oyetunji, remain in the unlawful custody of the DSS. No valid reasons on law were availed the Legal Team for this willful disobedience of the rule of law and court.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Teenager Arrested For Tampering UTME Result\n\nOn August 4, Justice Obiora Egwuatu of the Federal High Court sitting granted bail to the 12 detainees but the DSS only released eight on August 31.\n\nThe detainees had met their bail conditions including the provision of 24 sureties, though the DSS lawyer, Idowu Awo, had kicked against the bail granted by Justice Egwuatu to four of them, claiming that they were heavily involved in the alleged offence of arms stockpiling and other criminal activities of their boss, Igboho.\n\nBut Olajengbesi warned that should the DSS refuse to release the remaining two aides, he would file contempt of court charges against its Director-General, Yusuf Magaji Bichi.\n\nHe noted that DSS is a law enforcement agency and should not be allowed to carry out its official responsibility with impunity and absolute disrespect to the law of the land, especially where the constitutional rights and liberty of citizens are at stake.\n\nSee the full statement here:\n\n\u2018DSS\u2019 RELEASES TWO MORE IGBOHO\u2019S Aides \u2013 Tajudeen Irinloye and Uthman Opeymi Adelabu \u201cDSS\u2019 SELECTIVE OBEDIENCE TO COURT ORDER; AN AFFRONT TO AND DISREGARD OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE COURT\u201d By. Pelumi Olajengbesi Esq. The keenly observing world will recall that during our last press briefing on the on-going case of Chief Sunday Igboho\u2019s aides, it was reported that the DSS is yet to release four (4) of detainees on their custody on grounds of bail perfection technicality, in which we were allowed to secure the release of others. Sequel to the refusal of the DSS to release the other detainees, concerted efforts were immediately made to resolve all technical issues raised by the DSS. Accordingly, on Friday the 3rd of September, 2021, all issues raised were resolved and we proceeded to the Headquarters of the DSS to demand the immediate release of the four (4) remaining detainees in their custody. Regrettably and in the whimsical habit of the DSS, only two of the remaining four received their freedom while the other two namely; Amudat Habibat Babatunde and Jamiu Noah Oyetunji, remain in the unlawful custody of the DSS. No valid reasons on law were availed the Legal Team for this willful disobedience of the rule of law and court. The DSS\u2019 cherry-picking of an order of the court is an open dare and affront on the authority of the issuing court and it lacks legal backing under the extant laws of Nigeria. It is a condemnable action in any sane democratic society and speaks ill of the professionalism of the intelligence agency. The DSS simply have no right nor power to select or unilaterally handpick which order of the court is convenient for it to obey or honor. Any iota of non-compliance to an order of the court is tantamount to disregard of such an order in its entirety and the same is contemptuous. Consequently, we want to restate that if by Monday the 6th of September, 2021, the DSS continue with their unlawful detention of the remaining two (2) detainees, we shall not hesitate to proceed with our earlier plans to institute a contempt proceeding against the Director-General of the SSS, Yusuf Magaji Bichi. The DSS as a law enforcement agency should not be allowed to carry out its official responsibility with impunity and absolute disrespect to the law of the land, especially where the constitutional rights and liberty of citizens are at stake. It is reprehensible conduct unbecoming of an agency that is itself a creation of the law and it will not go unchallenged. Thank you. Pelumi Olajengbesi Esq. Principal Partner Law Corridor\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "A 19-year-old candidate in the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination has been arrested by the police for allegedly tampering with his result.\n\nThe spokesman of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Fabian Benjamin, said the arrest followed the suspect\u2019s claim of scoring 380 in the examination conducted in June.\n\n\u201cAfter several enquiries, 265 kept appearing as his score as against the 380 score,\u201d the JAMB spokesman said via a statement issued on Friday.\n\nFollowing the alleged alteration of the UTME score, Benjamin said the teenager\u2019s father, John Ifenkpam approached an Enugu-based lawyer, Ikeazor Akaiwe who wrote to JAMB for another opportunity for the boy to retake the examination and demanded N1 billion as damages.\n\nThe lawyer was said to have demanded the sum to cover for the physical and emotional trauma the boy had being through from being offered \u201ctwo separate scores.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Do Not Sell Lands To \u2018Selfish Politicians\u2019, Ishaku Warns Mambilla Residents\n\nAccording to JAMB spokesman, the suspect claimed that his UTME scores from 2019 till 2021 had been \u201caltered\u201d by the board, thereby denying him the opportunity to study his desired course \u2013 medicine.\n\nIt was gathered that the candidate travelled to Abuja from Enugu with his father and lawyer on Friday to honour an invitation from the management of the board led by the Registrar of JAMB, Prof Ishaq Oloyede.\n\n\u201cInitially, the boy was given few minutes to \u201ccome clean\u201d in a closed session with his father and lawyers about the results he was parading but insisted that his original score from the examination was 380.\n\n\u201cAfter going back and forth, the board tendered evidence to counter the claim by John and his legal representatives.\n\nAt the Friday meeting, documentary evidence tendered by the board showed that John actually scored 265 not the 380 he had claimed,\u201d the statement added.\n\nOn his part, the JAMB Registrar accused the candidate of result tempering, noting that he will be investigated and subsequently prosecuted by the police.\n\nProfessor Oloyeded said he was among 11 eleven other candidates who allegedly forged their results that the board would prosecute, adding that the original result issued would be withdrawn pending the end of the investigation.\n\n\u201cWe have 11 of them who tampered with their results. Two of them are already being prosecuted. The remaining ones we are going to withdraw their results and prosecute them. The main purpose is to sanitise the system, including our own staff,\u201d the Registrar was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cThere was never any communication of 380 with this boy. Because this boy has accused JAMB, we are going to withhold his result until the investigation is concluded. We are going to request that our interactions with him be subjected to the public.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the candidate\u2019s lawyer, Ikeazor, appealed to the board to instead give room for further infestation.\n\nHe said, \u201cI will not stand against the investigation. Let there be an investigation but what I will not agree to is to prejudge him.\u201d\n\nBut the candidate had insisted that \u201cThe result I have been receiving is not the result I am entitled to. I wrote the first JAMB in 2019. The first time they sent 328 later I saw 278 score when I checked it. I printed it. I couldn\u2019t meet up for admission that year. I wanted to study medicine and surgery at the University of Ibadan.\n\n\u201cIn 2020 the same thing happened. I scored 343 by the time I went to the portal to print I saw 306. I used the 306 and it gave me admission in UI. But because I didn\u2019t have further mathematics, I had to forfeit it.\n\n\u201cI decided to leave medicine and surgery for them in 2021 so I picked petroleum engineering. In 2021, JAMB issued me two results. I saw 380 the first time I checked then the second I saw 265.\u201d",

          "text": "U.S. automaker, General Motors has announced a pause in production at eight of its 15 North American assembly plants during the next two weeks, as global shortage of computer chips is getting worse.\n\nFord also will stop making pickups at its Kansas City Assembly Plant for the next two weeks. Shifts will be cut at two more truck plants in Dearborn, Michigan, and Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe global shortage in computer chips is getting worse, forcing automakers to temporarily close factories including those that build popular pickup trucks.\n\nAutomakers reported that U.S. dealers had just under a million new vehicles on their lots in August, 72% lower than the 3.58 million in August of 2019.\n\nIndustry analysts say the delta variant of the novel coronavirus has hit employees at chip factories in southeast Asia hard, forcing some plants to close. That\u2019s worsened a chip shortage that was starting to improve earlier in the summer.\n\n\u201cNow the prospects for new sales for the rest of the year continue to dim with the reality that tight inventory will last well into 2022,\u201d said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights for Cargurus.com.\n\nDemand for trucks, SUVs and other autos is strong, but buyers are growing frustrated due to lack of inventory and high prices. U.S. light vehicle sales fell nearly 18% in August compared with a year ago, while the average vehicle sale price hit over $41,000, a record, according to J.D. Power.\n\nSales of Ford\u2019s F-Series trucks fell nearly 23% for the month.\n\nThe August sales dip and inventory shortages prompted Schuster to cut his U.S. sales forecast for the year to 15.7 million. Until the pandemic hit, sales had been running around 17 million per year.\n\nConsumers who need a new vehicle don\u2019t have many choices with dealer supplies so short, Schuster said. Some have left the market because they can\u2019t find anything that meets their needs. For others, \u201cpricing is through the roof, so they can\u2019t afford it and aren\u2019t willing to spend what it\u2019s going to cost to get that vehicle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese recent scheduling adjustments are being driven by the continued parts shortages caused by semiconductor supply constraints from international markets experiencing COVID-19-related restrictions,\u201d GM said in a statement.\n\nThe GM and Ford cuts come on top of temporary plant closures announced previously by Toyota, Nissan and Stellantis, formerly Fiat Chrysler.\n\nToyota said it would slash production by at least 40% in Japan and North America for the next two months, cutting production by 360,000 vehicles worldwide in September alone.\n\nNissan, which announced in mid-August that chip shortages would force it to close its huge factory in Smyrna, Tennessee, for two weeks until Aug. 30, now says the closure will last four weeks, until Sept. 13.\n\nThere is a little good news. Ford said its overall production rose to nearly 80% from July to August, although it\u2019s not clear how long that would last.",
