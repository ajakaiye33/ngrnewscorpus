          "title": "APC convention shaky, Buhari shuns govs, jets off to Belgium",
          "text": "The All Progressives Congress is on the verge of postponing its national convention for the third time following the inability of the governors to reach a consensus on who should be the next chairman of the APC and on the zoning of positions in the National Working Committee, The PUNCH has learnt.\n\nThis is just as the APC \u2013 for the second straight day \u2013 refused to sell forms to aspirants vying for several positions in the party.\n\nOn Tuesday, about six governors attempted to meet with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), over the planned convention of the APC.\n\nHowever, the governors arrived at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, only to learn that the meeting would no longer take place. Rather, the President only agreed to meet with two governors \u2013 Hope Uzodinma (Imo) and Yahaya Bello (Kogi) who had earlier scheduled a meeting with him over happenings in their states.\n\nThose who were unable to see the President included the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum and Ekiti state governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi; Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, Simon Lalong of Plateau State; Ben Ayade of Cross River; and Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna.\n\nAlthough the Presidency gave no official reason for the abrupt call-off, there were indications that Buhari\u2019s line-up of activities for the day was shortened due to his scheduled departure to Brussels, the Belgian capital, where he would participate in the EU-AU summit taking place from February 17 \u2013 18.\n\nIt remains unclear when the meeting was rescheduled for. But that would be on or after the President\u2019s return from Brussels on Saturday, precisely one week to the proposed APC convention date.\n\nAlso sighted were Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege and Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Ahmed Wase.\n\nFielding questions from correspondents after his meeting with the President, Governor Bello stressed the need for the North-Central to produce Buhari\u2019s successor saying the region is the most marginalised in the country.\n\nReacting to the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, an Igbo apex socio-cultural organisation clamouring for the zoning of the Presidency to the South-East, Bello observed that the North-Central had never produced the President or vice president of the country. He, therefore, argued that it is only fitting that the region is given the opportunity in 2023.\n\nAlso addressing State House reporters, Governor Uzodinma said the APC convention slated for Saturday next week is not sacrosanct. He, however, said there was no indication that the convention would not hold.\n\nThis is as he said the failure of the party to sell nomination forms for National Working Committee offices on Monday does not threaten the February 26 convention and the inner workings of the party because there are other means of electing party officers.\n\nAsked if the convention may still hold despite the delays, the Imo State Governor said, \u201cOf course, that is the decision of the party, and there is nothing wrong even if it doesn\u2019t hold. What is important is that we must have our convention. We have said it is the 26th, if for any reason tomorrow it is not doable in the opinion of the party, we will move. But that does not mean that there is any intention to move.\n\nOn the purpose of his visit to the President, Uzodinma said, \u201cI came in to meet with Mr President, to brief him on the various developments in Imo State, as it has to do with security and governance and I had a very quality audience with Mr President.\u201d\n\nIn a separate interview on Channels Television, Governor Ayade of Cross River said there was nothing sacrosanct about the February 26 date for the convention.\n\nHe, however, said the President would have the final say on zoning and other issues rocking the party.\n\nAyade said, \u201cIf there is a need for a little shift then it is allowed particularly when it is within the ambit of the law. But as of today, I have no indication that it will happen but the President will return and address this.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a top source in the APC told The PUNCH that the party was working on a \u201cunity list\u201d such that the party would not hold an open contest at the convention but would simply affirm the names on the list.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe tried to buy forms again today but we were told the APC is not selling. Some governors are trying to come up with a unity list, a sort of consensus. However, many stakeholders in the party are against this. So, some of these governors are trying to postpone the convention since they cannot have their way. That is what is happening now.\u201d\n\nAttempts to get a response from the Secretary of the APC Caretaker Committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, proved abortive as he did not respond to a text message on Tuesday. ,,\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "*Speaks on Otuaro\u2019s emergence as deputy gov, Tompolo\u2019s support for Okowa\n\nIjaw leader, Chief Edwin Clark, has said that he is not aware of any pact between Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa and the Ijaw nation to hand over power to the Ijaw in Delta South at the end of his tenure in 2023.\n\nThe Ijaw leader\u2019s statement is coming on the heels of reports claiming that Okowa, an Anioma man from Delta North, had a pact with the Ijaw of Delta South in 2015 to hand over power to an Ijaw in 2023.\n\nClark, who is the leader of Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and Chairman, Board of Trustees, Ijaw National Congress (INC), said he was neither a party to such pact nor aware of its existence.\n\nHe added that his support for Okowa in 2015 was not based on any pact but competence, equity, fair play, and the need for inclusiveness and unity in Delta State.\n\nThe Ijaw leader said: \u201cIt is not to my knowledge and I was never a party to an arrangement that Okowa should hand over to an Ijaw person at the end of his term and there was no working accord known to me.\n\n\u201cIt was not a part of the arrangement when I decided to support Dr Ifeanyi Okowa in 2015. It was not a matter between the Aniomas and the Ijaws. It was not based on any condition other than competence, equity and, fair play.\n\n\u201cSome of us championed the cause of Delta North producing the governor of Delta State in 2015 for inclusiveness and unity of the state.\u201d\n\nChief Clark further said: \u201cFor record purposes, I would like to mention how in 2014, His Majesty, Prof Edozien, the Asagba of Asaba, accompanied by 11 traditional rulers of Anioma extraction with Chief Benjamin Elue, former deputy governor of Delta State, as Anioma Congress secretary, came to pay me a visit, requesting that an Anioma indigene be considered for the governorship of Delta state in 2015, and to support them in their demand for Anioma State.\n\n\u201cProf Edozien after our discussions, invited me to Asaba, to attend a mega rally organised at the Cenotaph, Asaba. I was the guest of honour, in order to identify with the Anioma, I dressed in Anioma attire. When it was my turn to speak in reply to their address, I assured them that I will support their request, and will see that it is realised.\n\n\u201cAt a subsequent meeting, with the then governor of Delta State, Dr Emmanuel Uduaghan, I discussed the matter with him and we agreed that the Delta North should produce the gubernatorial candidate of PDP in 2015, for proper integration in the state.\n\n\u201cThat was the reason why we recommended Dr Steve Oru to replace Godsday Orubebe as a Minister representing Delta State in Dr Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s government, instead of Dr Cairo Ojougboh who is also from Anioma. Dr Ojougboh then took Dr Oru\u2019s position as the Vice Chairman of the PDP in South-South.\n\n\u201cI will like to state with the greatest respect that the main beneficiaries of these series of interactions is our competent and intelligent governor, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa, the incumbent Governor of Delta state\n\n\u201cIt is at this juncture that Government Ekpemupolo, alias Tompolo, came to me in Abuja, where we decided to adopt the candidature of Dr Ifeanyi Okowa.\n\n\u201cThe arrangement for Okowa to become PDP gubernatorial candidate in Delta State with Otuaro as his deputy was finally sealed in my house.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says he\u2019s focused on supporting FG\u2019s economic recovery drive\n\n\u2022Insists it is only God that anoints leaders\n\nBy Obinna Chima\n\nIn reaction to speculations around his purported interest in the 2023 presidential race which has seen stampede by vested parties and interest, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele yesterday said it was the prerogative of President Muhammadu Buhari to plan his succession plan in line with global best practice, for good governance and continuing peace and progress of the country.\n\nEmefiele also stressed that he remained focused on his job, even as he has pledged to continue supporting the Buhari-led federal government\u2019s economic recovery drive.\n\nThese formed part of a statement titled; Who is Afraid of Emefiele? from the group known as \u2018FRIENDS OF GODWIN EMEFIELE,\u2019 who disclosed that they met with the CBN governor to clarify his position on the 2023 presidential race.\n\nEmefiele, according to the group, also warned those that had resorted to all sorts of blackmail, sponsored articles and choreographed comments on social media targeted at tainting his image, impugning his character and legacy to desist from such act, stressing that it\u2019s God that anoints leaders and that he would leave his faith firmly in the hands of God.\n\nThe statement noted that in the past few weeks, there have been media reports on Emefiele\u2019s purported interest in the 2023 presidential race, leading to some interested parties and vested interests resorting to all sorts of blackmail, sponsored articles and choreographed comments on social media targeted at tainting Emefiele\u2019s image, impugning his character and legacy.\n\nIt pointed out that the negative attacks were being sponsored by those who see Emefiele as a major threat to their political ambition.\n\n\u201cTruth is Godwin Emefiele has not confirmed to anyone he is running for President even as he is constitutionally qualified to do so; he has been under pressure in the past few weeks as different groups have been putting up unsolicited campaign for his candidacy.\n\n\u201cOnly yesterday, as the speculation became widespread, a group of his friends under the aegis of FRIENDS OF GODWIN EMEFIELE met with him to clarify his position. Here is what he told us:\n\n\u201cThat he remains focused on his job and will continue supporting the Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government\u2019s economic recovery drive; that in his career trajectory, right from his days as a young banker, he never asked, nor lobbied for a job, he was invited by the Board of Directors to be the Chief Executive Officer/Group Managing Director of Zenith Bank as he was an integral part of the team, led by founder Jim Ovia, that transformed Zenith Bank from a start-up to one of Africa\u2019s largest banks with subsidiaries in Ghana, Sierra Leone, Gambia, South Africa, Dubai, China and the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nIt further pointed out that in 2014, President Goodluck Jonathan tapped him to be the CBN Governor, a job he didn\u2019t lobby for and in which his name was not among those being considered at that time and was not even from the geo-political zone that most people thought the job would go to as the president then was from same geopolitical zone with him.\n\nIt further quoted Emefiele to have said he, \u201cremains humbled by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decision to grant him an unprecedented second term as CBN Governor- again without lobbying.\u201d\n\n\u201cThus he will continue to remain loyal to him and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Mr. Emefiele told us that he believes it\u2019s the prerogative of President Muhammadu Buhari to plan his succession in line with global best practices for good governance for the continuing peace and progress of the federal republic of Nigeria, as such he will play his part to stabilise the economy for an orderly transition.\n\n\u201cAnd given that it\u2019s God that anoints leaders, he will leave his faith firmly in the hands of God. With these fundamental questions settled, it is imperative to address some of the lies and utter falsehood being peddled by blackmailers and political jobbers who see Godwin Emefiele as a threat to their ambition,\u201d it stated.\n\nHighlighting his achievements since he assumed office in June 2014, they noted that then, his task was huge and the challenges seemed insurmountable, adding that today he has calmed the waters and put Nigeria back on the path of growth.\n\n\u201cAs you will recall there was a sharp fall in crude oil prices from 2015, which led to significant revenue shortfalls in Nigeria where crude oil represents about 95 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s export revenue. This created major shock for the Nigerian economy, leading to a 13-month recession in 2016.\n\n\u201cIn comparison to the previous years before Emefiele became the CBN governor, the average price of crude oil from 2010 to 2014 was over $100/barrel and this fell to some $30 / barrel with high production costs of some $25/barrel.\n\n\u201cDespite these challenges Emefiele\u2019s monetary policies supported the Buhari administration and all 36 State governments, ensuring salaries were paid and much more was done, with much less, in infrastructure, steering Nigeria away from much worse outcomes while many oil producers like Kuwait, Russia, Angola and Brunei had longer lasting recessions between of 20 \u2013 60 months,\u201d it stated.\n\nAdditionally, FRIENDS OF EMEFIELE urged critics to also understand that the second recession the country entered into in 2020 was as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThen, the global economy (Nigeria inclusive) was plunged into recession because of the pandemic which was unprecedented. It led to declines in economic activities and lockdown across the world.\n\nThey pointed out that countries such as the United States had their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) falling in 2020 by -31 per cent in the second quarter (Q2) of that year; the United Kingdom by -19.4 per cent in Q2; European Union by -14.1 per cent in Q2 and Nigeria, with deft response of the CBN had -6.1 per cent in Q2.\n\n\u201cAs we all know the CBN supported fiscal authorities in the following areas. N100 billion health sector credit facility for operators in the sector. Today, Nigeria boasts of two world-class cancer centres in Lagos and medical tourism has reduced.\n\n\u201cA one-year extension of a moratorium on principal repayments for CBN intervention facilities; the reduction of the interest rate on intervention loans from nine per cent to five per cent; strengthening of the loan-to-deposit ratio policy (i.e. stepped up enforcement of directive to extend more credit to the private sector),\u201d it stated.\n\nThe group listed other measures introduced by the Emefiele-led CBN to include the creation of N400 billion target credit facility for affected households and small and medium enterprises; granting regulatory forbearance to banks to restructure terms of facilities in affected sectors; improving FX supply to the CBN by directing oil companies and oil servicing companies to sell FX to the CBN rather than the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and additional N100 billion intervention fund in healthcare loans to pharmaceutical companies and healthcare practitioners intending to expand/build capacity.\n\nThe group added: \u201cDespite the challenges, the CBN under Emefiele has in the last seven years maintained a developmental-oriented approach in supporting the federal government to address challenges across various sectors of the economy and has initiated far-reaching reforms.\n\n\u201cOne issue the critics have continued to raise is the issue of the rice pyramid which was recently unveiled in Abuja. But these arm chair critics have failed to understand that through the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP), an initiative that was introduced by the Emefiele-led CBN, the lives of a lot of rural farmers have been transformed.\n\n\u201cThe rice pyramid which had taken place previously in Minna, Kebbi, Gombe, Ekiti and Abuja, showed how Emefiele has used agriculture to support the federal government\u2019s wars on insecurity.\n\n\u201cThe rice pyramids were build bag by bag in all the states the programme had been launched since December 2020, when it was first launched in Minna, Niger State. The programme held last month to unveil the world\u2019s largest rice pyramid in Abuja was also an initiative of the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN).\u201d\n\nIt noted that from an average yield of 1.8 metric tonnes per hectare in the pre-ABP era, the initiative has increased the country\u2019s average yield per hectare for rice paddy and maize to about five metric tonnes per hectare.\n\nAdditionally, there has been a significant reduction in the country\u2019s rice import bill, from a monstrous $1.05 billion prior to November 2015, to the current figure of $18.50 million, annually, the group noted.\n\n\u201cEmefiele also spearheaded the creation of the Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID), an initiative that brought all the private sector business leaders under an umbrella in the fight against the spread of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThis was why in its latest Article IV Consultation released in February 2022, the International Monetary Fund praised Nigeria\u2019s effort in fighting the spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cThere are many other measures announced by the CBN Governor which will be detailed in due course like the support to Technology, Digital innovation, the Creative Industries and the 15 Trillion Infrastructure corporation recently launched.\n\n\u201cApparently, those behind the sponsored negative reports are afraid of Emefiele\u2019s towering personality and service to Nigeria. But they must understand that he cannot be stampeded any way. He is focused on delivering the mandate of the Central Bank; he is rebuilding the economy of the country through import substitution policies and using agriculture to create a new rural middle class from ground up.\n\n\u201cThose who continue to criticise the rice pyramid are too ashamed of giving glory to whom it is due. Emefiele is focused on his unfinished job and should not be distracted,\u201d the statement added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A United States Professor and columnist, Farooq Kperogi says the erstwhile loyalists of the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu have lost respect for him.\n\nKperogi was reacting to the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola's mockery of Tinubu.\n\nOne of President Muhammadu Buhari's ministers, Aregbesola had on Monday while addressing APC members in Ijebu-jesa, described his successor, Gboyega Oyetola as the most \u201cuseless and corrupt governor to ever rule the state.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe minister also attacked Tinubu, saying the same treatment meted out to a former Lagos State governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, which foreclosed his re-election bid in 2019, would be visited on Oyetola.\n\nAlthough in the video, Aregbesola did not mention the APC presidential aspirant\u2019s name, he made insinuations that the former Lagos governor was responsible for the political situation in Osun, including how he has abused his leadership and suddenly assumed the god complex.\n\nAregbesola while castigating Tinubu also said, \u201cWon ti n to ara\u201d, meaning \u201cthey\u2019re already peeing themselves\".\n\nThis comes a few days after the APC leader was seen in a viral video with suspected pee stains on his attire during a visit to the Awujale of Ijebuland.\n\nKperogi in a Twitter post described the inner caucus of the former Lagos governor as \u201ctraitors\".\n\n\u201cIt appears like Tinubu's previously impregnable political base has now totally collapsed. He has lost his mystique & is now openly challenged and even mocked by previous loyalists such as Rauf Aregbesola.\n\n\u201cHis inner circle is peopled by 'traitors' who habitually leak unflattering info to the public about his health struggles.\n\n\u201cAnd his PR team is a crying disaster of ineptitude. Well, every beginning has an end. I think this is the end for Tinubu, but it's an embarrassing end.\u201d\n\n",

          "title": "Facebook under fire for poor treatment of African content moderators",
          "text": "Meta-owned Facebook has come under fire for the treatment of African content moderators according to a recent TIME article.\n\nTIME revealed that content moderators in Nairobi were subject to poor pay and working conditions by Sama, a company responsible for Facebook\u2019s Sub-Saharan Africa content moderation since 2019. Sama also provides data labeling services for tech giants like Google, Microsoft.\n\nIn 2021, Facebook said it spent more than $5 billion on safety measures. It contracts the services of more than 15,000 content moderators globally, most of whom are employed by third-parties like Sama.\n\n\u201cThe work that we do is a kind of mental torture,\u201d one employee, who currently works as a Facebook content moderator for Sama, told TIME. \u201cWhatever I am living on is hand-to-mouth. I can\u2019t save a cent. Sometimes I feel I want to resign. But then I ask myself: what will my baby eat?\u201d\n\nThese working conditions led 6 Ethiopians to resign in January. Recall that Facebook is struggling to reduce the influence of content on its platform which is leading to real-world violence in Ethiopia. According to TIME, at least two Sama content moderators resigned after being diagnosed with mental illnesses including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. Many others described how they had been traumatized by the work but were unable to obtain formal diagnoses due to their inability to afford access to quality mental healthcare. Some described continuing with work despite trauma because they had no other options.\n\nIn the summer of 2019, instead of negotiating when content moderators threatened to strike unless they were given better pay and working conditions, Sama responded by flying two highly-paid executives from San Francisco to Nairobi to deal with the uprising.\n\nSouth African Daniel Motaung, the attempted strike\u2019s leader who was in the process of formally filing trade union papers, was fired shortly after. He was accused by Sama of taking action that would put the relationship between the company and Facebook at \u201cgreat risk.\u201d Sama told other participants in the labor action effort that they were expendable and said they should either resign or get back to work, several employees told TIME. The workers abandoned the protest before the seven days were up, and there was no pay increase.\n\nSama denied that there was any strike or labor action.\n\nAccording to payslips seen by TIME, Sama pays foreign employees monthly pre-tax salaries of around 60,000 Kenyan shillings ($528), which includes a monthly bonus for relocating from elsewhere in Africa. After tax, this equates to around $440 per month, or a take-home wage of roughly $2.20 per hour, based on a 45-hour work week. Sama employees from within Kenya, who are not paid the monthly relocation bonus, receive a take-home wage equivalent to around $1.46 per hour after tax.\n\nThe average salary at Sama including benefits was approximately 2.5 times the Kenyan minimum wage, according to a 2021 study carried out by three MIT researchers. But these wages only cover the basic costs of living, workers say, and don\u2019t allow them to save or improve their financial situations.\n\nEmployees also complained of working long hours\u2014up to nine hours per day including breaks, and their screen time is monitored. According to several copies of Sama content moderators\u2019 performance reviews, TIME revealed that the moderators were measured against target metrics for average time spent and quality. This evidence contradicts the public statement that Facebook has made about not setting expectations on its contractors.\n\n\u201cA common misconception about content reviewers is that they\u2019re driven by quotas and pressured to make hasty decisions,\u201d Ellen Silver, Facebook\u2019s vice president of operations, said in a 2018 blog post. \u201cLet me be clear: content reviewers aren\u2019t required to evaluate any set number of posts \u2026 We encourage reviewers to take the time they need.\u201d\n\nA Meta spokesperson, Ben Walters, corroborated this statement.\n\nThe Social media giant has also put some features in place to help protect moderators, like the option to render videos in black and white or add blurring. But one Sama employee said he doesn\u2019t use these options because of the pressure to meet quotas. \u201cHow can you clearly see whether content is violating or not unless you can see it clearly? If it\u2019s black and white or blurred, I cannot tell,\u201d the employee said. \u201cSome people use the option, but I don\u2019t. Because if I wrongly action that [content], I will be marked down.\u201d\n\nThis report adds to a seemingly endless series of public controversies relating to Facebook in recent years. Despite claiming innocence in this case, it\u2019s imperative the social media giant holds its contractors like Sama to higher standards or else its name will be dragged in the mud.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "YC\u2019s backing of its first Namibian startup shows investors are paying attention to the country",
          "text": "When the COVID lockdown was announced in March 2020, people stampeded shops to buy many months\u2019 worth of food and supplies to the extent that many economies experienced shortages with food products, medical materials, toilet paper, and even home workout equipment. The lockdown was the closest thing to an apocalypse most people had experienced up to that point, and they wanted to be prepared.\n\nIn Namibia, the pandemic also affected retail shops. The government had locked down the country without making adequate palliative plans to support its people during the period. Taxis didn\u2019t run and shop owners couldn\u2019t transport themselves to and fro their suppliers for goods.\n\nIn the midst of the crisis, it soon became apparent that Namibia had a broken supply chain.\n\nOne man, David Akinin, who once worked in the construction industry as a founder, decided to intervene. He loaded his truck with food and essential supplies and drove around, selling them to people\u2014a sort of mobile retail shop. They were grateful for his intervention. But it wasn\u2019t enough; informal shops needed to reopen.\n\nAkinin\u2019s idea to provide food and essentials to people during lockdown gave birth to a company\u2014Jabu. \u201cWhen you\u2019re building something and people start thanking you for it, you know you\u2019ve found something great,\u201d Akinin told TechCabal on a call.\n\nJabu partnered with local and multinational suppliers to deliver their goods directly to informal retailers across Namibia. In the process, they faced a challenge: it was difficult to locate retailers who didn\u2019t have registered or verified addresses. The startup then worked with local community leaders to register retailers in their area and log the GPS location of each shop in the Jabu app. Within 2 weeks they identified the location of 1,000 shops.\n\nHeadquartered in Namibia, with operations in Zambia, Jabu is a data-driven e-commerce startup that helps small retailers with sourcing products and inventory management. Its platform connects over 6,000 retailers to local and international suppliers; and digitises their orders, payments, and logistics. The startup currently operates out of 5 cities and 9 sites.\n\nMid-2021, Jabu raised $3.2 million in seed funding, led by Afore Capital, with participation from Y Combinator, FJ Labs, Quiet Capital, Kli Capital, Pareto Capital, and unnamed angel investors.\n\nThe funding makes Jabu the first Namibian startup to be backed by YC.\n\nSceptical investors\n\nAkinin, who is founder and CEO of Jabu, is originally from Venezuela but has lived in Namibia for 9 years. When he got on the call with TechCabal, he was outdoors, seated in a veranda overlooking vibrant greenery. He was in Zambia, he said, where Jabu had opened an office in November last year. He would later reveal that it had been raining a lot in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, affecting Jabu\u2019s fleet operations.\n\nThe supply chain problem Jabu has set out to solve is a thorny one, and the solution it is building is critical to economic development. Yet, for a long time, the startup struggled to attract investment. \u201cOur first challenge was getting investors to recognise the country,\u201d Akinin said. \u201cI\u2019m sure a lot of people, on their first call, looked up Namibia on the map!\u201d\n\nInvestors Akinin approached were concerned about Jabu\u2019s potential to scale in Namibia, a country whose economy went into recession in 2016 and has been struggling to recover ever since.\n\nAt the onset of the pandemic, the African Development Bank Group (ADBG) projected that the Namibian economy would shrink by 7.9% in 2020, due to an expected decline in activity in mining, agriculture, construction, hospitality, and tourism. Post-lockdown, the decline actually happened. Namibia\u2019s GDP dropped by 8.5% in 2020, and the population of its poor has now hit a record high of 1.6 million persons.\n\nNow, although the economy is expected to make a rebound, albeit a slow one\u2014with growth projected at 1.2% in 2021 and 2.4% in 2022\u2014one can see that the country has had a rough few years, which may have caused it to miss out on the Great Venture Capitalist Influx Africa has recorded in the last 3\u20134 years.\n\nMoreover, it is well known that venture capitalists (VC) channel most of their African investment towards startups in South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, and Kenya. These countries\u2014dubbed the Big Four\u2014are Africa\u2019s busiest tech markets; compared to them, Namibia has a tiny population\u20142.5 million persons, where Nigeria has 206 million, Egypt 102 million, South Africa 59 million, and Kenya 53 million.\n\nAnd so, it is against this backdrop that investors were concerned about Jabu\u2019s scalability. Their recurring question was whether Namibia could produce a startup that could be worth $100 million in returns, and Akinin\u2019s answer\u2014precise each time\u2014was yes.\n\n\u201cA huge responsibility\u201d\n\nReflecting on Jabu being the first Namibian startup to be backed by YC, Akinin said, \u201cIt feels like such a huge responsibility, for us, towards an ecosystem that has been trying, for a long time, to raise awareness about the great things happening in Namibia. But it\u2019s a good opportunity to bring people into the Namibian ecosystem and onto our platform. It\u2019s inspiration for other companies still pushing hard and hoping to get more money this year.\u201d\n\nAkinin believes that the Namibian startup scene will get more funding attention now because there is an \u201can openness to innovation\u201d from both local founders and investors. \u201cInvestors around the world are opening their eyes to the understanding that there is opportunity in Namibia. I served as an ambassador of what\u2019s happening on the ground and was fortunate to have been able to share that story with investors.\u201d\n\nA tale of 2 countries\n\nFor a young startup, Akinin and his team remain undaunted by the challenges associated with operating in 2 different markets. For starters, they are dealing with unstable infrastructure in both Zambia and Namibia. And while there are frequent power outages in Lusaka, unlike in Windhoek, in both countries, more than half of Jabu\u2019s customers are in places without tarred roads, making logistics difficult: \u201cYou can see why the supply chain does not exist, in the first place,\u201d Akinin said. \u201cBecause there are no roads to the places we need to reach. We\u2019ve had to map roads that didn\u2019t exist previously in order to create a route to market.\u201d\n\nIn Lusaka, incessant rains have made movement on potholed roads near-impossible\u2014\u201cIt has got to the point where I\u2019m willing to invest in paving the road in front of our warehouse, just so that our vehicles can move smoothly.\u201d\n\nHe described Lusaka as a \u201cbillboard city\u201d but is unsure yet how to leverage that fact for Jabu\u2019s growth in the country. \u201cThere\u2019s advertising everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cMarketing and branding are a really different experience to what we have in Windhoek. We\u2019re very excited about getting to know it and taking some learnings from it back to Namibia.\u201d\n\nOn to the next round\n\nAfrican e-commerce startups have recorded an impressive spike in VC funding since 2019, raising nearly $90 million dollars in 2020, up from $47.5 million in 2019. Between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021, the total value of raises by e-commerce startups hit $140 million. The spike in funding may have been triggered by the lockdown, as the pandemic emphasised the gaps in the supply chain of many industries, forcing e-commerce entrepreneurs to innovate around the problem.\n\nFollowing its raise last year, Jabu is looking to expand to other countries in Southern Africa\u2014Botswana, South Africa, Lesotho, and Eswatini. The path to this expansion is still being developed and fine-tuned by the team. For now, however, Akinin\u2019s focus is on raising for Series A and consolidating his company\u2019s operations in Zambia.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from education, there is probably no other industry that contributes as much to the development of a society like healthcare. Unhealthy individuals can\u2019t build businesses, fight for good governance, or create life-changing innovations. So it\u2019s no surprise that some of the poorest countries in the world have the worst quality of healthcare.\n\nBefore it was stopped in 2000, the highest-ranked African country in the World Health Organization\u2019s health system rankings was Morocco in 29th position. Tunisia, the next in the continent, was in 52nd place. Not much has changed in the 21 years since. A report by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) described healthcare in Africa as the worst globally, with 50% of healthcare expenditure out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nMuch like the education sector, developments in Africa\u2019s healthcare space are driven by the private sector as underfunded public health facilities struggle to meet demand. In South Africa, one healthtech startup is helping South Africans access drugs and health advice using their phones. I sat down with one of the startup\u2019s co-founders \u2013 Healthdart \u2013 to learn more about its operations.\n\nMission-driven entrepreneurship\n\nIn the early 2000s, South Africa had an HIV crisis on its hands. About to get into the university, Njabulo Skhosana decided to study pharmacology at the University of Liverpool. The plan was to learn how he could help stem the tide, but he took a different route with stints at Bupa, Deloitte, and Discovery Health. The one constant thing in all these jobs was healthcare.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn May 2020, just a few weeks after the government imposed lockdowns in South Africa, he quit his job as the Chief of Staff to the CEO at Discovery Health to build Healthdart \u2013 a one-stop-shop for primary health care services.\n\nBringing primary health care closer to the people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthdart co-founders, L-R, Yauvan Hansraj (CTO), Njabulo Skhosana (CEO), and Tshwanelo Matsane (CPO). Source: Healthdart\n\nMost plans to improve healthcare in Africa are focused on secondary care, with primary healthcare often an afterthought. As a result, most Africans ignore symptoms of ill health until they get really serious. The disadvantage of this approach is that conditions that could have been prevented or treated early may now be too advanced for the patient to get help.\n\nHealthdart\u2019s solution uses an app to provide a platform where users can place orders for their drugs and have them delivered at less than the cost of the cheapest two-way bus ride (R30 or $1.99) in South African townships. Customers can choose to pay using electronic funds transfer before they receive the drugs or at the point of exchange using a card or cash.\n\nOne might ask what is so special about providing an avenue for patients to order and have their drugs delivered to them where they choose. Let me paint a picture. Imagine that you had a cold and got a prescription from a doctor; however, you have to journey to the nearest pharmacy to get the medication because there are no pharmacies close to you.\n\nAssuming you had a job and this happened during the week, you would have to take some time off from work to get your prescription. If you\u2019re fortunate, you could get your boss to give you the time you need. Yet, even with permission, people living in South Africa\u2019s townships have to take long and often stressful journeys without an assurance that they will get the drugs they need.\n\nAnd this is where Healthdart steps in. The startup does not just deliver drugs to patients; it also facilitates virtual and physical consultations with doctors and nurses. Consequently, the startup can provide comprehensive access to primary health care services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthdart delivers its solution via an app and yet targets middle-income neighbourhoods. With less disposable income, this society is less likely to have a smartphone, and I was curious to know how Healthdart intends to reach them.\n\n\u201cI think if you asked me that question five years ago, we would not have been able to start the business. Right now, we find that people can get basic android phones at low prices within the South African market,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis reply corresponds to a 2020 report from the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) that claims that the smartphone penetration in South Africa stands at ~91%. Even with that, the startup ensures that at 17 megabytes, the app is light enough to run on low-end smartphones while it uses WhatsApp to complement its customer service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthdart\u2019s solution is not novel, and there are startups across Africa that either offer a platform for patients to order drugs or speak with a physician. Still, Skhosana argues that Healthdart provides more than convenience to its customers.\n\n\u201cA huge part of our value proposition is reducing the total cost of care, and that is very different from what our competitors do. In most cases, the focus is on convenience, almost like trying to create an UberEats for medicine. But we see our role as a lot more integral to the person\u2019s lifestyle and just trying to make it as easy and affordable as possible for them to access the right level of healthcare that they need.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future\n\nSince its launch, Healthdart has primarily focused on a few South African townships. However, it plans to add more townships and cities to the areas it currently covers before exploring possible expansion options. In this time, the startup has facilitated more than 1,000 medication orders and health consultations across Johannesburg.\n\nInitially incubated in the Founders Factory Africa, it has also raised money from BFA Global\u2019s Catalyst Fund as it moves towards building a one-stop-shop for primary healthcare service in Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Or at least that\u2019s what Olufunmi thinks every time she ventures out from her house in the hinterlands of Ikorodu.\n\nFor example, Funmi entered a bus going to Ikeja last Saturday.\n\n\u201cEnter with your change o,\u201d called the conductor in a loud, whiny voice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have change o. It\u2019s \u20a6500 I have,\u201d Funmi told him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOya enter like that.\u201d\n\nWhen it was time to get her change, the conductor paired her with another passenger. To worsen matters, she never got to her destination because the driver\u2019s brakes failed and the bus rammed into another car.\n\nReally, Lagos is not a real place.\n\nFunmi\u2019s semi-fictional story is reminiscent of the average Lagosian\u2019s experience on Lagos roads. From the bad roads to the rickety buses to the uncouth drivers and conductors to the abysmal customer service.\n\nWhile the introduction of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) buses has been a much-needed respite, a 2021 Danne Institute for Research Report reveals that Lagosians lose 14.2 million hours per day to traffic congestion caused, in part, by bad roads. It also cost the Lagos government \u20a64 trillion ($96 million).\n\nApart from these challenges, security issues leading to tales of one chance, armed robbery, and petty theft abound.\n\nWhile infrastructure challenges like bad roads and some aspects of security are pretty out of the reach of the average Nigerian entrepreneur to solve, we\u2019ve seen several startups, including Shuttlers, GIG Mobility, and Treepz, try to tackle different parts of the problem.\n\nNewcomer, Transtura, is making its play into Nigeria\u2019s mobility and logistics space. One of five nominees in the Newbie of the Year category of Techpoint Awards 2021, the startup founded by Vincent Adeoba and two other friends, was launched last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe talked to Adeoba and discussed Transtura\u2019s journey, its recent acquisition of fintech startup, W\u00e0z\u00f3 money, and the future.\n\nTurning lemons into lemonade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrasnstura Co-founders. L-R: Vincent Adeyemo, Vincent Adeoba, and Olajide Philips\n\nIn 2017, Vincent Adeoba started a job as a Graduate Intern with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). He had just finished his one-year mandatory youth service and had also just bought a car.\n\nEarning just above \u20a6100,000 ($299)* monthly, he took his mentor\u2019s advice and rented the car to someone who used it as an Uber at a weekly rental of \u20a630,000 ($90). It would start him on his journey in the transport and logistics sector and the eventual founding of Transtura.\n\nIn 2019, Adeoba got capital from friends and family and acquired 13 vehicles to expand the car rental business. However, 2020 came in with the COVID-19 pandemic and brought things to a standstill for him. But, he soon found a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n\u201cI discovered that despite the restriction in movement, some of these shuttle mini-buses were still allowed to work. So I started divesting my investments in buying those vehicles for Uber, and I started researching about these shuttle mini-buses.\n\n\u201cWith my research and data available to me, I even discovered that in terms of return on investment and the capital outlay required for the buses, they are even better than Uber. Sometimes, for Uber, you won\u2019t get your capital outlay back until almost two years, even before making a profit. With these buses, capital outlay could be gotten in a year and six months.\u201d\n\nPutting in \u20a61.3 million ($3,421)**, he got the first bus and, within nine months, had acquired 14 more buses using his tried and trusted family and friends route.\n\nBut he soon began to think about other issues like safety and convenience for the user. On October 18, 2021, the Transtura app was officially launched.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing the business in a traditional way, but I was just thinking, \u2018how can we bring in technology to improve commuters\u2019 experience, to provide safety, to provide comfort, and at the same time, to redefine the way people see intra-city commuting in Lagos?\u2019\u201d\n\nCurrently, the app is available on the Google Play Store and will soon be available on the App Store. For now, iOS users can use its web app.\n\nTranstura has three routes: Iyana Oworo to Victoria Island, Yaba to Victoria Island, and Abraham Adesanya to CMS.\n\nBringing in Co-founders Vincent Adeyemo \u2014 a lawyer friend he had met in school \u2014 and Olajide Philips, the trio\u2019s Transtura journey began.\n\nWhat are the metrics?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Adeoba, Transtura has received little funding from the outside world. However, the company is also backed by Tekedia Capital and is looking to raise its pre-seed round.\n\nWith only three routes, he says the company can barely meet demand and has 2,500 active users. The business model, while not new, is different from what typically obtains.\n\n\u201cWhat we do is we pay drivers a salary to drive the buses for us.\u201d\n\nThey had initially planned to use a rent-to-own model, but they chose their current model to protect the brand and prevent issues associated with hire purchase or rent-to-own agreements.\n\n\u201cWhen you give people an asset to use on a rent-to-own basis or on hire purchase in this part of the world, they start seeing themselves as the owners of that asset from the first day you give it to them. And you have little to no control again.\u201d\n\nThere are plans to change the model to a more Uber-like model, probably partly because of the current challenge with the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW). According to Adeoba, every day, they have to pay \u20a61,000 to \u20a61,500 to NURTW agents on the road for each bus; sometimes, they pay per trip.\n\nIt\u2019s quite tough running a business in this manner, but he says they\u2019ve been able to deal with it using some level of tact and street smarts.\n\n\u201cWe told them what we are trying to do, and we were able to paint a very good picture to show that we are not competing with them.\u201d\n\nDriving new ways to shop and travel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Transtura and W\u00e0z\u00f3 team\n\nWhen the Central Bank of Nigeria first introduced its cashless policy in 2012, 65 out of 100 Nigerians transacted in cash.\n\nFast forward a couple of years, and while alternative payment channels have gained some momentum, cash is still king.\n\nEssentially, many everyday transactions like paying for a bus or buying tomatoes in the market are still cash-based. However, in Lagos State, Touch and Pay\u2019s Cowry card is changing the mobility game with its contactless cards.\n\nWith its acquisition of W\u00e0z\u00f3 for an undisclosed fee, Transtura\u2019s digital payment plans require some attention.\n\nFounded in 2021 by Stephen Ilori and Abudu Ridwan Olatunbosun, W\u00e0z\u00f3 is a payments service company that deals with bill payments. From what Adeoba told Techpoint Africa, this acquisition marks Transtura\u2019s entry into the digital payments and eCommerce space.\n\n\u201cAfter three months of our operations on the road, we discovered that beyond providing vehicles to people and providing the extra comfort and safety, the biggest opportunity in the transportation ecosystem is actually in payments.\n\n\u201cWe want to get into digital payments where people can have a universal wallet. So either you\u2019re riding with Transtura, or you\u2019re riding with the normal danfo, or you are even travelling outside the state, you will be able to use your Transtura wallet to make payments to the vendors and the drivers.\u201d\n\nAlongside the wallet, Adeoba says the company is looking to launch a marketplace for drivers to buy spare parts and other vehicle-related goods. They would be able to pay for this using their Transtura wallet.\n\nFor the passenger, payment would be made by scanning a QR code placed at strategic points in the vehicle. However, this has a familiar ring to it.\n\nIn 2019, we wrote about a new startup, named Gona, trying to make transport transactions cashless using QR codes.\n\nAdeoba says Transtura is quite different for several reasons, one of which is the company\u2019s plan to make its product an enterprise solution (B2B) rather than B2C for now. He also believes that the ancillary services, which come with the wallet, like the marketplace and an expense management card, give it a leg to stand on in terms of a revenue model.\n\nAs part of its B2B solution, an expense card would be given to each driver for expenses like fuel and minor but necessary vehicle maintenance while on the road. The card can be set to a particular spending limit each day and helps business owners keep track of money spent.\n\nMuch of this solution is targeted at large-scale mobility and logistics companies.\n\nThere are also plans to launch its Flexi Hire feature, which would enable persons to charter buses for different uses. This is also targeted at traditional transport businesses.\n\nThese features should be launched before the end of March 2022 and could provide a gateway to a new dispensation.\n\n*Average dollar exchange rate in 2017\n\n**Average dollar exchange rate in 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello, people\n\nHow was St Valentine\u2019s Day? Did you spend it with your loved one(s)? Or were you a dogged soldier and kept on coding, writing, designing, and building stuff? Mine had a mixture of everything plus more. While the Nigerian government\u2019s ICT ministry entered a new relationship, I probably fractured one with my big mouth.\n\nYes, you heard that right; Nigeria\u2019s Ministry of Communications and the Digital Economy has entered a partnership with the European Union (EU) to aid Nigeria\u2019s digital transformation. The EU plans to invest \u20ac820 million ($927 million) under its global gateway initiative.\n\nThey reportedly plan to invest in digital infrastructure, digitalisation of public services, digital entrepreneurship, digital skills, and digital governance. Yes, the Nigerian government needs all the help it can get. I mean, it only just recovered from the breakdown of its digital identity management platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides the ID management platform, several Nigerian public websites were affected by a \u201ctechnical glitch\u201d, so we hope the additional millions will help shore some of these glitches. The partnership terms are not clear, but let\u2019s hope it yields fruits, and none of the parties has a big mouth like mine.\n\nMoving on, Let\u2019s talk about:\n\nAirtel\u2019s strategic appointment\n\nStitch\u2019s plan to connect Africa\n\nRemedial\u2019s plan to digitise Nigerian pharmacies.\n\nAirtel makes a strategic hire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlubayo Adekanmbi. Vice President, Airtel Africa. Source: TechEconomy\n\nSometimes, big business moves start with statements of intent. Actions that tell the world that you\u2019re not playing games. Three days ago, Airtel Africa made one of such big statements, as it poached one of MTN\u2019s executives, Bayo Adekanmbi, to become its Vice President.\n\nAccording to Airtel, Adekanmbi will be \u201cresponsible for leading strategic business-wide initiatives, including innovation, strategic investment, operational efficiencies, and partnerships. In addition to this, he is also responsible for delivering Airtel Africa\u2019s Group Sustainability.\u201d\n\nSome context: Adekanmbi served with MTN Nigeria and South Africa for 14 years, and it worked in various critical roles across strategy, marketing, and management. Before joining Airtel, he was MTN Nigeria\u2019s Chief Strategy Officer. He is also the founder of Data Science Nigeria (DSN), a non-profit focused on scaling AI research and knowledge in Nigeria.\n\nWhy this is interesting: So far, MTN has dominated Nigeria\u2019s telecom space. It is Nigeria\u2019s largest telecom services provider in terms of voice and data subscribers and network coverage.\n\nIn the last quarter of 2021, MTN\u2019s revenue ($1.07 billion), more than doubled Airtel\u2019s ($476 million). Consequently, like other Nigerian telcos, Airtel has significant ground to make up if it plans to get close to MTN.\n\nIn previous years, we\u2019ve enjoyed data wars, an analysis of Internet subscriber growth using data from Nigeria\u2019s telecom regulators, but MTN and Airtel\u2019s financial reports offer deeper insights that we can\u2019t wait to explore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Airtel\u2019s Adekanmbi\u2019s appointment screams game on, but what other moves might we expect in 2022?\n\nStitch raises $21 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStitch Team. Source: Supplied\n\nNo one needs to mention that Africa\u2019s fintech space grows in leaps and bounds. You would be hard-pressed to find a week when an African fintech didn\u2019t raise money. Prove me wrong; I dare you.\n\nYou could, however, miss the different dimensions fintechs are taking, in response to market needs.\n\nToday, API-fintech startups are building the infrastructure for financial data, which is becoming increasingly important.\n\nTo start the week, South African API-fintech startup, Stitch, has raised $21 million Series A to build its API infrastructure and a financial graph ecosystem for Africa.\n\nWhat does Stitch do? Like most fintech infrastructure companies, it helps businesses build, optimise and scale their products using APIs connected to players in a country\u2019s financial sector.\n\nFor example, it could help facilitate communication between your Wallet app or savings app and your commercial bank.\n\nWhile the likes of Plaid, Tink, and Belvo lead the way in the US, Europe, and Latin America, respectively, Africa\u2019s fintech API space is replete with players like Mono, Okra, OnePipe, and US-based Pngme.\n\nInteresting point: Stitch defines its planned financial graph as a platform that will let businesses write code once, launch, and scale in multiple markets. Yes, it will facilitate communication between fintechs and banks across numerous African countries.\n\nThe big picture: Achieving interoperability in a heavily regulated industry is difficult enough in one country, but to do it in multiple African countries? That\u2019s on a whole new level.\n\nTravel, remittance, and trade are still fraught with severe challenges within Africa. Hundreds of African Union meetings and a fully ratified free trade agreement has not changed much. Don\u2019t forget sub-regional trade deals from the EU and the US.\n\nThere\u2019s hope: Systemic problems can, sometimes, create entrepreneurial openings, as we saw with Norebase, so let\u2019s keep our fingers crossed for Stitch\u2019s success.\n\nStitch raises $21M for its API infrastructure and embedded finance platform.

Source: Supplied\n\nIn 2010, NAFDAC introduced the Mobile Authentication Service (MAS) scheme to get customers involved in countering counterfeit and substandard medical products. By sending a one-time PIN, hidden behind a silver panel on a product packet, to a short code, a customer can know if a product is genuine or fake.\n\nThis measure was expedient because pharmacies and patent medicine stores stock substandard products on purpose or by accident. In the latter case, the business would start looking for credible suppliers and pharmaceutical companies to minimise such situations.\n\nAs usual, tech startups are here to the rescue.\n\nRecently admitted into the Winter 2022 cohort of US-accelerator, YCombinator, and closed a $1 million pre-seed round is Remedial Health, a Nigerian healthtech startup that develops digital solutions to reduce the supply of substandard health products to pharmacies and medicine stores.\n\nLed by Global Venture \u2014 that invested in TeamApt and Helium Health \u2014 and Ventures Platform, also invested in this round are Ingressive Capital, Voltron Capital, an Angel syndicate fund by Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d AGboola, Victor Asemota, and Opeyemi Awoyemi. Interestingly, this is over 80% participation from African VCs and angel investors.\n\nThe two-year-old startup intends to direct this fund into rolling out its digital procurement and patient medication records (PMR platforms and also support its By-Now-Pay-Later\n\nRead more: YC-backed Remedial Health raises $1 million pre-seed to digitize pharmacies in Nigeria\n\nIn case you missed it on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat Valentine\u2019s Day could look like in the Metaverse and Web3 era.

          "title": "For first time, investors dump Nigeria Eurobonds despite oil rally",
          "text": "At no point in Nigeria\u2019s history, since the discovery of oil, has a rally in oil prices failed to resonate with foreign investors until now, but that\u2019s what you get when you are the world\u2019s most inefficient spender.\n\nAfrica\u2019s top oil producer is increasingly becoming less of an oil economy and more of one that will continue to struggle irrespective of rising oil prices due to an ever-growing petrol subsidy bill that has wiped out the gains of the oil price.\n\nBusinessDay, in a detailed analysis Tuesday, demonstrated how even a $100 per barrel oil price will mean nothing for Nigeria, whose external reserves, currency, and government revenues are declining despite higher oil prices.\n\nThe trend has now extended to the country\u2019s Eurobonds.\n\nThe yields on eight of 13 Nigerian Eurobonds have jumped this year, a sign of increased risk perception by investors.\n\nThe price of the last Eurobond issued is down by a record 12 percent, according to data from the trading platform, FMDQ, while the yield has jumped to 10 percent from 8 percent when it was first issued in September.\n\nA falling bond price/rising yield is often associated with higher risk consideration while a rising bond price/falling yield is a sign of strong investor appetite.\n\nSince the said $1.25 billion 30-year Eurobond was issued in September 2021, oil prices have increased by 28 percent to $92 per barrel as of February 15.\n\nTypically, Nigeria\u2019s Eurobonds do well when oil prices increase. For instance, it took a resurgent oil price in January 2021 for Nigeria\u2019s Eurobonds to recover from an all-time low in March 2020, when oil prices bottomed amid the COVID-19 pandemic and Eurobond yields hit a record 12 percent.\n\nRead also: First time for Nigeria, $100 oil price means nothing\n\n\u201cIt is very abnormal for Nigeria\u2019s Eurobond yields to rise when oil prices are rising, it just goes to show Nigeria is becoming less of an oil economy due to the growing petrol subsidy bill,\u201d notes Egie Akpata, a director at investment bank, UCML.\n\nNigeria\u2019s reliance on petrol imports has always made higher oil prices a double-edged sword due to the petrol subsidy, but the cost of that practice has hit a record-high and lingering challenges with production means the country is no longer benefiting from a rally in oil prices.\n\nThe government is yet again reluctant to ditch the expensive practice, which was supposed to be phased out in June 2022 but will now continue for another 18 months.\n\nThe state-oil company, the NNPC, said the petrol subsidy will cost the government N3 trillion in 2022.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Muhammadu Buhari sought the approval of lawmakers for a supplementary budget of N2.6 trillion to cover the subsidy for 2022. The budget that was passed only made provision for N443 billion for subsidy for the months of January to June.\n\nThe supplementary budget takes Nigeria\u2019s budget deficit to N8.94 trillion from an initial N6.38 trillion, about 4 percent of GDP.\n\nRead also: Nigeria, the world\u2019s most inefficient spender, now lives to pay creditors\n\nA motley crew of economists, as well as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, have all repeatedly urged cash-strapped Nigeria to do away with the expensive practice but the government has turned deaf ears to wise counsel.\n\nAnalysts at emerging market-focused bank, Renaissance Capital, expect the budget deficit to be much higher due to lower oil revenues on the back of lower oil production and the rising subsidy bill.\n\n\u201cOn the fiscal front, the delay in removing the subsidy implies a budget deficit of 4.7 percent of GDP in FY22, on our estimate vs the government\u2019s 3.4 percent target,\u201d Renaissance Capital analysts said in a report.\n\n\u201cAlthough, typically, an improvement in FX liquidity hinged on higher oil price, lubricates Nigeria\u2019s economic engines and spurs an increase in economic activity, but in 2022, it stated that this will be undermined by an uncertain outlook for oil production,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s curious policies that have ensured it is eluded from rising commodity prices are benefiting other countries, such as South Africa for one.\n\nInvestor appetite for emerging markets has waned this year, but they still have a taste for South Africa.\n\nStocks on Johannesburg\u2019s benchmark FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index have got off to a blazing start, spurred on by strong prices for commodities.\n\nThe gauge set an all-time high last week and has returned 7.5 percent in dollar terms this year, compared with a 1.1 percent retreat for the MSCI Emerging Markets index.\n\nSouth African government bonds have already returned 8.9 percent in dollar terms in 2022, the best performer out of 19 developing nations tracked by Bloomberg. The average for peers is negative 0.1 percent.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s currency, the rand, is also faring better than most emerging-market currencies, even with its status as a proxy \u2014 meaning that in risk-off trade, it can be subjected to outsized swings.\n\nHalf of the 24 developing-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg have made losses against the dollar year-to-date. The rand is among those to have strengthened, fourth overall with a return of 4.6 percent.\n\nIn Nigeria\u2019s case, the currency is down from N415 at the beginning of the year to N416.7 year-to-date despite higher oil prices.\n\nNigerian stocks are also up 10 percent in naira terms, but in dollar terms, it is much less. The spot exchange rate for foreign portfolio investors is around N444 per dollar, lower than the N416.7 official rate.",

It is big, capable of adding to more to power supply than has been added since the last eight years, \u201d a source close to deal told BusinessDay.\n\nExperts said this development is seen as a great achievement for Nigeria\u2019s power sector as the $500 million Geometric/Aba power plant has the capacity to produce and distribute about 141 megawatts (MW) of electricity in its first phase, with new distribution lines, four new sub-stations and three rehabilitated sub-stations.\n\nEach plant is to produce 47 MW of power, supported by a 60 MVA per transformer.

By the terms of the agreement, NEPA assigned its right to distribute electric power in the ring-fenced area of Owerri-nta, Osisisoma, Ogbor Hill, Factory road and Port Harcourt road in Aba and also leased its distribution facilities within the contract area to Aba Power Limited.\n\nA supplementary agreement was made on August 31, 2006, between the Federal Government, represented by the minister of power and steel, Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) and Enugu Distribution Company (EDC) and Geometric/Aba Power Limited.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n1 \u201c Wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise\u201d Prov. 20:1\n\nAlcohol has turned many in our street to be stupefied. They become object of ridicules and mockery. When alcohol makes them rage they find themselves in a state of extreme anger which in itself is uncontrollable like a mad man. That is why any one who is a new creature cannot go by it nor be deceived by it.\n\nSatan has his strategies; he teaches those who have not given their lives totally to Christ two words to swallow: \u201cDrink moderately\u201d or sometimes: \u201cdrinkbut not drunk\u201d that is Satan\u2019s strategy. He will not tell his disciples do not drink at all. He knows that would keep them entirely from strong drink from alcohol although he knew what that Angel of God told Manoah\u2019s wife: \u201cthou art barren and bears not: but thou shelf conceive, and tear a son. Now therefore, beware, I pray thee and drink not wine or strong drink, and eat not any Maclean thing.\u201d Judges 13:3-4 she obeyed God. But Eve did not obey God. Manoah\u2019s wife did not allow any suggestibility from Satan. Satan would have been capable of suggesting to Manoah\u2019s wife to stick to alcohol but should drink moderately so as not to cause any miscarriage or harm to the child in the womb.\n\nMany people have fallen because they listened to Satan\u2019s suggesting. And he brings his suggestions to people in a subtle way.\n\n2.In a new life one cannot be deceived by Satan. \u201cDrink a little, drink moderately\u201d. That is Satan\u2019s subtle way of opening the door of alcoholism to those who have not totally surrendered to Christ for a new life, for to be a new creature, for to allow old things to pass away and to allow one to be born again. So Jesus was blunt in telling Nichodemus the truth, the gospel truth: \u201cExcept a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\u201d John 3:3.\n\nMany have been deceived into alcohol because they see Priests and Pastors who drink alcohol. The other day I was with some one who still opposed to doing away withalcohol entirely. He was gladdened and satisfied in his heart that Archbishop so and so was drinking alcohol; Bishop so, so and so, mentioning them by their names were drinking alcohol; that Provost so, so and so was drinking alcohol going by names; Cannon so, so and so going by their names were still with alcohol; that Venerable so, so and so going by their names were drinking alcohol; that it was only the present Bishop so, so mentioning his name that preached to his ministers, priests that they should forsake alcohol entirely but that some of the priests were still in alcohol secretly. That was one in his church narrating what he knew. Another could also narrate what goes on in his church concerning alcohol. We can see what great havoc that can be caused when people looking at their leaders see what they do or hear what they say.\n\nMany hundreds, many thousands, many millions have fallen into sin by what they see their leaders do. It is pathetic, disturbing and heart breaking. You look at this scripture: \u201cBut they also have erred throughwine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the Priests and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink\u2026.. Alltables are full of vomit and blitheness so that there is no place clean\u201d. Isaiah 28:7-8.\n\n3.Let those who delight in alcohol forsake their alcoholism and accept Jesus Christ and never seeking any hiding place in the bad examples of their leaders:\u201cmany pastors have destroyed my vineyard and \u2026\u201d Jer. 12:10. What you have to do now if you still drink alcohol, is to come truly to Christ and surrender your life to him and ask for a new life. He will surely do that for you. Be wise and not be deceived into alcohol.\n\nThere is no drunkard throughout all ages that ever agrees that he was at any time drunk. And there is no one in drunkenness that ever agrees that he is a drunkard.\n\nSatan has not relented in his ministrations. To you; he has not relented in whispering to you in his subtle way that you will be in a happy mood when you are in alcohol. Be ware of his suggestibility it is capable of pulling you out of the Christian way. If is capable of removing God\u2019s word from you and replacing it with deceit and unbeliever.\n\nRemember that all that God would use would be filled with the Holy Spiritand not with alcohol or strong drink. Paul was one; Peter, John, Stephen etc were filled with the Holy Spirit. Ask Jesus today to fill you with the Holy Spirit and there will be a change. Remember Hab.2:15\u201cwoe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink\u2026\u201d The end was that the neighbour became naked.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Anybody who was around in the state between 2004 and 2010 will know that Aregbesola was the harbinger of hope, confidence and power for the progressive party in the state.\n\n\u201cEverybody will agree that if not for Aregbesola\u2019s doggedness, modern politics and collective efforts, the PDP would have remained in power till date.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the 2018 governoship primary of the party, Adeoti said Aregbesola was blindfolded by his loyalty to his boss to accept, promote and assiduously work for a wrong and unpopular candidate.\n\nHe said: \u201cAregbesola was committed and loyal to his master in Lagos. That was why he supported an unpopular candidate in 2018. We all knew then that Oyetola was a bad product but Aregbesola did not have a choice. He obeyed his master.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, those people (Oyetola and his followers) have bit the finger that fed them. Aregbesola does not deserve being humiliated by anybody.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Minister of Interior, Aregbesola, said he had stomached betrayal, hypocrisy and backsliding from the people he was serving wholeheartedly.\n\nAccording to him, he decided to take a new path when he realised that the person he was committedly loyal to was out to destroy him and everything he stand for.\n\nHe urged members of the party to vote for Adeoti in the coming Saturday governoship primary of the party.\n\nLeaders of the APC who included former speaker of Osun House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Najeem Salaam and Chairman of the party in the state, Hon. Rasak Salinsile, who were at the event urged members of the party to ensure that Adeoti emerge victorious in the primary.",

          "text": "A faith-based human rights organisation, The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), has berated the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) on its stand regarding the professorial appointment of the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Ibrahim (Pantami).\n\nIt will be recalled that ASUU had on Monday described Pantami\u2019s professorial appointment by the Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO) as \u201cillegal\u201d.\n\nBut reacting to the development, MURIC said ASUU had not learnt its lessons.\n\nThe human rights group spoke through its director, Professor Ishaq Akintola, through a press statement dated Tuesday, February 15, 2022.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMURIC said: \u201cThe Academic Staff Union of Universities yesterday declared Professor Pantami\u2019s professorial appointment as illegal. It is the joke of the century. ASUU has no locus standi to declare illegal an appointment made by a university with the approval of the appointments and promotions committee and ratified by the university\u2019s council.\n\n\u201cWhat is ASUU national trying to do? What exactly is their problem? ASUU national has no right to usurp the powers of University A & P or that of its council. On what ground is ASUU acting as a national A & P (if there is anything like that) and the Grand Council of all universities?\n\n\u201cIt is trespass. ASUU national should know its limits. Again, is there any section of ASUU constitution which empowers it to override appointments made by universities? This is an affront. No more, no less.\n\n\u201cThe last time we checked, the power of appointment rests with A & P Committee of each university and pronouncement rests with the university council. No university worth its salt will consult ASUU over issue of promotion or appointment. Where did ASUU national get this absurd idea?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAgain, when last did ASUU wade into procedures for promotion or appointment of the academia in any Nigerian university? What we know of is that individual lecturers who feel wronged on promotion issues may report their university to the local ASUU. That is why what the national body is doing is strange. Or is it a witch-hunt?\n\n\u201cIs ASUU dancing to the gallery by championing the hate campaign of a section of the country? But will ASUU be able to carry all its branches along? For instance, will Northern universities see things the way ASUU national sees it? ASUU national will divide this body again if it continues this way. Remember that many other universities have formed other lecturers\u2019 associations because of bullying from the center.\n\n\u201cOne expects ASUU national to have learnt its lesson by now. There is a world of difference between fighting the collective cause of all members and fighting your own member or fighting a particular branch. This is a fight you cannot win. What came out of the conflict between ASUU national and its Unilorin branch? Who blinked first? Ilorin dealt with ASUU national and got away with it.\n\n\u201cIt is quite amusing that ASUU national threatened to sanction those who participated in the process that led to what ASUU called \u2018illegal\u2019 appointment. It is an empty threat. Unions are not held together by the force of threats. They are kept alive by good leadership, tolerance and sacrifice.\n\n\u201cBesides, Professor Pantami\u2019s work at FUTO is a voluntary work that attracts no payment and this has a place in the rules of the civil service. Neither is the minister doing it without the knowledge and approval of Mr. President.\n\n\u201cBefore dropping the anchor, we assert clearly, unequivocally and categorically that appointments conducted by A & P committee of the university and ratified by council cannot be illegal. ASUU national leaders should avoid issues capable of tearing its union apart.\u201d",

          "text": "Gov. Yahaya Bello of Kogi met President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday at the Presidential Villa in Abuja.\n\nBello, after the closed-door meeting, told State House correspondents that the north-central had never produced the president or vice president of the country, and it was only proper that the region should produce the next President of the country in 2023.\n\nHe said: \u201cWell if you\u2019re talking of southeast then you will equally talk of north-central not only since 1999 but since 1960. So what do you say of the north-central which has never produced the president or vice president?\n\n\u201cSo put the situation of the southeast and that of north-central side by side, then who is more disadvantaged in terms of the position of presidency or vice presidents?\n\n\u201cSo if you put both sides together, then let\u2019s do justice. And whichever way you look at it, I\u2019m eminently qualified.\u201d\n\nOn who he thinks should take over from President Buhari in 2023 and if he informed the president of his political ambition, the governor said: \u201cMr. President would want a vibrant, experienced, energetic, patriotic Nigerian to take over from him and in all of the qualities that Nigerians are yearning or looking for today, I possess all of these qualities by the special grace of God.\n\n\u201cNigerians are yearning and asking me to run for the President come 2023 and by the special grace of God I will not turn down that offer.\u201d\n\nThe governor added that he came to brief the President on the improved security situation in his state.\n\nBello noted that Kogi had been enjoying relative peace and stability in recent times due to new security measures introduced in the state.\n\nAccording to the governor, Nigerians have a role to play in securing the nation.\n\nHe called on all citizens to complement the government\u2019s effort by serving as agents of security in their homes and areas of abode.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs usual, I came to visit Mr. President to give him an update of the situation in my area of responsibility, which is Kogi State.\n\n\u201cLike you all know, Kogi as at the time I assumed office used to be the most dangerous, let me put it that way, crime state before. But as of today with the special grace of God, Kogi is now the safest state as far as Nigeria is concerned.\n\n\u201cAnd the President is very pleased about our performance in the state in the area of security, economy, infrastructural development, integration, peace, and unity that are being enjoyed in Kogi state today.\n\n\u201cSo basically, these are the briefs that I came with to see the President and he sends his goodwill message to the people of Kogi.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to him, the current administration has done greatly in tackling insecurity.\n\nHe, however, noted that the successes of the administration in addressing insecurity are under-reported, and it may be politically motivated.\n\n\u201cOne of the loopholes I can see in tackling insecurity is in Nigerians ourselves. Today in Kogi State, all citizens are potential security personnel.\n\n\u201cIf all Nigerians take it as their own business, insecurity would be tamed to the barest minimum.\n\n\u201cSo, we should be ready to take on security issues head-on, we shouldn\u2019t just be relying on the law enforcement agencies. The way we continue to hype issues of insecurity, especially our headlines in the media will not help us.\n\n\u201cFor instance, take the statistics of the insecurity issues they had in America from 2020 to date and compare with that of Nigeria, you will discover that we have just overhyped ours.

Andrew would have had to give testimony under oath.\n\n\u201cIt is known that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked countless young girls over many years,\u201d the filing said.\n\n\u201cPrince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others.\n\n\u201cHe pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims.\u201d\n\nThe statement represented a marked departure from a 2019 BBC interview in which Andrew, who is Queen Elizabeth\u2019s second son, failed to show sympathy toward Epstein\u2019s victims and refused to apologize for his friendship with the financier.\n\nThe royal family in January removed Andrew\u2019s military titles and royal patronages and said he will no longer be known as \u201cHis Royal Highness.\u201d\n\nAndrew was defending against Giuffre\u2019s lawsuit as a private citizen.

          "text": "University teachers in Nigeria are to commence a four-week strike starting on Monday, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has said.\n\nThe union announced this as part of its resolutions at the end of its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting in Lagos Monday morning.\n\n\u201c\u2026 NEC resolved to embark on a four-week roll-over total and comprehensive strike action beginning from Monday 14th February 2022,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 stated.\n\nReasons for industrial action\n\nAddressing the media at Tayo Aderinokun auditorium at the University of Lagos (UNILAG), Akoka, the union\u2019s president, Professor Emmanuel Osodeke listed as reasons for the strike, the government\u2019s failure to implement the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and Memorandum of Action (MoA) signed between the union and the government; the government\u2019s poor commitment to the payment of academic earned allowance (EAA); the continued use of the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System and refusal to adopt the Universities Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS), and proliferation of the universities in the country.\n\nASUU also accused the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board(JAMB) of encroaching on the statutory roles of the Senates of universities over the admission of candidates by the institutions.\n\nThe union also frowned at the recent appointment of Nigeria\u2019s minister of communications and digital economy, Isa Ibrahim, as a professor at a federal university (FUTO) and threatened to sanction all those it said took part in the processes leading to what it described as the illegal appointment.\n\nOn IPPIS\n\nSpeaking on IPPIS, the union in its communiqu\u00e9, said: \u201cThe imposition of this grotesque platform challenged our union to develop an alternative system to IPPIS \u2013 the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS). This locally developed and cost-effective alternative payment platform has the distinct capacity to check corruption and preserve the hard-earned autonomy of Nigerian universities for the good of the country. Regrettably, FGN is still foot-dragging over its adoption, contrary to an earlier agreement with our union, thereby allowing the financial chaos heralded by IPPIS to continue.\u201d\n\nOn EAA\n\nASUU said: \u201cCompatriots of the press, the Federal Government promised to mainstream the EAA into the annual federal budget in the various memoranda signed with ASUU and the Government recently released N221 billion for payment of some EAA allowances. However, many years of unpaid entitlements are outstanding, serving as triggers for industrial crisis in our universities.\u201d\n\nOn visitation panel\n\nThe union condemned what it termed the continued delay in the release of the white papers on the reports of the visitation panels to the universities. The panels were set up by the government.\n\n\u201cSending Visitation Panels to universities on a periodic (5-yearly) basis is a critical evaluation requirement stipulated in our university laws. Our Union had to embark on an action for the FGN to institute such panels. However, many months after the panels submitted their reports, the White Papers are yet to be released. We call for the immediate release of the White Papers to address numerous lapses in the administration of Nigeria\u2019s federal universities,\u201d ASUU said.\n\nAppeal for support\n\nMeanwhile, the union pleaded with Nigerians for understanding, saying the declaration of the strike became very important to preserve the sanctity of the Nigerian university system.\n\n\u201cComrades and compatriots, it was a painful decision for NEC to arrive at the roll-over strike option. Contrary to the views canvassed in some quarters, our union loathes to disrupt academic activities on our campuses. We love our students and respect their parents and guardians. We are also not insensitive to the genuine concerns about stable academic calendars in public universities expressed by patriotic Nigerians and lovers of Nigeria. But the blame should be squarely put at the doorsteps of those who have ignored our patriotic yearnings for a development-oriented education in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe patience of our members has been tasked beyond tolerable limits. The greatest asset of any nation is its human capital. Any nation that pays lip service to education as we currently witness in Nigeria will only grow in age and never experience genuine development. We therefore seek the understanding and support of all stakeholders to make the Nigerian government more responsive to issues of human capital development including health and education,\u201d the union said.\n\nNANS warns\n\nThe National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has rejected planned strike by ASUU.\n\nThe union threatened to embark on actions including confrontation to make sure that the strike is suspended and students and lecturers go back to classes.\n\nSpeaking in an interview, NANS President Asefon Sunday lamented that the Nigerian students were always at the receiving end of the skirmishes between the government and ASUU.\n\nAsefon said: \u201cWe are not supporting ASUU; we are not supporting the federal government. And whatever we are going to do to make sure we return to class is what we are going to do.

We are going to use confrontation to make sure that our lecturers are back to school.\n\n\u201cAny moment from now, you will be reading our actions across the nation. The federal government and ASUU are going to see the wrath of Nigerian students.\u201d\n\nThe union said the impact of the last nine-month strike suspended in December 2020 by the union is still being felt across universities.\n\n\u201cWhen two elephants fight, the grass suffers. Nigerian students have always been at the receiving end. We have been the ones suffering.\u201d\n\nNANS Seeks ministers\u2019 removal\n\nAsefon faulted what he described as the failure of the government to address the issues with ASUU for more than a decade.\n\nThe union called on President Muhammad Buhari to sack the ministers of labour and education, Chris Ngige and Adamu Adamu, respectively, accusing them of insincerity in addressing the union\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to take it. And we are rejecting it. And we are calling on the federal government to remove the ministers of labour and education. We need clear headed people. We need people who are sincere,\u201d he said.\n\nNANS blames ASUU\n\nWhile it accused the Nigerian government of insincerity, NANS also alleged that ASUU does not consider the interest of students when taking actions.\n\nIt lamented that ASUU does not carry along NANS in all its activities even though the students are always at the receiving end of ASUU\u2019s issues with the government.\n\nThe NANS president added that ASUU has offended the Nigerian students for not being able to agree with the government during the last nine-month prolonged strike, and wondered if the same issues could be addressed in one month.\n\nHe said: \u201cYes, we understand and believe that everything they are asking for is for the benefit of the Nigerian students but you cannot be asking something for me, as a Nigerian student, and you are not carrying us along. We are also stakeholders in the education sector.\n\n\u201cHow many times has ASUU as a sister union called the Nigerian students to inform us that this is what is going on? When the new President of ASUU came on board, I tried every possible means as a President of NANS to reach out to him. But he will be telling me to go and relate with the ASUU chairman in my school. Am I the president of SUG in my school?\n\n\u201cFor those nine months they could not achieve anything and they are now saying they are going for a one-month warning strike. What kind of a warning strike is that?\u201d he wondered. (Premium Times)",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has submitted the 2022 Appropriation Act amendment proposal to the National Assembly.\n\nIn the amendment proposal, the President earmarked the sum of N2.557 trillion for fuel subsidy.\n\nThe amendment proposal is contained in a six-page letter sent to the House on Tuesday.\n\nIn the letter, President Buhari is asking the National Assembly to approve the sum of N2.557 trillion supplementary budget for petrol subsidy from July to December 2022.\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan and Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila read the letter in their respective chambers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Northern Youths Kick Against Atiku\u2019s Presidential Ambition, Demand Power Shift To South\n\nIn the letter, President Muhammadu Buhari said the amendment is necessary to accommodate some issues in the country including Petroleum Subsidy which must be considered.\n\nHe is also asking the National Assembly to review the Finance Act 2021.\n\nAccordingly, President Muhammadu Buhari in the letter said it was imperative to remove all capital projects that were replicated on the 2022 Appropriation Act.\n\nThe Senate in December passed the 2022 budget of N17.126 trillion, jerking the appropriation bill by N735.8 billion.\n\nRead the full letter written by the President to the NASS below\u2026\n\nThe full text of the letter entitled, \u201cSUBMISSION OF THE 2022 APPROPRIATION AMENDMENT PROPOSAL\u201d, reads:\n\n\u201cAs l indicated at the signing of the 2022 Appropriation Act, I forward herewith the Proposals for the amendment of the 2022 Appropriation Act (as detailed in Schedules I-V), for the kind consideration and approval by the Senate.\n\n\u201cLet me seize this opportunity to once again express my deep gratitude to the leadership and members of the Senate for the expeditious consideration and passage of the 2022 Appropriation Bill as well as the enabling 2021 Finance Bill.\n\n\u201cIt has become necessary to present this amendment proposal considering the impacts of the recent suspension of the Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) subsidy removal and the adverse implications that some changes made by the National\n\nAssembly in the 2022 Appropriation Act could have for the successful implementation of the budget.\n\n\u201cIt is important to restore the provisions made for various key capital projects in the 2022 Executive Proposal (see details in Schedule l) that were cut by the National Assembly. This is to ensure that critical ongoing projects that are cardinal to this administration, and those nearing completion, do not suffer a setback due to reduced funding.\n\n\u201cIt is equally important to reinstate the N25.81 billion cut from the provision for the Power Sector Reform Programme in order to meet the Federal Government\u2019s commitment under the financing plan agreed with the World Bank.\n\n\u201cIn addition, it is necessary to reinstate the four (4) capital projects totaling N1.42 billion in the Executive Proposal for the Federal Ministry of Water Resources that were removed in the 2022 Appropriation Act.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, there is critical and urgent need to restore the N3 billion cut from the provision made for payment of mostly long outstanding Local Contractors\u2019 Debts and Other Liabilities as part of our strategy to reflate the economy and spur growth (see Schedule I).\n\n\u201cYou will agree with me that the inclusion of National Assembly\u2019s expenditures in the Executive Budget negates the principles of separation of Powers and financial autonomy of the Legislature. It is therefore necessary to transfer the National Assembly\u2019s expenditures totaling N16.59 billion in the Service Wide Vote to the National Assembly Statutory Transfer provision (see Schedule l).\n\n\u201cIt is also imperative to reinstate the N22.0 billion cut from the provision for Sinking Fund to Retire Mature Loans to ensure that government can meet its obligations under already issued bonds as and when they mature.\n\n\u201cThe cuts made from provisions for the recurrent spending of Nigeria\u2019s Foreign Missions, which are already constrained, are capable of causing serious embarrassment to the country as they mostly relate to office and residential rentals.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the reductions in provisions for allowances payable to personnel of the Nigerian Navy and Police Formations and Commands could create serious issues for government. It is therefore imperative that these provisions be restored as proposed (see Schedule II).\n\n\u201cIt is also absolutely necessary to remove all capital projects is that replicated in the 2022 Appropriation Act; 139 out of the 254 such projects totaling N13.24 billion have been identified to be deleted from the budget.\n\n\u201cSome significant and non-mandate projects were introduced in the budgets of the Ministry of Transportation, Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and Office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation (see Schedule III). There are several other projects that have been included by the National Assembly in the budgets of agencies that are outside their mandate areas. The Ministry of Finance, Budget, and National Planning has been directed to work with your relevant Committees to comprehensively identify and realign all such misplaced projects.\n\n\u201cIt is also necessary to restore the title /descriptions of 32 projects in the Appropriation Act to the titles contained in the Executive Proposal for the Ministry of Water Resources (see Schedule IV) in furtherance of our efforts to complete and put to use critical agenda projects.\n\n\u201cThe Appropriation Amendment request is for a total sum of N106,161,499,052 (One hundred and six billion, one hundred and sixty-one million, four hundred and ninety-nine thousand, and fifty-two Naira only) for Capital Expenditures and N43,870,592,044 (Forty-three billion, eight hundred and seventy million, five hundred and ninety-two thousand, and forty-four Naira only) for Recurrent Expenditures. I, therefore, request the National Assembly to make the above amendments without increasing the budget deficit. I urge you to roll back some of the N887.99 billion of projects earlier inserted in the budget by the National Assembly to accommodate these amendments.\n\n\u201cHowever, following the suspension of the PMS subsidy removal, the 2022 Budget Framework has been revised to fully provide for PMS subsidy (see Schedule V). An additional provision of N2.557 trillion will be required to fund the petrol subsidy in 2022. Consequently, the Federation ACCOunt (Main Pool) revenue for the three tiers of government is projected to decline by N2.00 trillion, while FGN\u2019s share from the Account is projected to reduce by N1.05 trillion. Therefore, the amount available to fund the FGN Budget is projected to decline by N969.09 billion.\n\n\u201cAggregate expenditure is projected to increase by N45.85 billion, due to additional domestic debt service provision of N102.5 billion net of the reductions in Statutory Transfers by N56.67 billion, as follows: NDDC, by N12.61 billion from N102.78 billion to N90.18 billion; NEDC, by N5.90 billion from N48.08 billion to N42.18 billion; UBEC, by N19.08 billion from N112.29 billion to N93.21 billion; Basic Health Care Fund, byN 9.54 billion from N56.14 billion to N46.60 billion; and NASENI, by N9.54 billion from N56.14 billion to N46.60 billion.\n\n\u201cTotal budget deficit is projected to increase by N1.01 trillion to N7.40 trillion, representing 4.01% of GDP. The incremental deficit will be financed by new borrowings from the domestic market.\n\n\u201cEqually, it is imperative that Clause 10 of the 2022 Appropriation Act which stipulates that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) are authorized to charge and defray from all money standing in credit to the units as revenues, penalties or sanctions at 10% for the technical setup and operational cost at the units in this financial year be repealed.\n\n\u201cThis clause is in conflict with the Act establishing these Agencies, as well as some other laws and financial regulations of the government. These are neither Revenue Generating Agencies nor Regulatory Bodies that generate revenue or charge penalty fees. They are fully funded (Personnel, Overhead, and Capital) by Government through Budgetary provisions.\n\n\u201cThe Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007, as well as the Finance Act 2021, require these Agencies to remit fully any recovered funds to the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF). This clause may lay dangerous precedence, and spark clamours for similar treatment by other anti-corruption agencies.\n\n\u201cAlso, Clause 11 stipulates that \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of any other law in force, Nigerian Embassies and Missions are authorised to expend funds allocated to them under the Capital components without having to seek approval of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u201d should likewise be repealed. It too is inconsistent with extant Financial Regulations and the Public Procurement Act, which set thresholds for approving officers and Parastatal / Ministerial Tenders Boards for awards of Contracts for the procurement of goods and Services. This also amounts to an intrusion of the Legislature into what is an executive function.\n\n\u201cGiven the urgency of the request for amendments, I I seek the cooperation of the National Assembly for expeditious legislative action on the 2022 Appropriation Amendment Proposal in order to sustain the gains of an early passage of the budget.\n\n\u201cPlease accept, Distinguished Senate President, the assurances of my highest consideration.\u201d",

          "title": "Russia Says Some Forces Pulling Back Amid Ukraine Crisis",
          "text": "Russia said Tuesday that some units participating in military exercises were returning to their bases, adding to glimmers of hope that the Kremlin may not be planning to invade Ukraine imminently. But it gave no details on where the troops were pulling back from, or how many.\n\nThat muddied efforts to determine the significance of the announcement, which buoyed world financial markets and the long-suffering ruble after weeks of escalation in Europe\u2019s worst East-West standoff in decades. It came a day after Russia\u2019s foreign minister indicated the country was ready to keep talking about the security grievances that led to the Ukraine crisis \u2014 a gesture that changed the tenor after weeks of tensions.\n\nYet hours before the Russian Defense Ministry statement about the troops, a U.S. defense official said Russian units were moving closer to the Ukrainian border \u2013 not away from it. And Western officials continued to warn that the Russian military could attack at any time, with some floating Wednesday as a possible invasion day. NATO\u2019s chief said the alliance had no proof yet of a Russian retreat.\n\nThe fears of an invasion grew from the fact that Russia has massed more than 130,000 troops near Ukraine. Russia denies it has any such plans, despite placing troops on Ukraine\u2019s borders to the north, south and east and launching massive military drills nearby. U.S. and other NATO allies, meanwhile, have moved troops and military supplies toward Ukraine\u2019s western flank, although not to confront Russian forces, and promised more financial aid to the ex-Soviet nation.\n\nMoscow brandished Tuesday\u2019s pullback announcement as proof that fears of war were fabricated by a hostile, U.S.-led West: \u201cFebruary 15, 2022, will go down in history as the day Western war propaganda failed. Humiliated and destroyed without a single shot fired,\u201d Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova tweeted.\n\nYet Ukraine remains effectively surrounded on three sides by military forces from its much more powerful neighbor, and even if the immediate threat recedes, longer-term risk remains. Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, and some 14,000 people have been killed in fighting between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russia separatists in the country\u2019s east.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry did not indicate where the withdrawing troops had been deployed or how many were leaving.\n\nIt released images of tanks and armored vehicles rolling onto a train, and a tank commander saluting his forces while a military band played. The ministry did not disclose where or when the images were taken, or where the military vehicles were headed, other than \u201cto places of permanent deployment.\u201d\n\nForeign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the troops were returning \u201caccording to plan.\u201d He said such drills always adhered to a schedule \u2014 regardless of \u201cwho thinks what and who gets hysterical about it, who is deploying real informational terrorism.\u201d\n\nUkraine\u2019s leaders expressed skepticism.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t believe when we hear, we\u2019ll believe when we see. When we see troops pulling out, we\u2019ll believe in de-escalation,\u201d Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said.\n\nSpeaking in Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said: \u201cSo far, we have not seen any de-escalation on the ground, not seen any signs of reduced Russian military presence on the borders of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nHowever, he added that there are \u201csome grounds for cautious optimism\u201d for diplomatic efforts, given the signals coming from Moscow in recent days.\n\nStoltenberg said Russia has in the past moved into areas with troops and equipment, then pulled back leaving military materiel in place for rapid use later. He said that NATO wants to see a \u201csignificant and enduring withdrawal of forces, troops, and not least the heavy equipment.\u201d\n\nEuropean leaders have been scrambling to try to head off a new war on their continent, after several tense weeks that have left Europeans feeling caught between Russia and the U.S., and further pushed up household energy prices because of Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian gas.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz met Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, a day after sitting down with Ukraine\u2019s leader in Kyiv. In his opening remarks in the Kremlin, Scholz addressed the Ukraine tensions but also noted Germany\u2019s economic ties with Russia \u2014 which complicate Western efforts to agree on how to punish Russia in case of an invasion.\n\nForeign Minister Zbigniew Rau of Poland, one of Russia\u2019s most strident European critics, met in Moscow with Lavrov, and they discussed ways to use the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe for more talks aimed at easing tensions around Ukraine.\n\nThe day before, Lavrov suggested more efforts at diplomacy in a made-for-TV meeting with Putin that seemed designed to send a message to the world about the Russian leader\u2019s position. The foreign minister argued that Moscow should hold more talks, despite the West\u2019s refusal to consider Russia\u2019s main demands.\n\nMoscow wants guarantees that NATO will not allow Ukraine and other former Soviet countries to join as members. It also wants the alliance to halt weapons deployments to Ukraine and roll back its forces from Eastern Europe.\n\nThe U.S. reacted coolly.\n\n\u201cThe path for diplomacy remains available if Russia chooses to engage constructively,\u201d White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. \u201cHowever, we are clear-eyed about the prospects of that, given the steps Russia is taking on the ground in plain sight.\u201d\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Liz Truss reiterated that the danger of an invasion still exists, telling Sky News that it \u201ccould be imminent.\u201d Norwegian Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt issued a similar warning, and Estonia\u2019s foreign intelligence agency said the Russian armed forces could launch an operation \u201cfrom the second half of February.\u201d\n\nA U.S. defense official said small numbers of Russian ground units have been moving out of larger assembly areas for several days, taking up positions closer to the Ukrainian border at what would be departure points if Putin launched an invasion.\n\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss information not publicly released.\n\nMaxar Technologies, a commercial satellite imagery company that has been monitoring the Russian buildup, reported increased Russian military activity in Belarus, Crimea and western Russia, including the arrival of helicopters, ground-attack aircraft and fighter-bomber jets at forward locations. The photos taken over a 48-hour period also show ground forces leaving their garrisons and combat units moving into convoy formation.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian lawmakers urged Putin to recognize rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine as independent states. The State Duma, Russia\u2019s lower house, voted to submit an appeal to Putin to that effect.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the issue of recognizing the self-proclaimed republics is \u201cvery, very relevant to the public.\u201d But it was unclear how Putin would respond or how this could influence Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine.\n\nWhile the U.S. warns that Russia could invade Ukraine any day and Kyiv alerted residents to find their nearest bomb shelters, the drumbeat of war was hardly heard in Russia itself.\n\nThe Kremlin has cast the U.S. warnings of an imminent attack as \u201chysteria\u201d and \u201cabsurdity,\u201d and many Russians believe Washington is deliberately stoking panic and fomenting tensions to trigger a conflict for domestic reasons.\n\nFew Russians expect a war.\n\nIn Russia\u2019s Belgorod region about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from Ukraine\u2019s border, residents carry on with life as usual, even as more military personnel have been passing through village streets.\n\n\u201cPlanes, helicopters just started flying, I guess, to patrol the border,\u201d said Vladimir Konovalenko.\n\nVillager Lyudmila Nechvolod says she\u2019s not worried.\n\n\u201cWe are friends with Ukraine. And we are not sure that Ukraine wants war with us. \u2026 We are really on the border, we really have relatives here and there, everyone has somebody there (on the Ukrainian side),\u201d she said. \u201cNo one wants war.\u201d",

          "text": "The Chief Executive Officer of Financial Derivatives Company Limited (FDC), Mr. Bismarck Rewane, has advised Nigerians not to entertain the illusion that the Dangote Refinery would guarantee them cheaper supply of refined petroleum products.\n\nRewane said the most the Dangote refinery would guarantee was improved supply of petrol in Nigeria\u2019s domestic market, but would not affect the foreign exchange position of Nigeria significantly.\n\nHe said this on Monday, during the 2022 virtual economic outlook organised by the Stanbic IBTC Group, where he projected that the refinery would become operational in the Q1 2023.\n\nRewane said: \u201cNobody should expect that the Dangote Refinery is going to make petrol cheaper (in Nigeria). It is going to make it more available at any point in time. I doubt it whether he is going to collect his money in Naira because Dangote has costs.\n\n\u201cDangote Refinery technically and theoretically is outside Nigeria as it is situated at the export processing zone. We have a deep sea ports where the ships will take the refined products. But rather than buying from Amsterdam we will buy from Dangote and ship to Atlas Cove, Bonny and Port Harcourt.\n\n\u201cThe saving (to Nigeria economy) is that rather than shipping a tanker from Amsterdam to Nigeria, we will be shipping it from Lekki. Another savings is because Dangote refinery is 45 percent more efficient than other refineries because of its cutting edge technology. This will further reduce the cost.\u201d\n\nHe said what would happen was that Nigeria would take 450,000 barrels and make it available to Dangote under a swap arrangement instead of giving it to refineries in Europe.\n\nThe CEO of the FDC said taking the crude to Dangote Refinery would be quicker than shipping it to, and bringing the refined products from Europe.\n\n\u201cI think that it is quite clear that it will not solve all our foreign exchange problems because it does not change things much. So, it is wrong notion to say that we spend all our money (FX) importing fuel.\n\n\u201cNo, it is our own fuel that is being refined for us abroad, which will now reside with Dangote. Apart from that I do not think that there is any much difference. The reason is that the price differential will probably be on transportation cost. It is not going to change dramatically our foreign exchange situation,\u201d he said.\n\nRewane also pointed out that that the Nigerian government was in a precarious financial position because, \u201cwe have a situation now where the government is desperate. There is a shortfall in government financing cannot be fixed through subsidy removal.\u201d\n\nHe said the unsung economic reality in 2022, was that Nigeria would be the poverty capital of the world as ordinary Nigerians on the bottom of economic ladder would spend 101 per cent (sic) of their official income on foods alone.\n\nRewane said food inflation could force many Nigerians to switch to substitutes to actually reducing the amount of food they are consuming.\n\n\u201cA study last year said that 25 per cent of Nigerians are consuming less in quantity than what they were consuming earlier while 50 per cent are consuming less quality than they are consuming previously. This will compromise their immune system and render them more fragile for other reasons.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, 63 million Nigerians were gainfully employed in Nigeria. In 2020 it dropped to 31 million people that were fully employed. That is why we are having kidnapping,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CEO of StanbicIBTC Holdings, Mr. Demola Sogunle, said that the event was to discuss investment and planning as election period draws near.\n\nDike Onwuamaeze",

          "title": "Nigeria: NNPC Completes Withdrawal of Dirty Fuel from Circulation",
          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd (NNPC) has withdrawn all the methanol blended petrol which was imported into the country about three weeks ago.\n\nThe NNPC also stated that cargoes of clean petrol are arriving daily into the country to bridge the gap created by the withdrawal of the methanol blended petrol.\n\nThe off-spec petrol, according to the NNPC, was imported into the country by four oil marketers through four cargoes under the company\u2019s Direct Sales Direct Purchase (DSDP) arrangement.\n\nThe four companies that were alleged to have supplied the methanol-blended petrol were: MRS which made the importation through a vessel named MT Bow Pioneer, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium through vessel identified as MT Tom Hilde, Oando through a vessel named MT Elka Apollon, and Duke Oil through MT Nord Gainer vessel. Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi, MRS and Oando have since denied this claim in press statements made available to the public.\n\nThe product was purchased from international trader, LITASCO and delivered with MT Nord Gainer loaded through the LITASCO loading port terminal in Antwerp, Belgium.\n\nThe NNPC moved to halt the situation by ensuring that the methanol blended petrol do not get to the filling stations.\n\nIn achieving this, the NNPC made sure that all the cargoes that were suspected to have methanol were quarantined, while all the trucks that have left the depots were tracked and intercepted.\n\nThe NNPC also restocked the depot with cleaner fuels and sent officials to inspect all the filling stations to ensure that they do not have the petrol that had excessive methanol.\n\nIn addition, the NNPC intensified efforts at increasing the supply of petrol into the market in order to bridge any unforeseen supply gap.\n\nA former Lagos State Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Kayode Opeifa, said the action taken by the NNPC in mitigating the potential crisis that would have been caused if the entire contaminated fuel had entered the Nigerian market was timely.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is what you would expect in this kind of situation. You quarantine the quantity, withdraw those in circulation and then begin investigation and that is the stage that I believe that we should be concerned with so that we don\u2019t have damages beyond what we \u2018ve had.\n\n\u201cTo that effect, as someone in the transport sector with analytical chemistry background, I think so far for the public, that is adequate. The product is withdrawn.\n\n\u201cWe need to be procedural in handling this matter. Vehicles are damaged but it\u2019s not a matter that should be handled based on emotions. We need to get answers to how it happened.\n\n\u201cWe have regulatory agencies and they have done the needful in terms of isolation, quarantine and restock. For the general public, what is important is that the product is no longer in the market,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, different countries have different specs, however, there is a minimum standard and the minimum standard was what NNPC said the particular fuel failed to meet. He said that it is not unusual to miss the specs on chemical analysis.\n\n\u201cIt is not unusual to have product defects. You have heard of car recalls, air bag recalls when they have gotten to the market. So, the best thing is to ensure that appropriate protocols are used to address this issue.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is the good news out of this whole thing that happened is that it was detected early enough, it was withdrawn within limited time and the fuel supply chain is gradually coming back to normal,\u201d he said.\n\nPeter Uzoho",
