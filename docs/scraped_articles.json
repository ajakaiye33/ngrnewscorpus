          "text": "Edo State Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, has linked the spate of insecurity and banditry being witnessed in the country to the refusal of politicians to speak the truth, urging them to be bold and speak truth to power irrespective of their political affiliations so as to make the nation better.\n\nShaibu gave the charge when he hosted the maiden edition of the Catholic Politicians and Captains of Industry Forum, at the St. Paul\u2019s Catholic Church Hall in Benin City, with the theme, \u2018State of the Nigerian Nation; Catholic Politicians and Captains of Industry Forum Chats on Way Forward for the Common Good.\u2019\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI can tell you that if whatever we do reflects our doctrines, we won\u2019t have this insurgency that we are experiencing right now. If we tell ourselves the truth, we will not have all these crises that are self-inflicted; we are the cause.\n\n\u201cBut I am happy that we now have a forum that we can use in telling ourselves the truth. For us, we will continue to speak the truth; there are good people in government, just that majority of them are bad, and the system is really bad too. Until we fix the system and stop talking, I can tell you that Nigeria will remain where it is.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWe will continue to speak truth to power; we are also appealing to some of our people, if you want to decamp from your political parties, no problem, but speak truth to power. When things are bad, say it\u2019s bad and find a way to provide a solution. Let us collectively continue to speak truth to power.\n\n\u201cIf you are in a particular political party and things are not working well, speak to your head let him know that things are bad; be bold to speak the truth; if he refuses to take it, it doesn\u2019t matter but speak the truth.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his opening remarks, the Chairman of Catholic Politicians and Captains of Industry Forum, Prof. Pat Utomi, said, \u201cIf we all put on our thinking caps; if we look at intelligence, information and trends, then we can predict things that will go wrong, and we can intervene to work to prevent those things from going wrong. All the problems that we are experiencing in Nigeria today are predictable.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s also help to facilitate the building of institutions that will essentially socialize the young people into new sets of values that will make the society a better place for everybody.\u201d",

          "title": "APC National Convention: Senator, ex-govs battle for Buni\u2019s job",
          "text": "By Omeiza Ajayi, ABUJA\n\nThe battle for the national chairmanship of the ruling All Progressives Congress APC has begun with several stakeholders making behind-the-scenes consultations on their prospects of taking over from the Caretaker National Chairman, Gov. Mai Mala Buni.\n\nThe moves followed the conclusion of APC\u2019s membership registration and revalidation exercise as well as the commencement of its Congresses which states from the Ward level ahead of its National Convention.\n\nAlso, in the wake of the controversy generated by the Supreme Court judgment on the Ondo Governorship election vis a vis the implications of the dissenting judgment for the APC, there have been increased political horse trading among aspirants for party positions.\n\nA 4-3 split decision of the court had dismissed the petition filed by the Peoples Democratic Party PDP aspirant in the 2020 Ondo State Governorship Election, Eyitayo Jegede SAN against the incumbent Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu SAN and the ruling APC.\n\nSome of those who wanted to get Gov. Mai Mala Buni out of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee have continued to espouse the provision of Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended).\n\nThe section provides that; \u201cThe Governor shall not, during the period when he holds office, hold any other executive office or paid employment in any capacity whatsoever\u201d.\n\nAlso, Article 17(iv) of the APC constitution states that; \u201cNo officer in any organ of the Party shall hold executive position office in government concurrently\u201d.\n\nThe minority judgment of the apex court which touched on these provisions have heightened activities among partisans, especially those angling to chair the party at the national level.\n\nSaturday Vanguard takes a look at some of the frontrunners in the contest. They include the Senator, representing Niger East Senatorial District at the National Assembly, Mohammed Sani Musa, former Governors Tanko Al-Makura of Nasarawa state; Ali Modu Sheriff of Borno and Abdulaziz Yari of Zamfara.\n\nOthers are a former National Publicity Secretary of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change CPC Saliu Mustapha and the Hakimin Jimeta, Mr Sunny Sylvester Moniedafe.\n\nSenator Mohammed Sani Musa\n\nA progressive Senator from Niger state, with strong history of leading high-performance teams to meet or exceed objectives.\n\nWith arguments against having ex-governors as national chairman of the party, there are strong indications that the Chairman, Senate Services Committee is being considered for the plum job.\n\nSince inception in 2013, the APC has been chaired by only former State governors beginning from Chief Bisi Akande (Osun), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun (Edo), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole (Edo) to the incumbent National Chairman of its Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee CECPC, Gov. Mai Mala Buni of Yobe state.\n\nWhile he is said to have extracted the commitment of his state governor, Abubakar Sani Bello, the senator also has the support of his colleagues including most members of the House of Representatives.\n\nAlthough, no one can easily predict where the pendulum would swing, there is a strong clamour and argument to have the national Chairmanship of the party zoned to the North Central.\n\nThere are also arguments that no one outside of the Action Congress of Nigeria ACN tendency has ever led the party.\n\nSenator Musa who came from one of the legacy parties, the defunct All Nigerian Peoples Party is therefore being touted for the position as the Presidential ticket is likely to be ceded to another person outside of the defunct ACN and the defunct Congress for Progressive CPC tendency, President Muhammadu Buhari having being a member of that political tendency.\n\nWhat is also going for him is that he is a founding member of the APC, and is reputed to be highly organized, dedicated, passionate and hardworking person with a proven integrity in all the places he has served in both public and private sector from 1986 to date.\n\nHis promoters said he possesses proven skills in developing consensus at party, committee and legislative levels.\n\n\u201cTalented relationship-builder, problem-solver and leader with accomplished career both in and outside government. Enthusiastic about applying expertise toward helping people of diverse classes in Nigeria\u201d, they said.\n\nTanko Al-Makura\n\nThe immediate past governor of Nasarawa State is currently Nasarawa South Senatorial District at the National Assembly, has not been talking so much about his ambition as he usually shys away from media inquiries.\n\nHe was elected governor of Nasarawa State in 2011 on the platform of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), a party formed by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAlthough, Al-Makura is said to have the support of his state governor, Abdullahi Sule, what could count against him is that he belongs to the CPC political tendency in the party.\n\nBut his governor thinks otherwise as he had during the APC registration/revalidation exercise, advised the party to look in the direction of the defunct CPC and Nasarawa State for the position of its national chairman.\n\nThe argument against such proposition is that the president also comes from the defunct CPC while past APC Chairmen have come from the ACN tendency.\n\nAli Modu Sheriff\n\nThe former Borno state Governor is reputed to not just have a big war-chest, but also regarded as a heavy spender. He is one politician who is not afraid of spending raw cash.\n\nAlso from the ANPP tendency, he is a founding member of the APC but immediately ditched it and left for the PDP ahead of the 2015 general election.\n\nWhat would however count against him is his defection antecedents as well as his less than desirable handling of the PDP when he was its acting National Chairman.\n\nAbdulaziz Yari\n\nThe immediate past governor of Zamfara State has never hidden his ambition to lead the party at the national level.\n\nBeing a former chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum NGF, it is believed that he must have forged useful political friendships across board.\n\nAlso of the ANPP political tendency, he does not yet have the support of his state governor, Bello Matawalle who recently defected to the APC.\n\nMatawalle\u2019s detection unsettled the political climate in the state APC as he naturally became the leader of the party by virtue of his office as Governor.\n\nHowever, Yari is said to be uncomfortable with governor becoming leader of the party. Will the governor support him, seeing the experience in Edo where Comrade Adams Oshiomhole who was supported by his successor, Governor Godwin Obaseki to become party chairman troubled the Governor and nearly have him a bloodied political nose?\n\nThere is also a reported gang up by some party elements in the North West to truncate Yari\u2019s aspiration for the party chairmanship position because, like am analyst puts it, \u201cif he gets it, it will spoil their calculations for the 2023 Vice Presidential slot\u201d.\n\nWhen taken up on this, Yari had told Saturday Vanguard that; \u201cI hear that also. Somebody told me that some of my colleagues and former colleagues are interested in the number one and number two slots so, if the (National Chairmanship) seat goes to the North West, nothing will get to them, so they ganged up to neutralize Yari.\n\n\u201cIf God decides that it should be, it is going to be. People can maneuver and do all sorts of calculations but they will not prevail. All I know is this: I have the capacity to lead this party and they know what I can do\u201d, he stated.\n\nSunny Sylvester Moniedafe\n\nOriginally from Delta state, Mr Moniedafe has spent almost all his life in Adamawa state to the effect that he was recently named \u201cHakimin Jimeta\u201d.\n\nAlthough, both Delta and Adamawa states are current under the grip of the PDP, Moniedafe has been crisscrossing the country, conferring with stakeholders and selling his candidacy to them.\n\nHe considers himself a neutral element who can effectively heal all broken political fractures in the party.\n\nSalihu Mustapha\n\nMustapha was once the Deputy National Secretary of the CPC.\n\nThe Turaki of Ilorin in a recent interview dismissed fears that he does not have the support of his state governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq.\n\nAccording to him, the governor is not only in support of his bid, but that his aspiration has now assumed a life of its own and become a \u201cpan-Kwara agenda\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Vincent Ujumadu, Dennis Agbo, Steve Oko & Emmanuel Iheaka\n\nDRIVING through most of the federal roads that crisscross the South-East geopolitical zone has become very agonizing. The Enugu-Onitsha, Onitsha Owerri, Aba-Owerri, Owerri-Umuahia, Enugu-Abakaliki, Oba-Nnewi-Okigwe, among many others are in deplorable condition.\n\nFor instance, the journey from Enugu to Onitsha which, in the good old days, used to take less than one hour now takes about six hours. Same for Enugu-Aba and Onitsha-Owerri.\n\nIn fact, motorists have totally abandoned the 82 Division- 9th mile section of the degraded Enugu-Onitsha expressway, due to its impassibility, thereby forcing commuters to overuse the single lane of Trans-Ekulu bridge, which often results in a terrible gridlock all day round.\n\nIn Enugu, both lanes of the road from Abakpa junction are in grave degradation such that vehicles, particularly heavy duty trucks are in constant breakdowns on the road thereby compounding traffic problems in the area.\n\nWater tankers who source the city\u2019s water supply from 9th mile have ugly experiences on the bad road and which brought about hike in the price of water supply to residents.\n\nIn Anambra, the Amansea portion of the Enugu \u2013Onitsha expressway has been turned into money making spot as scores of youths assemble there every day to push vehicles stuck in the mud for negotiated fees on the dilapidated road.\n\nDrivers are also bemoaning their fate as their vehicles could sometimes remain in the mud for days as towing vehicles can not even access the area.\n\nThe portion, which has become a death trap despite promises made in the past that it would be reconstructed as part of the ongoing work from Onitsha \u2013to Enugu, has become a nightmare to motorists and passengers.\n\nThe development has put so much pressure on the old Onitsha \u2013Enugu road with the attendant traffic gridlock witnessed on daily basis.\n\nMany vehicles, particularly trucks, have had to remain in the mud for days as the drivers and owners of goods being conveyed by the drivers suffer economic losses.Some of the youths who now make money by pushing out vehicles from the mud say they make as much as N15000 daily.\n\nOne of the drivers, Mallam Isa Aminu, whose lorry had been trapped in the mud for three days said he is praying that there would not be further rainfall in the next few to so that the area could dry to enable him drive out.\n\nHe said that he could not afford the amount of money being demanded by the youths and urged government to come to the aid of the drivers by making the area a priority in the ongoing reconstruction of the Onitsha \u2013Enugu expressway.\n\nFor Imo State, to say that federal roads in the area are deplorable, is to state the obvious. Though residents of the state and those who ply the roads o may be said to have heaved a sigh of relief from what the situation was in 2018/2019; it is still an ugly experience to ply the Owerri-Umuahia road and Owerri \u2013 Aba road.\n\nBefore the ousted Emeka Ihedioha administration came on board in 2019, it was a nightmare to travel through the Owerri \u2013 Umuahia road. The Imo part of the road was totally broken.\n\nAt a point, motorists resorted to taking a bypass through villages in Emekuku and Obowo to cut off the bad federal road until the state government did a remedial work on the road.\n\nThe road has since gone bad again.. A journey that ought to take one hour, now takes two hours. The Emekuku in Owerri North, Oboama Nguru in Aboh Mbaise and Achingali in Obowo areas of the road are the worst portions of the road.\n\nThe Owerri end of the Owerri \u2013 Aba road and the Ulakwo axis have become impassable in spite of the fact that.the state government did remedial work on the road some years ago.\n\nIn Abia State, the Osisioma to Port Harcourt axis of the dual carriage road could pass as the worst section of the highway as commuters dread plying the route.\n\nThe ongoing rehabilitation work which began from the Enugu end since January 2015 at the twilight of former President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s administration has been crawling on snail speed for close to seven years now.\n\nThe Abia axis of the highway was segmented into two and awarded to two separate construction firms apparently for swift execution, but the slow pace of the work seems to have defeated that aim.\n\nThe condition of the highway between Aba and Obigbo in Rivers State, particularly at Ariaria Junction, Alaojii Mechanic Village and Asa axis is hellish. The expressway has virtually collapsed in these identified portions making movement undesirable for commuters.\n\nSecurity agents who have converted these failed portions into toll gates as they extortion money from motorists have made matters worse.\n\nSimilarly, the Port Harcourt Road traversing the heart of the commercial city of Aba is in sorry state, just as the Ikot Ekpene-Umuahia federal highway linking South East and Akwa Ibom State, particularly the Ikwuano axis.\n\nThe federal government in 2018 awarded N13.4 billion contract for the total rehabilitation of the highway after years of palliative work by the Federal Road Maintenance Agency, FERMA, but after the initial clearance of some terrible portions the road has been abandoned for non mobilization of the contractor..\n\nWhile the Akwa Ibom end of the road is smooth, the Abia axis is almost impassable, thus, making movement on it a nightmare.\n\nThe Umuahia-Ohafia-Arochukwu federal road is no exception as it has almost collapsed making trip to Arochukwu from Umuahia the state capital almost a day\u2019s journey.\n\nIn fact commuters prefer going to Arochukwu via Akwa Ibom instead of passing through Ohafia, a journey that ordinarily should not have taken more than two hours.\n\nDespite claims by the federal government that contract for the rehabilitation of the road has been awarded, there is nothing on ground to suggest it will be done any time soon.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Why blame Tega?",
          "text": "Ajebo Lawrence\n\nBy Yetunde Arebi\n\nHi. Last edition, I stated here that I was not going to join in the buzz going on about Tega and Boma, two of the ousted housemates of the ongoinTega\n\nTheir unwholesome relationship appeared to have been a major reason why viewers voted them out of the show. However, I received messages and calls from readers asking why I had refused to comment on Tega\u2019s conducts and if I was in support of what she had done.\n\nSome accused me of being a feminist and were not surprised that I was shielding her. In fact, a friend called to hear my views and we did discuss a bit. Is Tega really guilty of conducts unbecoming of a married woman whilst in the House?\n\nI think there is more to this question than a yes or no. If we continue to look at the actions in isolation, we may not really get a true appraisal of what went down between the duo.\n\nLet us first remind ourselves what the Big Brother reality show is about. Created by Johannes Hendrikus Hubert, a Dutch media tycoon, popularly known as John de Mol of Endemol and originally broadcast in the Netherlands, the show has been franchised in over 54 countries including Nigeria which is hosting its 6th season.\n\nHousemates live together in a confined space for a particular number of days, supervised by the Big Brother, under the full glare of cameras.\n\nThey form alliances and strike deals with fellow housemates to prolong their stay in the house, while viewers vote for their favourites to win the ultimate grand price, judge their conducts and vote for their favourites.\n\nThis year\u2019s, over N90 million is at stake and many may do everything and anything possible to emerge as winner. What they do to win is now tagged \u2018strategy\u2019 in local parlance. Ironically, your strategy can either make or mar you, which is what has happened in the Boma and Tega adventure.\n\nPrior to recent editions, the show had been condemned by many Nigerians for it\u2019s lurid content and every year government is advised to ban the show, insisting that it does not promote our values as a people.\n\nWith cameras in every nook and corner of the house 24/7, there is slim chance that the housemates will not be caught pants down either in their rooms or rest rooms and of course, in bed, under the sheets, even if by mistake. indeed, viewers got a glimpse of Tega\u2019s bum while dressing or undressing in Boma\u2019s presence. And this is the point I want to take off from.\n\nWhat is a married WOMAN doing in the Big Brother House? This was the first question I asked myself when I first saw Tega.\n\nBut this is the 21st Century, she is free to make her own decisions and no one can stop her if that is where she wants to be, some supporters in the early days of the show opined. After all, she is not the only married individual in the show and there have been others.\n\nShe is just the first woman to, all others have been men. The truth is that societal standards for judging men and women are different. Besides, all but one, have conducted themselves in manners worthy of their status.\n\nTega\u2019s drama adds a new twist to the story of BBNaija. For those who have called her unprintable names and insisted she could have done better, remember that we all have different endurance thresholds.\n\nFaced with an unending flow of alcohol in freezing condition, anything can happen, especially where one has not been really exposed to engaging men on that level.\n\nMy next question was, who is her husband? Why did he consent to her representing their family in a game such as this? Was it for the fame and/or the money?\n\nFor a guy who described himself as a brand consultant and night ambassador (whatever that is) I think it was very naive on his part that this will go down without their relationship getting a blow at least.\n\nEven singles with relationships outside, hardly get off without a few scratches. Not to mention a married situation. Tega\u2019s husband ought not to have allowed her walk into the lion\u2019s den in the first place.\n\nInterestingly, we also learnt that he had a strategy too. According to Tega who claimed to be an accomplished actress, (hahaha) they had agreed that she could act kissing and making out rolls with Housemates but must not have sex.\n\nCome on! This guy already laid out the grounds for adultery to catwalk on. If you can agree with your wife that other men can kiss and grapple her body to remain in a game, wetin remain now? I dear say she rep wella joor!\n\nIt is only baffling how Tega and Boma can imagine that dishing such behavior on local and international TV can be regarded as good content to Nigerians. Our hypocrisy will never allow us to accept such.\n\nThe truth is, there are men, women too, who don\u2019t know where to draw the line in their pursuit for success. Some men have consciously or otherwise set up their spouses in compromising situations only to cry wolf when the center falls.\n\nThey use their wives as baits for men, for benefit they cannot get by themselves. They turn a blind eye so long their secrets are safe and the goodies keep rolling in. And some don\u2019t even care. They are a power couple on a mission. Huh!\n\nA dear friend while working in one of Nigeria\u2019s Minister\u2019s office told of how a lady refused to go home without a contract paper her company had bided for.\n\nHer husband would not take things kindly with her should the deal not come through. It was late in the night. Only the minister and a few aides were left in the building.\n\nAnd this is a MARRIED woman, sent by her husband to do whatever it takes to get a contract. So, I don\u2019t really blame Tega or Boma. I blame her husband! Do have a wonderful weekend!!\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Bunmi Sofola\n\n\u201cMost people want to meet Mr. Or Miss Right\u201d, said Jare a 30-year old single mother of one. \u201cMost people in their youth dream of one day making a commitment to one person.\n\n\u201cWhen they do, they don\u2019t then leave the marriage because they do not respect it, can\u2019t stand living with an unfaithful partner or because their partner is drinking or spending the house-keeping money or urrent fashion.\n\n\u201cAnd people who don\u2019t get married do not reject marriage because of their lack of respect for it either, they just can\u2019t find anyone half-way decent who is free. Unfortunately, a lot of young people are not prepared for the ups and downs of marriage.\u201d\n\nJare continued, \u201cit is not marriage per se that young people should hear about in the school curriculum \u2013 that is the institution of marriage \u2013 but the ingredients of what makes a good marriage. Respect, trust, understanding, unconditional love and fun!\n\nPeople do not have a problem with the concept of marriage, they simply have a problem with finding someone they want to marry and stay with.\n\n\u201cWhat is needed in schools these days is not lesson on the sanctity of marriage which moves you no nearer to an altar, but lessons on how to pull a partner you might actually marry.\n\n\u201cThese lessons would incorporate information and individual qualities that would be suited to your own personality and needs. The source of my own relationship problem could have been ironed out at an early age if such advice had been available\u2026\u201d\n\nJare told me that she should have been prepared for now to smell a rat a mile off and make a run for it. By the time she realised the love of her life was married, she was literally holding the baby!\n\n\u201cI met him with a couple of guys he shared three-bedroom flat with. What he didn\u2019t tell me was the fact that he paid his share of the rent but only kept his room as a guest room \u2013 he was already married and living at the other end of the city with his wife and two kids.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, there were no tell-tale signs of this in his rented, well-furnished room.\n\n\u201cI grew up in a society that celebrated marriage. I had a mother and father who stayed together and it never occurred to me until now, that there was any alternative to the family state we were in.\n\n\u201cIn spite of our Catholic-style upbringing, neither my sister nor I are married. We\u2019ve never even come close. Neither of us had ever really lived with a man either.\n\n\u201cShe is 36, I am over 30 and responsible for a child whose father was trickster.\u201d Did I detect a tinge of \u2018bitterness\u2019? \u201cNot necessarily,\u201d she assured me.\n\n\u201cBut lessons on successful relationship could have taught me, for instance that the frog who has one date with you and vamooses is a bad emotional investment.\n\n\u201cI could have learnt that a man who criticizes everything about you, from your hair to the job you do, to the position of the watch on your wrist, leaves you alone on Christmas eve and Easter celebrations, is a man with problems of his own.\n\n\u201cThey could have told me to heed the alarm bells when a man who wants to leave his girlfriend for you, says that he wants to stay with her long enough for her to lose enough weights so that, she could attract someone else and not have a broken heart when she is eventually ditched. How self-centred can you get?\n\nI mean how many frogs is a girl expected to kiss before she finds her prince? A few years back, Jare said people in her age group got together for a self-help project. The idea then was that since they were mostly marriageable materials, they should be able to match make.\n\n\u201cAfterall, we all came from identical family backgrounds,\u201d she explained. I was already involved with the father of my child, whom I thought I would marry, and was out of the \u2018arrangee\u2019 marriages. But a lot of our mates fell for it and quite a number of the marriages we match-made were celebrated ones.\n\n\u201cI ran into an old friend recently who was \u2018lucky\u2019 to get introduced to her husband and she said it was the costliest mistake she ever made. But her husband is a good provider and they actually live in their own house.\n\n\u201cShe has a thriving fabrics shop but she\u2019s not happy. She said she\u2019s never been in love with the man \u2013 just in love with the idea of getting married. It got to a point where she couldn\u2019t bear to be touched by the man she slept on the same bed with.\n\n\u201cNow she\u2019s met a man she\u2019s hopeless in love with but is unfortunately trapped in a loveless marriage with two kids. She says she\u2019s seriously thinking of her own happiness \u2013 not her duty to her family.\u201d\n\nUche, a thirty-two-year old banker said she stayed single by pushing the self-destruct button at just the right time. She used to be so scared of commitment because of what she\u2019d seen of her mates\u2019 marriages. But now, with most of her friends settled and having babies, she would love to settle down, especially when she hopes to have children.\n\nNot with just any man, she assured me. \u201cIt won\u2019t just be physical attraction, but there will be a click, something that just happens chemically. His qualities will include allowing me to be in the context of the relationship and enabling me to have my own space.\n\n\u201cI have stayed this long to think of getting hitched, so I must settle for a reasonable man. And he must be comfortably well off as I have certain standards I want to maintain. I can\u2019t stand the idea of worrying about bills!\n\n\u201cFriendship is of course, the most important feature of the relationship. If you meet someone with whom you get on so well that you become best friends, you have a real chance for a long-term relationship to survive. It also means there is no play-acting or living up to someone\u2019s idea of what you should be like.\n\n\u201cIn my mid-twenties, I wanted all the glamour and excitement and jet setting that life as a banker could offer me. I wanted a handsome man who would dress in a sophisticated way. Now I see how superficial that was.\n\n\u201cThese days, I prefer to go out with men who are an intellectual challenge so I could take the time to know them first before declaring any underlying love\u2026\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nProfessor Yemi Osinbajo\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo says Nigeria needs to invent and produce cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications for education, business, medicine and security.\n\nHe said that effective collaboration between public and private sectors to build world-class institutions focused on innovation in science, technology and management sciences would help proffer solutions to the country\u2019s challenges.\n\nOsinbajo\u2019s spokesman, Laolu Akande, in a statement on Saturday, said the vice president delivered a keynote address to the founding class (2021) of the Nigerian University of Technology and Management (NUTM), Lagos.\n\nThe event was the institution\u2019s maiden graduation ceremony of its flagship Scholars Programme.\n\nNUTM is a top-notch school of innovation and technology focused on nurturing leaders in Nigeria and Africa, promoted by Dr Okey Enelamah, immediate past Industry, Trade and Investment Minister.\n\n\u201cThe most significant problems of this generation, especially in Africa, will require innovation in science, technology and the management sciences, especially entrepreneurship and innovative leadership if we are to stand a chance of resolving them.\u201d\n\nThe vice president said that the graduands of the NUTM programme had what was required to be among those who would in the future, provide solutions to national and global challenges in different sectors.\n\n\u201cI think sitting before us today, the graduands of the NUTM Scholars Programme, we might just be beholding the men and women with the answers to some of the world\u2019s most significant challenges.\n\n\u201cAnd there are many challenges indeed. We need to invent and produce cutting-edge AI applications for education, business, medicine and security.\n\n\u201cWe need to design the educational innovation required to train millions of children in or out of classrooms all across the country and on our continent, and provide the techniques for delivering opportunities in technology on the scale,\u201d he said.\n\nOsinbajo said that in Agriculture, Nigeria needed to invent advanced devices, precision agriculture methodologies, and robotic systems.\n\nHe said such inventions would guarantee the huge yields per acreage or volumes in dairy and livestock to meet the food security needs of a country headed for the third position in global population size in a few short years.\n\n\u201cAnd we are waiting for the breakthrough in the treatment of peculiar African health challenges such as sickle cell disease, fibroids and cancers.\n\n\u201cThere is so much to do. But we know that ground-breaking innovation in technology or commerce will always be the product of the work of well-trained people.\n\n\u201cWhich is why the NUTM Scholars Programme was designed to offer cutting-edge knowledge in Technology, Entrepreneurship and Design; Management; Perspectives in breakthrough Leadership ideas, Critical thinking and Writing.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the goal of the university is to train and equip highly sophisticated crack technology, innovation and management experts.\n\n\u201cThe students are the first cut of that dream team. And, we are holding our breath waiting for you to step into your destined roles.\n\n\u201cFirst, every major innovative breakthrough in science, technology or the social sciences was the product of patient collaborative work, sometimes across nations.\n\n\u201cThere is no innovation yet around the hard and, sometimes, long task of creating rare value,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the second reason why most people will never attain significance is because they are only interested in themselves and their personal successes.\n\n\u201cBut to earn significance, one must do something much bigger than oneself, a big idea, a massive game-changer should always be your target.\n\n\u201cThird is developing a mindset that you are as good as anyone who has ever developed a game-changing idea.\n\n\u201cProblem-solving innovators are, after all, men and women not spirits. And this is important because the way not to achieve is to have a mind that is incapable of seeing huge things,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile commending the founders, management and academics of the NUTM for the great work, Osinbajo told the graduands that those who built Dubai were men and women, not spirits.\n\nIn his welcome remarks, Enelamah, who is also the Chairman, Governing Board of the University, thanked the vice president for attending the event.\n\nHe added that NUTM was a pioneering higher education institution that had been established to nurture leaders and innovators to create an impact in Africa and other parts of the world.(NAN)",

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever lose a fight, no. I don\u2019t think I will.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s nobody out there to beat me.\u201d\n\nJoshua has reiterated his desire for a blockbuster battle, but Fury insists his British rival\u2019s shock loss to Andy Ruiz Jr is proof that he should not look too far ahead at future fights.\n\n\u201cHow can he have me now, if I\u2019ve got a rematch with Wilder,\u201d said Fury.\n\n\u201cThe big thing is \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you what they always do \u2013 and he already fell victim to it, Joshua.\n\n\u201cThey talk about fights that\u2019s not happening. Everybody wants to talk to me about the Joshua fight. They don\u2019t care about the fight that I\u2019m having.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, they want me to look over what I\u2019m doing and then get chinned. I\u2019m laid on my back flat by Wilder and he\u2019s taking my position.\u201d\n\nReflecting on the remainder of his career, Fury said, \u201cI\u2019ve only got, two, three fights left, because there\u2019s no more challenges.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve all been beaten. I\u2019ve got Wilder next and provided I get through that, then I\u2019ve got AJ.\u201d\n\nThe two-time world champion also revealed how he battled depression after fulfilling his long-term ambition of defeating Wladimir Klitschko in 2015.\n\n\u201cBefore it was like I had conquered the world and it was nothing else that I wanted to do,\u201d said Fury.\n\n\u201cWhen I was only young, Klitschko was a world champion, so I was always looking at him and when I\u2019d completed it, it was game over for me.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to continue, plus I was mentally unstable. Going into that fight, I was very depressed and down, and anxious. I always had that goal of beating Klitschko that kept me on the straight and narrow path, but after that goal was taken away from me, I had nothing else that I could focus on to give me that drive.\n\n\u201cIt was like a total downward spiral and I didn\u2019t want to live anymore. I was happy to die at 27. I was happy to finish, that was it. Nothing or nobody could bring me back.\n\n\u201cNot my wife and kids. I didn\u2019t care. Every day I woke up, I just wanted to die.

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nJustice Ladiran Akintola of an Oyo State High Court sitting in Ibadan on Friday awarded N20billion exceptional and aggravated damages against the Federal Government and the Department of State Security (DSS) in a case of fundamental human rights instituted by the Yoruba Nation agitator, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho.\n\nThe court also granted all the 16 reliefs sought by Igboho, through his counsel, Chief Yomi Alliyu (SAN), and awarded additional cost of N2million against the respondents jointly and in favour of Igboho. The reliefs included a restraining order for the Federal Government and security agencies not to intimidate, harass and freeze Igboho\u2019s bank accounts.\n\nThe three respondents in the case with number M/435/2021 are Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), as the first respondent, as well as SSS as second respondent and Director of SSS in Oyo State as third respondent.\n\nIgboho had demanded N500billion as reparation for damages to his property, such as his house and exotic cars that include Mercedes Benz G-Class and 2019 Lexus Car during the invasion of his residence at Soka, Ibadan, Oyo State in the early hours of Thursday July 1, 2021 by DSS operatives.\n\nJustice Akintola had adjourned the case for either ruling or judgment, saying the case would be for ruling if the preliminary objections raised by the three respondents in the case succeeded, but would be for judgment if the objections failed.\n\nDeciding the preliminary objection yesterday, the court held that it did not find merit in the objection by the first respondent, who argued through his counsel, Abdullahi Abubakar, that the court lacked jurisdiction among other things to entertain the case.\n\nIn the main suit, Justice Akintola held that the reckless and indiscriminate shooting undertaken by the second and third respondents and their agents, which resulted in the death of two persons in Igboho\u2019s house, was in itself, a threat to the life of the applicant. He added that nobody shoots guns in order to entertain people. Such a conduct, the court held, has a serious potential of killing the victim, and at best constituting a serious threat to the life of the victim.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of any evidence that Nigeria was in a state of war, the style and procedure adopted by the second and third respondents and their agents in this case, is highly condemnable, reprehensible, crude and most unprofessional,\u201d the court said.\n\nJustice Akintola held further that with the benefit of hindsight, given the number of guns, arms allegedly recovered from the Igboho\u2019s premises on the fateful night, relative to the harm, damage and deaths, plus trauma inflicted on, not only the applicant, his households, guests, and neighbourhood, \u201cit is very doubtful if it worth the exercise at all.\u201d\n\nAccording to the court, it was not only the applicant that would have been traumatised by the overzealous and recklessness of the second and third respondents and their agents, the entire neighbourhood of the applicant\u2019s residence was thrown into serious squabbles and troubles.\n\n\u201cThe style adopted by the second and third respondents in the case should be condemned in strongest possible terms, especially even the fact that they are maintained by the Nigerian taxpayers. And yet they did not hesitate to unleash such mayhem on a Nigerian citizen, who has not been pronounced guilty of any crime by any court of the land,\u201d Justice Akintola said.\n\nThe court also stated that if the identity of individual agent of the second and third respondents that undertook this most bizarre and horrendous operation was known they would have been held liable for the serious infraction.\n\nCounsel to Igboho, Alliyu described the judgment as a victory for democracy in an interview with journalists after the court session, while counsel to Malami, Abdullahi Abubakar, declined an interview with journalists who wanted to know if his client would challenge the judgment at the Court of Appeal. But counsel to second and third respondents, T.A. Nurudeen, was not in court.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "Rev Chris Christian, Founder and Shepherd, Locust Army International: Why i\u2019m still a virgin at 56",
          "text": "In a country where there is a craze for private jets and materialism, Chris Christian has remained a sacred eunuch with an oath of poverty. The Shepherd or G.O. of Locust Army International, a church with many branches in Nigeria, Africa and worldwide, has no property to his name due to an oath. He does not have a wife at 56, and has no ambition in the future for any. The author of over 200 bestsellers spoke to HENRY AKUBUIRO in the church premises, Ajah, Lagos, where he addressed some topical issues facing the Nigerian church even as he gave reasons for his decision never to get married or have sexual relations with other challenges threatening the nation.\n\nThe recent death of Prophet T. B. Joshua has continued to draw contrasting reactions from sections of the Nigerian Christian community. Reverend Chris Okotie said T.B Joshua wasn\u2019t a genuine man of God, while Prophet Chukwuemeka Ohanaemere, better known as Odumeje or Indaboski denounced Okotie for his unrelenting stand. So who determines a real man of God?\n\nThere are principles to take into consideration. The Bible is a principled book. Because of the way the Pentecostal is, we don\u2019t have many knowledgeable preachers in Nigeria, and there is a lot of liberty. The church is not being censored by anybody on who should become a pastor. Therefore, a lot of people who are not qualified to be pastors are into pastoral work. As a result of that, there are numerous misunderstandings. They don\u2019t even think about the conditions, those principles that should qualify a man of God. The parameters they are using to measure who is a man of God in Nigeria are not actually the parameters.\n\nWhat are the parameters?\n\nGod is His Word and there are other principles that should make a genuine man of God. For instance, God cannot be monopolised. If you say you are a prophet and He is talking to you, He cannot only talk to one individual. So when one person is saying, \u201cGod said\u2026 \u201c, the person should allow what he said God said to be censored. Apart from being censored, there should be a kindred spirit. When Jesus came to the world, his ministry wasn\u2019t accepted by the Jews. But, at least, he recognised John the Baptist. So the messiahnism of the Sovereign Servant that Jesus accomplished was acceptable to John. So somebody should not say he is one tree in the forest.\n\nSo was Chris Okotie right in his criticisms?\n\nI was expecting you to ask me whether TB Joshua was right. I am not a judge, but I am thinking that, if TB Joshua was dead, whether he was right or wrong, he should be left alone.\n\nDon\u2019t you think T. B. Joshua\u2019s death has left a big vacuum in Nigeria?\n\nAll of us were surprised he died. Whether you like him or not, he influenced this country. That doesn\u2019t mean I am saying he is from God (laughs). But it\u2019s not possible to deny him that impact.\n\nWhen you said he influenced Nigeria, what exactly do you mean?\n\nIf you look at the tourism red light, many nations identified with the Synagogue. But I think people should be very careful, because Godliness is a mystery. We can\u2019t know everything. That\u2019s why some people should be guided not to say some things straight. There are some things that cannot be said straight. Somebody said when T. B. Joshua was about to be buried, an angel appeared, and some people disagreed. Look at that!\n\nProphet Odumeje said Chris Okotie had never performed any miracle in his life, but he had chosen to rubbish a prophet like T. B. Joshua who performed multiple miracles all over the world?\n\nA lot of things are spoken out of ignorance. It is not only through miracles that impact is made in the church. There are big ministries that miracle is not part of their calling. There are those who are just teachers. There are announcers. There are prophets who announce God\u2019s projects or programmes; they are not into healing. There are prophets. So people shouldn\u2019t see miracle work as the only arm of success. For instance, when John the Baptist came, he wasn\u2019t into miracle work. But Jesus testified that no one was greater than him. A ministry can be successful without that part. Sometimes you find it difficult to separate that part from witchcraft. Sometimes you are not sure of the source of that power, especially if it is separated from the Word. The Bible tells us there should be learning before power. There should be knowledge. As I often say, power is a projection of wisdom. So when somebody does not have knowledge and he is doing a lot of miracles, you should look at that being magical, because the first thing the word of God does to you is to transform the inner man, the soul of the man, and God doesn\u2019t depend on miracles to do it. So there is a lot of impact we make on people through fellowship.\n\nHow then do we distinguish between genuine miracles and fake ones, because most Nigerians are craving miracles now?\n\nThere are values associated with a genuine preacher, which should not be trifled with. When a preacher trifles with that, we suspect him. For instance, clarity of vision. Second is genuine attention to the word of God. The third is the character that word of God produces \u2014testimonies. There are things that, if you hear about men of God, you begin to wonder if they are genuine people. What you see is excessive materialism, the way prosperity is being flaunted as though it was the only criteria. The King died on the cross as a total sacrifice. So his name should not be traded with. The final criteria is association \u2014who is your father in the lord? At least, you should have someone to look onto, and then somebody you are encouraging.\n\nSo what do you have to say about a prophet like the celebrity prophet, Odumeje Indabosky?\n\nI don\u2019t know who Indabosky is. In the days of Acts of Apostles, there was a Bar Jesus. The Bible says he depended on sorcery to do wonders in the land of Samaria until Peter came. Still in the Acts of the Apostles, the Bible mentions another man who was using divination to get money for his master. There is a lot of magic going on. There are some men of God, if I say they are magical, you will be embarrassed. But, if you give them time \u2014because we are not judges \u2014 nature won\u2019t be patient.\n\nYou are 56 years now, have you changed your mind on getting married?\n\nThe oath of celibacy is for life. As long as I am on earth, it\u2019s just to give it totally to God. He made me that way. Handling temptations from females is not hard to handle if you make up your mind. I have created a structure that doesn\u2019t give room for temptation. My PA is a man. I don\u2019t travel to preach with a woman. A woman has not entered my apartment for about 5 years. I don\u2019t carry a woman in my car.\n\nWhy did you take the oath of celibacy?\n\nI didn\u2019t just take the oath. There are three categories of eunuchs: those made eunuchs by God; those who became eunuchs because of their contributions to the kingdom, and those who men made eunuchs to be used. I belong to the first category. I just discovered I was born that way for a purpose; for the work I came for. I am a preacher of a kind. And that particular oath of chastity shares a covenant with poverty. So, as long as I am not married, I won\u2019t have things. Even my Bible, books (both the ones I bought and the ones I wrote) all bear the name of the church, and not my personal name. This church premises is situated on 18 plots of land -\u2014that\u2019s about three hectares, from the gate to the sea. I bought it in the name of the church. It costs millions of naira. It doesn\u2019t bear my name as the owner because of that oath of poverty. So the oath is not just about chastity; it\u2019s also about poverty. So I don\u2019t believe in owning things. You don\u2019t preach prosperity to me. It\u2019s also a mystery. You know, I preach eternal life in the flesh. I don\u2019t fall sick. I don\u2019t go to the hospital. Meanwhile, I am out of sight of many, that is, I don\u2019t go to the supermarket. I don\u2019t visit people\u2019s houses on a regular basis. For instance, I haven\u2019t visited anybody\u2019s house for five years. People don\u2019t visit me at home except those I am living with. That\u2019s a restricted life.\n\nOne might say since you lead a life similar to a monk, you ought to be submitting yourself to daily strokes of the cane as monks of the old were used to. Are you not thinking in that direction?\n\n(laughs) Do I need to be flogged? I live a life of purpose, why should I be punished with strokes of the cane? (laughs). I don\u2019t need to be punished. The pain of the consecration is enough for me. The fire that sustains that oath is very hot, so there is no need for further pain.\n\nWere you ever in a relationship, or have you always been celibate? Do you have female friends?\n\nThere is an age of awareness. I passed through secondary school and university. And if you can see, people are praying in the hall. In the process, people come around; sometimes women cook food and give it to me, and I do pastoral work. But that relationship has its limits (laughs). As I told you, there are restrictions; no female church member visits me. I spent most of my time alone in my office. I only spend a little of my time at home daily.\n\nAre you a virgin?\n\nWhen you hear chastity, it\u2019s just that. The word \u201cchastity\u201d is deep. It\u2019s only those who are involved from God that know what\u2019s involved in it. The feelings of a eunuch can\u2019t be regular. If the emotions are regular, then you will have problems. That\u2019s the difference between a God made eunuch and a man made eunuch. If a man is meant to get married and he chose to be a eunuch, he may naturally have challenges in coping with it.\n\nThe oath is tied to why I came to this world. If I break it, I don\u2019t exist. The oath involves the altar here \u2014I don\u2019t bury people here. I mean, my church members don\u2019t die untimely deaths, because I have to pay that price to preserve the people and the church. It\u2019s not something I should not be hypocritical about. It\u2019s not whether people are watching me or not. God is watching me. So if I fail in my oath, the things attached to it will go. There are benefits that I enjoy because I live this way. There are certain angelic services I enjoy because of that life. I enjoy angelic massage, feeding and injection. If I need to be injected, when I lay down, they give it to me. If I am exhausted and I need to be ministered to, they will serve me. If I break the covenant, the benefits will fade. So I am better inside than outside. Some people wonder if I do it secretly, but I am not a hypocrite.\n\nHow then do you fight and conquer temptations? A handsome and successful man (of God) will have ladies drooling all over him. How do you cope?\n\nYou have asked me this before. There is a structure in place to checkmate that. For instance, I have never had a lady secretary or personal assistant. I don\u2019t travel with women. I don\u2019t live with women. Much of the work women would do for me is done by men. So the structure I have reduces the temptation. You know, there is power in contact. Apart from the structure on ground, I already have this nature in me. The eunuch\u2019s life is a spirit in a man; it\u2019s not a decision. That\u2019s why it works in consonance with poverty. I feel like helping pastors sometimes. They talk about prosperity, but they don\u2019t see the ability to see the negative side of accumulating wealth. Some of this wealth is not from genuine sources, but they don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why you see them falling sick. Sometimes when problems start coming to them, they can\u2019t trace the source because of avarice. They want to grab things.\n\nThat means you don\u2019t own mansions anywhere?\n\nIt\u2019s not possible. The oath is not unto man, so there is no need for hypocrisy. I have a camp that contains over a hundred rooms and halls. During camping, people use it. I am also developing this place in Ajah to house over a hundred rooms for the kingdom. That\u2019s the kind of thing I do. I build houses in a public place where people can use it. I have churches all over Nigeria and outside the country.\n\nDo you believe in other people getting married and do you conduct weddings in your church?\n\nWhy not? I have pastors all over the world. They are all married. I support them. There are some of them who wanted to remain single, but when I saw they were having pressures coping with it, I encouraged them to marry, but I haven\u2019t wedded anybody. Weddings take place in the church, however, but my regional coordinators and pastors handle them. If I like, I attend. If I don\u2019t like, I won\u2019t attend.\n\nMany men of God in this part of the world run their ministries with their wives, and some with their children. How do you run yours?\n\nThe pattern is there in the Bible. Peter wasn\u2019t Jesus\u2019 wife. Moses handed over to Joshua, and Elijah gave the mantle to Elisha. There is a structure that commands who is who in the ministry, that is, the organogram of this church has not brought any wife into it.\n\nHow do you counsel couples since you don\u2019t have a marriage experience?\n\n(laughs) You don\u2019t need to have a marriage experience to counsel. I have been a pastor for 28 years, so pastoring has given me that experience to handle such issues. I do counseling for couples, but that is not my major. You met me writing here.\n\nBy taking the oath of celibacy, are you not working against God\u2019s instruction that man should \u201cbe fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it?\u201d\n\nIf you look at what you said, God wants partnership for man; it\u2019s not necessarily wife. I am not here alone. I am working with a team of people. What God wants is dominion. You are talking of a natural family; there is also a spiritual family. The dominion I want is the dominion of God\u2019s kingdom, so I already have a team of people who are helping in the dominion, like church members, leaders \u2014in this place, we have coordinators and different kinds of pastors all over the country and beyond. And then, the fruitfulness is the evangelism, soul winning and church planting, just like Jesus who did have a wife; just like Apostle Paul; just like Elijah accomplished so many things without a natural family.\n\nRecently, Edo State was in the news for trying to impose compulsory vaccination on the people, including churches and mosques, who have to show their vaccination certificates in order to enter the church. Even the state chapter of CAN was reported to have given tacit support before protests erupted against it\u2026.\n\nThat\u2019s an embarrassment. CAN shouldn\u2019t support that. Except for organisations or a particular church where the head is being led that way. They should not force things that require choice. They should not force somebody to live or die. If somebody thinks vaccination will help him live and another says he doesn\u2019t need it, nobody should be forced. It\u2019s possible for the vaccine to have a negative influence on people who didn\u2019t really accept it, but it\u2019s a matter of choice. Nobody should impose compulsory vaccination on Nigerians. For instance, I won\u2019t vaccinate; I don\u2019t believe in it. I cannot vaccinate at this time in my life. Don\u2019t you know I am not married? It\u2019s not a normal life. I don\u2019t believe in death, for instance. I don\u2019t take drugs. I haven\u2019t taken drugs for ten years, and I won\u2019t anytime. Why should I vaccinate? Have you met me on the road before?\n\nSeven years ago, I was given an award in Ghana as The Best Inspirational Writer, but I didn\u2019t travel to receive it. Another group gave me an award in Cotonou, and I didn\u2019t go. They gave me another one in Togo, I didn\u2019t go. Some journalists asked me, \u201cShepherd, are you afraid of light?\u201d I asked them how, and they said, \u201cBecause they will capture you.\u201d I told them I would go with time\u201d (laughs).\n\nThe recent takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban has raised fears there might be a replica in Nigeria if care is not taken. Do Nigerian Christians have to worry?\n\nNo, those who are saying that are not right. Afghanistan is a different country from Nigeria from religious setting to geographical differences. Afghanistan is predominantly Islamic, while Nigeria is about 50-50. So how does an Hausa man, for instance, come to Enugu and say everybody should become a Muslim. That means nobody would be alive.\n\nBut Benue State governor, Samuel Orton, has continued to talk about a covert plan to islamise Nigeria\u2026\n\nIf it is true, it\u2019s not everything anybody attempts that works. I get embarrassed when people say there is an attempt to Islamise a country that is complicated. Do you know that I came from a village in Anambra where nobody knew anything about Islam? Even Anambra as a state doesn\u2019t understand Islam. I grew up not knowing anything about Islam. So how do you Islamise us?\n\nSo the fears are unfounded?\n\nYes. Even in the north itself, like Taraba, Plateau, Borno states, they have a big Christian population.\n\nSo what do you have to say about the Plateau killings where several states had to hurriedly evacuate their students, mainly Christians, from Jos? Is there any way out of the recurring killings?\n\nThe problem cannot be solved completely because of the mix-up. You just manage it. We need intelligent leaders. I lived in Jos more than 30 years ago as a student at UNIJOS. It has always been like this. Once in a while, things flare up. Jos is predominantly a Christian area. While it happens in Jos is because the Plateau man is also fierce; he is also fierce. His tolerance is low, too. So there are constant confrontations. When the Muslims come up with intimidation, they react, and they (Christians) are more in number.\n\nWhy do you think these problems persist?\n\nNigeria as a nation doesn\u2019t have sacrificial leaders who really love the country. That is why politics has its problems. People care more about what they get, and, when they care more about what they get, they turn their eyes against the evil in the land like the constant banditry and kidnapping. If our politicians are genuine, they will stop these things. We should also be courageous to say that some of these things are encouraged by our politicians. Some people who don\u2019t like Buhari steer up some of these things to make his government ungovernable, even among the governors. Look at what is happening in Zamfara and Katsina. The other day, roads were blocked and motorists were stopped from moving in Katsina. That is Buhari\u2019s home state, it\u2019s embarrassing. The politicians are the ones causing these problems. Sometimes you wonder if these things would end, because, if Buhari, as an ex soldier, can\u2019t handle it, it might be more difficult for somebody who doesn\u2019t come from a military background or an inexperienced person to solve. Buhari is an experienced person.\n\nWhile Buhari was encouraged to take over from Jonathan, we thought he could solve these problems. You can see that the north was more peaceful during Jonathan\u2019s time than now. The issue of banditry and kidnappings were not there then. It was only Boko Haram. Now, other things have joined. The Fulani herdsmen menace is spreading in the north. It wasn\u2019t like that before. Look at the NDA attack and kidnapping the other day in Kaduna.\n\nWhat about dividing the country as being canvassed by separatist groups?\n\nNot exactly. Nigeria\u2019s problems are not what one man can solve. What I think we should do is for the godfathers of Nigeria to prayerfully come together and look at what\u2019s possible, because Nigeria is good to be together, not carving out Oduduwa or Biafra republics. That Biafra is not genuine. The ulterior motive is excessive individualism, making gains from people. It\u2019s just like that in Yorubaland. What is necessary is restructuring, with more powers to the regions, so that people can control their areas. If Nigeria must continue to be together, I think it must be done. If Nigeria would be at peace, people should withdraw to themselves and encourage themselves and come with a voice to meet the centre. Buhari may not be able to do it, but the next president, somebody who loves Nigeria, should bring Nigeria to restructure.\n\nIn the meantime, Nigerians should have more tolerance for each other. When you ban open grazing, it\u2019s not good to tell our Fulani brothers to leave the states totally if arrangements haven\u2019t been made for them. If a state can provide land, why not? They are our brothers. Saying that Nigerians should not be in the midst of Nigerians is not right. It\u2019s not every Fulani man who is carrying an AK 47. Forty years ago, I grew up seeing Fulani nomads going about peacefully. So they should look at the problems and nip it in the bud. We shouldn\u2019t label every Igbo man an IPOB member. So we shouldn\u2019t look at every Fulani man as a killer. Nigerians should learn to tolerate one another. Nigerians should accept their destiny as Nigerians and find godly ways to solve them.\n\nNigeria is a country in prophecy. Despite the evil men, there are genuine men of God, Christians and Muslims, and their percentage is high. So we have hope. Nigeria is better as one. The problems won\u2019t end even if we divide.\n\nWhat\u2019s new?\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.\n\nNext month, the second week of October, we are going to have a programme called \u201cWonder of that Last Age\u201d. We are inviting pastors from all over the world to attend the programme. There is no evil we cannot conquer if we trust God enough. When we trust Him, the light of change should come from His presence.",

institutions like World Bank, IFAD, AFD, three others\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Presidency Saturday listed 15 projects spread across the nation\u2019s six geo-political zones as those to be financed with the over $4 billion to be sourced from multilateral institutions, under the 2018-2021 medium term (rolling) external borrowing plan.\n\nPresidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, in a release issued on Saturday stated that President Muhammadu Buhari had requested the Senate to approve sovereign loans of $4.054bn and \u20ac710million as well as grant components of $125m for the proposed projects.\n\nAccording to the letter addressed to the President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan by the President, the sovereign loans will be sourced from the World Bank, French Development Agency (AFD), China-Exim Bank, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Credit Suisse Group and Standard Chartered/China Export and Credit (SINOSURE).\n\nThe President\u2019s request to the Senate listed 15 proposed pipeline projects, the objectives, the implementation period, benefiting States, as well as the implementing Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).\n\nA breakdown of the \u2018\u2018Addendum to the Proposed Pipeline Projects for the 2018-2021 Medium Term (rolling) External Borrowing Plan,\u2019\u2019 showed that the World Bank is expected to finance seven projects including the $125million grant for \u2018\u2018Better Education Services for All\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe Global Partnership for Education grant is expected to increase equitable access for out-of-school children and improve literacy in focus states.\n\nThe grant, which will be implemented by the Federal Ministry of Education and the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC), will strengthen accountability for results in basic Education in Katsina, Oyo and Adamawa States.\n\nOther projects to be financed by the World Bank are, the State Fiscal, Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability Programme for Results as well as the Agro-Processing, Productivity, Enhancement and Livelihood Improvement Support Project.\n\nThe benefiting States for the agro-processing project are, Kogi, Kaduna, Kano, Cross River, Enugu and Lagos with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development as the implementing ministry.\n\nThe objective of the project is to enhance agricultural productivity of small and medium scale farmers and improve value addition along priority value chains in the participating States.\n\nSimilarly, the World Bank is also financing the Nigeria Sustainable Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project in Delta, Ekiti, Gombe, Kaduna, Katsina, Imo and Plateau States, for the next five years.\n\nThe project, when completed, is expected to improve rural water supply, sanitation and hygiene nationwide towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for water supply and sanitation by 2030.\n\nUnder the external borrowing plan, the World Bank supported projects also include Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Project (COPREP), under the supervision of the Federal Ministry of Health and Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).\n\nThe project, which has an implementation period of 5 years, will respond to threats posed by COVID-19 through the procurement of vaccines.\n\nFurthermore, no fewer than 29 States are listed as beneficiaries of the Agro-Climatic Resilience in Arid Zone Landscape project, which is expected to reduce natural resource management conflicts in dry and semi-arid ecosystems in Nigeria.\n\nThe benefiting states for the project to be co-financed by World Bank and European Investment Bank (EIB) are: Akwa Ibom, Borno, Oyo, Sokoto, Kano, Katsina, Edo, Plateau, Abia, Nasarawa, Delta, Niger, Gombe, Imo, Enugu, Kogi, Anambra, Niger, Ebonyi, Cross River, Ondo, Kaduna, Kebbi, Jigawa, Bauchi, Ekiti, Ogun, Benue, Yobe and Kwara.\n\nThe World Bank is also funding the Livestock

Apapa-TinCan Island Port, under the Lagos-Ibadan Railway modernisation project.\n\nThe French Development Agency will finance two projects, which include the National Digital Identity Management project and the Kaduna Bus Rapid Transport Project.\n\nThe digital identity project will be co- financed with World Bank and EIB.\n\nThe Value Chain Development Programme to be financed by IFAD and implemented in Anambra, Benue, Ebonyi, Niger, Ogun, Taraba, Nasarawa, Enugu and Kogi States will empower 100,000 farmers, including over 6,000 and 3,000 processors and traders respectively.\n\nThe loan facility to be provided by European ECA/KfW/IPEX/APC will be spent on the construction of the Standard Gauge Rail (SGR) linking Nigeria with Niger Republic from Kano-Katsina-Daura-Jibiya-Maradi with branch to Dutse.\n\nThe specific project title, Kano-Maradi SGR with a branch to Dutse, has an implementation period of 30 months and will be implemented by the Federal Ministry of Transport.\n\nThe Chinese African Development Fund through the Bank of China is expected to provide a loan facility of $325 million for the establishment of three power and renewable energy projects including solar cells production facility Phase 1 & II , electric power transformer production, Plants 1, II, III and high voltage testing laboratory.\n\nThe National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI) will implement the project aimed at increasing local capacity and capability in the development of power and renewable energy technologies and infrastructure.\n\nCredit Suisse will finance major industrialisation projects as well as micro, small and medium enterprises schemes to be executed by the Bank of Industry while SINOSURE and Standard Chartered Bank will provide funds for the provision of 17MW Hybrid Solar Power infrastructure for the National Assembly (NASS) complex.\n\nThe project, with an implementation period of five years, is expected to address \u2018\u2018NASS power supply deficit and reduce higher overhead burdensome cost of running and maintaining fossil fuel generators (25MW installed capacity) to power the assembly complex.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari had in a request letter dated August 24, 2021 sought the consideration and approval of the Senate to take $4.054 billion, \u00a3710 million and $125 million external loans to fund projects captured under the 2018-2021 borrowing plan.\n\nThe President\u2019s letter was read by President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, last Tuesday at the commencement of plenary after a two-month annual recess of the National Assembly.\n\nThe President in the letter explained that the projects listed in the 2018-2021 Federal Government Borrowing Plan are to be financed through sovereign loans from the World Bank, French Development Agency (AFD), China-Exim Bank, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Credit Suisse Group and Standard Chatered/China Export and Credit (SINOSURE) in the total sum of USD4,054,476,863.00; Euro 710,000,000.00 and Grant Component of USD125,000,000.00.\n\nHe explained that the amount would be used to fund Federal and States Government projects cut across key sectors such as Infrastructure, Health, Agriculture and Food Security, Energy, Education and Human Capital Development and COVID-19 Response efforts.\n\nAccording to the President, the projects which are spread across the six geo-political zones of the country would bring about employment generation and poverty reduction, as well as protection of the most vulnerable and very poor segments of the Nigerian society.\n\nThe letter read in part: \u201cI write in respect of the above subject and to submit the attached addendum to the proposed 2018-2021 Federal Government External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan for the consideration and concurrent approval of the Senate for same to become effective.\n\n\u201cThe Senate President may wish to recall that I earlier transmitted a request on the proposed 2018-2020 Federal Government External Borrowing Plan for the concurrent approval of the Senate in May, 2021.\n\n\u201cHowever, in view of other emerging needs and to ensure that all critical projects approved by FEC as at June 2021 are incorporated, I hereby forward and addendum to the proposed Borrowing Plan.\n\n\u201cThe Projects listed in the addendum to the 2018-2021 Federal Government External Borrowing Plan are to be financed through sovereign loans from the World Bank, French Development Agency (AFD), China-Exim Bank, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Credit Suisse Group and Standard Chatered/China Export and Credit (SINOSURE) in the total sum of USD4,054,476,863.00; Euro 710,000,000.00 and Grant Component of USD125,000,000.00.\n\n\u201cThe Senate is kindly invited to note that the projects and programmes in the Borrowing Plan were selected based on positive, technical and economic evaluations and the contribution they would make to the socio-economic development of the country including employment generation and poverty reduction as well as protection of the most vulnerable and very poor segments of the Nigerian society.\n\n\u201cThe Senate may also wish to note that all the listed projects in the addendum form part of the 2018-2021 External Borrowing Plan and cover both the Federal and States Government projects and are geared towards the realization of the Nigeria Economic Sustainability Plan that cut across key sectors such as Infrastructure, Health, Agriculture and Food Security, Energy, Education and Human Capital Development and COVID-19 Response efforts.\n\n\u201cGiven the importance attached to the timely delivery of the projects listed in the proposed Borrowing Plan and the benefits both the Federal and State Governments stand to gain from the implementation of same, I hereby wish to request for the kind consideration and concurrent approval of the Senate for projects listed in the addendum to the 2018-2021 Federal Government External Borrowing Plan to enable the projects become effective.\u201d\n\nShare this:

          "text": "One youth killed, two vehicles burnt\n\nBy Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba\n\nHRM Ifechukwude Aninshi Okonjo II, the Obi of Ogwashi-Uku kingdom in Aniocha South Local Government Area of Delta State has escaped what appeared like a planned attack on the monarch.\n\nHowever, the attack Friday on the traditional ruler, who is the brother of the Director-General of World Trade Centre (WTO), Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, left one person dead while two vehicles were burnt.\n\nSeveral vehicles were reportedly damaged during the incident but THISDAY learnt that HRM Ifechukwude and a number of his palace chiefs escaped unhurt.\n\nThere were conflicting reports as to who masterminded the attack on the convoy of the royal father of the Ogwashi-Uku Kingdom, with one source blaming the attack on \u201csome irate youths at the (neighboring) Otulu satellite town\u201d while another account claimed that some secret cult members carried out the attack.\n\nThe Ogwashi-Uku traditional ruler was said to have led a high-calibre team, comprising members of his Obi-in-Council and some community leaders to the satellite town to perform certain traditional rites, including prayers, intended to usher peace into the whole community.\n\nEyewitness accounts said that some youths of Otulu community had made bonfire on the road leading to the town apparently to barricade the monarch\u2019s convoy and block his exit from the town after performing the said rites.\n\nAll entreaties by the Obi\u2019s younger brother, Prince Onyema Okonjo, and security agents to let the Obi have his right of way were allegedly unheeded by the irate youths.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that youths of Otulu had recently embarked on protest march, demanding that relevant authorities in the state should grant the Otulu satellite community autonomous status.\n\nOne of the protesting youths was said to have been hit by a bullet in the ensuing confusion as the security personnel attempt to disarm the youths and to dismantle the barricade, leading to the reported casualty.\n\nThe sight of one of their colleague\u2019s blood reportedly infuriated the protesting youths, who then launched attack on vehicles in the Monarch\u2019s convoy with two of them burnt and several others damaged.\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer Bright Edafe, a deputy superintendent of police (DSP), while confirming the report on Saturday, said that the Ogwashi-Uku king had gone to Otulu, a satellite town of Ogwasi-Uku, to perform some traditional rites and, in the process, a certain fence fell, prompting the youths to go on the rampage.\n\nConsequently, two vehicles were burnt while the youth who was hit by stray bullet eventually died.\n\nMeanwhile, the traditional ruler has affirmed that Otulu remains part and parcel of Ogwashi-Uku kingdom, stressing that the agitation by a few to carve out Otulu from Ogwashi-Uku as an autonomous community was unwarranted and unacceptable.\n\nA statement from the palace of the monarch on Saturday also confirmed the incident, blaming the attack on cultists but was silent on whether there was any casualty from the entourage of the Obi of Ogwashi-Uku, who the statement said \u201csurvived the cultists\u2019 attack\u201d on the convoy.\n\nPrince Greg Okwumbu, the spokesman of the monarch said in the statement, \u201cObi and members of the Council of Ogwashi-Uku visited Otulu Ogwashi-Uku Friday, September 17, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe visit was largely successful and the Obi met members of the community, prayed with them and discussed with them about some issues.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the visit and when the Obi was departing, cultists and thugs imported into Otulu who were aware of the visit attacked members of the entourage who were at the rear of the convoy.\n\n\u201cThe thugs also attempted to forcefully seize a gun belonging to a law enforcement member who escorted the Obi on the visit. It is important to note that members of the press accompanied the Obi on the visit.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, law enforcement agents from the office of the Area Commander and the Brigade Command in Asaba were also there at the visit and witnessed everything that happened\u201d, he noted, adding, \u201cThe people who sponsored the thugs are known to us and will be brought to justice.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Accuses them of dishonesty, says their body language shows party not interested in power shift\n\nBennett Oghifo\n\nGovernor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State yesterday mocked governors of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum who joined in adopting the resolution for power shift to the South, saying their body language shows the party won\u2019t zone the Presidency to the South.\n\nThe Southern governors, led by Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, had in a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of their meeting in Enugu State on Thursday insisted on power shift to the South.\n\nUmahi, who spoke on a television programme yesterday, alleged the PDP governors at the meeting in Enugu were being dishonest with their claim that they are keen about the 2023 presidency going to the South.\n\nHe said: \u201cOne or two governors that own PDP, their body language suggests that are against zoning and I can tell you from reliable source that they are thinking just for their own interest.\n\n\u201cThe truth remains that a number of us \u2013 the Southern Governors \u2013 that were in that meeting; that did say that Presidency must come to South, especially PDP, are not being honest. Let\u2019s see what they (PDP) come up with in their zoning in the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cThere are a couple of decisions taken at the Southern Governors\u2019 meeting that I know that together, there is sincerity of purpose in them. But when it comes to politics, I see the hand of Esau and the voice of Jacob.\u201d\n\nThe Ebonyi State Governor warned that the alleged dishonesty of the PDP governors in the Forum might threaten the unity of the Southern governors.\n\nUmahi also opposed the resolution of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum supporting the collection of the Value Added Tax by states.\n\nHe knocked his colleagues on the platform for being \u201cselfish\u201d, adding that he won\u2019t pursue VAT collection or implement the decision of the Forum on the issue.\n\nUmahi said the resolution of the Forum on VAT did not reflect his stand.\n\nThe Ebonyi State Governor, who was represented at the Enugu Southern governors\u2019 meeting by his deputy, Kelechi Igwe, said: \u201cIn any gathering, the minority will have their say and the majority will have their way. For example, there was an issue that came up on VAT; I\u2019m not sure it is clear to some of our colleagues but it is very clear to me.\n\n\u201cWe (Ebonyi) took a stand as a state with our leaders on the issue of the VAT war that is ongoing and so my deputy carried it on to say that this is what my governor is saying and this is what the state is saying and he went ahead to explain with some other deputies that represented their governors.\n\n\u201cBut together, they were in the minority and it didn\u2019t stop the majority from coming up with their communiqu\u00e9. When it comes up to implementation and voicing out, I will continue to say \u2018this is where I stand\u2019, if it is a choice, I will choose what would benefit my state.\u201d\n\nUmahi continues: \u201cThere is no state in the country that is not enjoying the help of other states. When they (Southern governors) said this VAT collection is part of true restructuring, I said I never believe in total restructuring; I believe in administrative restructuring.\u201d\n\nUmahi said a number of states would collapse should VAT collection move from the federal to the sub-nationals.\n\nHe said it was not right that some states would \u201ceat and have so much surplus and then some other states don\u2019t have much to eat.\u201d\n\nUmahi said: \u201cWe have to be our brother\u2019s keeper; we have to see how we can grow the economies of the weakest states, otherwise, we will breed insecurity in those states. There is no way in a relationship that you will get 100 per cent of what you put in, it doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether Ebonyi State would be viable for VAT collection, should the court rule that sub-nationals have the power to collect VAT within their domains, Umahi said: \u201cI have said that my state would not be viable and I will continue to say that more than 30 other states would not be viable; we should not break the states.\n\n\u201cWhatever thing we are doing, we have to think about the nation first. Let\u2019s tarry a while and see how we can pass this river and then we can come to the fact of who is right and who is wrong.\n\n\u201cTrue federalism is not done in a day. If we want to do a restructuring, we have to have a gradual process to do that.\u201d\n\nVAT is a consumption tax paid when goods are purchased and services are rendered. It is charged at a rate of 7.5 per cent.\n\nAlthough Rivers and Lagos states have started the process of collecting VAT within their territories, the Court of Appeal in a ruling on September 10 stopped the collection pending the determination of an appeal filed by the Federal Inland Revenue Service against the judgment of the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, which favoured collection of VAT by states.\n\nApart from Lagos and Rivers states, Ogun State has also started the process of passing a bill on VAT in its House of Assembly.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Both of the applicant\u2019s parents sustained grave injuries from the military invasion and both of them eventually succumbed to those injuries and are now late.\n\n\u201cThat in the course of the invasion, the applicant managed to escape to a safe location from where he managed to flee overseas to save his life. That there was neither a court order revoking the applicant\u2019s bail nor any arrest warrant that could have justified the deadly military assault.\n\n\u201cThat had the President implemented the provisional measures, the applicant would have felt safe enough to voluntarily end his exile and return to Nigeria to face prosecution in the said charge under reference therein. That in the course of his exile, the applicant on or about May 5, 2021, entered the Republic of Kenya on his British passport and was admitted as such as Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Nairobi. After his admission, the applicant settled in at a temporary location in Nairobi, Kenya.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Kanu then went on to reveal in detail the \u201cabduction\u201d of Nnamdi Kanu from the East African country and his ordeal in the hands of the Nigerian security operatives at a private residence where he was taken to.\n\nHe said, \u201cThat on June 19, 2021, the applicant drove himself and without any companion to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, to drop off a friend at the airport. That as soon as the applicant pulled to stop at the parking lot and alighted from his vehicle, about twenty respondent\u2019s agents (hereafter abductors) violently accosted and abducted the applicant, handcuffed and blindfolded him, bundled him in a vehicle and sped away, while telling onlookers that the applicant is a \u201cterrorist separatist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat the applicant\u2019s abductors took him to a nondescript private house (not a police station) somewhere in Nairobi, Kenya, and chained him to the floor. That while chained to the floor, the applicant\u2019s abductors took turns to beat him torturing him to a point that he fainted several times and was intermittently revived when they poured cold water on him. That to prevent the applicant\u2019s anguished screaming from being heard in the vicinity, the applicant\u2019s abductors tied a cloth over his mouth and so close to covering his nostrils that the applicant struggled to breathe.\n\n\u201cThat the applicant remained chained to the floor for eight days and was thus forced to relieve himself of urine and excrement where he was chained with same being smeared all over his body. That throughout the duration of the applicant\u2019s captivity, he was not allowed to bathe and was fed only on bland bread once a day and given non-sanitary water to drink.\u201d\n\nSahara Reporters had on September 7 reported that Ejimakor, lawyer to the detained IPOB leader, headed to court over the latter's health issues.\n\nIt had been reported that the access roads to the court were blocked by truckloads of the military, police and other security agencies, which created fear in road users in Umuahia.\n\nEjimakor, in an application, Nnamdi Kanu Vs Federal Government of Nigeria and seven others, had brought an ex parte order asking the court to, among other things, make an interim order of release of Kanu to attend to his health in any medical facility of his choice in Nigeria, pending the hearing of the motion.\n\nThe high court presided over by Justice K. C. J. Okereke had asked the lawyer to put the respondents on notice.\n\nIn an elaborate statement released later that day, Ejimakor had said, \u201cToday, I secured an Order from the High Court of Abia State to serve by substituted means an Application for enforcement of the Fundamental Rights of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, which I recently brought before the High Court of Abia State.\n\n\u201cThe next hearing date is set for 21st September, 2021 in Umuahia. The material issue is the unbroken chain of infringements that began with the 2017 extrajudicial attempt on Kanu\u2019s life in Abia State; his involuntary flight to safety/exile; his abduction in Kenya and his extraordinary rendition to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe believe that these supervening issues have complicated Kanu\u2019s prosecution and thus must be judicially dispensed with before any further prosecutorial action can proceed. Accordingly, I have placed the following reliefs before the Court:\n\n\u201c1, A DECLARATION that the military invasion of the Applicant\u2019s building and premises at Isiama, Afaraukwu Ibeku, Abia State on 10th September, 2017 by the Respondents or their agents is illegal, unlawful, unconstitutional and amount to infringement of the Applicant's fundamental right to life, dignity of his person, his personal liberty and fair hearing as guaranteed under the pertinent provisions of Chapter IV of the Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (hereafter, CFRN) and the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act (hereafter, the Charter).\n\n\u201c2, A DECLARATION that the arrest of the Applicant in Kenya by the Respondents or their agents without due process of law is arbitrary, illegal, unlawful, unconstitutional and amounts to infringement of the Applicant's fundamental right against arbitrary arrest, to his personal liberty and to fair hearing as enshrined and guaranteed under the pertinent provisions of CFRN and the Charter.\n\n\u201c3, A DECLARATION that the torture and detention of the Applicant in Kenya by the Respondents or their agents is illegal, unlawful, unconstitutional and amounts to infringement of the Applicant's fundamental right against torture and to fair hearing, as enshrined and guaranteed under the pertinent provisions of CFRN and the Charter).\n\n\u201c4, A DECLARATION that the expulsion of the Applicant from Kenya to Nigeria by the Respondents or their agents and their consequent detention and planned prosecution of the Applicant in Charge No: FHC/ABJ/CR/383/2015 (Federal Republic of Nigeria v. Nnamdi Kanu) is illegal, unlawful, unconstitutional and amount to infringement of the Applicant's fundamental right against unlawful expulsion and detention, and to fair hearing, as enshrined and guaranteed under the pertinent provisions of CFRN and the Charter).\n\n\u201c5, AN ORDER OF INJUNCTION restraining the Respondents or their agents from taking any further step in the prosecution of the Applicant in Charge No: FHC/ABJ/CR/383/2015 (Federal Republic of Nigeria v. Nnamdi Kanu) pursuant to said unlawful expulsion of the Applicant from Kenya to Nigeria.\n\n\u201c6, AN ORDER mandating and compelling the the Respondents or their agents to forthwith release the Applicant from detention and restitute or otherwise restore Applicant to his liberty, same being his state of being as of 19th June, 2021; and to thereupon repatriate the Applicant to his country of domicile (to wit: Britain) to await the outcome of any formal request the Respondents may file before the competent authorities in Britain for the lawful extradition of the Applicant to Nigeria to continue his prosecution in Charge No: FHC/ABJ/CR/383/2015 (Federal Republic of Nigeria v.

That throughout the duration of the applicant\u2019s captivity, he was not allowed to bathe and was fed only on bland bread once a day and given non-sanitary water to drink.\u201d\n\nSahara Reporters had on September 7 reported that Ejimakor, lawyer to the detained IPOB leader, headed to court over the latter's health issues.\n\nIt had been reported that the access roads to the court were blocked by truckloads of the military, police and other security agencies, which created fear in road users in Umuahia.\n\nEjimakor, in an application, Nnamdi Kanu Vs Federal Government of Nigeria and seven others, had brought an ex parte order asking the court to, among other things, make an interim order of release of Kanu to attend to his health in any medical facility of his choice in Nigeria, pending the hearing of the motion.\n\nThe high court presided over by Justice K. C. J. Okereke had asked the lawyer to put the respondents on notice.\n\nIn an elaborate statement released later that day, Ejimakor had said, \u201cToday, I secured an Order from the High Court of Abia State to serve by substituted means an Application for enforcement of the Fundamental Rights of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, which I recently brought before the High Court of Abia State.\n\n\u201cThe next hearing date is set for 21st September, 2021 in Umuahia. The material issue is the unbroken chain of infringements that began with the 2017 extrajudicial attempt on Kanu\u2019s life in Abia State; his involuntary flight to safety/exile; his abduction in Kenya and his extraordinary rendition to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe believe that these supervening issues have complicated Kanu\u2019s prosecution and thus must be judicially dispensed with before any further prosecutorial action can proceed. Accordingly, I have placed the following reliefs before the Court:\n\n\u201c1, A DECLARATION that the military invasion of the Applicant\u2019s building and premises at Isiama, Afaraukwu Ibeku, Abia State on 10th September, 2017 by the Respondents or their agents is illegal, unlawful, unconstitutional and amount to infringement of the Applicant's fundamental right to life, dignity of his person, his personal liberty and fair hearing as guaranteed under the pertinent provisions of Chapter IV of the Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (hereafter, CFRN) and the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act (hereafter, the Charter).\n\n\u201c2, A DECLARATION that the arrest of the Applicant in Kenya by the Respondents or their agents without due process of law is arbitrary, illegal, unlawful, unconstitutional and amounts to infringement of the Applicant's fundamental right against arbitrary arrest, to his personal liberty and to fair hearing as enshrined and guaranteed under the pertinent provisions of CFRN and the Charter.\n\n\u201c3, A DECLARATION that the torture and detention of the Applicant in Kenya by the Respondents or their agents is illegal, unlawful, unconstitutional and amounts to infringement of the Applicant's fundamental right against torture and to fair hearing, as enshrined and guaranteed under the pertinent provisions of CFRN and the Charter).\n\n\u201c4, A DECLARATION that the expulsion of the Applicant from Kenya to Nigeria by the Respondents or their agents and their consequent detention and planned prosecution of the Applicant in Charge No: FHC/ABJ/CR/383/2015 (Federal Republic of Nigeria v. Nnamdi Kanu) is illegal, unlawful, unconstitutional and amount to infringement of the Applicant's fundamental right against unlawful expulsion and detention, and to fair hearing, as enshrined and guaranteed under the pertinent provisions of CFRN and the Charter).\n\n\u201c5, AN ORDER OF INJUNCTION restraining the Respondents or their agents from taking any further step in the prosecution of the Applicant in Charge No: FHC/ABJ/CR/383/2015 (Federal Republic of Nigeria v. Nnamdi Kanu) pursuant to said unlawful expulsion of the Applicant from Kenya to Nigeria.\n\n\u201c6, AN ORDER mandating and compelling the the Respondents or their agents to forthwith release the Applicant from detention and restitute or otherwise restore Applicant to his liberty, same being his state of being as of 19th June, 2021; and to thereupon repatriate the Applicant to his country of domicile (to wit: Britain) to await the outcome of any formal request the Respondents may file before the competent authorities in Britain for the lawful extradition of the Applicant to Nigeria to continue his prosecution in Charge No: FHC/ABJ/CR/383/2015 (Federal Republic of Nigeria v. Nnamdi Kanu).\n\n\u201c7, AN ORDER mandating and compelling the Respondents to issue an official Letter of Apology to the Applicant for the infringement of his fundamental rights; and publication of said Letter of Apology in three (3) national dailies.\n\n\u201c8, AN ORDER mandating and compelling the Respondents to pay the sum of N5,000,000,000.00 (Five Billion Naira) to the Applicant, being monetary damages claimed by the Applicant against the Respondents jointly and severally for the physical, mental, emotional, psychological and other damages suffered by the Applicant as a result of the infringements of Applicant\u2019s fundamental rights.\u201d\n\nAccording to the copy of the suit obtained by SaharaReporters, Ejimakor, had in a statement in support of the affidavit, had noted in his conclusion that the court should bar the Nigerian government from further prosecuting Kanu.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, we submit that there is an overriding need for his honourable court to bar the respondents from any further detention and prosecution of the applicant in charge Number, FHC/ABJ/CR/383/2015 followed by the immediate restoration of applicant to the liberty he enjoyed as of the date he was unlawfully and arbitrarily arrested. We therefore urge this honourable court to resolve the lone issue in favour of the applicant and to grant the prayers sought,\u201d Ejimakor said.",

He was, indeed, a pan Africanist of the finest hue.\n\n\u201cEver humble, he practised egalitarianism in truth and spirit. He never discriminated against the less privileged or those who did not share his religious views.

          "title": "A backstory to the tussle between CBN and forex rates platform abokiFX",
          "text": "abokiFX, a popular mobile and web-based platform that collates the black market foreign exchange rates in Nigeria, on Friday announced it will temporarily suspend the publishing of rates on all its platforms, hours after receiving threats from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThe apex bank had said it would shut down the platform, which Governor Godwin Emefiele described as \u201cillegal and criminal\u201d and accused of carrying out an \u201cillegal activity that undermines the economy\u201d.\n\nAfter the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s two-day meeting in Abuja, Emefiele confirmed that the apex bank was also planning to prosecute abokiFX\u2019s supposed owner, Olusegun Adedotun Oniwinde, for \u201cillegal forex trading\u201d and \u201ceconomic sabotage\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have given instructions to our experts to go after his website and let it be clear that we will go after him because we can\u2019t allow this to continue,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that the CBN does not recognize any foreign exchange market window apart from the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window.\n\nWhy Nigeria has different exchange rates\n\nNigeria is Africa\u2019s largest producer of oil, a commodity that brings in more than 90% of the country\u2019s foreign exchange earnings. Between 2014 to 2016, a plunge in global oil prices caused a dollar crunch that resulted in an economic recession.\n\nBut rather than an outright devaluation of the naira, the CBN adopted a multiple exchange-rate regime. This involved keeping a stronger rate pegged to the U.S. dollar for official transactions and a weaker floating rate for investors and exporters, known as the NAFEX window.\n\nOther rates were introduced for travelers and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) while there\u2019s also the parallel or black market, where foreign currencies are traded unofficially and the naira is often valued less than the NAFEX rate.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA historic plunge in oil prices triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic last year caused a more severe scarcity of hard currency in Nigeria. The CBN was forced to devalue the naira twice last year, amid other measures meant to stabilise the exchange rate such as limiting forex deposits and withdrawals over the counter and banning the sale of forex to exchange bureaus.\n\nIn March, the apex bank also replaced the exchange rate at the official window, set at \u20a6379/$1, with the NAFEX rate of \u20a6410.25/$1, as part of efforts to ditch the multiple exchange rate system that\u2019s been said to distort the market and frustrate foreign investors, in favor of a single-rate system. That left Nigeria with only two rates \u2013 the NAFEX rate and the parallel market rate \u2013 from almost five different rates as of early 2020.\n\nWhere abokiFX comes in\n\nBefore abokiFX, Nigerians wanting to change currencies in the unofficial black/parallel market could only obtain information on rates manually, such as through phone calls to money changers.\n\nHowever, the platform, which was launched in 2014 has gained popularity as a go-to source for information on the value of the naira against the major foreign currencies in the black market. It is used by market operators for trading and news organisations for reporting.\n\nIn recent weeks, and particularly after the CBN stopped forex sales to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators a month ago, the value of the naira has plummeted sharply, with the gap further widening between the parallel and NAFEX rates.\n\nBefore the ban, the local unit traded at around \u20a6520/$1 but fell to \u20a6570/$1 on Friday. A day before, the naira recorded its biggest single-day plunge in the parallel market in several months, a \u20a68.00 or 1.42% decline from \u20a6562/$1 on Wednesday to \u20a6570/$1, per abokiFX data.\n\nMeanwhile, data on the FMDQ securities exchange window, where forex is traded officially, showed that naira closed at \u20a6412.88/$1 on Friday. Currency speculators profit from this difference between the black market and official rates through round-tripping and other forms of currency manipulation practices that negatively affect the value of the local currency.\n\nAllegations of economic sabotage\n\nAccording to the CBN Governor, Oniwinde, who is based in the United Kingdom, publishes arbitrary rates without contacting BDCs and uses his website for forex manipulations and speculations, making profits from the significant disparity in rates quoted on abokiFX and the official exchange rate.\n\nEmefiele added that the apex bank had been studying the activities of the platform in the last two years. \u201cThere was a time we asked our colleagues to call the abokiFX to ask how he conducts the rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CBN act section 2, does make it clear that only the Central Bank can determine the value of the naira, and yet a single individual living in England continues to manipulate the exchange rate and make a huge profit which he withdraws through an ATM in London.\n\nA screenshot of the abokiFX website.\n\n\u201cIt is economic sabotage and we will pursue him, wherever he is, we will report him to international security agencies, we will track him, Mr. Oniwinde, we will find you, because we cannot allow you to continue to conduct an illegal activity that kills our economy,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\nThe CBN head also alleged that Oniwinde was an illegal forex dealer with over 20 bank accounts in eight banks that are filled with money from speculative activities and he\u2019s sold \u201ctens of millions of forex\u201d to several Nigerian companies, violating the country\u2019s foreign exchange laws.\n\nabokiFX debunks claims\n\nabokiFX in a statement released on Friday debunked the CBN\u2019s claims and said all allegations towards its director were not confirmed.\n\n\u201cAll allegations against our director are yet to be confirmed but we at abokiFX DO NOT trade FX nor do we manipulate parallel market rates,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cOutside the media allegation, we have not received any communication from any government body and our accounts are not closed as stipulated in the media.\u201d\n\nThe company has, however, temporarily suspended rate updates on all its platforms to \u201cget better clarity of the situation\u201d, adding that it \u201csincerely hopes the suspension will lead to the Naira appreciation from next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinal rates have been posted this evening but the abokiFX news section and the crypto rates section will still be active,\u201d the statement adds. \u201cWith our decision to temporarily suspend online rates publication, we are aware that there will be limited visibility of parallel rates information which will impact decision making for many.\u201d\n\nThe abokiFX statement.

          "title": "Africell exits Ugandan telecom market due to fierce competition",
          "text": "On September 7, Africell announced its decision to leave Uganda after operating in the East African country for seven years. The decision saw the U.S-owned company become the latest network operator to throw in the towel and exit a market dominated by two pan-African telecom behemoths.\n\nA statement issued by Africell blames tough competition from the local units of MTN and Bharti Airtel, both of which account for more than 90% of the market share. The remaining 10% is split between three or four other nationwide operators including Africell and Uganda Telecom.\n\nSouth Africa-based MTN Group, Africa\u2019s largest telecoms operator, entered Uganda in 1998 and has since established dominance in the market; largely due to first-mover advantage and significant investments the business has made in Uganda.\n\nAirtel, which launched 12 years later, has mainly relied on acquisitions to scale its market position. After entering Uganda through the purchase of Zain\u2019s operations, the company, in 2013, fully acquired Warid Telecom for $100 million; the first-ever in-country acquisition in the sector that increased Airtel\u2019s subscriber base by over 50%.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWith operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), The Gambia, and Sierra Leone, Africell launched in Uganda in 2014 after buying the local operations of French telecom giant, Orange.\n\nAt the time of the acquisition, 8 operators were serving a population of around 36 million Ugandan residents, with total subscriptions estimated at less than 20 million. It appeared Africell was entering an untapped market and the company bet on data services to eat into the market share of incumbents.\n\n\u201cWhen entering new markets, Africell\u2019s objective is always to introduce competition in a manner that benefits local consumers and communities,\u201d Sam Williams, the firm\u2019s communications director told TechCabal. \u201cIn Uganda, our goal was to provide an appealing alternative to the incumbent duopoly, by focusing (among other things) on fast and reliable data services.\u201d\n\nAfricell is reputed for its affordable internet service packages and relative network stability in Uganda, which saw it gain the trust of a substantial number of subscribers. But like its predecessors, the company struggled to make a notable impact in a mobile market reputedly hostile to new entrants.\n\nThe perils of playing third fiddle\n\nThe economics of being number three on the telecoms players list in a relatively small and saturated market makes little commercial sense for Africell or any potential entrant.\n\nUganda has over 24 million mobile subscribers with MTN controlling 50% of the market while Airtel Uganda accounts for 43%. This means newcomers are forced to share in a limited pool of subscribers left over by the leaders.\n\nFor instance, other telecom players in South Africa apart from MTN and Vodacom have struggled to make consistent profits. MTN also decided against reapplying for a license in Ethiopia, to avoid trailing behind Ethio Telecom and Safaricom.\n\nAccording to Williams, Africell \u201cbuilt a strong position\u201d in Ugandan urban centers already dominated by its competitors. However, a wider rollout to underserved areas would have required a significant longer-term investment that would have been difficult to recover given the size of Africell\u2019s market share.\n\n\u201cIn a market where two incumbents control that much market share already, it\u2019s definitely going to be very challenging for other operators to break in,\u201d Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer, told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cTelecommunications is capital intensive. Masts, towers, fibre, and data centres do not come cheap. Without a significant number of subscribers, it\u2019s going to be hard to recoup returns on investment.\u201d\n\nAn Africell Shop in Uganda. Image credit: Techjaja\n\nOrange invested significantly in new technologies before deciding to cut short its losses. Since it entered Uganda via a shareholding agreement with HiTS Telecom in 2009, the French firm was only able to get around 700,000 subscribers \u2013 roughly 3.3% of the market share at the time.\n\nAfricell claims to have grown the inherited number of subscribers to about 2.3 million within seven years, becoming the country\u2019s third-largest player, according to data available on the firm\u2019s website.\n\nHowever, data from Omdia shows that figure is closer to 1.6 million, some way off the pace compared to almost 15 million subscribers for MTN and 12.8 million for Airtel. It\u2019s also reportedly been losing its share of the market slowly, which fell from about 7% at the end of 2019 to 5% at the end of June 2021.\n\n\u201cWe decided to end operations following a careful analysis of how the Uganda business fits into our overall Africell Group strategy,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s a recognition of the fact that \u2013 in our view \u2013 investment in our other markets is a more sustainable route to our goal of advancing the African telecoms sector.\u201d\n\nA flurry of exits\n\nAfricell hasn\u2019t been the only victim of MTN and Airtel Uganda\u2019s dominance. Before Africell\u2019s decision to pack, at least four other players have either exited or been bought out by bigger players after failing to break into the inner circle of the market.\n\nIn addition to the acquisition of Warid, which at the time was the third-largest player and had offered the biggest threat to the MTN-Airtel duopoly, K2 Telecom\u2019s operation was absorbed by Airtel in 2018.\n\nSmart Telecom exited the market in August of this year; and Vodafone, with all its solid financial backing, could only challenge for three years before it eventually quit.\n\nWith Africell\u2019s exit, only three major network providers currently operate in Uganda, a landlocked country with a population of over 44 million people.\n\nWhat next for Africell?\n\nWhile it struggled to grow its market share, Africell also grappled with high operating costs and debt burden, part of which was inherited from Orange. In 2019, the company\u2019s losses reportedly rose to over Ksh1.5 trillion ($400 million), with the bulk of its debt due to cell tower operators.\n\nPart of the conditions set by the sector\u2019s regulator, the Uganda Communication Commission (UCC), before Africell formally winds up operations is the payments of its creditors. Without giving out specific details, Williams disclosed that discussions are currently ongoing between the relevant parties.\n\nIn 2019, Africell signed a financing agreement worth $100 million with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a U.S. government funding agency. The investment is expected to be deployed across Africell\u2019s remaining markets while it\u2019s also planning to launch operations in Angola by the end of this year.\n\nAfricell\u2019s exit from Uganda will come as good news to the likes of MTN, which is gearing up to sell 20% of its shares to the public via an IPO, in line with a government directive issued last year.\n\nCurrent Africell subscribers in the country must close their accounts and switch to alternative mobile providers by October 7, with the company saying it will provide support and guidance during the migration process.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Africell will return mobile sites to third-party owners while network technology equipment will be transferred to other units within the Africell Group. The operator\u2019s mobile frequency and spectrum holdings will be returned to the UCC and it claims to have notified GSMA of the termination of roaming partner agreements.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa",
          "text": "After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple has released the iPhone 13 series.\n\nDuring a virtual event on Tuesday, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 will come in four new models: the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about the iPhone 13 series?\n\nWell, it looks very much like the iPhone 12 but two notable main updates were made to the phone\u2019s display and camera. The new phones will also run on the latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS 15. They also come with larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 Terabyte storage), a new A15 Bionic processor, a smaller notch and new camera features.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe iPhone 13 starts at $829 for 128GB, which is twice the storage the iPhone 12 started with; while the iPhone 13 Mini starts at $729 for 128GB of storage. The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max start at $999 and $1,099 respectively, for 128GB storage.\n\nIPHONE 13 SERIES US PRICES AND STORAGE\n\nPhone 128GB storage 256GB storage 512GB storage 1TB storage iPhone 13 Mini $729 $829 $1,029 NA iPhone 13 $829 $929 $1,129 NA iPhone 13 Pro $999 $1,099 $1,299 $1,499 iPhone 13 Pro Max $1,099 $1,199 $1,399 $1,599\n\nWhy the iPhone 13 series are more expensive in African countries\n\nOver the years, there\u2019s been a noticeable price difference for Apple products in African countries. So, TechCabal reached out to iPhone retailers in different African countries to find out when the iPhone 13 will be available and how much it\u2019ll cost.\n\nNigeria\n\n\u201cOf course, you can expect that since the iPhone will be available on September 24, we\u2019ll have it in Nigeria on or before October 1.\u201d Emmanuel Osho, CEO of Bodds IT and Apple certified technician told TechCabal. \u201cThe price will be about 30% higher because it\u2019s new and there\u2019s a lot of hype around it.\u201d\n\nDespite the increased margin on the iPhone, Osho expects that the new iPhones will still sell out fast. A positive effect of the people purchasing the new iPhone 13 is that they\u2019ll most times trade in their older iPhones, making room for other people to buy them at a more affordable price.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Nigeria, at an exchange rate of $1/\u20a6550, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about \u20a6593,000.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, the iPhone 13 will reportedly be available from October 8 according to iStoreZA, an Apple premium reseller. Although the store hasn\u2019t revealed the prices, the iPhone 13 Pro 128GB is expected to go for around R23,499 ($1,640), while the iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB could retail for around R25,999 ($1,815). This is a high price margin of over 50%, most likely influenced by the fact that an iPhone or iPod attracts 7% duties and 15% VAT in South Africa per Business Insider.\n\nYou can expect that the price of iPhones from other retailers to be around the same price range as the majority of Apple products sold in South Africa come through a sole distributor, Core Computer Group.\n\nKenya\n\nIn Kenya, TechCabal spoke to a Salute iWorld, an authorized Apple product retailer at Yaya Center, Nairobi.\n\nA representative of the retailer told us that they expect to have the iPhone 13 in their stores within the next two weeks.\n\nWhile he couldn\u2019t comment on how much it\u2019ll cost he mentioned that in general Apple products are charged a 16% import fee with an additional 6% added on for Value Added Tax (VAT). This is aside from the transportation cost and the profit margin that the retailer will add to arrive at a final price for the public.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Kenya, at an exchange rate of $1/KSh110, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about KSh119,000.\n\nThe iPhone 13 looks like it offers a bit over its predecessor. But not so much that it\u2019ll compel many to upgrade. In the context of Africa, it brings up the question of whether the minor upgrades are worth paying at least an additional 30% \u2013 50% to get the new iPhone 13 in Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa.\n\nAlexandria Williams contributed to this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

Existing investors like Adjuvant Capital, KdT Ventures, Plexo Capital, Endeavor Capital, and Ingressive Capital participated in the round.\n\nLaunched in 2019 by Dr Abasi Ene-Obong (CEO), 54gene is a healthtech company centred around unlocking scientific discoveries and enhancing diagnosis and treatment outcomes across Africa and the rest of the world.\n\nThe funding will be used to expand its genomes and molecular diagnostics department across Africa, guaranteeing that African patients have access to reliable diagnostics and enabling the adoption of precision medicine in clinical settings throughout the continent.\n\nAccording to Dr Ene-Obong, the company plans to expand its contribution to global drug discovery by investing in the development of life science skills on the continent, something which this fund will facilitate.\n\nFor context on what 54gene does and why you should care, you should revisit this story as told by the startup\u2019s COO, Delali Attipoe.\n\nBuilding a hardware startup through resilience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObialunanma Nnaobi and Obasegun Ayodele.

Although Ayodele was introduced to the hardware space when he was in secondary school at LAUTECH International College in Ogbomosho, Nigeria, he failed at the four different startups he founded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut rather than throw in the towel, he learnt from his failures and moved on, knowledge in hand. Along the way, he debunked many entrepreneurial myths.\n\nChimgozirim took us through Ayodele\u2019s journey to building low-cost hardware solutions for Africans.\n\nRead his inspiring story: After failing at 4 startups, Obasegun Ayodele is making hardware accessible to Africans with Vilsquare.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s Privacy Roundtable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStealing online information\n\nIn January 2021, we conducted a Twitter poll to gauge public opinion on WhatsApp\u2019s planned privacy policy update. Of the 210 respondents, 118 were unconcerned about the policy change.\n\nFew African countries have data protection regulations. Senegal, for example, has implemented such regulations. However, the vast majority do not have any legislation in place.\n\nAccording to Privacy International, a UK-based registered charity that defends and promotes the right to privacy worldwide, although the number is slowly rising, only 24 African countries have adopted laws and regulations to protect personal data.\n\nBecause this is a problem in Africa, Techpoint Africa has launched the Privacy Roundtable, a monthly series focusing on privacy issues and happenings in Africa, with input from experts and non-experts.\n\nOgheneruemu gave us a sneak peek of what we can expect from this series.\n\nCurious?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOurPass, a digital commerce solution headquartered in Nigeria has announced its launch over a virtual event.\n\nRevealing the motivation for building the startup, Samuel Eze, co-founder and CEO disclosed that the idea for OurPass came from watching his mother struggle to make purchases online.\n\nAll too often, she had to switch between various eCommerce sites and frequently ended up not buying anything.\n\nFurther research showed that she was not the only one who had such challenges. With this evidence, he set out to solve the problem with OurPass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOurPass is a mobile app that enables consumers to shop in one click thereby reducing abandoned carts and increasing sales for merchants. All you have to do is to sign up on OurPass once and you\u2019ll never have to do that again.\u201d\n\nAs mobile and internet penetration has grown in Africa, more people are comfortable with the idea of shopping online. The growth of fintech startups especially in the payments space has also facilitated the growth and acceptance of eCommerce in Africa.\n\nHowever, despite this progress, like most parts of the world, issues with checkout and needing to visit multiple eCommerce stores to make a purchase remains a challenge.\n\nAccording to Shopify, 24% of people abandoned their shopping cart because the site required them to create an account while 18% of people abandoned their cart because of a long and complicated checkout process.\n\nIt is this problem that OurPass is determined to solve. With its mobile application, users only input their details once and subsequently, are able to make purchases on the platform.\n\nTo do this, the startup has curated a few merchants on the platform and recently acquired Storemia, an online storefront provider.\n\nThe startup offers users three major offerings: a 0.8% transaction fee capped at \u20a61,000 for merchants, five percent commission, and free deliveries. Customers can also purchase airtime and pay bills on the platform. Buyers enjoy free delivery, fast, easy and safe checkout across all websites that have OurPass integrated, and can track all their orders and transactions.\n\n\u201cThe coming together of Storemia and OurPass is one of the revolutionary mergers in the Nigerian tech space because both products are very complementary. Storemia in itself is the easiest and fastest way to create eCommerce stores.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOurPass is the fastest checkout tool for eCommerce stores so when you bring the power of Storemia and the power of OurPass together, then you have a super product,\u201d Bolu Oluwagbesan, founder of Storemia said.\n\nThe startup has raised a pre-seed round of $1 million led by Tekedia Capital and angel investors from Fortune 500 companies.\n\nProfessor Ndubuisi Ekekwe, founder of Tekedia Capital, expressed delight to be investing in the startup. \u201cI remember the first time the OurPass team pitched their idea to me. I immediately knew that it was a great product because if we can reduce the friction customers have when they want to pay for something, everyone will be very happy.\u201d\n\nBarbara Salami, one of the angel investors said, \u201cThe platform resonates with me because it truly opens up access to commerce where customers beyond having the opportunity to securely and conveniently place orders could potentially place and receive orders from anywhere in Africa.\u201d\n\nTo sign up as a merchant or buyer, head over to the website or download the OurPass app from the Google Play Store.",

She had recently been sent a message by a loan company informing her that someone had taken out a loan and defaulted. She was listed as a guarantor and was to ensure that this person paid back the money, or she would be in trouble.\n\nShe was reasonably panicked. She contemplated what would happen to her since the loan company claimed to have her bank account details. She wondered if they could really do anything to her.\n\nIn the Nigerian context, this is a familiar story. In August 2021, Nigerian loan company, Sokoloan was fined \u20a610 million by the National Information Technology and Development Agency (NITDA) for invasion of privacy.\n\nNITDA said the company had been illegally accessing users\u2019 contacts, defaming customers, and had malicious malware from third parties tracking customers without their consent on its app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few years ago, we concluded that Nigerians care less about data protection. Hasty? Maybe not.\n\nIn January 2021, we conducted a Twitter Poll on people\u2019s thoughts about WhatsApp\u2019s intended privacy policy update. Of the 210 respondents, 56.2% did not care about the policy update.\n\nThe update meant that WhatsApp would be able to share information with other Facebook companies.\n\nHowever, data protection and privacy remain important subjects. From a PoS transaction to entering information on a health app, data is exchanged and needs to be protected.\n\nThe Privacy Roundtable is a monthly series focused on privacy issues and happenings in Africa with input from experts and non-experts.\n\nWe will discuss privacy issues peculiar to the African landscape and speak to data protection and cybersecurity experts, tech enthusiasts, and even tech indifferent people.\n\nBefore we dive in, here\u2019s an explanation of frequently used and sometimes confusing concepts.\n\nWhat is data privacy, and how is it different from data protection?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Visual Content Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nWhile both terms are often used interchangeably, they mean different things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nData privacy or information privacy refers to an individual\u2019s right to authorise access to their data. This also applies to organisations.\n\nData protection is the process of safeguarding information from corruption, compromise, or loss.\n\nSo while data privacy focuses on who has access to your data and the right to safeguard it, data protection is based on data availability and management.\n\nBy law, data protection is the responsibility of the organisation receiving such data.\n\nAlthough data privacy can exist without data protection, there would be no need to safeguard data if there is no right to do so.\n\nAt the heart of both terms is data processing.\n\nData processing refers to any operation or set of operations performed on personal data. This could include collecting, recording, organising, structuring, storing, disclosing, and erasing.\n\nWho are the persons involved?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several entities involved in data processing.\n\nData subject\n\nA data subject refers to any living individual whose personal data is processed by an organisation. For example, Bongo wants to get a loan, so he opens an account with a loan company. In this case, Bongo is the data subject.\n\nData controller\n\nThis refers to any person, organisation, or body that receives and controls an individual\u2019s data. The data controller determines the purpose and means of data processing. Using Bongo\u2019s case, the loan company is the data controller.\n\nData processor\n\nA data processor refers to a person, company, or body that processes data on behalf of the data controller. This could be an employee of the controller or an external body or person. So in this instance, Bongo\u2019s loan company could decide to have an employee handle the role. They could also choose to hire an external expert or company.\n\nWhy is data privacy and protection important?\n\nMost people believe that data privacy is for people who have something to hide. However, this is not true.\n\nData privacy deals with personally identifiable information (PII) such as name, date of birth, addresses, passwords, and ATM card pins. If this information gets into the wrong hands, a lot of damage could be done. And data protection is trying to stop this from happening by safeguarding vital information.\n\nIf PIIs are not adequately protected, one could be the victim of identity theft, suffer the loss of important data, or have their money stolen.\n\nThe importance of this grows as the amount of data received increases. This is why corporations like Facebook and Google are expected to pull out all the stops to protect users\u2019 data. However, this also applies to smaller companies.\n\nThese rights also apply in cases of cross-border data transfer.\n\nWhat rights do you have?\n\nApart from the right to decide who gets access to your data, by law, individuals have the right to request that their data be deleted.\n\nThere is also the right to access your personal information without any cost to you, the right to withdraw consent, and the right to get more information on further processing.\n\nThis is why laws mandate data controllers to have privacy policies.\n\nThese rights apply to online and offline data.\n\nWhat is a privacy policy?\n\nA privacy policy is a statement or legal document that discloses the ways a data controller collects, discloses, and manages personal data it has received.\n\nFlowing from this, Bongo\u2019s loan company must have a privacy policy describing how his PIIs are collected or if they are collected at all, whether third parties have access to his data, contact details of the company\u2019s data processor, and how long his data is being kept, among other things.\n\nIt should explicitly describe whether information is kept confidential and be as straightforward and explanatory as possible, devoid of too much legal jargon.\n\nA privacy policy is important to both the data subject and the data controller.\n\nFor you, it gives some insight into how your data is being processed.\n\nIt also ensures that data controllers, like Bongo\u2019s loan company, comply with regulations and gives them an edge over competitors when they are as transparent as possible.\n\nWhich laws apply?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Africa, only eight countries have either a data protection act, a regulation, or a semblance of both.\n\nEthiopia, Tanzania, Nigeria, and Namibia do not have comprehensive data protection laws. However, a draft data protection law is expected to be presented to the Namibian Parliament in 2021. On the other hand, Nigeria published a draft data protection bill in August 2020, but it has yet to be presented.\n\nThese countries have either issued a proclamation or regulation, or are in discussions to do so.\n\nCurrently, only Kenya, South Africa, Togo, and Uganda have comprehensive data protection laws. However, these laws have only been developed but haven\u2019t been implemented. All four countries do not have an established regulatory authority overseeing the laws.\n\nHowever, the laws and regulations prescribe penalties for breach, what should be contained in privacy policies, data processor or controller requirements, among others.\n\nA placeholder\n\nWhile these explainers are not exhaustive, they give a general idea of what you should expect from the series.\n\nHowever, this explainer would be updated regularly to cover previously unexplained concepts.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communication Satellite (NigComSat) Limited is planning to acquire two new satellites as it aims to increase operational capacity.\n\nAccording to Abimbola Alale, managing director and chief executive officer of the company owned by the Nigerian government, NigComSat-2 (High Throughput Satellite) would be launched in 2023 while NigComSat-3 would launch in 2025.\n\nThe two satellites would eventually replace the existing satellite NigComSat-1R which is set to deorbit in 2026 when its 15 years lifespan expires. NigComSat-1R replaced NigComSat-1 which failed in orbit in November 2008 due to a solar array anomaly. The NigComSat-1R was successfully launched on-board the LM-3B launch vehicle developed by CALT on December 2011 and was delivered in orbit to NigComSat Limited on 2 March 2012.\n\nRead also: Top 5 Challenges of the Nigerian Tech Space and Possible Solutions.\n\n\u201cThis will not only inspire confidence in our customers and channel partners but also place NigComSat Ltd in the front line of communication satellite operators with a fleet of satellites in orbit,\u201d Alale said.\n\nNigeria is pushing its satellite capacity as part of measures to connect millions of Nigerians living in rural areas to the internet. About 60 percent of the population is not covered by broadband and the majority of those covered are in the urban centres. Alale says boosting the satellite capacity would also contribute to the \u201cnation\u2019s digital economy service infrastructure.\u201d\n\nNigComSat is expected to play a key role in the achievement of the targets set out in the National Broadband Plan 2020-2025.\n\nWhile the plans to acquire new satellites are ongoing, NigComSat has also been growing its human capacity by empowering its personnel to acquire the technical know-how of the satellite technologies. In recent times, it has sent personnel abroad for training and many of them have returned to contribute their skills in the industry.\n\nBeyond personnel training, the company is also reaching out to communities. NigComSat said it has trained 600 youths across the six geo-political zones in the country. The states that have benefited include Lagos, Kano, Gombe, Bauchi, Plateau, Rivers, Anambra, Niger, Kebbi, Akwa-Ibom, Abia, and Ekiti. These youths have been equipped with tools to participate in growing the digital economy.\n\nThe company also secured approval in early 2020 to form two subsidiary companies (SUBCOs) the Satellite Infrastructure Company (SIC) to provide satellite upstream services such as Transponder leasing, and In-Orbit-(IoT) services, Carrier Spectrum Management (CSM) services, etc. and the Satellite Broadcasting and Broadband Company (SBBC) to provide satellite downstream services such as broadband internet services, Broadcasting (DTH) services, etc.\n\nAlale says NigComSat has been given a set of KPIs by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, linked to the development of a strategic document that identifies the key market opportunities and risks in the Nigerian market as well as defines the SUBCO\u2019s operational framework.\n\nThe SUBCOs were formed to carry out commercial businesses on behalf of NigComSat with strategic partners and expand its business operations and in the information and communications technology space.",

Philip Shaibu has linked the spate of insecurity and banditry being witnessed in the country to refusal of politicians to speak the truth, urging them to be bold and speak truth to power irrespective of their political affiliations so as to make the nation better.\n\nShaibu gave the charge when he hosted the maiden edition of the Catholic Politicians and Captains of Industry Forum, at the St. Paul\u2019s Catholic Church Hall in Benin City, with the theme, \u201cState of the Nigerian Nation; Catholic Politicians and Captains of Industry Forum Chats on Way Forward for the Common Good.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI can tell you that if whatever we do reflects our doctrines, we won\u2019t have this insurgency that we are experiencing right now.

          "text": "The government of Anambra State has expressed sadness over the passing of elder statesman, Alhaji Abdulazeez Chivuzor Ude.\n\nA statement by the state\u2019s commissioner for information and public enlightenment, C Don Adinuba, said the state government received the news of Ude\u2019s passing with sadness, describing it a huge loss to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe people and Government of Anambra State have received with sadness the news of the death two days ago of Chief Abdulaziz Chivuzor Ude, the internationally renowned publisher, intellectual, art lover, pan Africanist, entrepreneur and philanthropist from Abor, Udi Local Government Area of Enugu State who played a significant part in modern Igbo history. He died in Lagos in his late 80s, and was buried in his hometown in the afternoon yesterday in line with the Islamic injunction,\u201d Adinuba said.\n\n\u201cHe was Christened Bertrand at an early age and became the first senior prefect of the College of Immaculate Conception (CIC), Enugu, Ude attended Oxford University where he read philosophy, economics and politics before proceeding to Columbia University in New York where he took a master\u2019s degree in international relations.\n\n\u201cHe caught public attention when, while working as an editor at Random House in New York, the world\u2019s biggest book publishing firm, he published Chinua Achebe\u2019s classic, Things Fall Apart, in the United States during the Nigerian Civil War of 1967-70. He was to strike a lifelong relationship with Achebe, and made handsome contributions to Achebe\u2019s Okike: A Journal of New African Writing, established in 1971 at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.\n\n\u201cUde also struck a lifelong relationship in the late 1960s with such Anambra indigenes as Dr Chuba Okadigbo, then an academic in Washington, DC. He worked closely with Dr Okadigbo when the latter was appointed the Special Political Adviser to President Shehu Shagari from 1979 to 1983. When Okadigbo founded Platform, an analytical news magazine, based in Lagos, Chief Ude stood with him all the way, making critical financial interventions.\n\n\u201cThere were many persons of Anambra State origin in top management of his enterprises like Gordon and Georgi Umunna who worked on Financial Post. His friendship with the hugely popular musician, Chief Oliver Akanite from Nnewi South Local Government Area popularly known as Oliver de Coque, was such that the entertainer waxed an album dedicated to Chief Ude which turned out to be a national bestseller.\n\n\u201cUnknown to most people because of his self-effacing nature, Chief Ude contributed significantly to the creation of Anambra, Enugu, Delta and Ebonyi states. Apart from being one of the signatories to the petition for the creation of these states to the Ibrahim Babangida military regime, he donated not just cash but also his private jet to transport the Igbo patriots like Dr Alex Ekwueme, Chike Edozie, Dr Akanu Ibiam, Chief CC Onoh and Dr Okadigbo to different cities who signed the petition.\n\n\u201cHe also donated part of his building at 59 Awolowo Road, Ikoyi, Lagos, to coordinate the campaign for the creation of Igbo states and paid the staff. The then traditional ruler of Enugwu Ukwu, Igwe Osita Agwuna, one of Nigeria\u2019s foremost nationalists, was to confer a high title on him for services to the Igbo world.\n\n\u201cUde\u2019s Nok book publishing firm in Enugu, New York, London and Lagos, published such outstanding works as Chinweizu\u2019s The West and the Rest of Us and Romanus Egudu\u2019s Study of Four West Africans. Ude, in addition, financed Eddie Iroh\u2019s Chic, the London-based colourful social magazine. He was, indeed, a pan Africanist of the finest hue.\n\n\u201cAn active member of The African Business Round Table for several years, Ude awarded scholarships to hundreds of people to study in top universities in the world and assisted many others in different fields quietly. For example, he was a major promoter of the exhibitions of Aka: The Circle of Exhibiting Artists like Professor Obiora Udechukwu, Professor Chike Aniakor, Tayo Adenaike, Dr Obiora Anidi, Nsikak Essien, Chris Afuba, Bona Ezeudu and Boniface Okafor.\n\n\u201cEver humble, he practised egalitarianism in truth and spirit. He never discriminated against the less privileged or those who did not share his religious views. Even after converting to Islam, a result of his deep friendship with founding Guinean President Sekou Toure, a pan Africanist in his own right, Ude remained a big contributor to the welfare of priests and the church in his community.\n\n\u201cThe Government and people of Anambra State truly mourn the transition of this great Igboman, pan Africanist, publisher and intellectual. We mourn with the Ude family of Abor and the people and government of Enugu State.\n\n\u201cMay Abdulaziz Ude\u2019s noble soul find rest in paradise.\u201d",

          "title": "The Osun Federal Government Road Construction Refunds: The True State Of Affairs, By Bola Oyebamiji",
          "text": "My attention has been drawn to a viral video being circulated on the social media by the former Commissioner for Home Affairs, Mr. Sikiru Ayedun, who by his unsubstantiated claims, could mislead the public through misrepresentation of facts on the state of refund by the Federal Government to the Osun State Government on all the federal roads constructed by the previous administration and the Osun debt portfolio management by the present administration.\n\nIn setting the records straight, it is important to emphatically and explicitly state that such claims, as presented in the video under reference, is capable of creating disharmony, strife and bad blood within the progressive family.\n\nThe claim that the sum of N48billion has been received by the Oyetola led administration as refund on federal roads constructed within the state is untrue.\n\nThe total contract sum of all federal road projects embarked upon by the Osun State Government, as approved by the Federal Ministry of Works, is N38billion. It is therefore against logic that the sum of N48bn will be paid by the FG for projects whose total contract sum equals N38bn. The projects in question, as at November, 2018, on the average, was less than 35% completion.\n\nAvailable records show that the Osun State Government awarded the 29km Gbongan \u2013 Akoda dualization project in 2013 for N29bn while the 40km Osogbo \u2013 Ikirun \u2013 Ila Odo Kwara boundary was awarded for N17.5bn in the same year, making both projects to amount to N46.5bn as proposed by Osun State Government. However, after due diligence and thorough assessment by the FG Public Procurement Agency, the contract sum was reviewed downward thus: Gbongan \u2013 Akoda road at N23bn, and Osogbo \u2013 Ila Odo road at N15bn respectively to carry the approved award contract sum of N38bn for all the ongoing FG roads under construction. This review was duly communicated to the Osun State Government.\n\nAs at November 2018, the contractor handling Gbongan \u2013 Akoda road project had received a total sum of N10.2bn, out of which 3.5km of the 29km stretched road have been completed including the Gbongan Interchange and the project was at 29% completion while the contractor handling the Osogbo \u2013 Ila Odo road collected a total sum of N9.2bn, with 49% completion rate; the implication is that the Osun State Government had paid both contractors the sum of N19.4bn as at November 2018. Similarly, the total refund by the FG to the state as today, in three tranches, stood at N11.9bn based on the project delivered by both contractors. It is imperative to state that the FG refund of N11.9bn has been judiciously utilized and ploughed back into four (4) inherited road projects embarked upon by the previous administration contrary to the unsubstantiated claims by Mr. Ayedun that the refund is being used to pay full salaries to civil servants in the state.\n\nAs at today, Gbongan \u2013 Akoda road project is at 36% completion stage, with 8.6km asphalted on both sides of the road. Also, the Osogbo \u2013 Ila odo project which was at 49% in November 2018 is now at 55% completion, Oba Adesoji Aderemi road which was equally inherited at 65% completion is at 74% now and Ilesa \u2013 Iperindo \u2013 Ipetu Ijesa road project rose from 40% to 66% completion stage. It is also instructive to note that since the advent of Oyetola administration, additional 60km of road had been reconstructed and fully completed, with another 10 township roads presently under construction; these are expected to be completed before the end of 2021 including the Iconic Olaiya flyover.\n\nWhile we refrain from joining issues with anyone, the State Government of Osun under the leadership of Gov. Gboyega Oyetola has expended over N150bn on prompt payment of full salaries and pensions. It is a fact that Osun State remains one of the few states paying minimum wage of N30,000 in spite of our precarious and highly geared financial situation. This is in fulfillment of the pact he made with Osun citizens when he assumed office in 2018. Whereas, it is true that both the state\u2019s N30bn and N11.4bn Sukuk bonds have been fully repaid, the current government has paid over N67bn as loan repayment during its 33months of administration in the State without borrowing a kobo till date.\n\nThe ingenuity and doggedness of Governor Gboyega Oyetola, has ensured a significant reduction in the total debt portfolio of Osun State.\n\nHowever, inspite of this unprecedented boldness in public financial management, Osun remains the third (3rd) most indebted state among the 36 states of Nigeria. This can be verified from the website of the Debt Management Office.\n\nWithout sounding like a broken record, let me reaffirm that Governor Gboyega Oyetola will continue to deploy his over 3 decades of managerial experience as a risk manager, a welfarist and financial guru to move the economy of the state towards prosperity of the larger percentage of Osun citizens.\n\nFinally, I urge all well meaning Osun citizens both politician and otherwise, to endeavour to verify all information before publication and dissemination. This will ensure a peaceful and healthy political atmosphere for all and sundry.\n\nThe State Government of Osun under Governor Gboyega Oyetola hereby reiterates her commitment to provide a secured, financially viable and paeceful environment so Osun may continue to thrive.\n\nI want to implore us as all political leaders and Omoluabis (virtuous people) to support Mr Governor in his quest for a greater Osun.\n\nBola Oyebamiji is the\n\nHonourable commissioner for Finance, Osun State",

          "text": "The most important determinant of the value of the Naira is whether or not the Nigerian economy is productive and competitive in international trade. That is to say, whether it has a diversified base of complex, value added products it exports and earns forex from those exports. I am not talking about diversification to cashew nuts and yam tubers. No. Those are primary commodities, not complex, value added ones that are the product of serious engineering and innovation.\n\nSince we obviously don\u2019t have such an economy, our main FX earner is crude oil, which gives us 90% of our FX. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t control the price of crude. Its pricing is volatile and unstable as a result of various international political and economic factors. This means that because we are essentially a one-product country, a one-trick pony, we are exposed to instability in our main income source. When the price of oil drops, and as the world innovates toward alternative energy sources, the amount of external reserves we have to back up the international value of our legal tender (our reserves) frequently comes under pressure. It\u2019s those reserves, our main defense in a soccer analogy, that determines the value of the Naira.\n\nThis is why, among the five main objectives of the Central Bank of Nigeria we have : \u201cissue the legal tender currency in Nigeria\u201d, and \u201cmaintain external reserves to safeguard the international value of the legal tender currency\u201d. So if we don\u2019t diversify but continue to rely on crude oil as a mono -product economy, the Naira crisis will get worse, not better.\n\nUnfortunately, achieving a diversified, complex economy, especially in a resource dependent economy, is not easy. It requires a a high level of knowledge, political will and consistency in economic policy and takes decades to achieve. This was the subject of my lecture a few months ago to the 2021 Annual Conference of the Nigerian Economics Students Association (NESA) held at the University of Port Harcourt, and will feature in my forthcoming book in 2022, The Pundit\u2019s Mind.\n\nThere are other facts as well that affect the value of the Naira. These include the basic factor of supply and demand (if too much Naira is chasing scarce dollars, the dollar gets stronger relative to the Naira, and vice versa). Others are inflation (a high inflation economy such as Nigeria\u2019s weakens the value of the legal tender), high government indebtedness ( again, our case especially relative to our revenues and ability to pay which will be stretched the more we borrow on poor revenues, and 90 kobo out of every N1 goes to debt servicing).\n\nSpeculation also affects the naira value, as there are currency traders around the world for whom the weakness of a currency is their very good fortune. Such traders \u201cattack\u201d such currencies for profit, especially where the currency is using a fixed, official exchange rate determined by the central bank instead of the market. As the Naira is effectively measured against a \u201creserve\u201d currency (dollars, euros, pound sterling), speculators can attack such a currency for profit if the country (Nigeria in this case) is perceived to have insufficient foreign reserves to meet demand.\n\nBecause our inflation rates at 17% are way higher than those \u201creserve-currency\u201d countries, again we are exposed to possible currency attacks. If reserves are weak, and demand for dollars massively outstrips supply, currency devaluation is inevitable, and currency traders who mount speculative attacks profit from this devaluation. Such traders will borrow the Naira from Nigerian banks, convert it to, say, dollars, then buy short-interest paying Nigerian bonds. If, as the speculators anticipate, the central bank devalues the naira, the traders sell the bonds in the foreign currency, convert them into naira, and repay the original Naira loan. The steeper the devaluation the higher the speculator\u2019s profit.\n\nWhat should we do about all of this? As I have said before, and say again, we have two options. One is to let the Naira find its level in the market. In order, words, the CBN should stop subsidizing the currency. While there will likely be an immediate spike in the price of the dollar, this move will have two advantages. The first is that, because Nigeria has a big, profitable economy and market, dollars will likely swamp the market seeking profits for investors.\n\nWhen this happens, the laws of demand and supply will work in favor of the Naira. Alongside this, maintaining different exchange rates for different kinds of transactions must end. This is called rate convergence.\n\nThe second, and more important benefit is that, since the current practice of the CBN pumping dollars in the FX market (from the reserves, which also depleted them) is essentially a subsidy for imports, which has made Nigeria more and more import dependent, letting go of the subsidy on the Naira will refocus the economy towards exports.\n\nThis will create an incentive for complex production of a quality that can be competitive in the international market. Accompanying this must be the right trade policies to support and create such incentives for massive exports of finished, value added goods from Nigeria.\n\nIf we don\u2019t want to go this way, perhaps because of the political risk of an immediate further drop in the Naira value (which will recover in the medium to longer term if the right policies are pursued), we can consider dollarization of the Nigerian economy.\n\nHere the dollar officially becomes a legal tender in Nigeria, either replacing the Naira or alongside it. Countries such as Panama, Liberia, Ecuador, Zimbabwe have done this.This\u2019ll lower interest rates and help deepen the financial sector because we are a high inflation country.\n\nBut this carries serious consequences too. Nigeria will lose monetary autonomy (our central bank will no longer be able to take independent decisions on interest rates for example). The CBN will lose seigniorage, the revenues it earns from issuing currency from the difference between the face value of the Naira and its production cost. And of course, this will involve a loss of national prestige and independence. You could argue, of course, that what value is your prestige when your national economy is in tatters? So, there we are, the simplified A-Z of our FX crisis. Either way, tough decisions have to be made. Politics is easy. Real leadership is not.\n\nKingsley Moghalu OON\n\nIfekaego Nnewi",

One hundred National Guard troops were on standby.\n\nAs part of an effort by some of Trump\u2019s far-right supporters to rewrite the history of the deadly mob assault on the Capitol that was captured in graphic video, speaker after speaker insisted that hundreds of rioters arrested for their actions that day were \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d who committed no violence.\n\nProsecutors and legal experts say the cases are being handled properly.\n\n\u201cThis is about justice and disparate treatment,\u201d said Matt Braynard, a rally organizer and supporter of Trump\u2019s false claims that his defeat was the result of widespread fraud.\n\nWhile crowds were small, passions rose at times, with sporadic yelling matches breaking out between participants in the rally and counter-demonstrators. Police on bicycles moved in to break up some of these squabbles.\n\nCapitol Police reported four arrests, including a man armed with a handgun spotted in the crowd, though they said it was \u201cnot clear why the man was at the demonstration.\u201d Officers in riot gear also removed one man from the rally who had a large knife strapped to his hip.\n\nOrganizers of the \u201cJustice for J6\u201d rally called for a peaceful event, but U.S. Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger told reporters on Friday there had been threats of violence linked to the rally, some targeting individual members of Congress, and police were bracing to prevent clashes between Trump supporters and opponents.\n\nTony Smith, 40, of Upper Marlboro, Maryland, said he had come to voice his support for a fair judicial process for those charged in the breach of the Capitol.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t honor that we don\u2019t honor America,\u201d said Smith, who was carrying a poster board that said \u201cWe Want Trump!\u201d",

He said officials were currently working on the \u201cprocedure\u201d for this, and details including the division of teachers.\n\nBut schoolgirls and their parents said prospects were bleak.\n\n\u201cI am so worried about my future,\u201d said one Afghan schoolgirl, who had hoped to be a lawyer.\n\n\u201cEverything looks very dark.

And that dream has vanished. I don\u2019t think they would let us go back to school. Even if they open the high schools again, they don\u2019t want women to become educated.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, the Taliban announced that women would be allowed to study at universities, but they would not be able to do so alongside men and would face a new dress code.\n\nSome suggested the new rules would exclude women from education because the universities do not have the resources to provide separate classes.\n\nBarring girls from secondary schools would mean none would be able to go on to further education.\n\nSince the Taliban were removed from power in 2001, enormous progress has been made in improving Afghanistan\u2019s education enrolments and literacy rates \u2013 especially for girls and women.\n\nThe number of girls in primary schools increased from almost zero to 2.5 million, while the female literacy rate nearly doubled in a decade to 30%. However, many of the gains have been made in cities.\n\n\u201cThis is a setback in the education of Afghan women and girls,\u201d said Nororya Nizhat, a former Education Ministry spokesperson.\n\n\u201cThis reminds everyone of what the Taliban did in the 90s. We ended up with a generation of illiterate and non-educated women.\u201d\n\nShortly after taking power the Taliban said the rights of women in Afghanistan would be respected \u201cwithin the framework of Islamic law\u201d.",

The accreditation also indicates that NAF is committed to doing the right thing even when no one is watching, this is commendable,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Erhabor used the opportunity to encourage the CAS to go a step further in his commitment to quality and excellent service delivery by ensuring that other NAF facilities across the country key into the quality management system.\n\nHe said the Gazette on National Quality Infrastructure was recently released, indicating that the issue of Quality is now being taken seriously at the highest level of decision making in the country.\n\nHe commended the pivotal role gallant personnel of the NAF have continued to play in the fight against insurgency, armed banditry and other forms of criminality in the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe officers and men of the NAF represent the best among us and their attributes of courage, integrity, excellence, professionalism and patriotism are worthy of emulation\u201d.\n\nHe assured the NAF of the Council unalloyed support as it continues with the task of safeguarding the territorial integrity of the country.\n\nIn his remarks, the CAS said that the NAF appreciates its collaboration with MLSCN especially in the standardization and improvement of NAF laboratories.\n\nHe also disclosed that the NAF was making efforts to ensure provision of competent personnel, appropriate facility, equipment and regular supply of reagents among other inputs for other laboratories.\n\nIn the same vein, the CAS stated that the NAF is currently upgrading and equipping laboratories with modern analyzers while also ensuring that medical personnel as well as medical laboratory scientists benefit from regular training, both local and foreign.\n\n\u201cVery soon, the NAF School of Medical Sciences and Aviation Medicine will admit students for technician courses, including medical laboratory technicians.

          "text": "Director-General of Progressive Governors Forum, PGF, an umbrella body for governors elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Dr. Salihu Moh\u2019 Lukman, has described as retrogressive politics the clamour by some State governors to control collection of Value Added Tax, VAT, in Nigeria.\n\nLukman stated that if the reason behind the clamor for decentralized control of VAT collection is based on divisive, ethnocentric injustice, then it is retrogressive politics which is a complete departure from the progressive politics which the APC stands for.\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike had sued and secured court judgment against the Federal Inland Revenue Service, FIRS, over the right of the State to control the collection of VAT.\n\nWike lamented injustice and inequitable distribution of resources generated from VAT, arguing that \u2018Rivers State generated about N15 billion as VAT in June 2021 but received only N4.7 billion, Lagos State generated over N46 billion as VAT in June, but got just over N9 billion, whereas Kano State generated N2.8 billion and also got N2.8 billion as allocation.\u2019\n\nIn his statement titled, \u2018Retrogressive Politics of Value Added Tax in Nigeria\u2019, issued Friday and made available to newsmen in Abuja, the APC chieftain wondered if State collection of VAT was going to prioritise the development of the nation\u2019s productive capacity or rather simply be about consuming the resources that are currently available, stressing that access may not necessarily translate into commitment to utilise the resources in ways that strengthened commitment of political leaders to invest in the development of Nigeria\u2019s productive sector.\n\nHe emphasized that if the priority is about consuming currently available resources, commitment of political leaders to mobilise investment to develop the nation\u2019s productive sectors will be weak, hence it is important to ensure that access to resources also come with increased commitment by political leaders towards developing Nigeria\u2019s productive sector.\n\nThe PGF DG maintained that the reason Nigerians are debating whether it is states or federal government that should collect VAT is as a result of significant increase in what is being generated from VAT, thereby making it an attractive variable in the struggle for resource control by State governments.\n\nLukman boasted that the APC government led by president Muhammadu has tremendously increased VAT from N759.43 billion in 2015 to N1.531 trillion in 2020, an increase of more than hundred percent.\n\nHe berated the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, for generating very low income from VAT on account of both combination of weak institutional capacity and corruption in the public sector during its 16 years reign in power.\n\n\u201cNo matter what anyone want to say, the reality is that the significant increase in VAT in the country between 2015 and 2020 confirmed improved efficiency and reduced corruption in the process of collection and management of Nigeria\u2019s public finances.\n\n\u201cThe reality however is that credit must go to the APC led federal government of President Buhari. Whether it would have been possible if PDP is still in control of the federal government can only be wishful thoughts. If that were to be the case, why wasn\u2019t it the case at any point between 1999 and 2015?,\u201d he asked.\n\nLukman added that, \u201cGovernor Wike can audaciously and shamelessly talk about VAT today because, its value has significantly increased which made it attractive for a rich State like Rivers to be interested in controlling it. If Governor Wike has any morality, he should look back and acknowledge how small Rivers must have received as its VAT share before 2015. Being a leading member of PDP, what was responsible for the low VAT records in the country between 1999 and 2015?\n\n\u201cAs members of APC, it is important that Governor Wike is reminded that the current increased record of VAT collection in the country is made possible only because the PDP is no longer in power. If PDP were to be in power the fact of inefficiency and corruption in the process of collection and management of VAT would have continued and the amount collected would have remained relatively low. It is not by accident that VAT collection in the country significantly increased under APC led federal government. This is because one of the specific commitment of APC since 2015 as outlined in the section of the party\u2019s manifesto Funding a New Nigeria was that \u2018APC government will set about the urgent task of getting Nigeria\u2019s public finances in order, by tackling the massive waste, duplication and corruption in the system, diversifying the economy and expanding our tax base to increase non-oil revenues, and reprioritising public spending away from bureaucracy towards investment in infrastructure and improved frontline services.\u2019\u201d",
          "summary": "Lukman stated that if the reason behind the clamor for decentralized control of VAT collection is based on divisive, ethnocentric injustice, then it is retrogressive politics which is a complete departure from the progressive politics which the APC stands for.\nLukman boasted that the APC government led by president Muhammadu has tremendously increased VAT from N759.43 billion in 2015 to N1.531 trillion in 2020, an increase of more than hundred percent.\n\u201cThe reality however is that credit must go to the APC led federal government of President Buhari.\nBeing a leading member of PDP, what was responsible for the low VAT records in the country between 1999 and 2015?\nIt is not by accident that VAT collection in the country significantly increased under APC led federal government.",

          "text": "A Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Mr Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, has raised an alarm over the investigations into the October 20, 2020 shooting at the Lekki tollgate in Lagos State.\n\nHe alleged that there was an attempt to frustrate the Lagos State Judicial Panel on Restitution for Victims of SARS-related abuses and other matters, from reaching meaningful conclusions on its probe into the incident.\n\nAdegboruwa raised the alarm on Saturday in a chat with Channels Television in reaction to the announcement that the panel was suspending its sitting indefinitely.\n\nAlthough he did not return with the panel after it rose to deliberate on the submissions by the Lagos State counsel to call expert witnesses, the senior lawyer promised to give further details on the claim.\n\nAdegboruwa represents the civil society in the panel set up by the state government to probe the excesses of police personnel in the state.\n\nAt the resumed sitting, Chairman of the panel, Justice Doris Okuwobi, said sitting would be suspended until further notice, after Saturday\u2019s session.\n\n\u201cThere are two reports that we are expected to work on; we are not close enough to any of them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot continue with the sitting and end the assignment without concluding. So, we will not be sitting from today.\n\n\u201cWe have to collate and evaluate petitions already heard so as to make findings and recommendations, even on the Lekki shooting. But as soon as we find ourselves in a comfortable situation, we will send hearing notices for cases that have been listed.\n\n\u201cPlease bear with us, we cannot speculate on any further extension. We have to work towards completing the assignment as early as we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is without any prejudice to us coming back to conclude on part-heard cases. Dates will be communicated to petitioners who have petitions pending,\u201d Okuwobi added.\n\nThe Way Forward\n\nMeanwhile, lawyers appearing before the panel have suggested ways in which the panel could speed up its work.\n\nA counsel to the Lagos State government and SAN, Olukayode Enitan, said the panel should have adopted the \u201cfront-loading method\u201d when he suggested it at the beginning of the hearing.\n\nHe stated that if their application was not considered, \u201cit will be like a bird flying with one wing,\u201d adding that the state has never wasted time or occasioned delay at the panel.\n\n\u201cWe have always been present, at no point were we not here and never have we requested an adjournment except for once.\n\n\u201cIt will be most unfair to not want to hear what we want to say. I would advise that the panel adopt a process that will ensure that all sides are heard,\u201d Enitan said.\n\nOn his part, the lawyer representing the Lekki Concession Company (LCC), Rotimi Seriki, also urged the panel to hear the expert witnesses.\n\n\u201cI believe that in the interest of justice and given that this is a fact-finding exercise, any piece of evidence that will allow this panel in arriving at a decision should not be shut out,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen the panel enquired if the expert witness could be flown in immediately, Enitan said no as he explained that the UK witness would be required to observe the COVID-19 travel protocol and go into quarantine before he could appear.\n\nAdeshina Ogunlana, a lawyer representing some of the #EndSARS protesters, suggested that the panel could take the expert witness by virtual means.\n\nHe also proposed that the sitting of the panel be either extended or an additional weekday be added.",

          "title": "Nigeria: CBN Promises to Deal with Illegal Forex Traders, AbokiFX Suspends Forex Updates",
          "text": "The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, on Friday vowed to send the Economic and Finance Crimes Commission (EFCC) and other security agencies after Nigerians fraudulently acquiring foreign exchange in the form of Personal Travel Allowance (PTA)/Business Travel Allowance (BTA) from banks.\n\nThe CBN, in a recent circular, said defaulters of its forex policy were customers that obtain PTA/BTA from banks, using fake visas, and others who cancel their flights and fail to return the purchased PTA/BTA within two weeks as stipulated in the customer declaration form signed.\n\nThe CBN governor, while answering questions from journalists at the end of a two-day meeting of Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), in Abuja said there were evidences that people had deceitfully bought forex from banks using fake visas, and under the pretext of traveling, only to cancel their tickets afterwards.\n\nHe said a particular study had shown that one of the banks sold forex to 52 people who said they wanted to travel.\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cAfter two weeks, they went to check, and 40 out of the 52 had canceled their tickets. How could you have a situation where about 70 per cent or 80 per cent of people who went to a bank to buy BTA on the excuse that they wanted to travel cancel the trip?\n\n\u201cBank sold to them but they turned back and then went and sold it to black market because they wanted to enjoy the arbitrage.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said such fraudulent means of acquiring foreign exchange would no longer go unpunished, adding that the CBN was committed to meeting all legitimate Fx demands in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cHowever, if you go to a bank with fake ticket, fake visa, fake passport, we have told them not to sell to you. If they sell to you mistakenly because you hoodwinked them to sell to you and after two weeks, they checked and found that you canceled your ticket or your visa is fake, they will call you because you are their customer; they have your BVN, they have your number \u2013 they will call you to return the dollars.\n\n\u201cIf you do not return it, they will place your name on their website, your BVN on their website and we will pick those details and we will send them to EFCC and other crime agencies and they will pursue you, you must return the dollars because you cannot acquire it illegally. That is our position.\u201d\n\nThe CBN Governor also announced that the bank would track down and bring the founder of AbokiFx, Mr. Oniwinde Adedotun to book for alleged speculative activities on the foreign exchange \u201cwhich amounted to economic sabotage.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said Adedotun had been conducting nefarious and criminal activity on the Nigerian economy by indulging in forex speculation in contravention of the CBN Act which vested the apex bank with the sole responsibility for determining the rate of the Naira.\n\nThe CBN governor said: \u201cWe found him as a Nigerian who lives in England, and conducts this nefarious and criminal activity on our economy. It is an economic sabotage and we will pursue him wherever he is. We will report him to international security agencies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll track him, Mr. Oniwinde, we will find you, because we cannot allow you to continue to conduct an illegal activity that kills our economy.\u201d\n\nHe described Oniwinde as an illegal Fx dealer who started the AbokiFx operation in 2015, adding that he had since milked the economy by taking position and manipulating the exchange rate to the detriment of the economy.\n\nEmefiele said the CBN had investigated the activities of AbokiFx for the last two and a half years, adding that since inception of business in 2015, the company had continued to file the same account balance sheet of \u00a31,000 to the UK Government for four consecutive years.\n\nHe alleged that in Nigeria, the company had over 25 bank accounts with about eight banks in both naira and dollar with significant turnover which indicated that he had been milking the system through speculative information activities on the Naira and collecting his proceeds in cash through a particular ATM in London.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the CBN governor said the bank would continue to do its job of safeguarding the financial system for the betterment of everyone.\n\n\u201cA few questions: Has Nigerians ever asked how exactly AbokiFx collects his data that he publishes on his website? How many BDCs can claim that they have either seen a staff of AbokiFx coming to ask for daily rates or how many BDCs send daily returns on exchange rate to AbokiFx. How then do they determine what the rate is and they post them illegally on their website?\n\n\u201cIn which other country will unlicensed single person be the one that sets exchange rate in that country? How come he sets exchange rate of our own country, and why is he not setting exchange rate of the Pound and Dollar or Pound and South African Rands? Why target Nigeria, and yet you are a Nigerian?\n\n\u201cYou chose to live in London, enjoy all the spoils in London at the expense of the blood of Nigerians. You will pay for it.\n\n\u201cThe CBN Act Section 2, does make it clear that only the Central Bank can determine the value of the Naira, and yet a single unscrupulous individual who lives in London continues to manipulate the exchange for Nigerians, continues to make huge profits, continues to collect these profits in cash ATMs in London while ordinary Nigerians suffer the consequences of these actions. We will not allow this to continue again.\u201d\n\nThe apex bank also resolved to retain Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), otherwise known as interest rate, at 11.5 per cent and the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR.\n\nIt retained the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) at 27.5 per cent and Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nThe MPR is the rate at which the CBN lends to commercial banks and often determines the cost of borrowing in the economy.\n\nAboki FX Speaks\n\nMeanwhile, Online foreign exchange update platform, Aboki FX, responded to allegations against it on Friday night, saying it would no longer provide daily updates on foreign exchange rates following complaints by the CBN that it is responsible for the current crisis in the Forex market which has brought the naira to its knees.\n\nAboki FX said in a statement that it would no longer publish exchange rates for now and hoped that the naira would stabilise.\n\n\u201cAboki FX is fully functional but we will not be publishing any form of rates on our platform for now. We sincerely hope this suspension will lead to the naira appreciation from next week. With our decision to temporarily suspend online rate publication, we are aware that there will be limited visibility of parallel rates information which will impact decision making for many,\u201d it said.\n\nThe platform denied manipulating the market, adding that there was no way it could have such power.\n\nIt further stated that it usually gets its information from bureau de change operators in Lagos.\n\n\u201cNone of our data source providers know who we are or what their rates are being used for. This is to avoid any manipulation of rates. Our staff have a daily routine of going to the market to gather rates as all the BDCs in the country have their rates clearly displayed on their rates board and parallel market dealers give the information away freely. All we do is collate all that information and display it on all our platforms daily,\u201d the firm said.\n\nAs regards allegations of fraud levelled against its founder, Olusegun Oniwinde, by the CBN governor, the company said such allegations were not proven.\n\nThe firm said it doesn\u2019t trade forex and it had always stated this on social media.\n\n\u201cAboki FX purely provides benchmark parallel rate information which helps guide our users in almost 200 countries across the world. Aboki FX does not trade FX which we have always maintained in our emails and social media platforms,\u201d it said.\n\nJames Emejo and Sonia Mayomi in Abuja",

          "title": "US Capitol on High Alert as Pro-Trump Demonstrators Converge for Rally",
          "text": "Hundreds of police officers will be on duty around the U.S. Capitol on Saturday braced for a rally by supporters of the hundreds of people who breached the building on Jan. 6 trying to overturn former President Donald Trump\u2019s election defeat.\n\nA black eight-foot-high (2.44 m) fence which surrounded the white-domed building for about six months after the attack is back, 100 National Guard troops are on standby and security officials are performing additional checks on travelers arriving at Washington\u2019s nearest airport in an effort to prevent violence.\n\nOrganizers of the \u201cJustice for J6\u201d rally said they expected a peaceful event, but U.S. Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger told reporters on Friday \u201cthere have been some threats of violence\u201d linked to the event, where police would work to avoid clashes between Trump supporters and opponents.\n\nMore than 600 people have been charged with taking part in the Jan. 6 violence, which followed a speech by Trump reiterating his false claims that his election loss to Democratic President Joe Biden was the result of widespread fraud. Those claims have been rejected by multiple courts, state election officials and members of Trump\u2019s own administration.\n\nRioters that day battled police, beating them with sticks and metal barricades, smashed their way through windows into the Capitol building and ran through the halls, sending lawmakers and then-Vice President Mike Pence running for safety.\n\nFour people died that day, one fatally shot by police and three from medical emergencies. A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the day after and four police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later committed suicide.\n\nAlmost 50 people have so far pleaded guilty to charges related to the violence, nine admitting to committing felonies. The vast majority of defendants have been released awaiting trial but about 75 are still in custody, according to court documents.\n\nMembers of the right-wing groups the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers and Three Percenters are among those charged with storming the building.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic that the rallying cries justice for January 6th. I think justice for January 6th would have been the impeachment and removal of Donald Trump,\u201d said Representative Adman Kinzinger, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting the Jan. 6 violence, in an interview with MSNBC.\n\nTrump was ultimately acquitted by the then-Republican-controlled Senate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time we stop as a party or leaders accepting somehow these ideas of Oath Keepers, which is basically a militia that wants to overthrow the government, that that\u2019s okay,\u201d Kinzinger said.\n\nMatt Braynard, a supporter of Trump\u2019s false claims that his defeat was the result of widespread fraud who is organizing the rally, said he hoped it would lead to the release of people charged with taking part in the events of Jan. 6.\n\n\u201cWhat we really want to do is put a spotlight on the mistreatment of these individuals and encourage federal legislators to demand the Department of Justice deliver real justice to these people. And that means, in many cases, dropping charges,\u201d Braynard said in an interview on C-SPAN.\n\nWhile hundreds have been arrested for taking part in the riot \u2014 some of whom posted images online of their activities on Jan. 6 \u2014 questions remain unanswered. No suspects have yet been identified in the investigation into who planted pipe bombs at the Democratic and Republican parties\u2019 national headquarters near the Capitol on Jan. 5.\n\nA California man was arrested early this week after he was found near the Capitol with multiple large knives that are banned in the District of Columbia. His truck was decorated with white supremacist symbols and he made racist comments when approached by police, according to court documents.\n\nUnlike on Jan. 6, when Congress was in session to formally certify Biden\u2019s election, the Capitol will be largely empty on Saturday, with most members out of town.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin has put 100 National Guard troops on standby to help police protect the Capitol if needed. The National Guard troops, who will be unarmed except for batons, would be used after local, state and federal law enforcement capabilities had been tapped, the spokesman said.\n\nNational Guard troops were stationed in and around the Capitol from early January through late May, with as many as 5,200 troops in place at the mission\u2019s peak.",

Several officers were knocked to the ground and trampled, the police said and television footage showed.\n\nAbout 700 people managed to gather in parts of Melbourne, as 2,000 officers made the city centre virtually a no-go zone, setting up checkpoints and barricades. Public transport and ride shares into the city were suspended.\n\nIn Sydney, riot squad officers, highway patrol, detectives and general duties police were also deployed to the streets, preventing large gatherings.\n\nAustralia has been grappling with an outbreak of the Delta variant of the coronavirus since mid-June, with both Sydney and Melbourne, and the capital Canberra, in strict lockdowns for weeks now. On Saturday, there were 1,882 new coronavirus cases reported, most of them in Sydney.\n\nMost of the restrictions in Victoria, New South Wales and Canberra are to remain until at least 70% of those 16 and older are fully vaccinated, which based on the current pace of inoculations could be in late October or early November.\n\nA high rate of compliance with public health orders has helped Australia keep the number of infections relatively low, with just under 85,000 total cases and 1,145 deaths since the start of the pandemic.\n\nThe vast majority of Australians support vaccinations and the public health measures, but there have been sporadic and sometimes violent protests against the management of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cIt was extremely disappointing to see another example of a small minority of the community showing a complete disregard for the health and safety of not only police, but each and every other Victorian,\u201d Victoria Police said in a statement.\n\nReporting by Lidia Kelly; Editing",

          "title": "US Admits Kabul Drone Strike Killed Civilians",
          "text": "The Pentagon has retreated from its defense of a drone strike that killed multiple civilians in Afghanistan last month, announcing that a review revealed that only civilians were killed in the attack, not an Islamic State extremist as first believed.\n\n\u201cThe strike was a tragic mistake,\u201d Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, told a Pentagon news conference Friday.\n\nMcKenzie apologized for the error and said the United States is considering making reparation payments to the family of the victims. He said the decision to strike a white Toyota Corolla sedan, after having tracked it for about eight hours, was made in an \u201cearnest belief\u201d \u2014 based on a standard of \u201creasonable certainty\u201d \u2014 that it posed an imminent threat to American forces at Kabul airport. The car was believed to have been carrying explosives in its trunk, he said.\n\nFor days after the Aug. 29 strike, Pentagon officials asserted that it had been conducted correctly, despite 10 civilians being killed, including seven children. News organizations later raised doubts about that version of events, reporting that the driver of the targeted vehicle was a longtime employee at an American humanitarian organization and citing an absence of evidence to support the Pentagon\u2019s assertion that the vehicle contained explosives.\n\nThe airstrike was the last of a U.S. war that ended as it had begun in 2001 \u2014 with the Taliban in power in Kabul. The speed with which the Taliban overran the country took the U.S. government by surprise and forced it to send several thousand troops to the Kabul airport for a hurried evacuation of Americans, Afghans and others. The evacuation, which began Aug. 14, unfolded under a near-constant threat of attack by the Islamic State group\u2019s Afghanistan affiliate.\n\nMcKenzie, who oversaw U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, including a final evacuation of U.S. forces and more than 120,000 civilians from Kabul airport, expressed his condolences to the family and friends of those killed.\n\n\u201cI am now convinced that as many as 10 civilians, including up to seven children, were tragically killed in that strike,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cMoreover, we now assess that it is unlikely that the vehicle and those who died were associated with ISIS-K or were a direct threat to U.S. forces,\u201d he added, referring to the Islamic State group\u2019s Afghanistan affiliate.\n\nPrior to the strike, U.S. intelligence had indicated a likelihood that a white Toyota Corolla would be used in an attack against U.S. forces, McKenzie said. On the morning of Aug. 29, such a vehicle was detected at a compound in Kabul that U.S. intelligence in the preceding 48 hours had determined was used by the Islamic State group to plan and facilitate attacks. The vehicle was tracked by U.S. drone aircraft from that compound to numerous other locations in the city before the decision was made to attack it at a point just a couple of miles from Kabul airport, McKenzie said.\n\n\u201cClearly our intelligence was wrong on this particular white Toyota Corolla,\u201d he said.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in a written statement, apologized for what he called \u201ca horrible mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe now know that there was no connection\u201d between the driver of the vehicle and the Islamic State group, and that the driver\u2019s activities that day were \u201ccompletely harmless and not at all related to the imminent threat we believed we faced,\u201d Austin said.\n\nGen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters two days after the attack that it appeared to have been a \u201crighteous\u201d strike and that at least one of the people killed was a \u201cfacilitator\u201d for the Islamic State group\u2019s Afghanistan affiliate, which had killed 169 Afghan civilians and 13 American service members in a suicide bombing on Aug. 26 at the Kabul airport.\n\nAfter McKenzie\u2019s remarks on Friday, Milley expressed regret.\n\n\u201cThis is a horrible tragedy of war and it\u2019s heart wrenching,\u201d Milley told reporters traveling with him in Europe. \u201cWe are committed to being fully transparent about this incident.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a dynamic high-threat environment, the commanders on the ground had appropriate authority and had reasonable certainty that the target was valid, but after deeper post-strike analysis our conclusion is that innocent civilians were killed,\u201d Milley added.\n\nAccounts from the family of the victims, documents from colleagues seen by The Associated Press, and the scene at the family home \u2014 where Zemerai Ahmadi\u2019s car was struck by a Hellfire missile just as he pulled into the driveway \u2014 all painted a picture of a family that had worked for Americans and were trying to gain visas to the United States, fearing for their lives under the Taliban.\n\nThe family said that when the 37-year-old Zemerai, alone in his car, pulled up to the house, he honked his horn. His 11-year-old son ran out and Zemerai let the boy get in and drive the car into the driveway. The other kids ran out to watch, and the Hellfire missile incinerated the car, killing seven children and an adult son and nephew of Zemerai.\n\nAmnesty International, the humanitarian aid group, called the U.S. military\u2019s admission of a mistake a good first step.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. must now commit to a full, transparent, and impartial investigation into this incident,\u201d said Brian Castner, a senior crisis adviser with Amnesty International. \u201cAnyone suspected of criminal responsibility should be prosecuted in a fair trial. Survivors and families of the victims should be kept informed of the progress of the investigation and be given full reparation.\u201d\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said a fuller explanation must be provided.\n\n\u201cWe need to know what went wrong in the hours and minutes leading up to the strike to prevent similar tragedies in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cI am also concerned about the accuracy and completeness of public statements made in the immediate aftermath of the strike, and whether those accounted for all of the information possessed by the government at the time.\u201d",

          "title": "In Escalation Over Submarine Deal, France Recalls Envoys from US and Australia",
          "text": "France plunged into an unprecedented diplomatic crisis with the United States and Australia on Friday after it recalled its ambassadors from both countries over a trilateral security deal which sank a French-designed submarine contract with Canberra.\n\nThe rare decision taken by French President Emmanuel Macron was made due to the \u201cexceptional gravity\u201d of the matter, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, Australia said it would scrap a $40 billion deal signed in 2016 for France\u2019s Naval Group to build a fleet of conventional submarines and would instead build at least eight nuclear-powered submarines with U.S. and British technology after striking a trilateral security partnership. France called it a stab in the back.\n\nA diplomatic source in France said it was the first time Paris had recalled its own ambassadors in this way.\n\nAustralia said on Saturday morning it regretted the recall, and that it valued the relationship with France and would keep engaging with Paris on other issues.\n\n\u201cAustralia understands France\u2019s deep disappointment with our decision, which was taken in accordance with our clear and communicated national security interests,\u201d a spokesperson for Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne said in a statement.\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that France was a \u2018vital ally\u2019 and that the United States would be engaged in coming days to resolve the differences.\n\nThe French foreign ministry statement made no mention of Britain, but the diplomatic source said France considered Britain had joined the deal in an opportunistic manner.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to hold consultations with our (British) ambassador to know what to make of it or to draw any conclusions,\u201d the source added.\n\nLe Drian said the deal was unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThe cancellation (of the project) \u2026 and the announcement of a new partnership with the United States meant to launch studies on a possible future cooperation on nuclear-powered submarines, constitute unacceptable behavior between allies and partners,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nHe added that the consequences \u201cdirectly affect the vision we have of our alliances, of our partnerships and of the importance of the Indo-Pacific for Europe.\u201d\n\nLOW POINT\n\nThe row marks the lowest point in relations between Australia and France since 1995, when Canberra protested France\u2019s decision to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific and recalled its ambassador for consultations.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday rejected French criticism that it had not been warned about the new deal, and said he had raised the possibility in talks with the French president that Australia might scrap the Naval Group deal.\n\nMorrison insisted he had told Macron in June that Australia had revised its thinking.\n\n\u201cI made it very clear, we had a lengthy dinner there in Paris, about our very significant concerns about the capabilities of conventional submarines to deal with the new strategic environment we\u2019re faced with,\u201d he told 5aa Radio.\n\n\u201cI made it very clear that this was a matter that Australia would need to make a decision on in our national interest.\u201d\n\nThe strain in multilateral ties come as the United States and its allies seek additional support in Asia and the Pacific given concern about the rising influence of a more assertive China.\n\nFrance is about to take over the presidency of the European Union, which on Thursday released its strategy for the Indo-Pacific, pledging to seek a trade deal with Taiwan and to deploy more ships to keep sea routes open.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken tried on Thursday to calm the French outcry, calling France a vital partner in the region.\n\nPierre Morcos, a visiting fellow at Washington\u2019s Center for Strategic and International Studies, called France\u2019s move \u201chistoric.\u201d\n\n\u201cReassuring words such as those heard yesterday from Secretary Blinken are not enough for Paris \u2013 especially after French authorities learned that this agreement was months in the making,\u201d he said.",
