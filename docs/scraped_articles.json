Some men experience it during times of stress. However, frequent cases of erectile dysfunction, experts say, can be a sign of other health problems that need treatment.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, one of the experts and a Professor of Surgery, KehindeTijani, stated that men should also be worried if their lack of early morning erection interferes with their sex life.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with our correspondent, Tijani, who is also a consultant urologist, stressed that it is not a must for men to have early morning erection every day. Rather, the most important thing is to have a good erection during coital activities.\n\nHe however further said that \u201closs of early morning erection can be a pointer to potential problems with coital activities and even systemic problems involving blood vessels.\n\n\u201cIt can be a guide on the state of erectile function of an individual, even though its relevance tends to be over-exaggerated.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cmany normal men do not observe the early morning erection but have no problem with coital activities.

Many hospital-acquired infections are already caused by bacteria resistant to all known antibiotics and many researchers believe that we will return to the pre-antibiotic period.\n\n\u201cIt increases human pain, infections become refractory, and the patient remains in the hospital longer than they would have or are forced into the hospital because it is necessary to use intravenous therapy.\n\n\u201cThe occurrence of resistance in hospitals is considered an indicator of poor quality care services\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nAnother panelist, Dr. Bamidele Mutiu, a Consultant Clinical Microbiologist at the Lagos State College of Medicine and Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, also blamed health practitioners for contributing to the antibiotic resistance situation in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, some doctors prescribe the drugs without proper investigation to ensure whether or not antibiotics are required.\n\n\u201cThe theme of this year\u2019s WAAW \u2013 \u2018Spread Awareness, Stop Resistance\u2019 should start with health practitioners.\n\n\u201cEvery time we come in contact with patients, within and outside the hospital, we should tell them \u2018you don\u2019t need antibiotics unless it is indicated, backed up by laboratory diagnosis, microbiological evidence and sensitivity testing.\u2019\n\n\u201cI can tell you that, we, the health workers, are also guilty.\n\n\u201cFor some of us, every patient they see, they are adding antibiotics to their prescriptions to increase the amount patients will pay and increase profit.\n\n\u201cWe should look inward because we the health workers have a role to play,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Managing Director of St. Racheal\u2019s Pharma, Mr. Akinjide Adeosun, traced the problem of antibiotic resistance in Nigeria to the country\u2019s high out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure.\n\nAccording to him, the pressure on patients to pay often leads to the sub-optimal purchase of antimicrobial doses, thereby, encouraging microbial to be resistant to available drugs.\n\n\u201cI hereby state my unequivocal support to the House of Representatives\u2019 bill championed by Hon.

O. Obiabaka at Setraco yard, Ifie-Warri.\n\nREAD ALSo:Opinion: Hostage \u2018Warriors\u2019 \u2014 Gbenro Olajuyigbe\n\nAdams while explaining the socio-economic benefits of the Trans Warri Ode Itsekiri bridges and access road stated that the scope of the project includes the construction of 26km length of road with the spur, culverts, drains, and 19 bridges of various spans including Ode-Itsekiri internal Roads and two jetties on both sides of Warri Rivers. The main alignment for Ubeji is through Ifie, Aje-Etan, Ijala, across Warri River to Ugbodede, Orugbo, Ajigba and ends at Ode-Itsekiri.\n\nSpeaking further, Adams submitted that the project when completed will not only reduce youths restiveness but will open up the other sides of Warri separated by Warri river which will make enormous land mass available while speeding up development.\n\nAir Commodore C. O. Obiabaka appreciated His Excellency Sen. Dr. Okowa for the massive project. Saying the project when completed will not only improve the economic situation of the State but help in the movement of security equipment and in securing the area.\n\nThe Trans-Warri Ode Itsekiri bridges and access road project was an initiative of the Ibori administration but actual work was started by the Uduaghan administration in May, 2007. Thus the project If well funded is expected to be completed in December 2022.",

          "text": ".\n\n\u2014 We need leaders with fear of God\n\nDayo Johnson Akure\n\nThe President and General Overseer of the United Apostolic Church of Christ(UACC), Dr James Bayo Owoyemi weekend asked Christians to stop their non-challant attitudes to active politics and get involved ahead of the 2023 election\n\nDr Owoyemi said that the fear of God is imperative for those to lead the country in the next political dispensation hence the need for Christians to get involved.\n\nHe spoke at the close of the church\u2019s national convention in Akure, the Ondo state capital.\n\nAccording to him \u201d Christians should gear up to vie for elective positions in the coming dispensation. We need politicians with the fear of God to come to the 2023 election if we are to move forward.\n\n\u201d The call became necessary because if God-fearing people stayed away from politics, the wicked would continue to rule the nation.\n\n\u201cChristians have roles to play in nation-building. Christians must be involved in politics. It is in the bible that we should obey the people in authority.\n\n\u201cIf Christians run away from politics, then they cannot be voted for and whoever gets there, we will be subjected to them.\u201d\n\nThe President charged Christians occupying political offices to always play to please God and not man noting that they would give an account of their stewardship to their creator.\n\n\u201d Let Christians occupying political offices do things according to God\u2019s order and they should remember that they are representatives of God and the people would be expecting them to exude godly dispositions in their manner of operations.\n\nAccording to him Christians holding political offices needed to make service to humanity their priority and not how to corner for themselves and family members whats meant for the generality of the people.\n\n\u201d There should be a distinct difference between those of us called Christians and others. Our ways of life while holding political positions should be worthy of emulation. We\u2019re not expected to join the bandwagons.\n\nOwoyemi admonished members of his church to do according to the \u201cwill of God so that they could receive the good promises of Christ, the Good Shepherd.\n\nMembers of the church who stood out in Gods vineyard were given awards for their meritorious services to boost their morale and encourage others.",

That one has been achieved. Other arrangements are on the way. We are going to decide soon where our presidential candidate will come from.\n\n\u201cThe next government, which I hope is going to be the PDP government, will look at the issue of insecurity and find a lasting solution to it and bring back the country to a state of peaceful coexistence and free movement.\n\n\u201cWith the present insecurity in the country, every common man and woman knows that Nigeria is in a big problem under the current government. Nigeria is in a state of disarray. But a good political party and a good government can solve this problem of insecurity.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you that traveling by road is now dangerous, traveling by train is also dangerous. And those who have the money travel by air. But the common man cannot travel by air. Anywhere you go today, you are not safe.\n\n\u201cThe industrial development in Nigeria is not going well because government policy is not consistent over the years.\n\n\u201cIf government policy is consistent, Nigeria wouldn\u2019t have been where it is today. Every policy needs to be consistent for a period of five years running. But changing a policy soon after implementation by successive governments is not good for industrial development of the country.\n\n\u201cIf Nigeria must be re-industrialised, government policy on the Manufacturing sector must be consistent to stand the test of time,\u201d he said.",

We were creating jobs for other countries but now the jobs are here and youths have to key into the project instead of looking for white-collar jobs.\n\n\u201cWe will also be introducing fishery into the rice fields. There will be more training and sensitisation of farmers,\u201d he said,\n\nNational Coordinator of Sawah Eco-Technology, Dr. Ademiluyi Yinka, said President Buhari approved the training for rice farmers in some selected states through NCAM.\n\nDr. Ademiluyi stated that the technology encourages the use of low lands for rice cultivation and produces more yields per hectare more than the conventional methods of growing rice.\n\nHe said weed and pest control was easily done with the technology.",

They said they were not aware of any scheduled autopsy.\n\nThe legal practitioner said the autopsy would have helped to put an end to speculations about how Adegoke died and whether any part of his body is missing as alleged by some people.\n\nWhat could have been a giant step towards unraveling the cause of Adegoke\u2019s death was frustrated by his family, Abiodun said.\n\nAccording to him, all parties in the dispute had agreed with the Police for the conduct of the autopsy on Friday only for the Adegokes to keep away at the last minute.\n\nHe said a team of independent pathologists led by professors had arrived from Abuja and Ilorin on Thursday in preparation for the autopsy which was scheduled to commence by 9am on Friday, 19th November 2021.\n\nHe stated that when the Police team from the Osun State Police Command and the pathologists arrived at 9am, the members of the family of the deceased were not available.\n\nHe said that Police officers handling the case called them repeatedly on the phone to know their whereabouts and their initial response was that they were stuck in traffic in Osogbo at about 12noon.\n\nThree hours later, he said the Adegokes called back to say they were no longer coming.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that this is a calculated attempt to frustrate investigation into the matter and establish the fact that Timothy Adegoke died of natural causes,\u201d Abiodun said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe same brother spoke with The Nation and said that the Police have not told him what killed his brother and the reason why they arrested Chief Ramon Adedoyin. If that is the case, why is he going about smearing his name?\n\n\u201cJustice is a tripartite triangle: justice to the victim, justice to the accused and justice to the society whose norm is desecrated. There must be justice to all. Gbade Adegoke must be stopped in his campaign of calumny to smear Chief Adedoyin\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cIf they have nothing to hide, they should make themselves available for the autopsy to be conducted so that the whole world will know the truth.\u201d\n\nAbiodun appealed to Osun State Police Commissioner, Wale Olokode, to \u201cdisplay the highest professionalism in this matter and act according to the evidence and facts already established before the Police and not what rumour mongers are spreading and be fair to all the parties.\u201d\n\nWe were not informed about autopsy, says family\u2019s lawyer\n\nCounsel to the Adegokes, Mr Babarinde Samson,denied that the family was informed about any autopsy scheduled for Friday.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe were on our way to Osogbo yesterday (Friday) when the police informed us that they would carry out an autopsy on Adegoke on Friday. We demanded that we must have a pathologist from the family who must be part of the process.\n\n\u201cWe told them that the autopsy should not be carried out without our pathologist on ground. \u201cThis is very important to our case. We arrived at the Police command around 2 PM. We met with the Commissioner of Police on Friday and he said he was just informed that an autopsy should be conducted on Friday.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to carry out autopsy without family representation. They informed us around 1 PM yesterday and we kicked against that.\u201d\n\nThirty-seven year-old Adegoke had travelled from his base in Abuja to Ile-Ife on Friday ,November 5 to write his last examination.\n\nThe late Director of Finance at Xiamien Stone Limited, Abuja, according to investigation, flew from Abuja to Akure in Ondo State. His plane landed in the Ondo State capital at 3pm.\n\nHe then proceeded to Ile-Ife by road, hitting town at about 4.45pm.\n\nHe chose to lodge at Hilton Hotel and Resort located on the Ife-Ibadan expressway opposite Ife Central Local Government Area secretariat ,booking for a deluxe suite at N18,500 per night for two nights.\n\nMeanwhile, the management of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital (OAUTHC), has denied that the corpse of Mr Timothy Adegoke who died mysteriously at Hilton Hotel and Resort, Ile-Ife was deposited in their morgue.\n\nPolice spokesperson, SP Yemisi Opalola, had claimed that the remains of Adegoke were deposited in OAUTHC after it was exhumed.\n\nA statement by the management through the Public Relations Officer, Kemi Fasooto, titled, \u2018Disclaimer on the Current Case of Timothy Adegoke\u2019, read, \u201cThe attention of the Management of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, has been drawn to claim that the body of Timothy Adegoke was brought to the morgue of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex for autopsy. Please we want to state that the body of the deceased was never deposited in our hospital for any coroner case.\u201d\n\nPolice spokesperson, Yemisi Opalola, in a 46 seconds video made available to The Nation on Saturday night, retracted the information she provided earlier. Speaking in Yoruba language, she said: \u201cI want to state it categorically that the remains of Timothy Adegoke was deposited in Osun State University Teaching Hospital and not in OAUTCH.\n\n\u201cWe (Police) are not covering any facts about this matter.\u201d",

          "text": "From TONY JOHN, Port Harcourt\n\nA new militant group in the Niger Delta known as Bayan-Men have blown up an oil facility belonging to the Nigeria Agip Oil Company (NAOC), in Ogba/Egbema/Andoni Local Government Area of Rivers State.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nDaily Sun gathered that the group which blew up the oil well, OB5, (Obiavu-5) operated by Agip in the area, said their action following the failure of the oil firm to deal directly with their host communities.\n\nIt was noted that there has been panic in the area following the renewed attack on oil facilities owned by Agip in Omoku by the new militia group, who said their interest was better deal for their people.\n\nLeader of the Bayan-Men,who simply gave his name as \u201cGeneral\u201d the Bayan-Men, in Port Harcourt, yesterday, said that their action was because the oil company has refused to allow the people benefit from their operation in the area, adding that the firm was neck deep in divide-and-rule antics.\n\nThe General said: \u201cThe only thing we want Agip to do is to deal directly with the 27 communities of Omoku, according to the Federal Government resolution.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want Agip to be negotiating with anybody. They should deal with the communities. If they continue like this, what we have done now is small to what we will do if they continue.\n\n\u201cThey should not keep us together and treat us as one. They should treat communities individually.\n\n\u201cWe are not joking. We are not interested in killing anybody. Our interest is that they must do the right thing, else we will keep blowing up their facilities. We are giving them 24 hours to start the process of doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nConfirming the development, the Coordinator-General of Omoku Community Youth Leaders Forum (OCYLF), Ekeuku Pureheart, disclosed that the development was as a result of the failure of Agip to adhere to the demands of the people.\n\nPureheart noted that the matter was simply for Agip to recognize the various communities that make up Omoku, adding that the boys were threatening to carry out more attacks if Agip fails to do the right thing.\n\nPureheart said: \u201cFederal Government intervened a longtime ago. Now, some uncontrollable boys and some militia group have blown up Agip oil well, OB-5. Obiavu-5 is the name of the oil well.\n\n\u201cThe boys are still threatening that if Agip does not engage directly with the communities of Omoku and give them what is due them, that they will do more.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on the Federal Government and other relevant agencies to intervene before things get out of hand. This may cause drop in production. The government does not need any situation that will result to further drop in production to occure.\n\n\u201cThe group is saying enough is enough. Agip is working with few individuals in Omoku to oppress the people and the boys are saying they will no longer take that.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Agip was still struggling to put out the ravaging fire on the facility.\n\nPureheart: \u201cAgip is already there trying to bring down the flame. They are there with fire fighters to bring the fire under control.\n\n\u201cThe group is saying that Agip should deal with individual communities, that is what the law provides. Omoku is a cluster of communities. And the law says when you reach any land, treat them differently and give them what is due them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey should adhere to FG resolution of February 27, 2021, and that agreement must be implemented in line with the Petroleum Industry Act. We are urging the FG to stop up to ensure that the agreement is implemented in full.\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "title": "In Double Standard, US Threatens Nigeria with Arms Embargo, While Silent on Israel",
          "text": "\u2022 100 NAF personnel as force reviews safety standards\n\n\u2022 CAN faults removal of Nigeria from religious violations list\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi in Lagos, Kingsley Nwezeh and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nIn what seems to be a clear case of double standard, the United States has threatened that Nigeria risks arms embargo for alleged violations of the laws on armed conflicts in the fight against banditry, terrorism, and other forms of violence in different parts of the federation.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with CNN International released yesterday by the US Department of State, the US Secretary of State, Antony J. Blinken, threatened that his country would apply the Leahy Laws against Nigeria if the allegations of rights violations were found to be credible.\n\nThe threat came just as the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) faulted the removal of Nigeria from the US 2021 list of religious violators, insisting that Christians are still being persecuted by terrorist groups and other Islamic associations in the country.\n\nAccording to reports, the United States was said to have vetoed over 50 United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions critical of Israel since 1972.\n\nDuring the last escalation of violence between Israel and the Palestinians, the US had reportedly stuck to that playbook, blocking a joint statement calling for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.\n\nSeveral resolutions condemning violence against Palestine protesters, and the illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, were also reportedly thwarted by the US.\n\nThe UN resolutions had also stated that East Jerusalem should not be considered Israeli territory, but the US recognised Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital in December 2017.\n\nIn contrast to Washington\u2019s blanket support for Israel, concerns have heightened that the US wants to tie Nigeria\u2019s hand behind her back in the face of attacks by terrorists, and bandits by threatening arms embargo against the country in the fight against insurgent groups.\n\nBut Blinken, in a surprise move, said his country would apply the Leahy Laws against Nigeria.\n\nThe Leahy Laws prohibit the US Department of State and Department of Defence from providing military assistance to foreign security force units that violate human rights with impunity.\n\nBlinken said: \u201cOf course, we also have laws in place \u2013 the Leahy laws, for example. That makes sure that if there are units that have committed abuses; we are not going to provide equipment to those units.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the US would invoke the Leahy Laws against Nigeria, the secretary of state promised: \u201cWell, we look in any instance if there are credible allegations that prove out or that we believe meet the standard of the law, of course, we will apply the law.\n\n\u201cIf there is genuine transparency, accountability, and change that follows from these incidents and these abuses, I think that is very important, not only to our administration. It is also important to the US Congress in making judgments about continuing to assist the security forces,\u201d Blinken explained.\n\nThe secretary of state, however, explained the nature of military assistance the US had been giving Nigeria, noting that it was not all about the sale of military hardware alone, but also about the software.\n\nAccording to Blinken, \u201cthe military assistance itself is not just the hardware that we might provide \u2013 airplanes or helicopters. It is also the software as well as the human software\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cBecause one of the things that we are doing is making sure that as we are providing equipment to deal with profound security challenges that are faced here in Nigeria \u2013 terrorism, criminal activity, other violence, those who will be using the equipment are trained.\n\n\u201cSecurity forces must be trained in a way that makes sure that they are doing it to avoid hurting the good guys, even as they are going after the bad guys, to make sure that the laws of armed conflict are fully in mind. If they make mistakes, they are corrected and they are brought to light immediately,\u201d Blinken explained.\n\nReacting to the report on the Lekki Tollgate incident, Blinken admitted that the report of the Lekki Incident had brought transparency to what happened on the night of October 20, 2020.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think the first of all, the fact of the report, of the panel\u2019s work is usually important because it is bringing vital transparency to what happened, to the violence that took place around the #EndSARS protests and the allegations of abuses by the security forces.\n\n\u201cI have not seen the published report yet. I think it will hopefully be coming out very, very soon. But a couple of things are really important,\u201d Blinken added.\n\nHe explained that the report was important to make sure that such an incident would not happen again.\n\nHe argued that reforms \u201care necessary to build and rebuild trust between the citizens and the security services, between citizens and the state. That is an obligation of both the state government and the federal government.\u201d\n\nBlinken insisted that officers of the Nigerian Army and the Nigeria Police, who played one role or the other in the Lekki Incident should be made to account for their roles.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf there are individuals that \u2013 as it emerges from this report \u2013 who are responsible for committing abuses, there has to be accountability in terms of those individuals. That too is vital to rebuilding trust between citizens and the state and the security services.\u201d\n\nThe panel\u2019s report had recommended that all officers deployed to the tollgate should face appropriate disciplinary action. Except for Commander, 81 Division Garrison, Brig. Gen. Francis Omata, the panel demanded that all military officers involved in the operations should be stripped of their status and dismissed on the ground that they \u201care not fit and proper to serve in any public or security service of the nation.\u201d\n\nThe panel equally recommended that the Divisional Police Officer, Maroko Police Division, Mr. Raji Ganiyu, and all police officers deployed for operation between October 20 and 21, 2020 should be prosecuted for arbitrary and indiscriminate shooting and killing of the #EndSARS protesters.\n\nOn the Ethiopia-Tigray conflict, Blinken disclosed that the US \u201cis acting in close coordination with former President Olusegun Obasanjo, supporting his efforts, and other leaders on the continent including Kenyan President Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta to end the conflict.\u201d\n\nHe emphasised the African-led solutions to end the Ethiopia-Tigray conflict, noting that the African Union with Obasanjo \u201cis doing exactly that. It is a very important approach and it is something that we will support.\u201d\n\nCAN Faults Removal of Nigeria from Religious Violations List\n\nIn another development, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) yesterday faulted the removal of Nigeria Nigeria from the US 2021 list of religious violators, insisting that Christians are still being persecuted by terrorist groups and other Islamic associations in the country.\n\nThe apex Christian organisation said that it was at a loss on the data or statistics used by the US government in arriving at delisting Nigeria from the list of \u2018Countries of Particular Concern\u2019 on the issue of freedom of religion.\n\nUS Secretary of State, Blinken, had in a statement on Wednesday, blacklisted Russia, China, and eight other countries as religious violators, leaving out Nigeria which was placed on the same list in 2020.\n\nSpeaking in Nigeria during a two-day official visit that ended on Friday, Blinken had disclosed that the delisting of Nigeria was based on facts.\n\nBut CAN in a statement yesterday condemned the decision, saying that Christians were still being ferociously attacked and that nothing has changed between 2020 and 2021 to warrant the removal of Nigeria from the list of religious violators.\n\nThe statement signed by CAN President, Rev Samson Ayokunle, read in part: \u201cThe US government did not contact us when they were listing Nigeria among the countries of \u2018Particular Concern\u2019 on religious freedom, neither did they seek our opinion before removing Nigeria from the list. If they had done, we would have been able to compare the statistics then and now on the issue of freedom of religion in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhatever may be the data they used, our prayer is that Nigeria would be a country where no religious group is discriminated against or persecuted and that our government would see to it that all religiously biased policies are discontinued.\n\n\u201cChristians had faced and are still facing persecution from ISWAP and the Boko Haram Islamic Group till today as before. These are the people who said their agenda was to wipe away Christianity from Nigeria and to plant Islam as the only religion from the North down to the Atlantic Ocean in the South. That agenda with the killing of Christians has not stopped till today and Nigerians are living witnesses.\n\n\u201cThe bandits have joined other militant Islamic groups to be ferociously attacking churches, killing worshippers, and kidnapping for ransom.

          "text": "\u2022Katsina recruits 500 more vigilance operatives to tackle banditry\n\nLaleye Dipo in Minna\n\nTo curb incessant banditry and kidnapping in Niger State, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello has banned the sale of motorcycles in the state.\n\nThis is coming as bandits have invaded Zagzaga community in the Munya Local Government Area of Niger State, the third within one week, and abducted 10 more villagers, bringing the total number of persons with the bandits to 83.\n\nThey have also demanded for N150million ransom by the bandits before those in captivity would be set free.\n\nThe Katsina State Government has however, recruited 500 more persons as vigilance operatives to complement efforts of other security agencies in rural communities.\n\nSecretary to the Niger State Government, Mr. Ahmed Matane, said in a statement issued in Minna yesterday that the ban on sales of motorcycle resulted from incessant security challenges in some parts of state.\n\nHe stated that the ban was also informed by the fact that bandits and kidnappers now demand motorcycles as ransom.\n\nHe explained that the ban covered the sale of \u201cany motorcycle (Bajaj, Boxer, Qiujeng, Honda ACE, Jingchen) with engine capacity from 185 Cubic Centimetres (cc) and above\u2019\u2019.\n\nMatane stated also that the measure was aimed at eradicating the activities of criminals, bandits and kidnappers who unleashed mayhem on innocent citizens.\n\nHe condemned the degree of carnage and pandemonium bandits and kidnappers caused in parts of the state and reiterated its continued determination to rid the state of security threats.\n\nMatane added that the government was aware of the inconveniences the measure would cause the people, but the decision was taken in the overall interest of the state.\n\nHe appealed to dealers in motorcycles in the state to comply with the directive.\n\nHe urged the citizens to cooperate with security agencies on the security measures being put in place to put an end to activities of criminal elements.\n\nThe secretary to the state government also stated that government had ordered security agencies in the state to ensure effective and strict compliance and enforcement of the directive.\n\nMatane reaffirmed that commercial motorcycling and operation of illegal garages remained banned in Minna and its environs.\n\nMeanwhile, bandits have invaded Zagzaga community in the Munya Local Government Area of Niger State, the third within one week, and abducted 10 more villagers, bringing the total number of persons with the bandits to 83.\n\nThey have also demanded for N150million ransom by the bandits before those in captivity will be set free.\n\nAn eyewitness told THISDAY yesterday that the bandits returned to the community in the early morning hours, riding 10 motorcycles.\n\n\u201cThey parked their motorcycles about 500 metres to our village and came on foot, and began to select those they wanted to take away\n\n\u201cThey were asking for names of some particular set of people which gave us the impression that they were working with informants,\u201d the eyewitness further said.\n\nIt was learnt that before the Saturday morning invasion the bandits had phoned to demand for the N150million ransom.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that people are now leaving Zagzaga in droves as a result of the activities of the bandits who have set up a camp at Sohon Kabula with not less than 30 motorcycles at their disposal.\n\nMeanwhile, the Katsina State Government has recruited 500 more persons as vigilance operatives to complement efforts of other security agencies in rural communities.\n\nThe Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mustapha Inuwa, said this was part of efforts to check banditry.\n\nHe spoke while receving the interim report on the recruitment of vigilance groups, led by the Special Adviser on Security, Alhaji Ibrahim Katsina.\n\nHe said the measures were part of sustained efforts by the administration to restore peace and security.\n\n\u2018Each state in the North-west that is currently facing security challenges has been given the mandate to recruit credible vigilance members to boost their security architecture,\u2019\u2019 Inuwa said.\n\nAlso speaking, a member of the Security Committee representing Katsina Emirate Council, Kauran Katsina and district head of Rimi, Alhaji Nuhu Abdulkadir, said the Committee had lived up to its mandates and had searched diligently for trustworthy and reliable people in the communities, who had the needed qualities to be trained and work alongside security personnel for the restoration of peace in Katsina.\n\nA member of the Security Committee representing Daura Emirate Council, and also a retired Deputy Commissioner of Police, Lawal Al-Hassan said the Committee selected 13 vigilantes from each local government area of the state, who were of proven courage and integrity, with the right disposition to get the job done.\n\nWith the previous 500 persons that were recruited, the total number of vigilantes in the state is now 1,000.\n\nShare this:

The implication of your request is very serious\u2026 But the demand you made is heavy, I will consider it\u2019\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThough, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday declared that an unconditional release of the leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra, (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, currently standing trial for treason, runs contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers, and that such a demand was quite heavy, nonetheless, he said he would consider the plea for amnesty for him.\n\nA group of Igbo elders, under the aegis of \u201cHighly Respected Igbo Greats,\u201d led by First Republic parliamentarian and minister of aviation, Mbazulike Amaechi, requested the amnesty for Kanu, during a visit to Buhari at the State House, Abuja, yesterday.\n\nWhile receiving the delegation, led by the 93 year-old statesman, Buhari said: \u201cYou\u2019ve made an extremely difficult demand on me as leader of this country. The implication of your request is very serious.\n\n\u201cIn the last six years, since I became President, nobody would say I have confronted or interfered in the work of the Judiciary. God has spared you, and given you a clear head at this age, with a very sharp memory. A lot of people half your age are confused already. But the demand you made is heavy, I will consider it.\u201d\n\nStressing his policy of non-interference with the Judiciary, the President said when Kanu jumped bail, got arrested and was brought back to the country, \u201cI said the best thing was to subject him to the system. Let him make his case in court, instead of giving very negative impressions of the country from the outside. I feel it\u2019s even a favour to give him that opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe President condoled with Amaechi, who recently buried his wife, praying that her soul would rest in peace.\n\nThe nonagenarian had described the situation in the Southeast as \u201cpainful and pathetic,\u201d lamenting that \u201cbusinesses have collapsed, education is crumbling amid a reign of fear.\u201d\n\nAmaechi pleaded for a political, rather than military solution, requesting that if Kanu was released to him as the only First Republic Minister still alive, \u201che would no longer say the things he had been saying.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that he could control him, \u201cnot because I have anything to do with IPOB, but I am highly respected in Igboland today.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said twice he had interfaced with Nnamdi Kanu in the past, and the latter rescinded orders earlier given on civil disobedience.\n\nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave this planet without peace returning to my country. I believe in one big, united Nigeria, a force in Africa. Mr. President, I want you to be remembered as a person who saw Nigeria burning, and you quenched the fire.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Igbo Great\u2019s delegation were former Governor of Anambra State, Chukwuemeka Ezeife, Bishop Sunday Onuoha of the Methodist Church, former President of Igbo socio-cultural group, Aka Ikenga, Goddy Uwazurike and Tagbo Amaechi.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "When the federal government launched its National Housing Programme (NHP) and created a portal for the sale of completed houses under the scheme in November, the idea was to address housing deficit in the country and ease the burden of acquiring homes for Nigerians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is a programme borne out of the government\u2019s desire to provide affordable housing for its citizenry,\u201d information on the NHP portal reads.\n\nThe programme gives the options of mortgage, rent, and outright purchase.\n\nSpeaking on November 18 when he appeared before the senate committee on housing, Babatunde Fashola, minister of works and housing, said variation in prices according to states is as a result of the cost of building and topography.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe minister also said the cost of the structures range between \u201cN7.2 million and about N16 million, depending on what a person wants\u201d.\n\nHOW AFFORDABLE ARE THE NHP HOMES?\n\nChecks on the NHP portal by TheCable show that a one-bedroom bungalow goes for N9,268,751. The price is the same across states where the property type is available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA two-bedroom bungalow sells for N12,398,460, while that of a three-bedroom costs 16,491,155.\n\nA one-bedroom flat in a condominium available in southern states goes for N7,222,404, two-bedroom apartment costs N9,148,378, while a three-bedroom unit costs N13,241,074.\n\nIn May 2020, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released its 2019 report on \u2018Poverty and Inequality in Nigeria\u2019. According to the report, 82.9 million Nigerians are living in poverty. This represents 40.1 percent of the nation\u2019s populace.\n\nZamfara, Sokoto, Benue, Adamawa, Gombe, Plateau are among the poorest states in Nigeria. Most of these states have also been affected by years of banditry and insurgency which have left millions of residents displaced and homeless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaika Ahmed, commissioner for humanitarian affairs and disaster management in Zamfara, had said in September that there are over 600,000 displaced persons affected by banditry in the state.\n\nAlso, Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue state, said there are over 1.5 million IDPs in the state.\n\nTheCable had reported how insecurity has forced many residents of Benue to abandon their farms and seek refuge in IDP camps.\n\nGiven the poverty rate and scourge of displacements and homelessness in these states, it is not clear if the \u201caffordable housing\u201d takes IDPs into consideration, considering the cost of the homes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018N5M SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR A ONE-BEDROOM UNIT IN SOME AREAS IN OGUN\u2019\n\nA private developer, who didn\u2019t want to be named, said the prices offered by the federal government may depend on the area the buildings are located.\n\nAccording to him, while materials required for a one-bedroom apartment may differ depending on the design of the structure, the total figure is still significantly determined by the area the land is purchased.\n\n\u201cSome persons may view the FG\u2019s price on the high side, but it depends on the area. Building a one-bedroom apartment with exactly the same specifications in a place like Lekki and in Olambe area of Ogun state will come with very different prices,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor instance, I got a recent estimate for a building in Olambe area of Ogun state, and although the land was already purchased, the cost estimate for building materials and workmanship was around N3.5 million after we did our calculations.\n\n\u201cTo mention a few things in the estimate, building layout drawing was done for N20,000; materials for foundation including blocks, granite, sharp sand, lines, cement, was estimated at around N600,000; roofing sheets, N250,000; plumbing, N107,500; aluminum and burglary works, N245,000; tiling including materials for the floor and walls, N205,000; electrical wiring, N66,000. There are also other things like the soakaway, plastering, painting, flooring of the compound, gate, doors, windows, among others.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Fashola says over 7,000 persons have indicated interest in purchasing the apartments.\n\nThe big question is, with millions of people living below the poverty line and struggling to afford a day\u2019s meal, who are the citizens in places like Zamfara that can afford a one-bedroom bungalow at N9.2 million?",

          "text": "A few streets away from Eko Atlantic City, the doors to the exhibition halls of Gallery B57 are open, revealing a black and white portrait of Instagram Influencer, Sanchan.\n\nPortrait of Instagram influencer, Sanchan\n\nLast year, during the global lockdown, Nigerian-born international visual artist, Ade Adekola, made an open call on Instagram for people who were interested in having their photographs turned into portraits. He opened a sign-up form with a commitment to do 30 portraits, but when he opened the form two hours later, the number of requests had exceeded 80. He had to close the call immediately to avoid being overwhelmed.\n\nDuring the process of creating the portraits\u2014all 80 of them\u2014he was able to improve his creative process, developing new techniques that helped him optimise the way he worked. He took the original photographs shared by interested persons, stripped them of all colours, turning them into black and white. He then turned them into engravings, before shading, cutting, and colouring them. Optimising this process, coupled with the overwhelmingly positive feedback he received from his 80 selected muses, encouraged him to create more portraits.\n\nIn the end, Adekola created 700 portraits, but there are only 40 portraits with striking designs and a collage of all 700 portraits on display at the exhibition halls of the gallery.\n\nThe allure of the 40 portraits on display, chosen by Adekola for their unique poses, circumstance or personal resonance to the subject, was elevated by presenting it in lightboxes.\n\nNow titled Lockdown Portraits, his project would go on to form a part of his exhibition titled, Dislocation &\u2026 alongside Anthology of an African Wedding and Diaspora Axis.\n\nOpening up conversations for dislocated people\n\nDislocation &\u2026 is an exhibition featuring NFT art, 3D textiles and augmented reality and events that feature creators from Tokyo, Israel and Singapore on social media and other digital collaborative platforms.\n\nThe artworks in the exhibition were conceived, executed and completed during the year-long lockdown, exploring and amplifying the effects of dislocation on humanity.\n\nIn Diaspora Axis, Adekola took a blend of various nationalities and used it to create a textile design. Ade set out to give agency to people with double or more nationalities, who were confused about their \u201ctrue identities\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo, the inspiration for the anthology series, from that disability perspective, are people who had an emotional roadmap, and that roadmap was truncated. I just open up the space for you to enter and think about what may or could have happened.\u201d\n\nThe design was adopted by an Israeli company to create and display dresses. Using 3D, over 70 design patterns are shown to consumers. \u201cSo, when you buy it, they send the physical garment to you, all cut,\u201d Adekola explained.\n\nA pandemic is a form of dislocation to Adekola, who said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to explore the different kinds of dislocation forces. So, the pandemic is a kind of dislocation where people are in isolation\u2014a prolonged one.\u201d\n\nBuying African emotional entanglement\n\nA scene from Anthology of an African Wedding\n\nAnthology of an African Wedding collection explores dislocation from the angle of emotional entanglement in Yoruba wedding cultures. The Yoruba nation hails from the southwest region of Nigeria, and their wedding culture is colourful, vibrant, and in many ways, extravagant.\n\nViewable using augmented reality, Anthology of an African Wedding collection brings viewers a step closer to experiencing a Yoruba wedding with its traditional gowns, headgear and rings.\n\nAdekola has evolved his art using Photoshop for over 20 years, creating over 20,000 texture designs that he used to create Anthology of an African Wedding. Anthology of an African Wedding, which also sells as an NFT on OpenSea, consists of 18 art pieces\u20149 showing traditional wedding scenes and 9 white wedding ones.\n\nDislocation &\u2026 is on display at Gallery B57 until December 1st.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Chipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration may revolutionise Africa\u2019s creative hustle",
          "text": "Want to be a creator in Africa? Okay. But be wary; it\u2019s going to take time, thick skin, and a little bit of what we at TechCabal like to call \u201cthe creative hustle\u201d.\n\nFor years, Africa\u2019s creative industry has been hampered by poor returns, leaving creators at the mercy of sponsors and algorithm-manipulated trends.\n\nBut fintechs like Chipper Cash stand to be a driving force behind fan-sponsored content that may change the way Africans create and consume digital media.\n\nWhere the money resides\u2026\n\nTwitter has been a space for clapbacks, online discourse, and creativity since its inception. On the third most popular social media platform in Africa, the continent\u2019s Twitter users wield power so influential that Twitter began to build out its first Africa-based team in Ghana this year.\n\nWhile Twitter is an impactful platform for creators, it has not always been a lucrative one. In a world where creators are waking up to the value of their content, monetisation has become more essential than ever, and social media platforms are finally catching on.\n\nThe digital content industry is predicted to skyrocket to a value of $38.2 billion by 2030. But developing content in an increasingly competitive market requires funding and return on investment that Africa\u2019s creators are not seeing, which is \u201cthe quality of work creators produce,\u201d said David I. Adeleke, Communications Lead and Managing Editor at Nestcoin, in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nSo when TikTok, a newer entry into Africa\u2019s social media space, came on the scene, it offered a monetisation plan, out of necessity. To incentivise creators to pivot from the more popular social media platforms in Africa like Facebook, it rolled out its very own Creator Fund offering payouts to TikTok-ers once that reached 100,000 authentic views on the app.\n\nStill, in a world where creators like Ryan Kaji, a 9-year-old from the US, made an estimated $29.5 from YouTube and an additional $200 million from branded toys and clothing, Africa\u2019s creatives are making far less money from their work.\n\nThe funding divide\n\nYouTubers earn money directly from YouTube for ads inserted on top of their videos. They are paid on a cost-per-thousand-views (CPM) basis and accrue earnings when a viewer watches at least 30 seconds of a played ad or half the ad for a shorter advertisement.\n\nOf the 10 countries with the highest CPM per video, Algeria is the only African country on the list. Algerian YouTubers receive $24.50 CPM. And, after earnings are garnered, YouTube takes a 55% cut, further reducing take-home pay.\n\nAccording to Mike Otieno, co-founder of Wowzi, a seamless, Africa-focused, AI-driven influencer marketing platform, South Africa is the most mature market for paid creative content in Africa, with the nation\u2019s influencers earning more, on the whole than other influencers throughout the continent.\n\nBut, even with higher than average earnings, Caspar Lee, South Africa\u2019s most-watched YouTuber, earns around 10% of Kaji\u2019s YouTube earnings per year. Nigeria\u2019s highest-earning YouTuber, Mark Angel Comedy, earns around 12.2% of that same figure. And Uganda\u2019s most-watched creator on YouTube, musician Eddy Kenzo, earns around 1.6% of that.\n\nThe difference between creator revenues and earnings in countries like the US versus countries in Africa comes down to market size and potential, says Otieno.\n\n\u201cMarkets with many big brands making a lot of money means more allocation to advertising budgets, which trickles down to creators. Thriving markets also tend to be hyper-competitive, so brands want to outdo each other.\u201d\n\nWhen bigger brands enter growing markets, they do so with a long-term outlook of the markets\u2019 growth, spreading endorsement funding out over a longer period. Brands with smaller budgets, on the other hand, tend to place conversion as a top priority and aim to get a \u201cmaximum return for their buck,\u201d remarked Otiento.\n\nBut forecasting a market\u2019s potential growth does not account for the power and value that creators add to the creative ecosystem in the present.\n\nChipper Cash, an Africa-made cross-border payments company valued at $2 billion, is working to change this by giving creators the opportunity to receive direct revenue from the audience that loves and understands the true value of their creative content.\n\nTwitter sponsors\n\nTwitter joined the creator monetisation club in May with its very own Tip Jar function. Through the Tip Jar, users are now able to send money to their favourite online voices via PayPal, Venmo, or Cash App in-app integrations. But, as none of these payment apps is widely used throughout Africa, the region\u2019s Tweeters were still limited in their ability to sponsor their favourite creators.\n\nIn October, Chipper Cash announced its all-new seamless integration with Twitter\u2019s Tip Jar.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, Wiza Jalakasi, Vice President of Global Developer Relations at Chipper Cash, shared that the fintech company worked with Twitter to build out the platform\u2019s tech to create a \u201ccheap mechanism for tipping out creators\u201d.\n\nTwitter users will be able to receive payments via a QR code or direct link using their chipper.me link along with their username and an easily accessible button on mobile, using the Twitter Tips feature.\n\nThe integration will also support smaller microtransactions, with no charge for withdrawals.\n\nJalakasi believes that the app\u2019s integration with Twitter will change the \u201cfundamental misalignment of incentives\u201d by getting rid of \u201cunnecessary middlemen [such as brand sponsors] in the creative economy value chain\u201d and help \u201cexpand monetisation pathways for African creators\u201d at large.\n\nSo far, the Twitter-Chipper Cash integration is only supported for users in Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda.\n\nFunding the fandom\n\nIt\u2019s clear that fans of Africa\u2019s top creatives are willing and ready to fund their faves. On Wednesday, Nigerian singer-songwriter, Davido, raised more than $338,000 via social media after posting his bank account information and asking fans and friends to send him a little bit of birthday cash.\n\n\u201cFans funding creatives\u201d has been a tried and true method in other parts of the world.\n\nChipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration is reminiscent of similar models used on China-made live-streaming apps. Fuelled by digital payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay integrated into the social media app itself, users were able to tip their favourite creators without leaving the app. Live stream tip functions were so successful in China that the market reached an estimated $4.4 billion in revenue in 2018 before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014which led to an additional surge in live stream viewing.\n\nWhat user-generated tip culture has provided in China is a robust influencer culture with a robust, local, influencer economy that spans e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and education.\n\nChina\u2019s influencers wield so much power that, in a recent double-11 sale for the Chinese e-commerce giant, Taobao, a top influencer generated $1.67 billion in sales over a 12-hour period.\n\nTikTok, born from the Chinese short video app, Douyin, has attempted to replicate this metric abroad and is now also offering gifts in the form of tips in select regions.\n\nYouTube also began offering a similar system with its Super Chat function in 2021, from which it keeps around 30% of overall earnings gained. Payment also requires linking your credit card to Google Pay.\n\nTwitter-unfriendly\n\nBut before Chipper Cash further expands throughout Africa, ideas about Twitter in certain countries will need a revamp.\n\nKenya is one of the fastest-growing economies in sub-Saharan Africa and a hotspot for tech innovation. In the country, Twitter is used as a vibrant space for social discourse. The unstoppable force that is Kenyans on Twitter (or KOT) has resulted in the relocation of a New York Times East Africa Bureau Chief and a rally to stop IMF loans to the country.\n\nOtieno says that moments like this make popular creators on apps like TikTok and Instagram hesitant to shift towards using Twitter.\n\n\u201cTwitter guys are seen as noisemakers in Kenya, so it\u2019s not somewhere people go to show love.\u201d\n\nHowever, Otieno believes that the integration of new app add-ons like Twitter Spaces and a clear monetisation scheme like Chipper Cash provides, creates an added benefit for creators to tweet and speak.\n\n\u201cIf you speak to TikTok and Instagram influencers, they\u2019ll say, \u2018I don\u2019t have a Twitter account. I just don\u2019t understand that space.\u2019 But Spaces gave Twitter more life. I think that influencers have started to become more receptive, and we will start to see more of a transition.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Yesterday, African e-commerce giant, Jumia, released its earnings report for the third quarter of 2021.\n\nDespite sharing healthy numbers as a result of accelerated growth across core usage KPIs\u2014including orders, annual active customers and gross merchandise volume (GMV)\u2014the markets responded differently with the stock price dropping by 20%.\n\nBefore sharing details of the report, recall that Jumia changed the functional (default) currency of its financial report from euros to dollars in Q2 2021. This will continue into the foreseeable future.\n\nHighlights from the report\n\nJumia\u2019s adjusted EBITDA and operating losses in Q3 2021 went up by 94% and 93% year-over-year, respectively, to $52.5 million and $64 million. This increase in loss was driven by a hike in the company\u2019s investment in sales & advertising and technology.\n\nSales and advertising expenses reached $24.0 million, up 228% year-over-year, while technology and content expenses increased by 27% to $9.4 million. This is a continuation of its return to aggressive advertising which slowed during the pandemic.\n\nCommenting on this result, the company\u2019s Co-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec said, \u201cWe believe that these investments are long-term in nature and that accelerating growth will ultimately contribute to profitability, leveraging the strong efficiency gains achieved throughout 2020 and the first half of 2021.\u201d\n\nJumia ended the quarter with $185 million in cash and cash equivalents and $399 million in financial assets.\n\nHistoric number of quarterly orders\n\nA major highlight from the report was that orders made on Jumia reached an all-time quarterly high of 8.5 million, representing a 28% year-over-year growth. It\u2019s the fastest growth rate of the past seven quarters, according to the company. Closely related to that, Jumia\u2019s annual active consumers reached 7.3 million and its gross merchandise value (GMV) reached $238 million, both up 8% year-over-year.\n\nIn the third quarter, FMCG inventories overtook fashion inventories as the fastest-growing category in terms of items sold. The former posted the highest ever volume number, almost doubling on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe second-fastest-growing category was food delivery, growing by almost 40% year-over-year. This category posted its highest ever quarterly volume with over 2 million orders, surpassing the previous record registered in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nJumia noted that it saw growth momentum across all inventory categories, except phones & electronics. The company attributes this slowdown to a global supply disruption, including global chipset shortages.\n\nJumiaPay and its fintech ambition\n\nIn the second quarter, JumiaPay\u2014Jumia\u2019s financial and digital services\u2014posted its largest-ever quarterly GMV processed. The company followed by disclosing in its third-quarter report that JumiaPay processed 36% of all orders on Jumia, a significant feat considering that it competes with numerous payment options. Riding on that wave, JumiaPay has continued to grow as the company expands the range of services available to consumers on JumiaPay App.\n\nIn Nigeria for example, customers are now able to book bus tickets via the JumiaPay App, including a proprietary seat mapping selection that will be rolled out in other markets in the near future. In Egypt, JumiaPay added new consumers, including several universities which students can now pay their tuition fees online via the JumiaPay app as well as a major Arabic content streaming platform, Shahid.\n\nOptimistic about its fintech ambitions for JumiaPay, the company shared a picture of its roadmap. In the near future, it plans to launch payment cards, savings, insurance and \u2018buy now pay later\u2019 offerings to consumers of JumiaPay. For merchants, it\u2019s looking to roll out point of sale, QR Codes, consumer financing, and other offerings.\n\nSource: Jumia\n\nLogistics services\n\nFor its logistics service to third parties, Jumia reached a major milestone by recording $1 million revenue from this service. It delivered 2.9 million packages on behalf of 766 clients, this was a 123% increase on the 1.3 million packages that were delivered in Q2 2021.\n\nThe company also mentioned that it took part in impact initiatives such as Giga, a global initiative to connect every school in Africa to the Internet and every young person to information, opportunity and choice. It also partnered with Solar Taxi, a modern eco-friendly mobility company, to provide an affordable and eco-friendly delivery solution in Ghana.\n\nThe increase in losses incurred by Jumia in the third quarter wasn\u2019t good news to some investors but the company sees it as a necessary path to achieving its goal of profitability and scale.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Immediately you launch your career as an artiste and record some success, you\u2019re like a business operating and generating revenue with customers in over 70 countries. At this point, you have become a global business.\u201d Oluwatosin Ajibade (Mr Eazi)\n\nCelebrities are humans first, you know? In the grand scheme of things, they are only individuals striving to live their best lives, showcasing their creativity while making money, and spreading as much love as possible, some of the things that made them famous in the first place.\n\nTo an average LinkedIn user, Ajibade Oluwatosin (his profile name as of the time I reached out) is just a \u201cGlobal superstar and VC.\u201d A cursory glance won\u2019t reveal that he\u2019s the popular Mr Eazi.\n\nI only figured it out a few weeks ago when one of my contacts liked one of his posts. I wasted no time sending a connection request, which he accepted rather quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do I do with this new connection,\u201d I asked myself.\n\nI remembered that Mr Eazi\u2019s emPawa Africa, a talent incubator, was instrumental in placing Joeboy in the limelight. That was when I concluded he would be a good fit for the Techpoint Africa Experts series. I sent him a message, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Eazi. Source: Instagram\n\nMr Eazi had just returned from an engagement on the evening we\u2019d scheduled our talk and needed a moment to catch his breath, which he did in record time.\n\nShortly after, we exchanged pleasantries, and the stage was set for a somewhat friendly conversation; his mood, best described as calm.\n\nSeeing Mr Eazi very relaxed was quite the revelation because his demeanour was not too different from his public appearances and videos. I guess I expected a contrasting personality, as is often the case with artistes.\n\nI got the thoughts of one of his fans while writing this.\n\n\u201cI think Mr Eazi is a laid back musician. He\u2019s very African and indigenous and relates a lot with his roots.\u201d\n\nOluwatosin said it was easy to build a persona around the name Mr Eazi, which was the nickname his friends in university gave him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the nickname is just an expression of who I am. I like to live calmly,\u201d he shared.\n\nAnd this calm personality seems to be reflected in every part of his life. Expectedly, though, he takes on a new life when he has to match his fans\u2019 energy and excitement at shows and events.\n\nSince gaining popularity, Mr Eazi\u2019s reputation has grown in leaps and bounds, preceding him even beyond the music scene.\n\nThere was a funny moment. as we spoke. when he revealed his spontaneity and unpredictability. What do you think about Don Eazi as president of any nation or Pastor Eazi?\n\nThirty-year-old Oluwatosin lived his early years in Sango Otta, Ogun State. The Nigeria-born musician later relocated to Ghana for his undergraduate studies before starting his music career in London.\n\nGiven his ardent local and global following, Mr Eazi\u2019s name and content mostly scream \u2018Afrobeats to the world!\u2019 since he came into the music industry a few years back.\n\nHe believes Africa is experiencing its best years in the global music industry, with many of its music genres being embraced globally.\n\nMotivation and obsession\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwatosin Ajibade (Mr Eazi). Source: Supplied\n\nA look at the mark the young artiste has made in a short time shows that he is clearly motivated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m someone who is fascinated with seeing ideas come to life. There\u2019s some form of joy that comes from conceiving an idea and seeing it come to life.\u201d\n\nStrangely, in an industry where one can make tons of money, his excitement mostly comes from creating music in the studio; the monetary value of the music produced is secondary in his books.\n\nAs with most success stories, there\u2019s some history. Oluwatosin\u2019s career track hasn\u2019t always been straightforward. A mechanical engineering graduate, Oluwatosin traded FMCGs and gold before deciding to stick to music.\n\n\n\nThe rest of this article will be made public on November 23, by noon (WAT)..

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSomething good is a frontier; something better is also a frontier and something excellent is just another frontier! You can always go beyond these frontiers! And so what is excellent? Just a frontier!\u201d \u2014 Mehmet Murat ildan\n\n\u201cThere exist limitless opportunities in every industry. Where there is an open mind, there will always be a frontier.\u201d \u2014 Charles Kettering\n\nWhen I think about the word \u2018frontier\u2019, what comes to mind is the American Wild West. Why? My first idea of what that word means came from a book romanticising the life of one of America\u2019s founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin. For the life of me, I can\u2019t remember the title, and Google Search is not helping.\n\nBut back to the word frontier. While there are several meanings of the word, for our purposes, we would be adopting this definition by the Merriam Webster Dictionary: \u201ca new field for exploitative or developmental activity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy all the talk about frontiers? We\u2019ll get into that at the end of this article, but for now, let\u2019s take a look at some numbers.\n\nThe edtech industry in Africa: the now\n\nAccording to Briter Bridges, as of Q1 2020, there were 210 edtech startups in Africa. The African e-learning space is many times described as nascent. A bit surprising, as it is not a novel industry on the continent.\n\nThe African Virtual University, created by the World Bank in 1997 and established by a charter signed by eighteen African member states, is Africa\u2019s first Internet-based school. It also has a physical building in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi.\n\nNigeria also has a distance learning university, the National Open University of Nigeria, founded in 2002 and the first of its kind in West Africa.\n\nHowever, only just recently has the edtech space begun to pick up steam.\n\nAccording to Boye Oshinaga, Gradely CEO, \u201cThe edtech industry is at its infrastructure-building phase in Nigeria and Africa, where those players that invest in the rails will get a big payoff in the coming years.\u201d\n\nWhy the infrastructure-building phase? Because a lot of what would power the industry is just as nascent as the edtech space.\n\nMost of the time, accessibility to these edtech startups requires an Internet connection, or at the very least, a smartphone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer Internet World Stats, Internet penetration in Africa as of Q1 2020 stood at 39.3%, much lower than the world average of 58.8%.\n\nThe Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA), however, predicts that 65% of sub-Saharan Africa will have a smartphone by 2025, a number which stood at 50% as of 2020.\n\nEdtech startups vary across different sectors: massive open online courses (MOOCs), extended reality learning content, gamified learning, examination preparation, and subject-based instructional content, among others.\n\nEyitayo Ogunmola, Utiva CEO, classifies them into edtech and teched. He says the former has more to do with \u201cdeploying tech solutions to creating learning experiences.\u201d The latter, on the other hand, \u201cis majorly around incubating and accelerating talent.\u201d\n\nBut he also introduces some unlikely sectors, like jobtech, HR tech, and workforce development tech.\n\n\u201cPeople also think Jobberman and all the hiring platforms are also education technology because many of them are now deploying learning as a subset of the value.\n\n\u201cSo the education technology industry, in Africa, by extension, is a combination of the three different categories that I\u2019ve mentioned: the edtech as a product, the teched as a service, and also the other value creation products and services that are also supercharging the learning side of things.\u201d\n\nThe edtech industry in Africa: the future\n\nSo, what happens next?\n\nEvolving business models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgunmola is very confident that these sectors will never merge because \u201cthey offer different kinds of value.\u201d So while he doesn\u2019t see them merging, he believes the industry is headed the way of a harmonious divergence.\n\nInterestingly, he believes that in the future, edtech will focus more on its adaptability and new learning models than technology. Comparing fintechs and edtechs, he says the latter would be a combination of APIs and new learning models, unlike the former, which appears to be largely API-driven.\n\n\u201cI see many companies are adopting new technologies, but I also see many companies adopting new approaches; it\u2019s going to be a combination. For example, in the future, it\u2019s going to be a combination of self-paced learning, instructor learning models, gamification to incentivise learning and completion rates, and micro franchising.\n\n\u201cThere are other things like VR and augmented reality. Facebook is exploring the metaverse, right? It will be about those things.\u201d\n\nOshinaga agrees.\n\n\u201cAll disruptive technologies and the behaviour to make them widely acceptable over the next ten years already exist in some form. They will just be utilised further to deliver clearer advantages over current systems and eventually win.\u201d\n\nHe, however, says, \u201cThe future of the industry is AI-driven and personalised, and will have education delivered in more animated, interactive, and immersive content formats. Methodologies such as Use of Technology in the Classroom and other widespread methodologies will be empirically tested to prove their relevance.\u201d\n\nHe also believes homeschooling would increase, citing examples of the US and the UK.\n\n\u201cIn the future, parents will take charge of their children\u2019s learning and be more proactive in what skills they try to imbibe in the child or what exposure they are looking to add to enrich their children\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nThe increase in homeschooling occurred during the pandemic, but Africa\u2019s story is split in the middle. Some countries \u2014 Nigeria, Ghana, and Zimbabwe \u2014 do not have any laws recognising homeschooling. However, in some, like Kenya, it appears to be illegal. In contrast, others like Zambia, Rwanda, South Africa and Botswana have legalised homeschooling.\n\nIn fact, in Botswana, you are not mandated to send your child to school.\n\nWhile homeschooling data is not available in most African countries \u2014 a challenge we\u2019ll come to in a bit \u2014 South Africa, where homeschooling has been legal for several years, showed a spike in the heat of the pandemic.\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing Ogunmola and Oshinaga agree on is the emergence and importance of more data in the next frontier of the edtech industry.\n\n\u201cAs you deploy technology into the learning space, leaders would have to focus aggressively on the data that has been generated and use that data to improve the technology because this is the intersection of human behaviour and technology,\u201d Ogunmola says.\n\nHe further submits that how this data is utilised to help improve learning for the user is far more important than collecting data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about, \u2018I have 50 projects on this platform; go and work on them.\u2019 It\u2019s about whether the platform can provide you with feedback during learning to improve your capacity. Because ultimately, this is education \u2014 improving your capacity.\u201d\n\nBut, Africa\u2019s data collection and retention structures are pretty underdeveloped. Look no further than identity verification and collection processes in several African countries and how long it has taken to get to this stage.\n\nOshinaga laments the lack of data, especially in the use of government funds without any thought to \u2018Who needs it more?\u2019 or \u2018Is this school performing well enough to warrant this funding, or should it be shut down and focus shifted to other schools?\u2019\u201d\n\nSo he says, \u201cWe will have more data on the performance of teachers and schools at a more global level so it\u2019s clear what donors, governments, investors, and companies can do about it.\u201d\n\nAs we said in an earlier article, for greater efficacy, the government would do better to support players looking to aid universities in providing learning for students.\n\nPutting it succinctly, Ogunmola says, \u201cUniversities would never be edtechs.\u201d\n\nTying it back to data collation, he says, \u201cImagine all universities have the data of all their students. Name, email, and mobile number, not some email they submitted ten years ago that is no longer updated. If they have this updated, they can share that data with us in the form of an API, and we can continue to improve the alumni. That\u2019s how we build a much-improved ecosystem of talent; it\u2019s not by this disintegrated and disaggregated form of engagement.\u201d\n\nAccessibility/Affordability\n\nIn 2020, as the coronavirus swept cities and students remained at home for an extended period, many K-12 schools and universities moved online. This marked a turning point for edtech use as startups like uLesson saw a rise in users and consequently accelerated expansion plans.\n\nBut for most users, especially those in the low and middle-income bracket, some of these services were out of reach due to Internet and smartphone availability. To help with this, some countries turned to tried-and-true radio programmes as an avenue to improve accessibility and affordability.\n\nAccording to Yomi Ojo, Founder of SchoolsCompass, the divide between the haves and have nots is a huge challenge for the edtech industry.\n\n\u201cA lot of these technologies are being built for the privileged, but it further widens the educational gap between them and the less-privileged. School owners and edtech products are overlooking these things; it\u2019s a time bomb.\u201d\n\nBut as Ojo himself says, edtech startups are not non-profit organisations. He believes that the government should do more to provide better Internet services and partner with these companies.\n\nA position Ogunmola and Oshinaga agree with to varying degrees. While both believe public-private partnerships would help in the future, Ogunmola thinks we will see more Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) models or loans.\n\nAccording to Ogunmola, Utiva is one of many companies already implementing these ideas. TalentQL is another one doing so via its AltSchool Africa product.\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I take a loan for learning if I can guarantee that it\u2019s going to get me a job?\u201d Ogunmola asks.\n\nFunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of August 2021, Africa\u2019s edtech industry has attracted $20 million in funding since 2019. This is not a lot of money, especially compared to investments in edtech on a global scale, which reached $18.6 billion in 2019 alone.\n\nBut Oshinaga believes we would see better investment rounds in the future. \u201cWe already have a Series A of over $5m and seed of $2-4m. This trend will continue.\u201d\n\nIn September 2020, South African edtech startup, Valenture Institute, raised a $7 million Series A from GSV Ventures.\n\nIn January 2021, Nigerian edtech startup, uLesson, also raised $7 million in a Series A investment round led by Owl Ventures.\n\nThe next frontier\n\nBased on United Nations\u2019 estimates, according to Worldometer, Africa currently has a population of 1.3 billion people, with a median age of 19.7 years. This number is expected to grow to 1.6 billion by 2030.\n\nAt Techpoint Build 2021, discussions about the next frontier in different sectors would be in the limelight. In anticipation of these discourses, we are talking to industry leaders, getting opinions, and seeking patterns.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to have you join us in January 2022.

Emmanuel Paul has that answer and more here: Led by ex-OPay exec, Kredi Money wants to be the one-stop-shop for payments, loans, insurance, other financial services.\n\nOzow\u2019s $48m Series B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Pays, CEO and Co-Founder of Ozow\n\nSouth African fintech startup, Ozow has closed a $48 million Series B to ease online payments for South Africans.\n\nPer TechCrunch, The funding was led by Tencent, a Chinese Internet-based company. Other investors, Endeavor Catalyst and Endeavor Harvest Fund, also participated in the round.\n\nWhat does Ozow do? The startup makes it possible to pay online with bank transfers or manual Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) without using your bank app.\n\nHow? It\u2019s called automated EFT; it works just like a payment gateway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen making an online payment, customers choose Ozow as a payment option, select a bank, log in with online banking details, and Ozow automates the payment.\n\nMerchants, on the other hand, only need an account number and smartphone to receive payments.\n\nOzow\u2019s CEO, Thomas Pays, says he started the company in 2014 to create a \u201ccentral platform that could basically provide solutions to eCommerce, point of sale, e-billing and peer to peer payment.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with TechCrunch, Pays says, seven years ago, digital payment was very fragmented,\n\n\u201cif I want a point of sale device, I need to go to a company like Yoco. If I want to accept payments via card on my eCommerce site, I need to go to a PayU.\u201d\n\nOzow plans to use the funding to expand its team from 100 to 250. A part of it will also be geared towards expansion into Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria.\n\nGetting blockchain skills with Bitmama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lagos Techie on Unsplash\n\nAccording to Statista, the blockchain technology market is currently valued at $6.92 billion. That value is expected to reach $162.84 billion by 2027. This means that as the market grows, the demand for blockchain talent will also increase.\n\nIn light of this, African crypto exchange, Bitmama, is launching Bitmama Credits Programme to support young people globally with the skills needed to get a career in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe programme will begin in the first quarter of next year, offering blockchain learning materials and internships.\n\nThe big picture: With the advent of several blockchain innovations such as Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralised finance (DeFi) and Web3, the demand for blockchain talent is climbing.\n\nIn 2019, the demand for blockchain jobs increased by 300% from the previous year.\n\nInterestingly, high demand also means huge salaries. The average salary for a blockchain developer is between $150,000 and $175,000; that\u2019s approximately $15,000 to $40,000 higher than the standard salary for software engineers.\n\nWhy\u2019s there so much demand?: According to 101 Blockchains, the need for blockchain talent is fueled by the advantages of blockchain, such as security, transparency, and traceability.\n\nWith more innovations coming out of the space, the demand for blockchain talent is bound to increase.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nGoogle\u2019s Next $1 Trillion Opportunity.

          "title": "Debate over direct primaries puts Nigeria\u2019s politicians, parties in quandary",
          "text": "The recent passage of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021 by Nigeria\u2019s National Assembly inserting direct primaries as the legal mode for political parties to pick their candidates for general elections is currently dominating discourse in the polity.\n\nWhile direct primaries involve the participation of all party members in the selection of party candidates, the indirect primaries involve the use of delegates who are usually leaders and members of the executives at the ward, local government and state levels, to elect the party\u2019s candidates at a congress or convention.\n\nUnlike indirect primary, which is organised in a particular selected venue, and is often restricted to only delegates, the direct primaries take place at ward levels.\n\nAcross Nigeria there have been diverse views about the issue, while some have kicked against it, others have supported NASS decision.\n\nSome stakeholders have argued that NASS should allow political parties to pick the option best suited for them. Similarly, others have pointed out that direct primaries was only out to restore sanity, give the party back to the people, rather than the current practise where the nomination of candidates for election has been hijacked by few party leaders.\n\nRead Also: Why direct primaries may be difficult to operate in current electoral system \u2013 Sentonji\n\nThe practice now is that the indirect primaries has enabled a few political power brokers to hijack party platforms, at the expense of the majority, by only allowing some carefully selected party delegates to elect candidates.\n\nAmong the opponents of the idea of a direct primary is the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) who are in favour of an indirect primary being operated presently.\n\nSince their spirited attempts to scuttle the lawmakers\u2019 effort did not scale through, observers say that their next move perhaps, is to lobby President Muhammadu Buhari not to sign the bill into law.\n\nSpeaking recently on why he pushed for direct primaries when hosting a group of youths, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, noted that it would bring more accountability and adequate representation as political office holders would not be restricted to pleasing a group of people selected as delegates, but work for the interest of the generality of party members, and by extension, the electorate.\n\nGbajabiamila stressed that some members of the political class might not be comfortable with the arrangement, but added that the majority of the masses were in support of direct primaries, which he said would give them the opportunity of deciding who would represent them.\n\n\u201cIf I know that my return will depend on a few men, I may care about you. But if I know that my return will depend on my accountability and representation to the people, I will do the right thing. It is important for this generation to open the door of leadership to the next generation. We must allow every Nigerian to participate fully in the process of leadership. I, therefore, stand with Direct Primary.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I said at different fora that I\u2019m for direct primaries. We have to do this for the sake of the institution. When you gather yourselves (as youths), chances are that you\u2019ll win. Democracy is a government of the people. Democracy is not just a general election. It starts from the primaries.\u201d\n\nBut Gbajabiamila\u2019s position did not go down well with the Kebbi State Governor and Chairman of the PGF, Atiku Abubakar Bagudu, who faulted the National Assembly\u2019s insertion of direct primary into the law, maintaining that political parties should be allowed to pick the option best suited for them.\n\nBagudu stressed that the resolution was against the spirit of Executive Order signed by President Buhari, which frowns at large gathering in the wake of the global pandemic, adding that cumbersome, unwieldy and would overstretch the limited resources of INEC, statutorily mandated to oversee primaries conducted by political parties.\n\n\u201cWe have discussed the pros and cons. There has been concern that political parties are voluntary organisations. We express the concern that political parties be allowed to choose from the options that they so desire. There is an Executive Order, signed by President Buhari against large gatherings. These are issues we discussed and hope that the best will be achieved for Nigeria,\u201d Bagudu said.\n\nAmid the uproar, the federal lawmakers are insisting that the move was necessary to safeguard the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nSpokesman of the House of Representatives, Benjamin Kalu said recently that both chambers adopted direct primaries because it far outweighs the indirect primaries, which he noted was not in consonant with the tenets of democracy.\n\nMeanwhile, while the furore generated by the issue of direct primary is tearing the APC apart, it is not clear what the positions of the PDP Governors are on the issue.\n\nJust when the bill was passed the PDP responded through its Spokesman, and condemned the NASS decision, saying that no party has the right to impose its will on another on the method to adopt for primaries election.\n\n\u201cIt is the inalienable right of each political party, within the context of our constitutional democracy, to decide its form of internal democratic practices, including the processes of nominating its candidates for elections at any level.\n\n\u201cThe PDP also believes that no political party should force its own processes on any other political party as the direct primaries amendment, a practice of the APC, sought to achieve,\u201d the PDP had said.\n\nBut reports say that the PDP Governors appear relatively unbothered on the issue, especially since they are in control after the recent national convention in which the entire party structure at the national level is in their firm grip. Furthermore, it appears that the PDP Governors are confident that whether it\u2019s direct or indirect primary, they are fully in charge for the time being.\n\nHowever, pundits say that though direct primaries might not solve the developmental challenges facing the country and its electoral system, it would eliminate the \u2018highest bidder\u2019 syndrome existing in most political parties in Nigeria and go a long way in reducing the emergence of fraudulent and questionable individuals as candidates.\n\nSimilar view was shared by Political Analyst, Kunle Okunade who noted that direct primaries system would give back the parties and candidates to the members of the political parties which would indirectly deepens internal democracy and reduces candidates\u2019 imposition by the few stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWith this candidates with legitimacy would emerge and this will strengthen the country\u2019s electoral process. My fear is whether the party leaders would follow the due process in the practice of direct system because based on observations of how it was practiced in 2019 in Lagos APC, the process was allegedly fraudulent and shambles,\u201d Okuade said.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with BusinessDay, Chekwas Okorie, popular politician and founding member of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) applauded the decision of the federal lawmakers, saying that it would deepen democracy, give the party back to the person which was long overdue.\n\n\u201cI have always supported direct primaries; I have been an advocate of it for years, because it guarantees inclusiveness in selecting a leader from the councillor to the president in political parties. Every party member participates and selects the leader that they want.\n\n\u201cThe practice now is bad; the delegates are often handpicked by the governors, these delegates would go on to carry out the order of the governors.\n\n\u201cBut in indirect primaries somebody who is not popular but can deliver can go on and win. Party members have a right to choose their leaders and they would not disappoint, if they do they don\u2019t vote for such a person again.\n\nThe party\u2019s constitution is clear on the right of party members, which is to vote and be voted for, but with the situation now their rights are being curtailed.\n\nEqually, speaking in similar vein, Kayode Kehinde political analyst, said that direct primaries adopted by federal lawmakers was in recognition of the agitations against the ills of favoritism and god-fatherism within the Nigerian political system, adding that since they represent the people their position should be respected.\n\n\u201cGoing by the most discussed key position on the adoption of the direct primaries election by NASS as a question of whether NASS or any other structure should propose or impose on political parties on what model to adopt in the process of choosing their party representatives for elections, a valid perceptive to this is that NASS is a body that acts as a representation of the people and by necessity, it should discuss issues in the interest of the people.\n\n\u201cWe know the injustice in the current system, hence, if it is considered, the indirect electoral process in party Primaries is not a platform in expressing the peoples\u2019 decision with political representatives, so it should be!\u201d\n\nFurthermore, among the concerns by stakeholders is that direct primaries would place an extra additional logistics burden on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to monitor direct primaries involving the 18 registered parties. Questions have been asked if the commission has the capability to cope with such an enormous task.\n\nThere are those that are concerned that the enormous resources required for such may put extra financial burden on the country.\n\nSuch is the view of Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, who said he would not support the idea of direct primary elections for political parties because it will cause more problems than envisaged, while more money would be needed.\n\nHe said that INEC lacked the required personnel to monitor the conduct of direct primaries by political parties.\n\n\u201cThe electoral law should allow political parties to adopt any of the processes suitable for them in conducting their primaries. The adoption of direct party primaries will only give the governors more power to do whatever they want,\u201d Ortom said.\n\nFestus Okoye, INEC, National Commissioner and Chairman, Information & Voter Education Committee said monitoring direct primaries comes with greater financial and security implications, adding that INEC would require about 17,618 officials to supervise direct primaries involving APC and PDP alone in one day.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf a political party decides to organise its primary at the local government level, it means that the Commission must deploy monitors to the 774 local government areas of the country.\n\n\u201cThe monitoring of direct primaries has financial and national security implications. The ad-hoc staff must be harvested from ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) or the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) or the universities or other sources as may be determined by the commission and supervised by a certain category of our staff.\u201d",

          "text": "Francis Herbert, a father of five, whose two children are in two different Nigerian universities, is a sad man today.\n\nHerbert is in pain today because the children, who were supposed to have either rounded off their programmes or at the tail end of their studies, are caught in the web of endless imbroglio between the Federal Government and the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).\n\nAccording to him, each of the children has lost two academic years.\n\n\u201cI am pained that while my children have lost two academic years, their friends who are in private universities have gone ahead of them. One of my children who got admission in 2019 has just finished year-one, whereas her friends in private universities are now at 300-level. The other one who was supposed to have graduated last year has not even started her project. It is painful that the disagreement between ASUU and the Federal Government is now negatively impacting on my family; holding down the progress of my innocent children,\u201d Herbert said.\n\n\u201cMust everybody go to private university? It is high time ASUU changed strategy. While I am not carpeting them for insisting that government should live up to expectation in funding the university education, at the same time, I want to advise that ASUU must, looking at the negative implications of their incessant strikes, come up with other strategies to engage with the government,\u201d he further said.\n\nWith the rumour of an impending fresh strike, he said that he and his children are now apprehensive and just wishing that it does not materialise.\n\nHerbert is just one out of several other parents who are sad today at what the university system is doing to their children.\n\nRead Also: ASUU strikes halt student housing growth\n\nWhile on a visit to Slot, a popular phone dealer at Computer Village Ikeja in Lagos, to trade-in his two old Tecno phones, a baker was surprised to see his neighbour\u2019s son, who was supposed to be in school.\n\nBut the undergraduate was not shy at meeting him because he is now \u2018hustling\u2019 among hundreds of other undergraduates who are now out of school because of the inability of the parents and sponsors to pay their tuition fees.\n\nThe undergraduate-turned hustler is a product of the nine-month strike by ASUU.\n\nFrom March 2020, which was the peak of Covid-19 and lockdowns and until November 20, 2020, Nigerian university undergraduates were at home idle due to the industrial action, which led to over 2000 students dropping out of school for the inability of their parents and sponsors to pay their tuition fees, as well as getting involved in family businesses or running their own outfits.\n\nSadly, ASUU is about beating the drum again despite the high rate of university dropout in recent time, and Nigeria having the highest rate of out-of-school in Africa with about 10.5 million children aged 5-14 years, according to UNICEF data.\n\nMany concerned citizens are beginning to raise the alarm over the implication of another ASUU strike, especially on the students and the future of the country.\n\nLooking at the sad experience of the nine-month strike last year, most observers decried that the crime rate increased during the strike as many idle hands were engaged negatively and some undergraduates died while committing crime.\n\nDonald Mmecha, a banker with StanbicIBTC, lamented that his children have not recovered from the forced long holiday during the nine-month ASUU strike last year and the only option left for him to guarantee their academic success is to move them to foreign schools, which are very expensive now with the staggering exchange rate.\n\nConsidering thousands of undergraduates whose parents cannot afford tuition fees in foreign universities, Mmecha warned that the country will be sitting on a cake of gun powder if these indigent undergraduates finally drop out of school due to incessant strike and lack of sponsors.\n\n\u201cDuring the strike, my house became a workshop for my engineering undergraduate son and studio for my Theatre Art undergraduate daughter. But my eldest son, a final year law student, was devastated because the online class did not work for his practical courses. We cannot afford another strike; families are suffering, and many are poorer now,\u201d he said.\n\nMargaret Esoh, a mother of two undergraduates and a consultant physician, had to move her two daughters to a United Kingdom university in February this year because she feared another ASUU strike considering the inflation, ensuing hardship and the kind of people running the country now.\n\n\u201cIt was very expensive sending them to a UK university. I sold some shares, but the pain is worth it because they are doing well over there despite being stepped down by a year. My concern is securing their future, which the Nigerian education system cannot guarantee,\u201d the doctor said.\n\nShe decried that the incessant strike is impacting negatively on the rating and quality of graduates from Nigerian universities.\n\nBusola Ekehinde, a business woman, regrets that people in her class cannot afford foreign universities, and their inability is forcing their children to suffer in the supremacy battle between ASUU and the Federal Government.\n\nHer fear is that when university strikes, the students are vulnerable and evil people take advantage of them.\n\n\u201cMama Ineh, our fellow trader, lost one of her sons who joined an oil bunkering gang in Yanegoa. The son was in a university in Port Harcourt and joined the gang instead of returning during last year\u2019s strike,\u201d the trader said, nothing further that she had to force her son to run her business during the strike in order to safeguard him.\n\nThe undergraduates are also angry on hearing news of another strike.\n\nAduke Ogunmade, a University of Lagos undergraduate urged the government to meet the demands of the lecturers as students cannot survive another shutting down of campuses after the nine-month long 2020 strike that impacted negatively on students, education standard and rating of Nigerian universities.\n\nEmeka Ibenegbu, a student of Abia State University Uturu, noted that crime rate would surely soar in the face of current hardship if the strike commences as many students will not continue to stay idle, but engage their hands positively or negatively.\n\n\u201cI know some of my mates who did not return to school because their sponsors are either dead or lost their jobs. What do you want that fellow to do and some who the strike will force to be idle may connect with the bad eggs out there and the society is heated up in crime,\u201d Emeka decried.\n\nIbiso Amaye, a University of Calabar undergraduate, who lost her classmate to human traffickers in Malaysia last year, lamented that the brilliant student was lured with the promise of goodlife and the ASUU strike of last year created an opportunity for him to leave.\n\n\u201cEven the parents thought he was still hanging with his friends in Calabar as he would usually do, not knowing that he died in Malaysia in the hands of traffickers who sold him out. If not for the strike, he would not have travelled,\u201d Amaye said.\n\nHowever, across the country, university lecturers do not see reasons they should not embark on the proposed strike, considering the government\u2019s persistence in failing its promises to them.\n\nAnele Oguezi, an associate professor at Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ebonyi State, said university lecturers\u2019 welfare should not be debated if the country wants to secure its future because the universities are breeding grounds for result-oriented researches, innovations and skills needed in technology, leadership, corporate world, economy, and all endeavours.\n\n\u201cWhy treat lecturers so badly, how much are we asking for that the Federal Government cannot offer? If you consider the salaries and allowances of our senators and governors, you will shut down universities forever. Government should abide by the agreements with ASUU to avert the strike, and that is the only way,\u201d he said.\n\nOnyedi Ifeatu, a senior lecturer at Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka, is concerned about the welfare of students, but noted that if the teacher is not happy, the student will learn nothing.\n\n\u201cI am a parent too, I need money to pay my children\u2019s tuition fees, but it is not coming the way I expect it to and I am not supposed to take advantage of my students. If an average professor in a Nigerian university earns barely N400, 000 a month, then how much do you think others in lower cadre earn. The welfare is poor and should be addressed for us to teach with our mind\u201d, Ifeatu said.\n\nIfeatu assured that the strike is likely going to hold because the Federal Government has always been promising, and reaching agreements with ASUU but not fulfilling the promises.\n\n\u201cYes, there seems to be a truce between ASUU and the federal government, but if the government has been fulfilling its part of the agreements, there will never be a case of strike in Nigeria and our demand is little compared with what politicians earn. Why will the government take politicians more seriously than lecturers whose impacts are felt across the society,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Emmanuel Osodeke, a professor and ASUU president, noted that ASUU will not be deceived again and if the government did not meet the agreement it reached with the union that made it to call off the 2020 strike, the union will commence with the strike as planned.\n\nHe also cleared the air, saying that the union has not shelved the strike because of the government\u2019s usual promise of settling the matter, but that the union will meet after three weeks to make a decision on the next move should the government fail again.\n\nNigerians wait and pray that before three weeks the issue will be resolved as many students may not survive another, considering the many that dropped out already due to hardship.\n\nThe other day, Adamu Adamu, minister of Education, said that Nigerian universities were producing unemployable youths.\n\nAccording to him, the country\u2019s education system, over the years, produced graduates with no generic and essential skills needed for global opportunities and responsibilities.\n\nIt blamed the curricula used in teaching in schools, particularly at tertiary institutions, and students\u2019 poor interest in marketable skills and other requirements of the workplace as largely responsible for the crisis.\n\n\u201cNigeria is still faced with the challenges of skills gaps, especially in the area of technical and vocational fields which need to be addressed adequately. These challenges did not come overnight, but as a result of long time neglect and poor management,\u201d he said.\n\nCritics say that since government is aware of the precarious state of education in the country, it should then be doing everything possible to shore up capacity in the sector by way of adequate funding.\n\nSpeaking on Channels Television interview programme recently, Dele Ashiru, chairman, ASUU, University of Lagos chapter, said the Federal Government cannot in good conscience say it does not have the resources to fund tertiary education in the country, considering the money government spends on mundane things.\n\nHe also carpeted state governors who continue to plant new universities when the existing ones are not being funded.\n\nAshiru said that governors are turning establishment of universities into constituency project.\n\n\u201cThey continue to establish more universities even when they do not fund the existing ones. In some of the institutions, all the buildings there are TetFunds structures, and the universities borrow money to pay salaries,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged government to change its attitude toward education of its citizens, and begin to see it as public good.\n\nDespite the reported decision by ASUU to shelve strike, BusinessDay can report that there is still apprehension that the Federal Government may not be able to meet the conditions. The days ahead will tell.",

Because of this, they opened a branch in Nnewi. After Tayo, the new MD took over. I don\u2019t even know him. I saw him for the first time last year,\u201d Chukuma said.\n\n\u201cThey started fighting about tribe. I am not certain about this but I think the reason he (GTB) is fighting is because of tribe. I don\u2019t know exactly what his problem is.\n\n\u201cBut finally, I have proved him wrong in everything. I have defeated him in all the courts we went to. The only thing left is for him to pay me what he owes me.\n\n\u201cHe was going to my account and taking money anyhow. I discovered it, took him to court and won. Up till now, he hasn\u2019t paid and we have gone up to supreme court. Maybe he hasn\u2019t paid because he wants Nigeria to change their law because of him.\u201d\n\nThe CEO explained that he would no longer \u201cdisturb\u201d the bank to pay the debt.\n\nAccording to him, he would take over the bank when it gets to the point that the bank cannot pay the principal amount plus 22 percent accrued interest.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of the whole thing is that the money is attracting the interest of 22 percent. So, I am waiting for the interest to be above their capacity so I can take over the bank,\u201d Chukuma said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I am waiting for. I am not disturbing them anymore. I am assuring all the customers of GTB that if I take over, I would still run it well. They shouldn\u2019t fear. I haven\u2019t done any business that fails.\n\n\u201cI will run it better than them.

All agencies of government that are in the business of agriculture will now be located here.

          "text": "It is good news for many admission seekers who may be awaiting the release of their senior school certificate examination (SSCE) results as the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) will on Monday announce the release of the long awaited results.\n\nThe Head of Nigeria\u2019s office (HNO) of the regional examination body, Patrick Areghan, who spoke in an exclusive telephone conversation with our reporter on Sunday, said a briefing to announce the release of the results would hold by 12 noon on Monday.\n\nMr Areghan cited various challenges including the stay-at-home-order in the South-east as part of the reasons for the seeming delay in the release of the results.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are all in Nigeria and we know what has been happening. We only finished the examination in October and the sit-at-home-order in the South-east didn\u2019t help matters.\n\n\u201cWe lost a whole week during the marking because every Monday is shut down. As I am talking to you this evening and on a Sunday, I am just leaving the office. But I can assure you that the result will be released tomorrow (Monday). The spokesperson must have reached out.\u201d\n\nAnticipation\n\nMany candidates, especially those who indicated in their Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) that they were awaiting their SSCE result, have anticipated the release of the results in the past few weeks.\n\nThe situation is further aggravated by the decision of some of the institutions to combine admission of candidates for both 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 academic calendar.\n\nFor instance, at the University of Lagos (UNILAG), Akoka, where such combined admission system is adopted, candidates were given a particular time to upload their SSCE results on the portal of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) to be qualified for admission into the institution.\n\nAccording to an insider, the university was not unaware that WAEC was yet to release its results, saying the decision was part of a screening method.\n\n\u201cThe university had chosen more than 70 per cent of the applicants needed among those who sat the UTME in 2020 and so it could only accommodate about 30 per cent of its quota among those that sat the 2021 UTME. So the late release of the result by WAEC was a good opportunity to weed out some applicants,\u201d the source explained.\n\nThe situation is the same across other institutions, as many parents have continued to besiege the WAEC head office in Yaba, Lagos, to inquire on the release of the results of their wards.\n\nMarking of scripts still ongoing\n\nMeanwhile, investigations by PREMIUM TIMES have indicated that results of some subjects for many candidates may not be released along with others when the announcement is made on Monday.\n\nREAD ALSO: WAEC delists 42 schools in Benue over examination malpractices\n\nReliable sources have confirmed to this newspaper that subjects such as Accounting and Agricultural Science were still being cross checked by \u201ccheckers\u201d on Sunday.\n\nBut the examination body could not confirm this development on Sunday night.\n\nHowever, a source, who is familiar with the development, said the delay was in connection with the new electronic marking system introduced by the examination body.\n\n\u201cThe e-marking hasn\u2019t been easy for subjects such as Accounting. This may also be because this is a new system, so markers are yet to get accustomed to it. We still had about 41,000 of scripts for agriculture that had not been checked as of last week. And as of today, we had about 300 scripts for Accounting that were yet to be checked,\u201d another source, who did not want to be quoted, said.",

          "text": "As the trial of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, enters a crucial stage, the umbrella body is seeking to recruit a top legal luminary to replace the current legal team that has been representing the breakaway agitator.\n\nAlthough IPoB has not discarded its current legal team made up of many lawyers, some who are rendering free services based on their belief in the cause that Mazi Kanu is leading, IPoB however wants the legal team to be spearheaded by a \u2018lawyer with high pedigree, generally known and highly respected within the Nigerian judiciary\u2019.\n\nA top source, who is close to the IPoB organization, said on Sunday that the current legal team is perceived to be populated by \u2018activists\u2019 who are best suited to work with a \u2018legal luminary\u2019 of not below the rank of a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, SAN popularly referred to as \u2018Learned Silk\u2019 in Nigerian legal parlance.\n\nThe source, who pleaded anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for the organization, said, \u201cIPoB is looking for a highly placed attorney of a SAN status, who is well versed in the Nigerian legal system and commands respect in the circle.\n\n\u201cThe envisaged SAN, when engaged, is expected to reorganize Mazi Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s legal team, mobilize qualified and like-minded lawyers to work as coordinated legal team to secure victory over his terrorism and treason felony charges slammed on him by the Nigerian Government.\n\n\u201cAs you can see these are very weighty and serious legal issues that require a versatile legal representation and not mere activists who many just be more interested in drawing publicity stunts at the expense of the client and we do not want anything that can affect out cause,\u201d the source said.\n\nVanguard learnt last night that one of the top lawyers being seriously considered by the IPoB leadership to champion the cause of Nnamdi Kanu, is a highly respected lawyer, Onyechi Ikpeazu, who has a PhD in law and has been recording outstanding victories for his clients in most of the cases handled by him.\n\nIt was however learnt that Dr. Ikpeazu was not likely going to accept any offer considering the huge implications it might have on his career as a leading international legal practitioner.\n\nIt was not also clears as at least night if IPoB had even approached Ikpeazu with any offer to represent its leader as the case against Kanu comes up early next year.\n\nAs to explain the rationale for the hiring of a foreign lawyer from the U.S to represent Kanu in Nigeria, the source express reservations over the attempt to bring in a foreign legal practitioner to appear in a Nigerian court, pointing out that it might not work out at the end of the day.\n\n\u201cThe issue of a U.S lawyer appearing for our client in Nigeria may not work 100 percent in our favour but it can at least draw international attention to our case,\u201d the top official said.\n\nIt will be recalled that on October 18, 2021, the Federal Government had filed an amended seven-count charge against the IPoB leader bordering on terrorism and treason felony.\n\nCount one of the charge reads: \u201cThat you, Nnamdi Kanu, male adult of Afaraukwu lbeku Umahia North Local Government Area of Abia State being the leader of IPOB on diverse dates in 2014 and 2015 in London, United Kingdom, did broadcast on Radio Biafra monitored in Enugu and other areas within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, preparations made by you and others now at large for states in the Southeast and South south and other communities in Kogi and Benue states to secede from the Federal Republic of Nigeria with a view to constituting same into the Republic of Biafra and you thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 41(c) of the Criminal Code Act, CAP.

          "text": "The Arewa Youths Consultative Forum, AYCF, has issued a statement warning against the release of Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB.\n\nIf the IPOB leader is released, AYCF\u2019s National President, Yerima Shettima, has warned that additional Kanu\u2019s will emerge, complicating the country\u2019s insecurity situation.\n\nAllowing Kanu to go unpunished, Shettima said reoort, would be detrimental to Nigeria and the Federal Government.\n\nHe was reacting to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s remark that he would consider the IPOB leader\u2019s release.\n\nBuhari had made the remark during a meeting with some Southeast leaders under the aegis of Highly Respected Igbo Greats, led by First Republic parliamentarian and Minister of Aviation, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi at the State House, Abuja.\n\nAmaechi pleaded with the president to release Kanu, rather than opt for military actions.\n\nResponding, Buhari who promised to consider their appeal, however, noted that an unconditional release of Kanu runs contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary.\n\nHowever, Shettima stressed that Kanu\u2019s release would undermine what he has done to Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Shettima: \u201cThere is the possibility of undermining the consequences of what this man (Nnamdi Kanu) did to the country and by implication, if he is allowed to go unpunished, it would be sending the wrong message. Nobody in the history of this country has done more damage to this country since the civil war than this young man.\n\n\u201cIf at the end of the day, they allow him to go unpunished after what he has done, the implication is that nobody will ever commit any offence of this nature and be punished because everybody will always refer to him.\n\n\u201cAnd this means that the constitution is automatically suspended in the country. This means that some people can just commit any crime at the expense of over 200 million Nigerians and get away with it. Somebody can kill, pronounce killing and still get away with it; then what is the essence of condemning people to death for killing, murder when compared to what this man (Kanu) did?\n\n\u201cThis is just a way of undermining the laws of our land, and indirectly they are saying the government of the day can be easily influenced. This means, somebody can commit any offence and then come to Buhari or any other government after this and seek forgiveness.\u201d\n\nThe AYCF National President noted that Kanu is not remorseful of his actions, hence he may boast of being begged.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis man is not even remorseful, indirectly, it\u2019s like the government is begging him to continue with what he\u2019s doing, and he would go unpunished.\n\n\u201cThe consequence is that, if he is allowed to go unpunished, we would end up having millions of Kanu rising, even, if he decides not to go ahead with further actions.\n\n\u201cIf he is allowed to go, he (Kanu) will come out boasting that he did not beg to be released. He is not remorseful and there is nothing to show he regrets his actions, and anybody can do such and get away with it; we are not in Banana Republic for God\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that the law should be allowed to take its full course in Kanu\u2019s matter.\n\n\u201cThe law must take its full course and I hope it\u2019s not what I\u2019m thinking because nobody has done the kind of damage this man has done to this country; and up till date, we have not recovered from the consequences of what he has done to this country, we are watching.\n\n\u201cIf we allow him to go unpunished, then we are saying that the country should produce millions of him. With him alone, look at the damage he has done to his region, but for us in the North, we would ensure he has no sympathizer.\n\n\u201cNobody is saying he should be dealt with without committing any crime, but if he is found wanting; then he should be made to face the consequences of his actions since the matter is in court,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s announcement that he will examine the petition of some Southeast leaders to free Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has elicited mixed reactions.\n\nDuring a meeting with Buhari at the State House in Abuja, Southeast leaders under the auspices of Highly Respected Igbo Greats, led by First Republic politician and Minister of Aviation, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi, appealed for Kanu\u2019s release.\n\nInstead of resorting to military force, Amaechi called with the president to pursue political solutions in Kanu\u2019s issue.\n\nBuhari, who pledged to review their petition, responded by stating that Kanu\u2019s unconditional release would be in violation of the idea of separation of powers between the Executive and the Judiciary.\n\nThe president also emphasized his non-interference approach with the judiciary.\n\nHowever, a constitutional lawyer, Maduabuchi Idam, contested the president\u2019s claim that ordering Kanu\u2019s release would constitute meddling with the judiciary.\n\nContrary to the president\u2019s assertion, Idam noted that the Nigerian constitution allows Buhari to order Attorney General of the Federation Abubakar Malami to drop the prosecution against Kanu.\n\nThe Abuja-based lawyer told DAILY POST that the president might order Malami to withdraw any cases against anyone, including the IPOB leader, in the national good.\n\nAccording to Idam: \u201cKindly note that if an offence is alleged to have been committed, it is the state that prosecutes the alleged offender. In this context, the state is the Presidency and that is why it is the office of the Attorney General of the Federation that prosecutes Mr. Nnamdi Kanu and those of his members on behalf of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, by virtue of Section 174 (1),(c) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as Amended, the AGF has the constitutional power to amongst others, enter a \u201cnulle prosecui\u201d ( power to discontinue a case) in favour of any person being prosecuted for any offence on behalf of the Federal Government. Similarly, the power is also available to the AG of the State with respect to State offences. See Section 211 of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cIn the light of the above, the President of Nigeria, in the interest of the public, can direct the AGF to withdraw any case that is instituted against any one on behalf of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cBy the operation of the said provision of the constitution, the AGF has the vires to personally or through an officer in his office, walk into the court where Mr. Kanu is undergoing prosecution and apply to withdraw the charges against him and his members, and the court has no power under the constitution or any law, to refuse the Application or demand the AGF to give an explanation for that.\n\n\u201cIf the President feels that a matter should be withdrawn from the court for public interest, all he needs to do is to direct the AGF to do the needful.\n\n\u201cI must say that I commend the courage of Mr. President for the first time, at least for saying that he will consider the request to release the IPOB Leader, Mr. Nnamdi Kanu and his members.\u201d\n\nIdam\u2019s remark was, however, countered by a Northern socio-political activist, Yaro Abdullahi, who warned on the dangers of releasing Kanu.\n\nAbdullahi warned that Kanu\u2019s release may serve as a spring board for other people to commit serious crimes and get away with it.\n\nHe pointed out that nobody in the history of Nigeria has committed Kanu\u2019s kind of crime; hence releasing him would be sending the wrong message.\n\n\u201cHow do you start considering the release of a criminal like Kanu, who ordered killing of people. Because of his criminal style of agitation, the Southeast is no longer peaceful, releasing him would be sending the wrong signal that people can just do anything and get away with it.\n\n\u201cThis is my view. The president should allow the judiciary to do their work and not listen to all those appeals. If the courts find him guilty, he should face the music and if it\u2019s the other way round, he should be released.\n\n\u201cThe president, while considering should also note the damage Kanu is capable of doing if set free,\u201d he told DAILY POST.",

At CDD, we reiterate that justice delay is justice denied, hence the necessity to expedite action on the report. The victims have waited a whole year. It is time to heal wounds and provide closure for the victims,\u201d the group said.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, the governor is being enjoined to be courageous and pitch his tent on the side of justice and for the people, in this case, irrespective of whether he was also challenged in the report or not. At this point in time, his integrity is highly needed. His government must implement the full report in order to balance the trust deficit that currently exists between the government and the public.\u201d\n\nThe CDD noted that it is satisfied with the process, outcome, and recommendations of the panel, saying the report \u201creflects high-level impartiality and genuine attempt to deliver justice and closure for the victims of police brutality and SARS in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe leaked 309-page report, which has been trending in the news, indicted the Police, the Army, Lekki Concession Company, and Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, indicating that there was \u201ccontextual massacre\u201d at Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020, contrary to official denials, stating that at least there was killing, injuring, and or assaulting of 48 protesters by soldiers and police in the incident,\u201d the statement read.\n\nAccording to the group, opposition claims need incontrovertible proof before they can be taken seriously.\n\nIt equally warned the government not to \u201cmiss this important opportunity to rebuild trust and provide closure for the victims of police brutality and SARS in the country.\u201d\n\nLast Monday, the judicial panel submitted its report to the Lagos State Government with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu setting up a four-member committee led by Lagos State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN) to raise a White Paper on the reports submitted by the panel.",

While the past few weeks have been disappointing, they should not obscure all the work he has done over the past three years to rebuild the foundations for long-term success.\n\n\u201cOle leaves with our sincerest thanks for his tireless efforts as manager and our very best wishes for the future. His place in the club\u2019s history will always be secure, not just for his story as a player, but as a great man and a manager who gave us many great moments. He will forever be welcome back at Old Trafford as part of the Manchester United family.\u201d\n\nSolskjaer was booed by a number of the United fans in the away end at full time at Watford, although midfielder Bruno Fernandes appeared to try to redirect their frustration towards the players.\n\nGoalkeeper David de Gea labelled the defeat \u201cembarrassing\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d.\n\nAfter the game, Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher described Solskjaer\u2019s position as \u201cuntenable\u201d but described the performance of the club\u2019s players as \u201cscandalous\u201d.\n\nOle\u2019s journey \u2018at the wheel\u2019 ends without a trophy\n\nFormer United striker Solskjaer returned to the club initially as caretaker manager after the dismissal of Jose Mourinho in December 2018 and immediately produced an upturn in United\u2019s form \u2013 including the 3-1 win at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League.\n\n\u2018Ole\u2019s at the wheel\u2019 became a trending topic as Solskjaer was appointed on a permanent basis in March 2019.\n\nHe was unable to lead United into the top four of the Premier League that season but did achieve third and second-place finishes in his two full seasons in charge.\n\nHowever, Solskjaer failed to deliver silverware during his tenure, with the defeat on penalties to Villarreal in last season\u2019s Europa League final being their best effort.\n\nHow did Solskjaer compare?\n\nThe Norwegian departs Manchester United with an inferior win percentage to that of Jose Mourinho, the man he replaced. Here, we take a look at the numbers\u2026\n\nSaturday\u2019s defeat to Watford was Solskjaer\u2019s 168th game in charge of the club. In total, he won 91 of them, drawing 37 and losing 40.\n\nOf Manchester United\u2019s four permanent managers since Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s departure from the club, including David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho as well as Solskjaer, the Norwegian\u2019s overall win rate of 54 per cent puts him second.\n\nMourinho\u2019s win rate is the highest of the four at 58 per cent, while Moyes and Van Gaal trail on 53 per cent and 52 per cent respectively.\n\nOverall, Solskjaer\u2019s record against the traditional big-six \u2013 Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham \u2013 was mixed, with 14 wins, 10 draws and 12 losses.\n\nIndeed, a big-six mini-league of head-to-head meetings since Solskjaer\u2019s appointment puts Manchester United 18 points behind City and 23 behind Liverpool.\n\nThat, of course, is despite heavy investment in the squad. This summer, Manchester United brought in Cristiano Ronaldo, Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane at considerable expense.\n\nTheir latest round of spending pushed their net spend under Solskjaer to \u00a3312m \u2013 \u00a333m more than any other Premier League side and \u00a3196m more than City and Liverpool\u2019s combined.\n\nManchester United will now pin their hopes on a new manager to restore their former glories.",

          "title": "US: Rittenhouse \u2018Not Guilty\u2019 Verdict Puts Biden in Difficult Political Spot",
          "text": "A difficult political atmosphere for President Joe Biden may have become even more treacherous with the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse.\n\nBiden was already facing sliding poll numbers with an electorate worn down by the coronavirus pandemic and increasing inflation. Now, the president finds himself caught between outraged Democrats \u2014 some of whom were already stewing over Biden\u2019s inability to land police reform and voting rights legislation \u2014 and Republicans looking to use the Rittenhouse case to exploit the national divide over matters of grievance and race.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the last things Biden wants to be engaging in at this moment as he tries to finish up the big Build Back Better bill and get that across the finish line through the Senate,\u201d said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. \u201cRace and Kyle Rittenhouse is not the space where he wants or needs to be going deep right now.\u201d\n\nThe acquittal of Rittenhouse has touched off new conversations about racial justice, vigilantism and policing in America. The Illinois teen armed himself with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle during an August 2020 protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, days after the shooting of a Black man by a white police officer. He said he came to small city to help protect a car lot from vandals and provide medical aid.\n\nRittenhouse would end up fatally shooting two men and maiming a third. Rittenhouse and his lawyers successfully argued that he had acted in self-defense during a confrontation in which he feared for his life.\n\nThe verdict in the case comes at a moment when Biden is trying to keep fellow Democrats focused on passing his massive social services and climate bill and hoping to turn the tide with Americans who have soured on his performance as president.\n\nThe president responded carefully following Friday\u2019s verdict, expressing respect for the jury\u2019s decision. He later added in a written statement that, like many Americans, he was \u201cangry and concerned\u201d with the jury acquittal of Rittenhouse.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans, who had success in this month\u2019s Virginia election in part by accusing Democrats of promoting critical race theory in public schools, are embracing 18-year-old Rittenhouse as their newest hero in America\u2019s culture wars.\n\nGOP Reps. Paul Gosar of Arizona and Matt Gaetz of Florida have said they\u2019d like to hire him as an intern, with Gosar suggesting they arm wrestle for the honor. Another Republican, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, on Saturday predicted that liberal outrage over the Rittenhouse trial would benefit her party.\n\n\u201cIt seems liberals want self-defense to be illegal,\u201d Boebert tweeted. \u201cTry running on that in 2022 and see how far it gets you with the majority of the sane American public.\u201d\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was quick to stand with Rittenhouse following the verdict. He called the teen \u201cbrave\u201d for testifying in his own defense and accused the left of trying \u201cto fan hatred\u201d with its treatment of Rittenhouse.\n\nTrump has spent much of his post-presidency stoking divisions with his frontal criticism of Biden and of any Republican who has not marched in lockstep with his views. And most Republicans, either through silence or direct endorsement, have followed his lead.\n\nIn the aftermath of the acquittal, Republicans have highlighted a tweet by Biden during his winning 2020 presidential campaign in which he appeared to suggest that Rittenhouse was a white supremacist.\n\nThe tweet, from September 2020, excoriated Trump for failing \u201cto disavow white supremacists on the debate stage\u201d the previous night and included a video that contained a still image of Rittenhouse from the night of the Kenosha shooting and footage of torch-bearing white supremacists at the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel are among party officials who have called on Biden to apologize.\n\n\u201cHe smeared a teenager to score political points and spread lies about this case,\u201d McDaniel wrote on Twitter. \u201cWhat Biden did was dangerous and inflammatory.\u201d\n\nAsked by a reporter soon after the verdict if he stood by his campaign social media posting, Biden responded that \u201cI stand by what the jury has concluded.\u201d\n\nBorick, the Muhlenberg College pollster, said the results of this month\u2019s elections in Virginia show that driving at cultural issues \u2014 including race and transgender rights \u2014 could be a good strategy for Republicans trying to energize a segment of the electorate that was passionate about Trump but less enthusiastic about the rest of the GOP. But Borick warned that the GOP\u2019s fulsome embrace of Rittenhouse wasn\u2019t without risk.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a great place to be if you\u2019re trying, come the midterms, to reach suburban voters and educated voters who might not fault the decision to acquit Rittenhouse because of the circumstances but are far from comfortable holding him up as a hero,\u201d Borick said.\n\nEven before the verdict, Biden had been facing increased pressure from some Democrats over the lack of progress on passing voting rights and police reform legislation.\n\nLast month, a day after Senate Republicans filibustered a major voting bill for the second time this year, Biden acknowledged that the process of governing could be \u201cfrustrating and sometimes dispiriting\u201d but urged supporters to \u201ckeep the faith.\u201d\n\nAt the same, civil rights leaders have expressed frustration that Biden has not used the power of the bully pulpit more to push for a broad police reform bill named after George Floyd, the Black Minneapolis man whose killing last year by police touched off protests around the U.S.\n\nSpeaking at an event earlier this week where he signed into law a trio of bills to increase aid to police, Biden only made passing mention of the George Floyd act, asking legislators from both parties to work together to make it law.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s next,\u201d Biden said.",

          "title": "In Double Standard, US Threatens Nigeria with Arms Embargo but Silent on Israel",
          "text": "In what seems to be a clear case of double standard, the United States has threatened that Nigeria risks arms embargo for alleged violations of the laws on armed conflicts in the fight against banditry, terrorism, and other forms of violence in different parts of the federation.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with CNN International released on Saturday by the US Department of State, the US Secretary of State, Antony J. Blinken, threatened that his country would apply the Leahy Laws against Nigeria if the allegations of rights violations were found to be credible.\n\nThe threat came just as the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) faulted the removal of Nigeria from the US 2021 list of religious violators, insisting that Christians are still being persecuted by terrorist groups and other Islamic associations in the country.\n\nAccording to reports, the United States was said to have vetoed over 50 United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions critical of Israel since 1972.\n\nDuring the last escalation of violence between Israel and the Palestinians, the US had reportedly stuck to that playbook, blocking a joint statement calling for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.\n\nSeveral resolutions condemning violence against Palestine protesters, and the illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, were also reportedly thwarted by the US.\n\nThe UN resolutions had also stated that East Jerusalem should not be considered Israeli territory, but the US recognised Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital in December 2017.\n\nIn contrast to Washington\u2019s blanket support for Israel, concerns have heightened that the US wants to tie Nigeria\u2019s hand behind her back in the face of attacks by terrorists, and bandits by threatening arms embargo against the country in the fight against insurgent groups.\n\nBut Blinken, in a surprise move, said his country would apply the Leahy Laws against Nigeria.\n\nThe Leahy Laws prohibit the US Department of State and Department of Defence from providing military assistance to foreign security force units that violate human rights with impunity.\n\nBlinken said: \u201cOf course, we also have laws in place \u2013 the Leahy laws, for example. That makes sure that if there are units that have committed abuses; we are not going to provide equipment to those units.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the US would invoke the Leahy Laws against Nigeria, the secretary of state promised: \u201cWell, we look in any instance if there are credible allegations that prove out or that we believe meet the standard of the law, of course, we will apply the law.\n\n\u201cIf there is genuine transparency, accountability, and change that follows from these incidents and these abuses, I think that is very important, not only to our administration. It is also important to the US Congress in making judgments about continuing to assist the security forces,\u201d Blinken explained.\n\nThe secretary of state, however, explained the nature of military assistance the US had been giving Nigeria, noting that it was not all about the sale of military hardware alone, but also about the software.\n\nAccording to Blinken, \u201cthe military assistance itself is not just the hardware that we might provide \u2013 airplanes or helicopters. It is also the software as well as the human software\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cBecause one of the things that we are doing is making sure that as we are providing equipment to deal with profound security challenges that are faced here in Nigeria \u2013 terrorism, criminal activity, other violence, those who will be using the equipment are trained.\n\n\u201cSecurity forces must be trained in a way that makes sure that they are doing it to avoid hurting the good guys, even as they are going after the bad guys, to make sure that the laws of armed conflict are fully in mind. If they make mistakes, they are corrected and they are brought to light immediately,\u201d Blinken explained.\n\nReacting to the report on the Lekki Tollgate incident, Blinken admitted that the report of the Lekki Incident had brought transparency to what happened on the night of October 20, 2020.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think the first of all, the fact of the report, of the panel\u2019s work is usually important because it is bringing vital transparency to what happened, to the violence that took place around the #EndSARS protests and the allegations of abuses by the security forces.\n\n\u201cI have not seen the published report yet. I think it will hopefully be coming out very, very soon. But a couple of things are really important,\u201d Blinken added.\n\nHe explained that the report was important to make sure that such an incident would not happen again.\n\nHe argued that reforms \u201care necessary to build and rebuild trust between the citizens and the security services, between citizens and the state. That is an obligation of both the state government and the federal government.\u201d\n\nBlinken insisted that officers of the Nigerian Army and the Nigeria Police, who played one role or the other in the Lekki Incident should be made to account for their roles.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf there are individuals that \u2013 as it emerges from this report \u2013 who are responsible for committing abuses, there has to be accountability in terms of those individuals. That too is vital to rebuilding trust between citizens and the state and the security services.\u201d\n\nThe panel\u2019s report had recommended that all officers deployed to the tollgate should face appropriate disciplinary action. Except for Commander, 81 Division Garrison, Brig. Gen. Francis Omata, the panel demanded that all military officers involved in the operations should be stripped of their status and dismissed on the ground that they \u201care not fit and proper to serve in any public or security service of the nation.\u201d\n\nThe panel equally recommended that the Divisional Police Officer, Maroko Police Division, Mr. Raji Ganiyu, and all police officers deployed for operation between October 20 and 21, 2020 should be prosecuted for arbitrary and indiscriminate shooting and killing of the #EndSARS protesters.\n\nOn the Ethiopia-Tigray conflict, Blinken disclosed that the US \u201cis acting in close coordination with former President Olusegun Obasanjo, supporting his efforts, and other leaders on the continent including Kenyan President Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta to end the conflict.\u201d\n\nHe emphasised the African-led solutions to end the Ethiopia-Tigray conflict, noting that the African Union with Obasanjo \u201cis doing exactly that. It is a very important approach and it is something that we will support.\u201d\n\nIn another development, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) on Saturday faulted the removal of Nigeria from the US 2021 list of religious violators, insisting that Christians are still being persecuted by terrorist groups and other Islamic associations in the country.\n\nThe apex Christian organisation said that it was at a loss on the data or statistics used by the US government in arriving at delisting Nigeria from the list of \u2018Countries of Particular Concern\u2019 on the issue of freedom of religion.\n\nUS Secretary of State, Blinken, had in a statement on Wednesday, blacklisted Russia, China, and eight other countries as religious violators, leaving out Nigeria which was placed on the same list in 2020.\n\nSpeaking in Nigeria during a two-day official visit that ended on Friday, Blinken had disclosed that the delisting of Nigeria was based on facts.\n\nBut CAN in a statement Saturday condemned the decision, saying that Christians were still being ferociously attacked and that nothing has changed between 2020 and 2021 to warrant the removal of Nigeria from the list of religious violators.\n\nThe statement signed by CAN President, Rev Samson Ayokunle, read in part: \u201cThe US government did not contact us when they were listing Nigeria among the countries of \u2018Particular Concern\u2019 on religious freedom, neither did they seek our opinion before removing Nigeria from the list. If they had done, we would have been able to compare the statistics then and now on the issue of freedom of religion in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhatever may be the data they used, our prayer is that Nigeria would be a country where no religious group is discriminated against or persecuted and that our government would see to it that all religiously biased policies are discontinued.\n\n\u201cChristians had faced and are still facing persecution from ISWAP and the Boko Haram Islamic Group till today as before. These are the people who said their agenda was to wipe away Christianity from Nigeria and to plant Islam as the only religion from the North down to the Atlantic Ocean in the South. That agenda with the killing of Christians has not stopped till today and Nigerians are living witnesses.\n\n\u201cThe bandits have joined other militant Islamic groups to be ferociously attacking churches, killing worshippers, and kidnapping for ransom. The herdsmen are equally doing their havoc. We have lost many people and places of worship to their assault, especially in the North-central part of the country and the northeast.\n\n\u201cThough the madness has grown now and those who are not Christians are being attacked, killed, and kidnapped, this is because these criminal acts have become a lucrative business and it is whoever you can kidnap for money! If the government had responded appropriately when this criminal madness began and subdued these evil groups immediately, we wouldn\u2019t be where we are now!\u201d\n\nThe Christian association also said discrimination against Christians, especially in Northern Nigeria has not stopped.\n\n\u201cUp till today, our government is still funding the membership of Nigeria in all the International Islamic organisations like OIC and its allies without being part of any international Christian organisation.\u201d\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi in Lagos, Kingsley Nwezeh and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",
          "summary": "But Blinken, in a surprise move, said his country would apply the Leahy Laws against Nigeria.\nIt is also important to the US Congress in making judgments about continuing to assist the security forces,\u201d Blinken explained.\nBut a couple of things are really important,\u201d Blinken added.\nHe explained that the report was important to make sure that such an incident would not happen again.\nSpeaking in Nigeria during a two-day official visit that ended on Friday, Blinken had disclosed that the delisting of Nigeria was based on facts.",
