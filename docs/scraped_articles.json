          "text": "The Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, on Wednesday, met with no fewer than 162 Peoples Democratic Party aspirants for the state House of Assembly alongside party leaders and other Edo PDP officials, at the Government House, Benin City.\n\nObaseki, who sued for unity and harmony among party members and leaders, expressed confidence that the party will come out victorious in the forthcoming general elections.\n\nHe noted, \u201cWe have 24 seats in the EDHA and 162 people are contesting; it\u2019s not everyone that will get the position. We should be united and not be our own opponents. The way we go about this primary election is very important.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time since 1999 that a fundamental amendment has been made to the Electoral Act. After the primary election, we have nine months to prepare and campaign and the journey will not be easy or cheap. We should conserve our energy for this process. We should work in unity to win the forthcoming EDHA election in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe have a primary election coming up and I am not asking anybody to step down but to sit with party leaders and see how to discuss and dialogue to reduce the number of aspirants to enable us to work better. If everyone decides to go into the primary, so be it as we all belong to one big family.\u201d\n\nObaseki added, \u201cPDP will select candidates to go and contest for the position against candidates from other parties. For contestation at this level, we can\u2019t be our own opponents. In any particular constituency, only one or two people will win, depending on the number of seats. We all will rally around to support those that emerge and together we will win the election.\u201d\n\nWarning against politics of bitterness, the governor stated, \u201cI want to warn all the aspirants, I don\u2019t want any of you to spend your future or sell your properties because of the election. There is a lot of bitterness in politics; we need to stop this as it can\u2019t lead us to the political evolution that we desire. Edo is a pacesetter.\n\n\u201cI want to stay neutral in the build-up to this primary despite the several calls I have received. Every aspirant is my own; the PDP is one and my goal is that the PDP must win at the state level, National Assembly, and Presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the first step towards winning. I want us to be strong and not go into the contest weak,\u201d Obaseki urged.\n\nOn his part, Edo PDP Chairman, Tony Aziegbemi disclosed that 164 aspirants bought the EDHA forms, while 162 persons returned their forms and were screened and cleared to contest the primary election.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

I have no other reason or objective except to serve.\n\n\u201cAfter one has been in office as Vice President for 7 years, I know that God did not give me that opportunity so that I would sit down somewhere and write the history of my service as Vice President.\n\n\u201cIt is for the purpose of serving the people, and that is why I am so determined that if God gives me the opportunity to serve, the Nigerian people would realise indeed they have done the right thing by putting me in office because I would serve the country with everything, with all my heart and commitment.\u201d\n\nAddressing the delegates in both States, the vice president acknowledged all the support that has been offered towards his presidential bid, while again emphasising that his sole purpose for seeking the highest office of the land, was purely to serve Nigeria and give his heart to the country.\n\nEmphasising the importance of service to the people, Prof. Osinbajo stated that \u201cone of the very important things I want to share with delegates anywhere I go is that the role of the politician is an important one.\n\n\u201cGod has given us an opportunity to serve, and that opportunity is one that we must treasure and thank God for. Out of so many people in the country, those of you who are here are those who have been chosen in one way or the other, appointed or elected.\n\n\u201cThat position is not for our personal aggrandizement, it is to contribute to our society and make life better for our people. It is an opportunity to truly serve the people.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo was received at the Palace by the Lamido of Adamawa, Muhammadu Mustapha, who recalled the VP\u2019s chieftaincy title as the Jagaba of Adamawa. The monarch then prayed for the realization of the VP\u2019s presidential aspiration.\n\n\u201cI hope your coming will add more light to Adamawa because you are the Jagaba of Adamawa. I hope you succeed in your efforts to become the President of this country. As long as you\u2019re coming to Adamawa, and with your visit to my palace, this will encourage people to see that you are really the Jagaba of Adamawa,\u201d the Lamido said.\n\nAlso at the palace, Governor Ahmadu Fintiri welcomed the Vice President to the State, saying \u201cwe pray that God will answer your heart\u2019s desires. I also hope that the APC delegates will see the reason to put a square peg in a square hole. I welcome you to Adamawa and I wish you the best of luck.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We ruled for 16 years without witnessing this kind of ugly trend bedevilling our country.\u201d\n\nAlso Read:\n\nJTF kills 10 bandits, rescues 14 kidnapped victims in Niger\n\n\u201cWe cannot fold our hands and watch our innocent citizens being killed and kidnapped every day without doing the needful, enough is enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of us are witness to what is happening in this country, and that is why we are now presenting ourselves so that we can rescue the situation from the arrogant, insolence, inefficient display by the ruling party.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, were you not in Kaduna during the tenure of Senator Makarfi as governor of Kaduna state? There was no religious violence, there was no insecurity.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at what we are doing in Bauchi. We are monitoring and carrying out evaluation on security matters to make sure that lives and property are secured.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are frequently engaging with the communities as well as our respected traditional institutions and stakeholders.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the above are completely absent in this APC led government.

          "text": ".. Launches impact report\n\nBy Chioma Obinna\n\nA leading pan-African healthcare technology company, mPharma has said that the various innovative strategies was deployed to address issues of affordability and access to prescription drugs caused by excessive margins charged by stakeholders along the drug supply chain.\n\nIt also reaffirmed its commitment to providing access to affordable healthcare solutions in Africa.\n\nSpeaking during a virtual launch of its impact report attended by the former Minister of Health, Ghana, Mr. Alex Segbefia, representing the former President of Ghana, H.E. John Dramani, and Head of Value Creation, Gabon Sovereign Wealth Fund, Serge Amissah, the CEO and Co-Founder of mPharma, Mr. Gregory Rockson noted that the contribution of mPharma to addressing the challenge of healthcare could not be over-emphasised, given its role during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe stated that the company, since its inception, has deployed a lot of innovative strategies to improve access, not only to medications but to essential healthcare services such as molecular diagnostics testing.\n\nRockson disclosed that the company\u2019s intervention was geared towards addressing the issues of affordability and access to prescription drugs caused by excessive margins charged by the various stakeholders along the drug supply chain.\n\n\u201cWe needed a solution to remedy the challenge of availability, accessibility, and affordability of drugs to provide value to patients. To address availability and accessibility, we began with a pilot in Ghana, our QualityRx program, which provides an innovative and affordable financing solution for struggling mom-and-pop pharmacies with a history of high performance.\n\n\u201cThe programme offers funding for refurbishment, inventory, customer management, and technology costs. By \u201creviving\u201d these pharmacies, we did not only expand our pharmacy network but, most importantly, increased access to affordable drugs. Pharmacies under the QualityRx model operate under the brand \u201ca mutti pharmacy.\u201d With QualityRx, we came to a step closer to our goal of making medicines more affordable to patients as we directly control prices for all mutti pharmacies\u201d, he said.\n\nPledging to build good health in Africa, he stated that it had recently secured $35 million in funding as the first tranche of a significant financing round for business operations.\n\nAccording to him, the funding would drive the expansion of our network of facilities and further improve our tech infrastructure.\n\nHe explained further that the company had become an essential factor in providing solutions to the numerous problems caused by the pandemic. The company has leveraged its partnership with esteemed partners such as Breyer Capital in rolling our free COVID-19 test and millions of COVID-19 test kits across government institutions, private labs, and organisations in eight African countries.\n\n\u201cWe recognised that the private health sector is a significant partner in healthcare delivery, and we anticipated African governments facing challenges in rolling out free COVID-19 tests. We proactively leveraged our relationship with mPharma investor Breyer Capital to establish a partnership with Sansure Biotech to secure one million COVID-19 test kits and 150 Polymerase\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks, former President Ghana, H.E. John Dramani, congratulated mPharma on promoting good health for all Africans while declaring the launch of the impact report.\n\nHe urged the company to keep pushing for technology-based, patients-centered, community-focused approaches that can meet the needs of patients irrespective of their location or financial status.\n\nAlso speaking, Head of Value Creation, Gabon Sovereign Wealth Fund, Serge Amissah pledged their support to rebuilding of the health sector in Gabon, adding that health is one essential resource for future generations, and that is why the Fund partnered with mPharma to work out models to rebuild the central medical store of Gabon.",

These are issues we discussed.\n\n\u201cWe referred to Easter and end of Ramadan, whereby religious festivities merged by providence, Christians and Muslims were kept in mood of religious reflection about ways to live better lives,\u201d Onaiyekan said.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Betty Edu, National Women Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), said that they they attended the meeting to advocate rights of Nigerian women participation in politics.\n\nShe said APC would mainstream women, in spite of high charges for purchase of election form for candidates, saying women in APC and the disabled would receive their forms free of charge.\n\n\u201cBeyond this, we are working to see that we ensure women scale through the primaries into the main election and come out as elected winners at different levels.\n\n\u201cToday the message was clear that for Nigeria to achieve SDGs, it is important for political parties to support the country achieve SDG and its policies.\n\n\u201cThey must ensure women are mainstreamed and prioritised as we go into the 2023 elections.\u201d",

          "text": "The declaration of intention to run for presidency in 2023 has taken its toll on Nigerians, especially students who have stayed home for three months due to the ongoing Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, strike.\n\nThe Non-Academic Staff Union of Universities, NASU, and the National Association of Academic Technologists, NAAT, embarked on strike in February over the failure of the Federal Government to address their concerns.\n\nDespite lingering strike action, ministers under this administration have declared intentions to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari without proffering any solution to the lingering strike action.\n\nThe numbers of presidential aspirants have continued to increase daily while ASUU and the government fail to reach truce.\n\nUnder the APC alone, presidential aspirants include: Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; Tinubu; Rotimi Amaechi, Minister of Transportation; Dave Umahi, Ebonyi State Governor; Rochas Okorocha, Imo West Senator; Yahaya Bello, Governor of Kogi State; Emeka Nwajiuba, Minister of State for Education.\n\nOthers are Adams Oshiomhole, former Governor of Edo State; Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti State Governor; Godswill Akpabio, Minister of Niger Delta, and Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment.\n\nThis, however, did not go down well with Nigerians who took to their social media pages describing the presidential aspirants as selfish, with all focus on election and having no regard for education in the country.\n\nHere are some reactions gathered by DAILY POST from Twitter;\n\n@Arekunmi \u201c None of these aspirants has even used \u201cending the ASUU strike card\u201d in their declaration campaigns. That\u2019s how low the regard for education is for these guys.We are not even asking you to end the strike..at least have some decency by using it to campaign.Like, at least lie.\u201d\n\n@AdaramolaRichard \u201cTo be frank, it is selfishness and even stupidity, running for presidency while students are on strike. Message to all presidential candidates.\u201d\n\n@Trinityboii \u201cStudents still dey house and strike not called off and all these men in power are all going for presidency. What is your plan, misplaced priority. Is it that these men in power are cursed.God help us oh.\u201d\n\n@NwanneObi \u201cIt is obvious that this government does not care about our students as already demonstrated. From Labor to Education all interested in presidency despite the many months of strike. Mobilize your members and students to chase them away.\u201d\n\n@NwanjiInnocent \u201cIt\u2019s sad at this point that the Ministers for Education and Labour have left ASUU and Nigerian students to jostle for the 2023 presidency. When this is all over, they will find a way to defend this mediocrity.\u201d\n\n@Aniefiokdebest \u201cThe multiple declaration for the 2023 presidency by politicians has turned the exercise to a child play. For goodness sake, how can individuals who cannot solve common ASUU strike, pay workers salary, implement the N30,00 minimum wage be declaring for president? Jokers.\u201d\n\n@Teju \u201cIt\u2019s so unfortunate that we have an irresponsible government in this country. A government that\u2019s more focused on 2023 election than the education and success of its students. A government that is willing to kill the education sector, and trying to make us illiterate.\u201d\n\n@99_AMC \u201cNo money to pay ASUU but there\u2019s 100m for the presidential form. Has any of them even addressed this strike while doing their declaration of interest in the presidency thingy?\n\n@IamDouggy \u201cAs a student, I endured strikes twice before I graduated. Education in Nigeria is just like electricity, if not worse, it\u2019s never stable. It pains me that the people are the ones suffering yet they can\u2019t do anything about it. The 2023 election is now the government\u2019s focus, even the Minister of Education.\u201d\n\n@Adibenco4 \u201cASUU has been on strike for months, yet all the government cares for is the 2023 election. We are not fools.\u201d",

It is also a big boost to Nigeria in its quest to take advantage of the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA),\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, he described the deep seaport as a major advantage Nigeria has to leverage its transshipment. \u201cWith this port, Nigeria will become a transshipment hub and the revenue we are currently losing to our neighboring countries will come here. That\u2019s big!\n\nAs you know, this project is being done in phases. Phase 1 has reached 89 percent and will be completed in Sept this year.\n\n\u201cThe facilities here are first class. We have seven ship to shore cranes and 21 RTG cranes. No port in Nigeria currency has this. The excellent equipment is why this port can do 18,000 Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit (TEU), which is more than four times the number that can currently be handled by our other ports.",

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are very active in support of the humanitarian effort of the Nigerian government and that is why we have called for an additional $351 million as part of the overall $1.1 billion for the humanitarian response plan for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe UN scribe, who was on a working visit to Maiduguri, Borno State, the worst hit by the insurgency, said from what he saw, great hope lies ahead.\n\n\u201cDespite all that they have seen and endured, the people I saw remain hopeful and committed to returning to their communities and resuming their lives. To that ends, I welcome the establishment of the Presidential Committee on the Repatriation, Return and Resettlement of displaced persons in the North-East.\u201d\n\nOn his meeting with President Buhari, Guterres said they discussed how to address the challenges confronting Nigeria and the smooth conduct of next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe spirit of hope amidst hardship and solidarity in struggle was also in the centre of my discussions with the Nigerian president today. We discussed the importance of laying the ground work to ensure peaceful and democratic elections next year and the full participation of Nigerian women and young people in all areas.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cWe also discussed the government\u2019s measures to address security challenges across the country. I want to extend my deepest condolences to the victims of the appalling attacks in Plateau State two and half weeks ago. It is a tragic reminder of terrorism scourge across West Africa and the Sahel.\u201d\n\nGuterres emphasised the commitment of the UN to combat terrorism, violent extremism, organised crime, poverty, food insecurity.\n\nHe also commended Nigeria for her role in sustaining peace in Africa and beyond as well as playing the leading role in sustaining democracy on the African continent.\n\nPresident Buhari has said Nigeria remains grateful to the UN and some world leaders for their steadfast partnership in fighting terrorism, saying the spotlight on Russia and Ukraine could easily distract from other pertinent global challenges.\n\nAccording to a statement by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Buhari noted that the country and the African continent were already concerned that the attention on Russia and Ukraine would crowd out other issues, but the ongoing visit of the UN scribe clearly showed that \u201cthe world has not forgotten us.\u201d\n\nHe said terrorism remains a threat to global peace, security and progress, with many already killed, while millions had been displaced by the insurgents over many years.\n\n\u201cWhen we assumed office, the North East was the major security problem we inherited in 2015, but we have been able to make people understand that you cannot kill people and shout \u2018Allahu Akbar,\u2019 (God is great!).\n\n\u201cIt is either you don\u2019t know what you are saying or you are simply stupid. God is a God of justice, so you cannot kill people and say God is great. Luckily, the people understood our message and it has made great impact,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president informed the UN scribe that the government had started a gradual, but steady process of resettlement and reintegration where citizens get encouraged to return to their farms, businesses and other pursuits in life.\n\nHe thanked the secretary general for the maiden visit to Nigeria.\n\nAct decisively before war breaks out, Akintoye urges UN scribe\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nMeanwhile, UN Secretary General, has been urged to act decisively to rescue Nigeria from sliding into war.\n\n\u201cBefore war breaks out in Nigeria with the humanitarian crisis this portends for the entire West African subregion and even beyond, please act decisively. A stitch in time, as they say, saves nine,\u201d Professor Banji Akintoye, emeritus professor of History and leader of Ilana Omo Oodua Worldwide, said in a statement he personally signed, yesterday.\n\nHe said the UN boss cannot get the true picture of how close to the precipice Nigeria is unless he visits the theatres of the criminality of the government.\n\n\u201cVisit the Middle Belt, behold the atrocities of Fulanii herdsmen and marvel. Visit the South West; if you will not talk to anyone at all, talk to Olu Falae, a one-time secretary of the Federal Government, one-time minister of Finance and presidential candidate and listen to his harrowing multiple experiences in the hands of rampaging Fulani herdsmen.\n\n\u201cSpeak with octogenarian Reuben Fasoranti, erstwhile leader of Afenifere, whose daughter was murdered in her prime by Fulani herdsmen.\n\n\u201cVisit Ifon, also in Ondo State, whose traditional ruler was murdered by Fulani herdsmen. Visit Southern Kaduna where ethnic cleansing is a daily activity of the murderous Fulani nihilists. Same thing is happening in Taraba, Plateau, Niger, Ogun and Oyo states where Fulani herdsmen maim, rape, kill farmers and destroy farmlands.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, the list is endless. And the atrocities have not abated. The Buhari administration refuses to allow the victims arm and defend themselves whereas the murderers are allowed to roam about with AK-47 looting, raping, maiming, and killing.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency must speak with the right people who will paint the correct picture of our parlous situation: a parlous and debt-ridden economy; restive and restless youths; collapsed educational system, hyperinflation, runaway unemployment, insecurity, corruption never before witnessed in this country, and a country divided than even during its civil war period.\u201d\n\nUse your remaining time to save Nigeria, Afenifere tells Buhari\n\nPan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, yesterday, charged President Buhari to use the remaining time of his administration to bring Nigeria out of the doldrums into which it has fallen.\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, Afenifere said information and assurance that emanated from President Buhari\u2019s message to Nigerians to mark this year\u2019s Eid-El-Fitri celebration \u201cfly against the reality on ground.\u201d\n\nIn his message released on Sunday, April 30, by the presidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, to mark the end of Ramadan fast, President Buhari had disclosed that the end to terrorism acts was in sight and that Nigerians have reasons to mark the Ramadan festival with hope as the \u201cbattle waged against terrorists who falsely masquerade under the name of Islam is approaching its conclusion.\u201d\n\nBut Ajayi stated that \u201crather than looking at the immediate future with hope, Nigerians are living and moving around in fear and despondence because of the insecurity they face at home, at work and even more so when travelling on highways. How then can one be hopeful in that kind of situation?\u201d\n\nWhile agreeing with the president that the fight against terrorists \u201chas been long and hard,\u201d Afenifere noted that government has not succeeded in convincing most Nigerians that the \u201cfinal victory is within sight.\u201d\n\nAfenifere reminded President Buhari that the three major areas in which he raised the hopes of Nigerians when coming to power were security, fighting corruption and boosting the economy among others.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the change we have seen in any of these areas are in the reverse. In reverse in the sense that insecurity is now at an unprecedented level, corruption is an all-time high while the economy is now so down that hardly are majority of Nigerians able to eat twice in 24 hours.\u201d\n\nHe challenged the president to immediately allow states to establish their own police forces, honour agreements his government has with various labour unions, drastically reduce the cost of governance and ensure the cost of social services and essential commodities like petrol and electricity come down considerably.",

          "text": "Michael Olugbode\n\n\n\nSecretary-General of United Nations, Antonio Guterres, yesterday, said Borno State, the hotbed of Boko Haram, has begun to wear a new look and new hope.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to the Northeast state as part of his two-day visit to Nigeria, Guterres said his visit was that of solidarity, especially, with the victims of terrorism, in the holy month of Ramadan, noting that, \u201cThe fact that I came to Borno State is symbolic of our priority to the world to fight terrorism and to create solutions for the victims of terrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, the Borno State I have heard about in many circumstances around my life as High Commissioner for Refugees and then as Secretary-General was a Borno State of terrorism, of violence, of displacement, of despair.\n\n\u201cThis is not the Borno that I found today. The Borno I found today is a Borno of hope. It\u2019s a Borno with future and I was very impressed to see the policy that is being applied here, recognising that we don\u2019t fight terrorism just by military means.\n\n\u201cIn fact, terrorism \u2013 addressing the root causes of terrorism \u2013 and the policy of the government, which is aiming at reestablishing fully the confidence between the people and the government is an essential element that I witnessed today being implemented in reality.\n\n\u201cAnd on the other hand, it is absolutely essential to understand that, in a situation like this, it\u2019s not enough to provide humanitarian assistance. I am grateful to all those from the international community that have supported the people of Borno with humanitarian assistance.\n\n\u201cBut the people I met today want more than that. The people I met today, in reality, want to go back home in safety and dignity. And when one looks at the state, one understands that the way to [fight] terrorism effectively, is to provide not only hope, but a future of reality. It is to invest in livelihoods, it is to invest in the reintegration of those that have been in the past recruited by these terrorist groups, by Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cI was amazed to see today in the centre [that] those that have been terrorists, they want to integrate in the society and contribute to society. And the policy that is in place here is a policy of reconciliation, it is a policy of reintegration and it is a policy aiming at a development perspective to allow for terrorism to be definitely eliminated \u2026thanks to the fact that people are able to construct their future in confidence with those that are governing them,\u201d he explained.\n\nWhile expressing delight with the achievements of Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, the UN Secretary-General said: \u201cSo, I will be your advocate, Mr. Governor. Your advocate within the international community, asking the international community to support and to invest in the Borno of hope.\u201d\n\nOn how the UN was going to assist Borno to get back on track, he said: \u201cThe UN has its demining programme. I believe that there is a full possibility of cooperation with the government of Borno in relation to that. But, of course, it is not only demining.\n\n\u201cIt is, as I said, investing in the future of people \u2013 investing in schools, in the hospitals, in the creation of jobs, in the livelihoods, in helping those programmes, so that they are able to deliver, to go to the market and making Borno, as I said, not only a state of hope, but a state of reality, in which there is no room for terrorism.\u201d\n\nHe revealed that he had promised to fully be supportive of the project of reintegration of terrorists, adding: \u201cAnd when that project is formulated, I am ready to be an advocate of it and to be telling different countries around the world that they need to invest, because the best thing we can do for peace is to reintegrate those that in a moment of despair became terrorists but now want to become good citizens and want to contribute to the well-being of their brothers and sisters.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Don\u2019t keep party waiting\n\n\u2022Rotational presidency legal, constitutional, says Bamidele\n\n\u2022Clark insists on Igbo presidency, accuses north of oppression\n\n\u2022Warns any southerner agreeing to be VP unpatriotic\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja, Fidelis David in Akure and\n\nVictor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\n\n\nChairman of Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, and governor of Ondo State, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, yesterday, urged President Muhammadu Buhari and the leadership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) not to keep party members waiting for their position on where the next president of Nigeria will come from. Akeredolu insisted that it was the turn of the southern part of the country to produce the next president.\n\nIn a similar vein, Chairman, Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele, declared that rotational presidency in Nigeria between the north and south was legal and constitutional.\n\nLikewise, elder statesman and Ijaw leader, Chief Edwin Clark, yesterday, contended that the two major political parties in Nigeria, APC and the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), should allow the Igbo have the presidency in 2023. Clark accused any southerner who accepts to be a running mate in the 2023 presidential election of unpatriotism.\n\nNational Chairman of APC and former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, had at the weekend said the party was yet to zone the presidency to any geopolitical area ahead of 2023, a comment that provoked negative reactions, especially, from the southern part of the country.\n\nBut Akeredolu, in a statement he personally signed, stressed the need for the president and the APC leadership to ensure that the southern part of the country produced the next president.\n\nThe governor joined the growing number of Nigerians advising not just APC, but also PDP, to ensure that their presidential candidates in the 2023 general election were from the southern part of the country.\n\nAkeredolu maintained that it was the turn of the southern part of the country to produce the next president, and the APC leadership should have no difficulty in making a pronouncement on the issue. He urged the party leaders to do this without delay, stressing that the principle of Federal Character is enshrined in the 1999 Constitution, as amended.\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cWe must not keep our party men and women guessing on the position of the leadership of the party. This is the time to weigh in and take control of the process. No statement must suggest, even remotely, that the party harbours certain sentiments, which may predispose it to consider throwing the contest open. This is, certainly, not the time for equivocation. Equity dictates that we take a stand.\u201d\n\nOn the recent APC national convention, which produced a new leadership for the party, Akeredolu said there was an urgent need for the party to come clean about the zoning of the presidential position.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe leadership of the party ensured that the principle of rotational representation guided its decision at the just-concluded convention. The party chairmanship position has gone to the north; all other offices have been filled on this understanding.\n\n\u201cThis is the time the leaders of the party must make a categorical statement, devoid of equivocation, on the pattern of succession.\n\n\u201cThe party executive committee has fixed a fee for the purchase of the nomination form for the office. It is expected, fervently, that it will proceed to complete the process by limiting the propensities for disagreement to a region for possible micro-management. It is very expedient that we avoid self-inflicted crises before the general election.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu commended the efforts of the APC federal administration to address the multifarious challenges facing the country. But he warned against permitting any form of internal distrust ahead of the coming elections.\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cThe current socio-economic crises are surmountable. It is commendable that the government is addressing these issues without drama.\n\n\u201cThe federal government and leadership of our great party will come out stronger. We cannot, therefore, afford any internal bickering, which holds the potential promise of causing distrust and militating against cohesion, harmony and the zeal to achieve set objectives.\n\n\u201cThe current democratic dispensation is anchored on the unwritten convention driven by a principle of equity. Political expediency dictates, more appealingly, that while adhering to the spirit and letters of the laws guiding conduct of elections and succession to political offices, we must do nothing which is capable of tilting the delicate balance against the established arrangement, which guarantees peace and promotes trust.\n\n\u201cOur party just elected officers on the established principle of giving every part of the country an important stake in the political calculus. The focus has now shifted to the process, which will culminate in the participation of our party in the general elections scheduled for next year.\u201d\n\nThe governor stressed that all lovers of peace and freedom must do everything to eschew tendencies that might predispose them to taking decisions, which promote distrust and could lead to a crisis, the end of which nobody would be able to predict.\n\nRotational Presidency Legal, Constitutional, Bamidele Insists\n\nBamidele declared that the issue of rotational presidency in the country was legal and constitutional. The APC chieftain described the rotation of the presidency between northern and southern Nigeria as a legal and constitutional agitation recognised by Section 14 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended.\n\nSpeaking in Ado Ekiti during an empowerment programme he organised for his constituents, Bamidele, who is the senator for Ekiti Central, described the agitation for the presidency by politicians of southern extraction as a legitimate request.\n\nAddressing journalists at the Oluyemi Kayode stadium, in Ado Ekiti, venue of the event, Bamidele said, \u201cRotational presidency is legitimate and constitutional. Let me state that Section 14 of the constitution and various sections of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, stated that no section of the country should dominate others in terms of positions.\n\n\u201cLet me also state that the primary concept of governance is welfare and good governance. The section emphasised that Nigeria shall not be governed in such a way that any particular section will have domineering advantage over others.\n\n\u201cThat is the whole essence of equitable distribution of wealth and power. Part of the equitable distribution of power is allowing the presidency to rotate between the north and south.\n\n\u201cThough the constitution didn\u2019t say specifically about rotation, but logically and through various judicial interpretations, allowing it to rotate is legal and constitutional.\u201d\n\nBamidele added that allowing the presidency to go to the south in 2023 would douse the raging restiveness and tension in the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cSpeaking as a Nigerian, there is social tension in Nigeria today and when you have situations whereby Nigerians are beginning to doubt our togetherness and no longer trust leadership, people should not be thinking about political dominance.\n\n\u201cThere is no part of this nation and zone that cannot produce the best. If you check properly, majority desire in APC is that there should be free, fair and credible primary to elect our presidential candidate and not by imposition.\u201d\n\nThe Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) had on Monday issued a firm warning to those trying to do away with the zoning of the presidency in the country, saying any attempt to end zoning, as being insinuated in some northern quarters, would spell the end for Nigeria.\n\nThe leaders had also condemned a statement credited to the chairman of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Alhaji Ango Abdullahi, that rotation of the presidency between the north and south was, \u201cdead and buried.\u201d They declared that another eight years of northern presidency, after President Muhammadu Buhari, was unacceptable.\n\nThe position of the leaders was contained in a joint statement by National Leader, Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), and Chairman, SMBLF, Chief Edwin Clark; leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo; President-General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Professor George Obiozor; and National President, Middle Belt Forum, Pogu Bitrus. They said they were prepared for those attempting to upturn a practice \u2013 zoning \u2013 that had sustained the country.\n\nThe group warned that any attempt to kill and bury the age-long power rotation agreement between the north and south was tantamount to an attempt to kill and bury Nigeria. SMBLF stated that the move to tinker with the rotation of the presidency was inimical to national unity.\n\nThe Southern and Middle Belt leaders also cautioned Abdullahi\u2019s NEF, and wondered if the northern body was now out to dissolve the country.\n\nThe position resonated in the Ekiti State capital at the event, where Bamidele distributed to his constituents materials, including mini buses, sowing machines, generating sets, ploughing machine, grinding machines, wheel chairs, tricycles, motorbikes, ambulance buses, ventilators, fertilisers, driers, and Hilux van.\n\nClark Insists on Igbo Presidency, Accuses North of Oppression\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on Arise Television, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, Clark, a former federal commissioner, alleged that the north was using its population to oppress the rest of the country. He maintained that for the unity of the country, the Igbo should lead Nigeria from next year.\n\nClark stated, \u201cNo Nigerian will like to live in a Nigeria whereby certain people believe that unless they are in power, there will be no Nigeria, that the person who is there will not succeed.\n\n\u201cSo, APC believes that unless you have a northerner as a candidate they won\u2019t succeed, because they, too, have been watching PDP prevaricating. When Lord Lugard created Nigeria in 1914, he did not say that some people were superior to the others.\u201d\n\nInsisting that Nigeria stood on a tripod, the north, east and west, the nonagenarian contended that the third leg, which is the east, was yet to be reintegrated since the civil war.\n\nClark said former Head of State, Gen. Yakubu Gowon, was removed from office by the north because he decided to make an Igbo man General Manager of the then Nigerian National Oil Company (NNOC). \u201cBecause an Igbo man was appointed, there was a coup,\u201d he declared.\n\nHe said there was no moral justification for treating Igbo people as second-class citizens, stressing that if it is the presidency that will make the people of the east feel a sense of belonging, then they should have it.\n\nClark said, though there were many good people in the north, like other parts of Nigeria, it was unfortunate that \u201ca lot of the people up north believe they own the country.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the issue of lop-sidedness, he said if there was a police recruitment exercise in the country today, for instance, which was usually on the basis of local governments, Kano would have 414, while Bayelsa, which produced a significant part of the wealth of the country, would have only 80.\n\nClark queried, \u201cWhat kind of country is this? The Igbo are the only people with five states in this country. North-west has seven. Let\u2019s give them a sense of belonging if you don\u2019t want to allow them go.\n\n\u201cThe next president, therefore, should go to the east. Let them produce the president. They have very competent people.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that the north should desist from any tendency to oppress other parts of the country with its population, saying it is strange that those from the north are asking for the primaries to be thrown open after they have benefitted from zoning.\n\nDeclaring that this could be the last fight before his passage, Clark declared, \u201cIf rotation is jettisoned, there will be no Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI do not think there are many people who are senior to me in this country. I am appealing to my northern brothers to, please, allow a Nigeria where all of us are equal, where our children can aspire to any position because they will ask questions.\n\n\u201cWe are not begging anybody. This country belongs to all of us.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesman said the treatment meted out to former President Goodluck Jonathan by the north remained unacceptable.\n\n\u201cAny southern governor or Southern politician who agrees to make himself a vice to a northerner in this election is very unpatriotic and not a true southerner and God will take care of him.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Michael Olugbode\n\n\n\nThe National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has alleged that a billionaire drug baron, Chief Afam Ukatu, imported into Nigeria two containers containing 1,284 cartons of tramadol, with the market value of over N22 billion, in October 2019. NDLEA said in a statement yesterday that its on-going investigation of Ukatu had uncovered the importation of the banned drug.\n\nThe statement was issued against the backdrop of insinuations by people the agency called hirelings, that NDLEA had no evidence to pin a crime on the Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of Mallinson Group of Companies.\n\nThe spokesman of the agency, Femi Babafemi, explained in the statement that Ukatu was arrested on April 13 on-board a flight to Abuja, at the MM2 Terminal of the Lagos airport, Ikeja, after months\u2019 surveillance.\n\nBabafemi said investigation revealed that Ukatu had been a major importer of large consignments of different brands and high dosages of tramadol hydrochloride, ranging from 120mg to 200mg, 225mg and 250mg.\n\nHe further said Ukatu owned pharmaceutical and plastic manufacturing companies, which he used as a cover to import illicit drugs into Nigeria.\n\nThe NDLEA spokesman said in the course of investigating the N3 billion tramadol saga between Ukatu and the Abba Kyari\u2019s IRT team, the agency\u2019s operatives unearthed more evidence establishing how he had been importing large quantities of tramadol far above the approved threshold allowed into the country.\n\nHe further alleged that in one instance, Ukatu, through his Mallinson Group of Companies, imported into the country two-container loads of five different brands of tramadol in October 2019 through the Apapa ports in Lagos.\n\nBabafemi said all the evidence so far gathered showed that the imported tramadol brands were far above the threshold permitted in Nigeria, adding, \u201cNo doubt, the suspect will soon have his day in court.\u201d\n\nNDLEA had earlier this week revealed that it intercepted travellers\u2019 cheques in different foreign currencies with a total value of over N1.1 billion at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos.\n\nA statement by Babafemi said, \u201cTravellers\u2019 cheques in different foreign currencies with a total value of N1, 157, 670,469.92 have been intercepted at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, MMIA, Ikeja, Lagos, by operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).\u201d\n\nBabafemi also disclosed that a suspect, Oguma Uchenna, was arrested in connection with the attempt to export the cheques, which he said were neatly concealed inside four bound hardcover books disguised as academic project literatures, to the United Kingdom.\n\nHe said the financial instruments suspected to be counterfeits were discovered last Wednesday at the NAHCO export shed of the Lagos airport during cargo examination of some consignments meant for exportation to the UK on a cargo flight.\n\nBabafemi also disclosed that a breakdown of the cheques showed they had monetary values of $287, 623.31; $1,456,300 and \u20ac1,297,800.\n\nHe had also said at the Lagos airport that NDLEA operatives foiled attempts by drug traffickers to smuggle into Nigeria 10.89 kilogrammes of cocaine through a Qatar Airways flight, adding that the illicit drug was hidden in seven children\u2019s duvets packed in an unaccompanied bag from Brazil.\n\nAccording to him, raid operations in Kaduna, Ondo and Akwa Ibom states led to the seizure of about 2,000 kilogrammes of tramadol, codeine, cannabis and heroin.\n\nIn Ondo State, 401 kilogrammes of cannabis was recovered and two suspects \u2013 Julius Dapo, 56, and Emeka Ikebuaku, 32 \u2013 were arrested at Ipele forest in Owo area on April 24.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

But it\u2019s opened already,\u201d a source told SaharaReporters on Tuesday evening.\n\nThis is coming a few days after the minister distributed over 100 exotic cars to ruling All Progressives Congress members ahead of the party\u2019s governorship primary in Kebbi State.\n\nMalami had last Thursday declared interest in the Kebbi State governorship race.\n\nExotic vehicles such as Toyota Prado, Lexus, Toyota Hilux, and Mercedes-Benz vehicles were given to them during the weekend.

          "text": "The United States Federal Reserve (Fed) has raised its interest rate by 50 basic points \u2014 the biggest hike since 2000 \u2014 in an effort to curb rising inflation.\n\nThe bank\u2019s federal open market committee (FOMC) unanimously voted to increase the benchmark rate by a half percentage point on Wednesday.\n\nIt also announced that it would begin allowing its holdings of treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to decline in June at an initial combined monthly pace of $47.5 billion, stepping up over three months to $95 billion.\n\nIn a statement, the Fed said although overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter, household spending and business fixed investment remained strong, adding that job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures.\n\nThe Fed also said the invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship in the country, noting that the implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain.\n\n\u201cThe invasion and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are likely to weigh on economic activity. In addition, COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. The committee is highly attentive to inflation risks,\u201d it said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of two per cent over the longer run. With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, the committee expects inflation to return to its two per cent objective and the labour market to remain strong.\n\n\u201cIn support of these goals, the committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3/4 to 1 per cent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the committee decided to begin reducing its holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities on June 1, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Balance Sheet that were issued in conjunction with this statement.\n\n\u201cIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the committee\u2019s goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe committee\u2019s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labour market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\u201d\n\nTheCable looks at how it may affect the Nigerian economy here",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

I agree that it\u2019s just as addictive as Twitter or any other platform, perhaps even more so. But why is nearly every video social networking app attempting to compete with TikTok?\n\nI mean, YouTube launched the YouTube Shorts Fund in 2021 to reward content creators. Also, Instagram heavily promoted short-form videos to creators and users alike, offering cash bonuses to top Reels creators.\n\nStill, Instagram is looking for ways to keep users on its platform. Could it be because TikTok \u2014 launched in 2016 \u2014 was the most downloaded app in the first quarter of 2022, beating out a slew of Meta-owned apps?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI understand that this may be a source of frustration for the Meta team, but wasn\u2019t it just last month that Instagram said it would stop recommending TikTok videos to the users?\n\nYet, yesterday, May 3, 2022, Instagram announced that it\u2019s testing a feature similar to TikTok that will provide a full-screen vertical home feed created to \u201cbring video more front and centre.\u201d\n\nEssentially, Instagram is still coming for TikTok users. Once more, why do you use the app? What sets it apart from YouTube Shorts or Reels? I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nTwitter is testing Twitter Circle\n\nFacebook to shut down its podcast platform\n\nTwitter is testing Twitter Circle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Claudio Schwarz | @purzlbaum on Unsplash\n\nYesterday, Tuesday, May 3, 2022, Twitter announced a limited test for Twitter Circle.\n\nNote that the feature was revealed as one of several potential product updates in July 2021. Following that, in April 2022, it appeared live on the site due to a bug.\n\nWhat\u2019s Twitter Circle? It is a feature that allows you to control who sees your tweets and who appears in your replies.\n\nThis means that people who are already members of your Circle will be able to see the tweets you post to it, but they will be unable to use the built-in retweet icon to share them automatically.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe feature will allow you to invite up to 150 people to your Circle, including followers and non-followers.\n\nConsequently, when you want to tweet without sharing with the general public, you can pull up the Choose Audience menu while writing a tweet and select Twitter Circle instead of Everyone.\n\nI probably know what you\u2019re thinking. It works in the same way as Twitter Communities. Well, you\u2019re wrong! They are different.\n\nHow? Even though Communities also hide tweets \u2014 an attempt to prevent \u201ccontext collapse\u201d \u2014Twitter Circle differs because Communities are tied to specific discussions. In contrast, Circle is just standard tweets that aren\u2019t visible to everyone.\n\nThe copycat game: It\u2019s a feature similar to Instagram\u2019s Close Friends and Google Plus feature\n\nThe company announced that beginning yesterday, some Twitter users can start creating their own Twitter Circle because the feature is still in its early stages.\n\nFor the time being, the select few who will have access to Twitter Circle can only create one Circle, and only the person who creates the Circle can see the list of people who are members of it.\n\nIf you\u2019re not part of the \u201cchosen ones,\u201d don\u2019t worry about it because I\u2019m not too. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 And even if you can\u2019t create a Twitter Circle, you can see tweets from users who can, as long as you\u2019re in their Circle.\n\nInterestingly, the feature is available on iOS, Android, and the web. Most importantly, if you\u2019re in a Circle, you can\u2019t leave it, but you can mute a discussion if you don\u2019t want to be a part of it.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Fisayo Fosudo\u2019s escapades in tech and finance to Hillary Omitogun\u2019s journey as a Web3 UX researcher at Nestcoin, we have a star-studded line-up of speakers at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022).\n\nTickets are selling out fast; save a seat for yourself here.\n\nFacebook to shut down its podcast platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you listen to podcasts on Facebook? I\u2019m guessing you do not. You can prove me wrong, though. Can you? If you can, I have some news for you.\n\nThe word starts with \u201cs\u201d: Social media giant, Facebook, is shutting down its podcast platform. This comes almost a year after its launch in June 2021.\n\nWhat does this signify? According to Bloomberg, creators will be unable to upload new shows to the platform as of this week, and the platform will be completely closed on June 3, 2022.\n\nWhy? Facebook claims the move is part of a larger overhaul of the company\u2019s audio offerings. In addition, Meta\u2019s \u2014 Facebook\u2019s parent company \u2014 spokesperson, Adelaide Coronado, stated that the changes would \u201csimplify\u201d the company\u2019s audio offerings.\n\nHowever, according to a report by 9to5Mac, an Apple news and reviews platform, the company is yielding to other competing podcasting platforms, like Apple Music and Spotify, which dominate the market.\n\nRemember that Facebook launched the podcast feature last year when streaming service giant, Spotify, began to acquire exclusive content creators. This also occurred when Apple\u2019s podcasting service announced the availability of subscriptions for its existing content.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the company is discontinuing its central audio hub and its short-form audio product called Soundbites. Also, it\u2019s incorporating its live-streaming Live Audio Rooms feature \u2013 essentially a clone of the once-popular audio app Clubhouse \u2013 into its larger Facebook Live suite.\n\nI think now it\u2019s a good time to revisit this: First test of Clubhouse-like Facebook audio features begins\n\nAlthough we know Facebook\u2019s podcasting service will be phased out on June 3, 2022, the social media giant has yet to provide a shutdown date for both Soundbites and the audio hub.\n\nMoreso, Facebook is reportedly focusing on other opportunities with podcast partners, like metaverse events and eCommerce.\n\nMeta is also said to be prioritising short-form video projects over other initiatives, most likely due to increased competition from popular short-form video platforms.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

Looking forward, Mushe hopes to work with video game providers to help metaverse gamers monetize their skills too.\n\nFacilitating transactions\n\nThe DeFi pioneer aims to become the only financial app users need. Mushe wants to help users swap back and forth between cryptocurrencies and fiat with ease, send money transfers and pay for goods and services.\n\nDeveloped by financial experts with years of experience, Mushe plans to cover all bases by offering prepaid cards connected to current accounts and allowing users to spend with merchant partners and send money in fiat or crypto to contacts, without fuss.\n\nKeeping it current\n\nThese current accounts will minimize the time needed to transfer between cryptos and fiat, and give users peace of mind knowing that their accounts are secure, easily accessible, and even able to receive their monthly salaries.\n\nBoth the user ID and the token\u2019s validity will need to be verified before transactions can be made, which will offer an added level of security.\n\nRewarding loyal users\n\nMushe aims to reward peer-to-peer interaction and trading, rewarding users for using its services and for their loyalty, as well as incentivizing ethical initiatives and behavior.\n\nNot only that, but Mushe will also allow business users to utilize Mushe token reward schemes to complement their marketing campaigns, incentivizing consumers to get involved.\n\nAiming to be a positive force for good, Mushe will let the community decide which charitable organizations will receive the one percent of Mushe tokens set aside to contribute to a healthier world.\n\nProviding financial education\n\nIn an exciting world developing at breakneck speed, financial education is necessary to ensure accessibility to the crypto world for all.\n\nMushe will offer tools and share knowledge to help users get up to speed on everything they need to know. It plans to provide market information, explain the jargon, and break down the trickier elements, educating users about the benefits and risks of new opportunities and helping them grow their investments.\n\nA whole new ecosystem\n\nThe MusheVerse is a simple ecosystem that does away with the complexities common in the crypto world. XMU is interoperable across fiat and crypto, the Mushe Wallet is seamlessly integrated, and users can trade and transfer with Mushe Swap.\n\nThe MusheVerse facilitates e-commerce, while Mushe Chat will allow users to connect socially. A more accessible crypto-token, education on digital assets forms a large part of the service, empowering decisions and financial choices with knowledgable reports and without the jargon.\n\nLearn more about Mushe (XMU)\n\n\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.mushe.world/\n\nPresale Registration : https://portal.mushe.world/sign-up\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/MusheWorldXMU\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Mushe_World\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mushe_world/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa\u2019s audience directly. Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to data from Coingecko, there are over 16,000 cryptocurrencies in circulation. Only around 10% of these will be around for the long haul. If you are new to cryptocurrency and don\u2019t know where to begin, any of the five coins highlighted in this article could be considered for an investment. The five cryptos are:\n\nEthereum (ETH) XRP (XRP) Gala Games (GALA) Chiliz (CHZ) FIREPIN Token (FRPN)\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at why we think these five cryptos will be good additions to your portfolio.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a layer one, open-source platform for decentralised apps (dApps). The goal is to establish a decentralised global computer upon which anybody may build. Ethereum enables smart contracts, which allow developers to programme digital currency using code, as well as to create NFTs, DeFi and DEX platforms.\n\nWith an ETH 2.0 upgrade scheduled for release in summer 2022, Ethereum is expected to continue its path to cryptocurrency dominance, with many predicting it could hit $10,000 and dethrone Bitcoin (BTC) for the number one slot.\n\nXRP\n\nXRP is the native token of Ripple Labs, a company that is revolutionising the banking and financial sectors by enabling quick and cheap cross border payments between establishments. The current SWIFT system is old, slow and expensive with transactions taking up to 5 days sometimes. With XRP any transaction will be completed in under two seconds to anywhere in the world.\n\nRipple Labs has been locked in a lawsuit with the SEC for over a year now which has negatively affected the price of XRP. Over the coming years and after the lawsuit is settled, the price of XRP is expected to moon to heights not seen before, with financial experts predicting it should be on a similar level to Ethereum in terms of market cap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGala Games\n\nGala Games (GALA) is one of the forefront projects in the world of the Metaverse. With crypto gaming (GameFi) becoming more popular by the day, it shouldn\u2019t be long before global adoption of crypto, from the video gaming industry, is established.\n\nGala Games is an ecosystem similar to Steam in that it will be a platform where multiple games will be available for playing and downloading. Users will be able to earn real-world fiat currency by completing tasks in-game via NFTs and then exchanging their earnings for GALA. As the Metaverse gains traction, expect to see the early adoption tokens such as Gala Games (GALA) see significant price increases.\n\nChiliz\n\nChiliz (CHZ) is another NFT and Metaverse ecosystem that is making waves in the cryptocurrency world. Instead of gaming, CHZ is used primarily for the sports and entertainment sectors. Sports memorabilia and collectables have been popular pastimes for many years now. Chiliz is taking that hobby and bringing it to the digital age.\n\nVia the Chiliz platform and its multitude of fan tokens that have launched, users will be able to collect digital cards, photos and videos in the form of NFTs. These NFTs can then be sold in exchange for CHZ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIREPIN Token\n\nFIREPIN Token (FRPN) is a brand new cryptocurrency that is still in its presale, meaning that you have a fantastic chance of investing in a project in its infancy. FIREPIN Token aims to be a fully integrated Metaverse community platform that has plans to produce the next generation of video games.\n\nAlongside this, FIREPIN Token can be utilised as a multi-chain cryptocurrency. This means that it is easily swappable between five of the most used blockchains. The five networks are:\n\nEthereum\n\nBNB\n\nSolana\n\nAvalanche\n\nPolygon\n\nWhen it comes to NFTs and developing apps, users will now be able to use FRPN to find the cheapest and quickest blockchain to facilitate their respective transactions.\n\nThese are the five cryptocurrencies that we believe have the strongest long term fundamentals and will be around for a long time. Before investing in cryptocurrency you should research any project thoroughly.\n\nFind Out More Here:\n\nJoin Presale: https://presale.firepin.io/register\n\nWebsite: https://firepin.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/FIREPINOFFICIAL\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FIREPIN_io\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

We should be united and not be our own opponents. The way we go about this primary election is very important.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time since 1999 that a fundamental amendment has been made to the Electoral Act. After the primary election, we have nine months to prepare and campaign and the journey will not be easy or cheap. We should conserve our energy for this process. We should work in unity to win the forthcoming EDHA election in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe have a primary election coming up and I am not asking anybody to step down but to sit with party leaders and see how to discuss and dialogue to reduce the number of aspirants to enable us to work better. If everyone decides to go into the primary, so be it as we all belong to one big family.\u201d\n\nObaseki added, \u201cPDP will select candidates to go and contest for the position against candidates from other parties. For contestation at this level, we can\u2019t be our own opponents. In any particular constituency, only one or two people will win, depending on the number of seats. We all will rally round to support those that emerge and together we will win the election.\u201d\n\nWarning against politics of bitterness, the governor stated, \u201cI want to warn all the aspirants, I don\u2019t want any of you to spend your future or sell your properties because of the election. There is a lot of bitterness in politics; we need to stop this as it can\u2019t lead us to the political evolution that we desire. Edo is a pacesetter.\n\n\u201cI want to stay neutral in the build up to this primary despite the several calls I have received. Every aspirant is my own; the PDP is one and my goal is that the PDP must win at the state level, National Assembly and Presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the first step towards winning. I want us to be strong and not go into the contest weak,\u201d Obaseki urged.\n\nOn his part, Edo PDP Chairman, Tony Aziegbemi disclosed that 164 aspirants bought the EDHA forms, while 162 persons returned their forms and were screened and cleared to contest the primary election.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Omoregie Ogbeide-Ihama, member representing Oredo in the House of Representatives sponsored a similar suit at the Federal High Court Abuja, with suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/ 598/2022.\n\nThe Plaintiffs in the said suit, seeking an ex-parte injunction are Hon. Monday Iyore Osagie, Hon. Reuben Ikponmwan Ekhosuehi, Hon. Adeyanba Michael Osaro, Hon. Magdalene Omosigho and Hon. Imariagbe Destiny Oghogho, who claim to bring the suit on behalf of the 576 ad hoc delegates elected on 30 April, 2020.\n\nThey are seeking to restrain the PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, Senator Sam Anyanwu, Hon. Umar Bature and INEC from acting on any list that does not include their names for the purpose of the party primaries of the 7th of May, 2022.\n\nDue to administrative constraints the matter which was filed on the 4th of May, 2022 is yet to be assigned to a court by the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court.\n\nIt will be recalled that a faction of the PDP in Edo State headed by Chief Dan Orbih expressed their dissatisfaction with the outcome of the Congress to elect 3 ad hoc delegates for the State and National Assembly primaries.\n\nTo avert the legal action in court, which Orbih and his supporters threatened, a three-man Electoral Appeal Panel was set-up by the national leadership of the party.\n\nOn Tuesday the 3rd of May, 2022, the Chairman and two other members of the Appeal Panel arrived in Benin City to address grievances arising from the congress held across the 192 wards in Edo State to elect 576 adhoc delegates ahead of the party primaries.\n\nAddressing party members at the PDP Secretariat in Benin City, Chairman of the Edo PDP Ward Congresses Electoral Appeal Panel, Sen. Chukwuka Utazi, said the committee has commenced work, promising to ensure justice for all aggrieved parties.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

This is beyond tokenism, but factored as imperative for good and qualitative leadership that can also guarantee purposeful, altruistic and effective governance for the critical job of birthing a new nation that truly works for the common good.\n\n\u201cJack-Rich is a world-class technocrat that is coming to the job with a remarkable record of accomplishments, having excelled well in the private sector and now ready to turn his knowledge and experience in the service of the nation.\n\n\u201cJack-Rich is a patriot. This is why we are rallying all compatriots around him to serve selflessly and help to reorder the nation around such ennobling values that can arrest the current doldrums in the nation\u2019s socio-economic sphere and begin anew as a nation in rebound.\n\n\u201cOf course, looking at the extent and impact of his philanthropy over the years and across the nation in the critical areas of education, health, infrastructure and strategic empowerment, it is too obvious that such leaning even as a private sector-led initiative can only assure Nigerians that Jack-Rich will put the people first in all considerations and as it affects government policies and programmes.\n\n\u201cSo, this is the Jack-Rich effect we will like to see at the national level, hence our coming together as patriots to canvass for his election at the forthcoming delegates\u2019 election of the APC in May.

          "text": "Ondo state Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has called on the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone the presidential position to the southern part of the country.\n\nAkeredolu made the call Tuesday in a statement, titled \u201cOur Party, APC, Must Tread the Path of Equity\u201d which was made available to journalists in Akure, the state capital.\n\nThe governor said the party could not afford any internal bickering that might cause distrust and militate against cohesion, harmony and the zeal to achieve set objectives.\n\nAPC National Chairman and former Nasarawa state Governor Senator Abdullahi Adamu, had last week, said the party was yet to zone presidency to any zone, a statement that is eliciting negative reactions from the southern part of Nigeria.\n\nAkeredolu, who said the current democratic dispensation was anchored on the unwritten convention driven by a principle of equity, said the APC must do nothing which is capable of tilting the delicate balance against the established arrangement which guarantees peace and promotes trust.\n\n\u201cOur party just elected officers on the established principle of giving every part of the country an important stake in the political calculus,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that the focus had shifted to the process which would culminate in the participation of the party in the general elections in 2023.\n\n\u201cAll lovers of peace and freedom must do everything to eschew tendencies which may predispose them to taking decisions which promote distrust and lead to a crisis, the end of which nobody may be able to predict.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the party ensured that the principle of rotational representation guided its decision at the just-concluded convention,\u201d he said.\n\nAkeredolu, who said party chairmanship position had gone to the North and all other offices had been filled, said it\u2019s high time leaders of the party took a categorical statement, devoid of equivocation, on the pattern of succession.\n\nHe said the party executive committee had fixed a fee for the purchase of the nomination form for the office.\n\n\u201cIt is expected, fervently, that it would proceed to complete the process by limiting the propensities for disagreement to a region for possible micro-management.\n\n\u201cIt is very expedient that we avoid self-inflicted crises before the general elections. It is the turn of the Southern part of the country to produce the next President.\n\n\u201cThe party leadership should have no difficulty in making pronouncement on this very important issue, just as it has fixed various fees for the purchase of forms.\n\n\u201cThis must be done without delay. The principle of Federal Character is enshrined in the 1999 Constitution, as amended. It will be disingenuous for anyone to argue against rotation at this period.\n\n\u201cWe must not keep our party men and women guessing on the position of the leadership of the party. This is the time to weigh in and take control of the process.\n\n\u201cNo statement must suggest, even remotely, that the party harbours certain sentiments which may predispose it to consider throwing the contest open.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly not the time for equivocation. Equity Dictates That We Take A Stand,\u201d Akeredolu said. (NAN)\n\nBamidele\n\nAlso in a related development, Chairman Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele, said allowing the presidency to return to the South in 2023 presidential elections would douse the raging restiveness and tension in the country.\n\nSenator Bamidele also described the agitation for presidency from politicians of Southern extraction, in the country as a legitimate request backed by the 1999 constitution.\n\nBamidele, who represents the Ekiti Central Senatorial District in the Senate stated this Tuesday while speaking in Ado-Ekiti,the Ekiti state capital during the empowerment programme for his constituents across the five councils in the zone.\n\nMaterials distributed at the event were mini buses, sewing machines, generating sets, ploughing machine, grinding machines, wheel chairs, tricycles, motorbikes, ambulance buses, ventilators, fertilisers, driers, Hilux van, among others.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Senator Bamidele described the rotation of presidency between the Northern and Southern Nigeria as a legal and constitutional agitation recognised by Section 14 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended.\n\nAddressing journalists at the Oluyemi Kayode Stadium, in Ado-Ekiti, venue of the event, Bamidele said: \u201cRotational presidency is legitimate and constitutional.\n\n\u201cLet me state that Section 14 of the constitution and various sections of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, stated that no section of the country should dominate others in terms of positions.\n\n\u201cLet me also state that the primary concept of governance is welfare and good governance. The Section emphasized that Nigeria shall not be governed in such a way that any particular section will have domineering advantage over others.\n\n\u201cThat is the whole essence of equitable distribution of wealth and power. Part of the equitable distribution of power is allowing presidency to rotate between North and South.\n\n\u201cThough the constitution didn\u2019t say specifically about rotation, but logically and through various judicial interpretations, allowing it to rotate is legal and constitutional\u201d.\n\n\u201cSpeaking as a Nigerian, there is social tension in Nigeria today and when you have situations whereby Nigerians are beginning to doubt our togetherness and no longer trust leadership, people should not be thinking about political dominance.\n\n\u201cThere is no part of this nation and zone that cannot produce the best. If you check properly, majority desire in APC is that, there should be free, fair and credible primary to elect our presidential candidate and not by imposition\u201d, he said.\n\nOn the empowerment\n\nBamidele expressed gratitude to his constituency for working hard to support him in the last three years.\n\n\u201cWhat I am doing today is part of how to give back to the society. This is not the first empowerment I have done. I have empowered over 5,000 people in my constituency in agriculture, tying and dying and others.\n\n\u201cThis is a basic and fundamental thing that I think will benefit our people in critical areas like Agriculture, education, security, health and general empowerment\n\n\u201cI have procured 10,000 volume of books for our students while two ambulances and ventilators were donated to Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital\u201d, he stated.\n\nChairman of the occasion and Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo, urged the Ekiti voters to vote for the APC governorship candidate, Biodun Oyebanji during the June 18 poll.\n\nThe former governor commended the lawmaker for giving a strong showing through the empowerment programme, saying \u201cthis has further showed that he is a good and worthy representative.\n\n\u201cI know that all of you love Biodun Oyebanji, but he can only become governor if you vote for him. Don\u2019t stay at home and be expecting victory. But if you go out and work, victory shall be ours\u201d, he said.\n\nTactically referring to Bamidele\u2019s re-election bid, Adebayo said: \u201cSenator Bamidele has done well with this empowerment, he has done creditably well and this is kind of him. Please, don\u2019t forget to remember him when the time comes.\u201d\n\nFayemi declares\n\nMeanwhile, Ekiti state Governor and Chairman Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Dr Kayode Fayemi, is to formally declare his intention to run for the position of president of the country Wednesday, 4th May 2022, in Abuja.\n\nFayemi would join the race for the Presidency after months of speculations that trailed his nationwide consultations.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Yinka Oyebode, in Ado-Ekiti Tuesday, the declaration is tagged \u201cUnveiling My Nigeria Agenda.\u201d\n\nFayemi, had after discussing his plan to run for the number one office with President Mohammadu Buhari last month, sought counsel, guidance and support from traditional and political leaders across states in the federation.\n\nThe Ekiti state governor said the engagements with the traditional rulers and political leaders provided an avenue to share and listen to their perspectives on the ideal approaches to building a united country based on justice, freedom, equity and the rule of law.\n\nThe aggregate opinion, counsel and goodwill received during the consultation period would form the crux of his declaration Wednesday at Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital city.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "\u2026 As Edo approves N40,000 new minimum wage\n\nBy Onu Okorie\n\nEdo State Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Mr. Odion Olaye has charged the Federal Government to step up efforts to tackle the high rate of insecurity, unemployment and hunger in the country.\n\nHe made the call yesterday during the 2022 Workers\u2019 Day in Benin City, Edo State.\n\nMeanwhile, the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has approved N40,000 as new minimum wage for workers in the state, in commemoration of this year\u2019s Workers\u2019 Day.\n\nThe governor, who made the announcement while delivering his 2022 Workers\u2019 Day speech, said his government would continue to prioritise the welfare of Edo workers, equipping them with capacity and the environment to deliver efficient and quality service to the people.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cAs we all know, the minimum of N30,000 can barely sustain a family. It will be immoral and mindless of us to continue to pretend we do not know our workers are suffering.\n\n\u201cThe government of Edo has now decided to review the minimum wage for Edo workers from N30,000 to N40,000. Undoubtedly, Edo is the first state since the current outbreak of coronavirus to take this initiative.\n\n\u201cEven though we would have loved to pay more, we hope that this little adjustment would enable us to cushion the impact of the inflation that we are faced with. There is no doubt that the financial implications will be heavy and put another burden on the government. But as a government, we are prepared to make the sacrifices so that the workers can live a better life. Your welfare is our number one priority.\u201d\n\nOn pensioners, he said he had approved, effective this month, the agreement reached with the Union of Pensioners that harmonised amount would be paid from this month.\n\n\u201cGovernment is aware of the difficulties faced by pensioners due to non-payment of pension and gratuities to pensioners by previous governments. This responsibility is huge and it will require a substantial part of our resources to settle them.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are not a government that is known for running away from challenges; we will look for a way to tackle these challenges,\u201d the governor added.",

God is a God of justice, so you cannot kill people and say God is great. Luckily the people understood our message and it has made great impact,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari told the UN scribe that the government had started a gradual, but steady process of resettlement and reintegration where citizens get encouraged to return to their farms, businesses and other pursuits in life.\n\nThe President thanked the Secretary General for the maiden visit to Nigeria.\n\nIn his remark, the UN Scribe, who had been in Borno State on Tuesday, said what he saw was a departure from the pictures of hopelessness and despair painted, adding that \u201dpeople exuded hope.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cYesterday, I visited Maiduguri where the United Nations is supporting the internally displaced. I was deeply moved by their stories and struggles.\n\n\u201cThese include the struggles with hunger, with the World Food Programme projecting 4.1 million people in the North East of Nigeria to be food insecure in the upcoming lean season,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nGuterres said the United Nations had called for an additional 351 million dollars as part of the overall 1.1 billion dollars for the humanitarian response plan for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBut despite all they have seen and endured, the people I met remain hopeful and committed to returning to their communities and resuming their lives. To that end, I welcome the establishment of the Presidential Committee on the Repatriation, Returns and Resettlement of Displaced Persons in the North East.\n\n\u201cThis spirit of hope amidst hardship \u2013 and solidarity in struggle \u2013 was also at the centre of my discussions with the Presidency today,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nThe UN Scribe said discussions with President Buhari also touched on laying groundwork to ensure peaceful and democratic elections next year \u2013 and the full participation of Nigeria\u2019s women and young people.\n\nAt the media stakeout, the UN Secretary General told newsmen that measures to address security challenges in the country, Lake Chad and Sahel were discussed, which include the UN Integrated Strategy for the Sahel.\n\nGuterres thanked President Buhari for his unwavering support of the Multinational Joint Task Force and the Lake Chad Basin Commission, assuring more commitment from the UN on COVID-19 vaccinations, vulnerability of countries to global warming, global food crises response and reform of UN Security Council.\n\nHe said the war in Ukraine will make things worse on global food, energy and financial systems, adding:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, in the earliest days of this war, I established the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, involving all UN Agencies and international financial institutions.

          "title": "EU Targets Russian Oil, Banks as Moscow\u2019s Ally Belarus Stages Army Drills",
          "text": "The EU proposed its toughest sanctions yet against Russia on Wednesday, including a phased oil embargo, as Ukraine came under further heavy Russian bombardment and nervously monitored large-scale army drills in neighbouring Belarus, a close Moscow ally.\n\nNearly 10 weeks into a war that has killed thousands, uprooted millions and flattened cities and towns in eastern and southern Ukraine, Russia also stepped up attacks on targets in western Ukraine, partly to disrupt Western arms deliveries.\n\nA new convoy of buses began evacuating more civilians from the devastated southeastern port city of Mariupol, which has seen the heaviest fighting of the war so far and where Moscow said remaining Ukrainian forces remained tightly blockaded.\n\nPiling pressure on Russia\u2019s already battered $1.8 trillion economy, the European Commission proposed phasing out supplies of Russian crude oil within six months and refined products by the end of 2022. The price of Brent crude jumped 3% to more than $108 a barrel after the news.\n\nThe plan, if agreed by EU governments, would be a watershed for the world\u2019s largest trading bloc, which remains dependent on Russian energy and must find alternative supplies. Hungary and Slovakia want to be exempted from the ban for now, sources said.\n\n\u201c(President Vladimir) Putin must pay a price, a high price, for his brutal aggression,\u201d Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, to applause from lawmakers.\n\nShe also announced sanctions targeting Russia\u2019s largest bank Sberbank, two other lenders, three state broadcasters and army officers and other individuals accused of war crimes.\n\nThe EU has yet to target Russian natural gas, used to heat homes and generate electricity across the bloc.\n\nPutin raised the economic stakes further for Kyiv\u2019s Western backers on Tuesday by announcing plans to block exports of vital raw materials.\n\n\u2018WE ARE READY\u2019\n\nOn the war front, Russia\u2019s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said his military would consider NATO transport carrying weapons in Ukraine, which is not a member of the alliance, as targets to be destroyed, RIA news agency reported. NATO says individual member states are sending military supplies but not troops.\n\nHis comments came after the ministry said it had disabled six railway stations in Ukraine used to supply Ukrainian forces with Western-made arms in the country\u2019s east. Reuters could not verify the claim and there was no immediate reaction from Kyiv.\n\nThe ministry also said it had hit 40 Ukrainian military targets, including four depots storing ammunition and artillery weapons.\n\nAnnouncing the surprise military drills, Belarus\u2019s defence ministry said they posed no threat to its neighbours, but Ukraine\u2019s border service said it could not exclude the possibility that Belarusian forces might join Russia\u2019s assault.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we are ready,\u201d said spokesman Andriy Demchenko.\n\nSome Russian forces entered Ukraine via Belarus when the invasion began on Feb. 24 but Belarusian troops have not so far been involved in what Moscow calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to disarm Ukraine and defend it from fascists.\n\nKyiv and its Western backers say the fascism claim is an absurd pretext for Moscow to wage an unprovoked war of aggression that has driven five million Ukrainians to flee abroad.\n\nThe convoy leaving Mariupol, organised by the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, was heading for the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. It was not expected to arrive on Wednesday.\n\nHe did not say how many buses were in the convoy or whether any more civilians had been evacuated from the vast Azovstal steel works, where the city\u2019s last defenders are holding out against Russian forces that have occupied Mariupol.\n\nThe first evacuees from Azovstal arrived by bus in Zaporizhzhia on Tuesday after cowering for weeks in bunkers beneath the sprawling Soviet-era steel works. read more\n\n\u201cWe had said goodbye to life. We didn\u2019t think anyone knew we were there,\u201d said Valentina Sytnykova, 70, who said she sheltered in the plant for two months with her son and 10-year-old granddaughter.\n\nUkraine\u2019s general staff said the Russian assault on Azovstal was continuing.\n\nRussia now controls Mariupol, once a city of 400,000 but now largely reduced to smoking rubble after weeks of siege and shelling. The city is key to Moscow\u2019s efforts to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea \u2013 vital for its grain and metals exports \u2013 and connect Russian-controlled territory in the south and east.\n\n\u2018WE ARE NOT AFRAID\u2019\n\nMoscow has deployed 22 battalion tactical groups near the eastern Ukrainian town of Izium in a possible drive to capture the cities of Kramatorsk and Severodonetsk in Donbas, British intelligence said. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.\n\nThe cities are in the eastern Donbas region \u2013 Russia\u2019s main target. Russian forces turned their heaviest firepower on Ukraine\u2019s east and south after failing to take Kyiv, the capital, in the opening weeks of the war.\n\nBut the mayor of Lviv in western Ukraine said Russian missile strikes late on Tuesday had damaged electricity and water networks in his city near the Polish border, across which flow Western arms supplies for Ukraine\u2019s military.\n\nThe governor of the eastern Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said two civilians had been killed and two wounded in the past 24 hours, adding that Russian forces had shelled residential areas 34 times. Russia denies targeting civilians.\n\n\u201cThere are no safe cities in Luhansk region,\u201d he said on the Telegram messaging service.\n\nUkraine remains defiant despite the unrelenting assault.\n\n\u201cRussia struggles to advance and suffers terrible losses. Thus the desperate missile terror across Ukraine. But we are not afraid and the world should not be afraid either,\u201d Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cMore sanctions on Russia. More heavy weapons for Ukraine. Russia\u2019s missile terrorism must be punished.\u201d",

          "text": "North Korea fired a ballistic missile Wednesday, Seoul said, a week after Kim Jong Un vowed to boost Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear arsenal and just days before the South inaugurates a new, hawkish president.\n\nPyongyang has conducted 14 weapons tests since January, including firing an intercontinental ballistic missile at full range for the first time since 2017.\n\nLast week Kim oversaw a huge military parade, vowed to rapidly expand and improve his nuclear arsenal, and warned of possible \u201cpre-emptive\u201d strikes \u2014 as satellite imagery indicates he may soon resume nuclear testing.\n\nThe Wednesday test comes days before the May 10 inauguration of South Korea\u2019s President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol, who has vowed to take a hard line with North Korea and ramp up security cooperation with the US after years of failed diplomacy.\n\nNorth Korea fired the ballistic missile at 12:03 pm (0303 GMT), Seoul\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said, likely from the Sunan Airfield near Pyongyang, the site of previous recent ICBM tests.\n\nThe missile flew 470 km (300 miles) and reached an altitude of 780 km, the JCS said, adding it was a \u201cblatant violation of UN Security Council resolutions.\u201d\n\nJapan\u2019s state minister of defence Makoto Oniki confirmed the launch and the missile\u2019s trajectory, saying it had landed \u201coutside of Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s \u201crepeated launches of ballistic missiles threaten peace and safety of our nation, the region, and the international community,\u201d he added.\n\nSeoul\u2019s national security council said it \u201cstrongly\u201d condemned the launch, urging the North to \u201ccease actions that pose a serious threat to the Korean Peninsula\u201d and to return to dialogue.\n\nSince high-level diplomacy with then-US president Donald Trump collapsed, North Korea has doubled-down on Kim\u2019s plans for military modernisation, seemingly impervious to threats of more sanctions as it ignores the United States offers of talks.\n\nKim Jong Un said at last week\u2019s military parade that he would take measures to develop \u201cthe nuclear forces of our state at the fastest possible speed\u201d, according to footage of his speech broadcast on state media.\n\nRepeated negotiations aimed at convincing Kim to give up his nuclear weapons have come to nothing.\n\n\u201cThere is a good chance that they test-fired a missile that can be equipped with a nuclear warhead,\u201d Ahn Chan-il, a North Korean studies scholar, told AFP Wednesday.\n\nKim also warned that he could \u201cpre-emptively\u201d use his nuclear force to counter so-called hostile forces at a meeting with top military brass last week.\n\nAnalysts said Kim\u2019s message on his nuclear weapons, plus the recent test, could be seen as a signal to President-elect Yoon, who has threatened a pre-emptive strike on Pyongyang.\n\n\u201cIt could be a warning message to\u2026 Yoon,\u201d said Hong Min of the Korea Institute for National Unification.\n\nYoon has suggested he is only willing to talk about peace if North Korea confirms it is willing to denuclearise \u2014 something Pyongyang will never accept, Hong said.\n\n\u201cIt could also signal Pyongyang\u2019s stance that it has no choice but to further enhance its arsenal if Seoul and Washington decided to deploy strategic military assets to the South,\u201d he added.\n\nFor five years under President Moon Jae-in, Seoul has pursued a policy of engagement with Pyongyang, brokering high-level summits between Kim and Trump while reducing joint US military drills the North sees as provocative.\n\nBut for President-elect Yoon this \u201csubservient\u201d approach has been a manifest failure.\n\nHe said on the campaign trail he would like more US missile defences \u2014 and even tactical nuclear weapons \u2014 deployed in South Korea and has vowed to ramp up joint military exercises, which infuriate Pyongyang.\n\nUS President Joe Biden is due to visit South Korea later this month to meet with Yoon.\n\nOther analysts said that North Korea\u2019s testing blitz could be aimed at taking advantage of gridlock at the United Nations following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIt is \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d for the Security Council to sanction North Korea \u2014 which has supported Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine \u2014 due to Moscow\u2019s veto power, said Cheong Seong-chang of the Center for North Korea Studies at the Sejong Institute.\n\n\u201cThe North therefore will try to test as many missiles as possible that it has not been able to do so far, enabling it to enhance capabilities of its arsenal at a fast pace.\u201d",
