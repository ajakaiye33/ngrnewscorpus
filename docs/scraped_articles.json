These services are under the supervision of the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy but currently listed under the transportation sector in the GDP Report.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Minister attributes the consistent positive performance of the ICT sector to the focused and committed support for the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, for the Digital Economy sector.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Federal Government has provided an enabling environment for the ICT sector to thrive, through the development and implementation of relevant policies.

          "text": "The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) on Monday said it has busted a notorious child trafficking syndicate in the Federal Capital Territory and arrested a suspect.\n\nThe agency said this in a statement issued by the head of its Press and Public Relations Unit, Mrs Stella Nezan, on Monday.\n\nNezan also explained that the operatives of the agency were able to rescue four children from one Mrs Blessing-Nnena Eze, suspected to have stolen the children.\n\nNAPTIP said the development represented a major feat in the agency\u2019s determination to curtail the incidence of child trafficking, especially within the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nIt said the agency had also commenced a manhunt for one suspect named \u201cMama Chioma\u201d from Enugu, in Enugu State, said to be in possession of another group of four trafficked children.\n\nAccording to the NAPTIP, Mama Chioma is suspected to be the major supplier that specialises in bringing the children and distributing them to other members of the gang.\n\nAll the suspects were said to be engaged in trafficking of children aged six months to one year from different parts of the country to Abuja, and using them to solicit alms from unsuspecting members of the public.\n\n\u201cThe arrest of Eze, the suspect, followed a tip-off from a media partner who alerted the agency of the activities of the suspect, especially around the popular AYA busy bus terminal, Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe Director General of NAPTIP, Mrs Imaan Sulaiman-Ibrahim, has ordered an improved surveillance in the notable spots, especially within the Federal Capital Territory and its environs,\u201d\n\nShe added that all members of the syndicate would surely be fished out and made to face the wrath of the law.\n\n\u201cThis is a wicked act that must be condemned by all. These innocent children are exposed to harsh weather conditions by the traffickers who shade them like wares by the roadside soliciting for money for selfish desires.\n\n\u201cWe shall surely fish out the fleeing members of the syndicate and they shall face the full wrath of the law,\u201d Sulaiman-Ibrahim said.\n\nThe NAPTIP boss further called on parents to keep an eye on their children in order to prevent them from being trafficked.",

But the solutions we seek cannot be realized by the force of arms and violence.\n\n\u201cI am conscious of the disconnect between the political elite and the masses, including disenfranchised and unemployed youths. Yet the questions confronting the South-East calls for dialogue.\n\n\u201cShould we continue to speak and act in manners that further deplete that badly-damaged trust, then the South-East could be in for a serious decline as the loss of confidence, resort-to-arms and self-help will only prove destructive.\u201d\n\nThe former Board Chairman, Federal Housing Authority (FHA) argued that the shoot order falls short of global acceptable policing standards.\n\nShe said the Police and Nigerian military, in a bid to restore normalcy, must resort to high-handed and extra-judicial engagements.\n\n\u201cNigeria has gone through this before. The essence of having the hindsight early days of Boko Haram offers is to better instruct today\u2019s policymakers on options that work and those that don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThere are several stressors and contributors to the problems at hand. Addressing them will require placing all the cards on the table. We can\u2019t simply shoot our way out of situations like this.\u201d\n\nOnyemelukwe, however, expressed her condolences to the families of the late Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen.

          "text": "By Sanni Onogu, Abuja\n\nThere is no allocation for Constitution Review in the 2021 budget, The Nation has learnt\n\nChairman, Senate Ad-hoc Committee on the Review the 1999 Constitution, Ovie Omo-Agege, disclosed at a briefing in Abuja, on Monday.\n\nOmo-Agege the situation notwithstanding, the committee has sufficient funds to carry out the exercise, saying it was still operating its 2020 budget.\n\nHe expressed optimism that funds would be voted for the exercise in the supplementary budget expected to be transmitted to the National Assembly in no distant time.\n\nThe Committee has scheduled zonal public hearing in 12 states across the six geopolitical zones to commence on Wednesday this week.\n\nHe insisted that the Bills to be collated from the public hearings will be voted on and passed by the Senate in July 2021 before the lawmakers embark on their annual vacation.\n\nOn whether paucity of funds has been responsible for the slow pace of work by the Committee and how the situation may likely affect the target of the panel to deliver on its mandate before the July recess for members of the National Assembly, Omo-Agege said the committee does not lack funds.\n\n\u201cIn 2021 budget, we have not received an appropriation yet due to some oversight so we are still working on the 2020 budget and we are hoping that during the supplementary exercise we will be accommodated\n\n\u201cI can tell you categorically that we have no challenge with paucity of funds. I was actually answering a question as to how much was appropriated (for the review exercise) in 2021. The answer again is that there was no appropriation for 2021.\n\n\u201cWe are still awaiting the supplementary budget. So we are operating the 2020 budget but we have enough for our work.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe have not been hampered in any way and we believe we have enough resources to carry out this exercise.\n\n\u201cWhether or not we are taking a vote this July, as I believe, we will. It is not a function of how much money we have,\u201d Omo-Agege said.\n\nHe added: \u201cYou must understand, this is not the only committee in Senate but it is the largest committee.\n\n\u201cI think the membership spans about 68 members. Taking that into account we have to accommodate the other committees and their assignments as well so as not to pull everybody away.\u201d\n\nOn whether comments recently credited to Senate President Ahmad Lawan on calls for restructuring will not influence the views of the Committee in the aspect of restructuring, Omo-Agege said: \u201cConstitution review is a major plank of the 9th Senate\u2019s Legislative Agenda and I can assure you that Senator Ahmad Lawan is not against anything, he is not against restructuring.\n\n\u201cRestructuring is just one aspect of several aspects of this Constitution review and it also depends on what you mean by restructuring and who is speaking to that.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that the Senate President has not taken any position, he is entitled to his views like any of us.\n\n\u201cHe is in support of what I am doing and you can take this to the bank that we will have an exercise that the Nigerian people will be glad.\u201d\n\nOn whether the current review exercise will not end up like past \u2018jamborees\u2019, Omo-Agege expressed optimism that President Buhari will assent to the Bills when they are transmitted.\n\n\u201cThe exercise is not a jamboree, it will be incremental. By the time we succeed in this exercise, God willing, it will be the 5th alteration,\n\n\u201cWe borrowed our system from the United states, even the US continues to amend their constitution and I think the last time I checked it was about 27 amendments.\n\n\u201cWhat that tells you is that from the outset the framers of our constitution knew they were not giving a perfect document.\n\n\u201cNobody ever has a perfect document, that is why they still do incremental amendment and that at some points, they will be near perfection.\n\n\u201cSection 9 of our Constitution also anticipated that a time will come where there will be several agitations questioning some issues in the constitution and how we should address that.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we have assembled the best brains to do this job and have provided the only mode for the alterations of the Constitution. All they provided for is incremental alterations.\u201d",

          "text": "By Lukman Olabiyi, Lagos\n\nLagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and his Ogun State counterpart, Governor Dapo Abiodun have, signed a Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) and inaugurated a commission to fast-track development in the borderline of the two states.\n\nThe signing of MoU by two governors for the purpose and inauguration of the commission was done at an elaborate event held at the Presidential Lodge, Ogun State.\n\nThe event was also attended by top government functionaries from the two states, traditional rulers and All Progressive Congress (APC) chieftains.\n\nThe commission is saddled with the responsibility of seeing to the development of infrastructure in border towns between the two states.\n\nAccording to Sanwo-Olu, the megacity status of Lagos State necessitated the need for synergy between Lagos and neighbouring Ogun in the area of development.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nAccording to him, \u2018Lagos, as a megacity with a population of over 22 million people reaffirms the need for greater synergy with other states especially our immediate neighbors for sustainable socio economic development.\n\n\u2018Our commitment to ensuring that Lagos becomes a 21st century economy makes it imperative for us to strategically collaborate with our closest neighbor, Ogun State, for the joint development of our states, the continued growth of our cities and the co-creation of value that encompasses good governance and urban regeneration,\u2019 Sanwo-Olu said.\n\nThe governor described the MOU as \u2018a game changer that will transform the urban agglomeration that Lagos State has become.\n\n\u2018We are driven by the desire to stimulate socio-economic growth, bridge development gaps and ensure that Lagos State\u2019s megacity status is complemented by pervasive infrastructural development even in boundary towns.\n\nThe MoU precedes the joint development commission that will be established to mutually tackle some of the issues prevalent in key economic sectors like: transportation, the environment, housing, health, infrastructure, among others.\n\nAs a way of realising the objectives of the commission, Sanwo-Olu said \u2018the two states will combine resources to develop border towns as well as ensure security of the two states.\n\nIn his address, Abiodun stated: \u2018Indeed, I congratulate all of us that are witnesses to the full operationalization of this joint success story of the Lagos-Ogun Joint Development Commission that we are inaugurating today, this is the obvious resolve and the deliberate and methodical efforts of two forward thinking Governors.\n\n\u2018I called this bilateral event a success story because whereas in the past, there might have been some initiatives between our two States but this is the first time that we will have a formal, structured framework of bilateral engagement that will be legislative backed.\n\n\u2018Yes, it is undeniable that we share historical and cultural affinities and long before now, successive administrations have mouthed and attempted to have some omnibus or spatial arrangement to have Lagos and Ogun States to work together.\n\n\u2018But, again, never had there been a time that this was concertized or encoded nor a law-backed structure, institutional arrangement; human and funding resource requirements formalized to actualize what and remains the right way to uplift our people improve their prosperity.\n\n\u2018So, what we are signing today, is a historic Memorandum of Understanding that takes cognizance of what had been envisioned, leading to the establishment of the Prof. Akin Mabogunje\u2019s Committee on Redeployment of Lagos Megacity Region Plan in 2005-6.\n\n\u2018Between the two of us \u2013 my brother governor and I \u2013 it is a mission accomplished and dream come true to put into action the thought about our two States forging a common alliance to jointly tackle issues bordering on security, sanitation, traffic and transportation, waste management, water supply, land use planning, infrastructure development and maintenance, urban renewal and slum upgrading for the mutual benefit of our people and the generality of Nigerians.\n\n\u2018All these development imperatives have to be streamlined for us to be serious and focused. Law is not just a mere tool for development, this Joint Development Commission will function better to sustain these common goals and there is no better time than now to deepen not only the relationship between our two states but within any contiguous states in the country.\n\n\u2018What is more, this MoU we are signing is a culmination of various efforts by state and non-state actors who have seen beyond the geographical delineation of our states. Already a number of state-owned institutions like the Nigeria Police, Nigerian Customs Service and others have always recognized the twin or Siamese relationship between our two Ssates and have always grouped Lagos and Ogun as one zone under their respective high commands.\n\n\u2018We are cognisant of the fact that Ogun State is the only neighbour that Lagos has and that we are a natural overflow of Lagos. There is no how development in Lagos would not have a spiral effect or vice versa.\n\n\u2018Ogun and Lagos States are like two rivers flowing onto each other. It is very difficult to identify which of the rivers is actually flowing onto the other. That is, at our various border communities, there is no actual way of separating the peoples living in the two states of Lagos and Ogun.\n\n\u2018Whichever way we look at it, Ogun State has a larger percentage of the population over-spill into Lagos State as witnessed in many of our border communities in Ota; Akute Alagboole; Lambe; Ojodu; Agbado; Mowe; Warewa; Isheri and indeed all the eight Local Government Areas that share boundaries with Lagos State.\n\n\u2018In actual fact, what concerns our people, particularly from the two States, is to make a living and increase their individual prosperity.This MoU is therefore a manifestation of the common dream that the Nation\u2019s largest economy and the nation\u2019s industrial capital are forging because both are deliberate, focused and methodical to governance.\n\n\u2018Again, I must thank my brother governor, His Excellency Babajide Sanwo-Olu for his own cooperation, enthusiasm and support for this initiative.\n\n\u2018Before now, together, we had jointly written, formally to President Muhammadu Buhari to release the Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta and the Ikorodu-Sagamu Roads for us to jointly reconstruct. Another manifestation of our working together is the Adiyan Water Works that, though, is in Ogun State, supplying water to the people of Lagos State. And will also be supplying water to Ogun State.\u2019",

Still, given the pressing urgency of addressing the perennial challenges, the federal funding for the project that has been delayed is now being partly unlocked.

He said, \u201cOn Sunday 23/05/2021 at about 2000hrs, the Command received a distress call that yet to be identified gunmen came out suddenly from a nearby bush, invaded Dong Village, Jos South LGA and killed seven persons.\n\n\u201cA combined team of Policemen, Special Task Force, Vigilante operatives led by a Deputy Commissioner of Police, Department of Operation, raced swiftly to the scene but the hoodlums had already fled back into the bush.\n\n\u201cInvestigation is ongoing, frantic effort is on to arrest the fleeing suspects. Meanwhile, Security has been beefed up in that area to prevent escalation of violence.\u201d\n\nThose killed in Dong community are Chiyena Oboche, Divine Oboche, Victoria Matthew, Praise Matthew, Danladi Matthew, Mr. Gospel, and Mr. Istifanus.\n\nLamenting the attacks, the Senator representing Plateau North in the National Assembly, Istifanus Gyang, said in a statement that it was disheartening that, \u201cShortly after the Inspector General of Police issued a security alert on likely terror attacks on Jos and the FCT, the blood merchants have visited terror on Dong community, adjacent Wild Life Park, Jos and Kwi village, adjacent Yakubu Gowon Airport Jos where a total of 14 persons were butchered to dead, including children.\u201d\n\nCondemning the attacks, the Senator revealed that \u201cavailable information indicates that some persons at a meeting with the Police the week preceding the attacks vowed to visit mayhem on helpless communities. It is therefore incumbent on the Plateau State Police Commissioner to arrest and prosecute those very persons forthwith.\u201d\n\nHe also called for decisive action against persons that are known to security agencies for the serial killings, displacemment and forceful occupation of ancestral homelands of communities in Plateau North.

          "text": "Ethiopia has awarded one out of the two private telco licences it intends to award to a consortium that includes the Vodafone group. The consortium, which made a winning bid of $850 million, comprises Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc and Sumitomo Corp.\n\nThe licence award is a big step for Ethiopia as it marks the opening of its telecom sector to foreign investors. For years, the state-owned Ethiotel has held a monopoly but will now have competition.\n\nBeyond competition, it will have a significant economic impact, considering that the consortium will create 1.1 million jobs and invest $8.5 billion in the next ten years. According to a tweet by the country\u2019s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, \u201cit will be the single largest foreign direct investment into Ethiopia to date.\u201d\n\nThe country also announced that it would not grant a second telecoms licence after rejecting a second bid from MTN.\n\nMTN\u2019s bid is not good enough\n\nThe prospect of a market with 112 million people is as good as it gets for many telcos, so it wasn\u2019t surprising that all the big names initially planned to make bids. Etisalat, Orange Telecoms, MTN and Saudi Telecom Company were some of the companies that registered interest.\n\nIn the end, only two companies put bids forward; the Vodafone consortium and MTN. Safaricom, one of the consortium companies, had announced prematurely in March that it had won the bid.\n\nRegardless, MTN also made a bid of $600 million which was considered not good enough, and now the second telecoms licence will now be retendered for new offers.\n\nOne interesting point is that MTN\u2019s bid was financed in part by a Chinese investor, while a newly created US foreign-aid agency backed the Vodafone consortium\u2019s bid. It is a continuation of what some observers call a competition on the tech front in Africa.\n\nA similar situation played out in Kenya as Safaricom rolled out its 5G service initially with Huawei providing support. The US reportedly had concerns with the decision to use Huawei, in line with a strategy of using its diplomatic might to dissuade African governments from buying into the technology solutions from the Chinese company.\n\nIn the end, Safaricom stuck with Huawei but also included the Finnish company, Nokia. Despite this, it is clear that this is not the last we\u2019ll see of the continuing competition between the US and China in Africa\u2019s tech space.",

          "text": "It takes a great team to build an equally great product. Centre Stage exists to tell the behind-the-scenes stories of the people building brilliant products and services in Africa.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Tobi Lufadeju to Centre Stage because I admire how determined she is to succeed in her role and how invested she is in her personal and professional development. Even when she has moments where she feels like a small fish in a big sea, she doesn\u2019t allow her youthful insecurities to slow her down or get in the way of her responsibilities.\n\nTwo weeks after my meeting with Feranmi, I\u2019m back at Eric Keyser to meet with a very nervous but confident Tobi Lufadeju who is a young product manager at Reliance HMO.\n\nWhat were you doing in your early 20s?\n\nI was wrapping up my MFA (Master of Fine Arts) in English literature and overthinking my future and career path.\n\nAt Reliance, Tobi is in charge of the consumer business unit.\n\n\u201cThe consumer business unit is basically the retail side of the business. But I don\u2019t just handle retail products \u2013 I also handle products for SMEs and our partners.\u201d\n\nCuriousity is a product manager\u2019s super power\n\nTobi describes herself as a curious person, so I had to ask how curiosity plays a role in her work:\n\n\u201cProduct management is the intersection of business, technology and design. Successful product managers need to learn a little bit about each of them because we do a lot of directing in our work. In my role, I have an overview of what everyone is working on \u2013 from the frontend engineers to the DevOps team.\u201d\n\nWhen Tobi uses the word \u2018directing\u2019, I immediately picture a sharp-minded captain steering a large ship in open waters. The captain is responsible for not only the ship but her diverse team of crew members and cabin hands. Should aspiring product managers expect to manage diverse teams? This is what Tobi had to say:\n\n\u201cYes, they absolutely should have that expectation. As the product manager, you are the product\u2019s encyclopedia; so if the head of marketing needs information about the product, you have to know enough to give an appropriate answer. Being a curious person helps me learn as much as I possibly can about what we are building.\u201d\n\nWhen you picture product managers, what do you see them doing? Crunching numbers? Creating colourless spreadsheets? Tracking the lifespan of a product? Counting app downloads? What does their day-to-day work life look like for Tobi?\n\n\u201cI prioritize the work we are doing at all times and carve out time to do the work. I collaborate with different people and communicate our products\u2019 progress reports so everyone on the team knows what they need to do. I also make out time to speak to my direct supervisor \u2013 the business lead \u2013 and realign myself with our goals and plans for the quarter.\u201d\n\nWinning the battle over Impostor Syndrome\n\nProduct managers not only have to speak their product\u2019s language, but they also have to speak their team\u2019s language. How then do successful product managers navigate team management?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a common myth that product managers are micromanagers; this isn\u2019t the case with me,\u201d Tobi said in-between bites of her chicken sandwich.\n\n\u201cAlthough I operate as a kind of middle man, I don\u2019t meddle with the work. I trust my team to do what they are skilled at and leave them to run on their own. I also remember to connect with them as human beings. Yeah, I have to meet my deliverables but I have to support my team as well.\u201d\n\nThere are an estimated 64 million young people aged between 15 \u2013 35 years old living in Nigeria. It\u2019s obvious that our youth population is increasing rapidly with no plans of slowing down. But how prepared are they to enter local and global workplaces? How do young managers deal with issues such as impostor syndrome?\n\n\u201cThe first two months on the job were not easy. I joined an existing team which meant that I had to do a lot of learning and observation in the beginning. My team members would throw around in-house language during meetings and I also had to figure out how to speak the engineering team\u2019s language. I dealt with impostor syndrome big time.\u201d\n\nWhen you get hired by a new company, you have to make your first 100 days count. But being the newbie hire can be a daunting experience. How can new employees quieten the insecure voices in their heads and trust their abilities and skills?\n\n\u201cEven though the learning curve was steep in the beginning, I had to figure it out. I couldn\u2019t afford to fail because that\u2019s my name on the line. So whenever I felt confused after a meeting, I would call one of my team members back and ask questions. I still have moments where I\u2019m confused about certain things but I\u2019ve been given the leeway to experiment and try different tactics.\u201d\n\nCentre Stage tip: When in doubt or confused, ask questions.\n\nTips and tricks for aspiring and existing product managers\n\nEarlier in our conversation, Tobi mentions how important it is to be curious on the job. I asked her what other skills she believes aspiring product managers need to be excellent in their roles?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll start with effective communication. You can\u2019t just tell people what to do, you have to help them understand what needs to be done, why it needs to be done, and who needs to do it. If you cannot communicate clearly, you will not get the results you desire.\n\nPrioritisation is the second skill. Successful product managers must own the product and visualize the bigger picture at all times. When you have the bigger picture in your mind, it\u2019s easier to assign priority levels to different tasks.\n\nFinally, you need interpersonal skills. Although my team members don\u2019t directly report to me, I still have to learn how to speak to them with respect and empathy. When we have long weeks, I ensure I check in on the engineers because, at the end of the day, we are humans and need breaks from time to time.\n\nProduct managers need to learn how to give praise and encouragement, especially when they notice their team members are stressed or when their energy tanks are empty.\u201d\n\nTobi\u2019s role at Reliance HMO is her first stab at being a product manager. In addition to learning on the job, she\u2019s also had to invest her personal time in picking up new knowledge about her responsibilities and that of her team. So, what is she doing to improve her skills?\n\n\u201cPractice. I consciously track what I\u2019m doing and how I\u2019m doing my work. I make out time to reflect on my progress regularly. I follow product leaders and managers on LinkedIn\u2013 I read their articles and make note of the tips they share. I also use Blinkst to read books at an accelerated pace. At one point, I had access to Masterclass, I took some business and product-focused courses. My business lead also sends me resources like podcasts and articles.\u201d\n\nWhere your professional career is concerned, one thing you never stop doing is learning. Tobi is ambitious about being successful in her role and isn\u2019t afraid to do what it takes to achieve her definition of success. My key takeaway from my conversation with Tobi is that managers, no matter how young or experienced they are, must be courageous, curious, and competent.\n\n\u201cIf I had to share any tip with aspiring product managers, I would recommend researching what goes into being a product manager and taking one or two courses about what tools you need to use and what to do on the job. If you are on social media, follow conversational product leaders and engage with them on Twitter or LinkedIn. There\u2019s a lot to learn at once and the work hit me like a wrecking ball in the beginning.\n\nMeasure as objectively as you can. You cannot fit everything into an OKR or KPI framework. Sometimes, you have to use your intuition to measure yourself and how well you are succeeding as a manager and team member. How are you handling your team? Are you driven by impact or are you working for the sake of it? If you are focused on making an impact, you will always deliver value to the business.\u201d",
          "summary": "Successful product managers need to learn a little bit about each of them because we do a lot of directing in our work.\nShould aspiring product managers expect to manage diverse teams?\nHow then do successful product managers navigate team management?\nI asked her what other skills she believes aspiring product managers need to be excellent in their roles?\nSuccessful product managers must own the product and visualize the bigger picture at all times.",

          "text": "Nigerian financial data startup Mono has raised a seed round of $2 million from a number of investors including Entr\u00e9e Capital and Lateral Capital.\n\nBabs Ogundeyi, co-founder and CEO of Kuda; Gbenga Oyebode, partner at The Continent Venture Partners; and Eric Idiahi, co-founder and partner at Verod Capital, also invested according to TechCrunch.\n\nMono was founded in 2020 by Abdul Hassan, a former product manager at Paystack, and Prakhar Singh. The company\u2019s technology enables businesses and individuals to gain access to financial information, such as account statements, stored at commercial banks. Mono is one of out a number of startups creating open banking solutions in Nigeria.\n\nThe seed money adds to the $500,000 Mono raised in September 2020 and the $125,000 received as part of the Winter 21 cohort of Y Combinator. Mono was one of 10 African startups to pitch at YC\u2019s Demo Day in March. Abdul Hassan, the startup\u2019s CEO, told TechCabal at the time that YC was an opportunity to make strategic connections.\n\nBut beyond making connections, Mono appears to be expanding its focus beyond financial data.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking of how we can power the internet economy with data that isn\u2019t necessarily financial data,\u201d Hassan said.\n\nOne thing on his mind is \u201copen data for telcos,\u201d a framework that enables customers to easily move their data between mobile network providers.\n\nHassan could not be reached for comment at press time. On the surface, an open data for telcos plan rings close to and could be looking to build on the existing mobile number portability (MNP) service in Nigeria.\n\nLaunched by the Nigeria Communications Commission in April 2013, MNP enables customers to freely switch network providers while retaining their phone numbers. A consortium of three companies (Interconnect Limited, Saab Grinteck and Telecordia) currently acts as the Number Portability Clearing House (NPCH) for the industry.\n\nHassan also told TechCrunch that Mono will be going live in Ghana by June and that they already have five banks and MTN Ghana\u2019s mobile money service as partners.",

          "title": "New FirstBank Website Puts YOU, the customer, First!",
          "text": "Banking has evolved over the years and the industry now abundantly relies on web-based applications for providing services to customers. With more and more people increasingly glued to connected devices, banks that hope to compete in today\u2019s market must focus on digital channels.\n\nOne of the pillars of a digital strategy is having a website that serves as the face of a company on the internet and its first virtual touchpoint. But in the digital age, just rolling out a website with a visual style and design stuck in the 90s does not cut it. Consumers have high expectations when it comes to online experience, so banks must find a way to offer the best digital experience possible. Hence the importance of having a unique site with world-class design and functionality.\n\nIf there\u2019s any bank that understands this so well, it\u2019s First Bank of Nigeria Limited, the West African premier financial inclusion services provider. Established over a century127 years ago, FirstBank continues to evolve, successfully adopting the latest technology and embracing innovation in delivering seamless banking solutions to its customers across the world. The bank recently launched a newly-designed corporate website that fits right in with its quest to be Africa\u2019s bank of first choice \u2013 even when it comes to banking on digital channels.\n\nFrom online banking, loan calculator to customer support, here are some standout features of the new FirstBank website:\n\nDesigned for Banking on the Go\n\nThe new FirstBank website has a simple yet striking and modern design in a fresh, magazine-style look that promotes access to essential information for its customers, FirstMonie agents, prospective agents and the public.\n\nThe site leverages the bank\u2019s brand colors to attract attention to certain areas. FirstBank uses its blue color on the call-to-action buttons, with the backdrop remaining mostly gold. This makes them stand out from the other menu items and brings user attention to where it matters most without overwhelming visitors.\n\nMore importantly, the website is designed from a mobile-first standpoint, which is responsive, considering increased usage of mobile devices compared to desktop computers. With this design, the FirstBank website reformats to fit the screen of whatever device the visitor is using to view it and allows users the flexibility to conduct business wherever they may be.\n\nIntuitive site navigation\n\nWhen people visit their institution\u2019s website, it is not because they are looking for somewhere to spend their extra time. They are often seeking help and want to get to things quickly. FirstBank offers a wide array of financial services for a varied customer base, which can make it difficult to maintain a clean and easily navigated website. But the new platform \u2013 with a simple and clearly labeled navigation \u2013 allows users and potential customers to find exactly what they\u2019re looking for quickly and easily.\n\nOne of the core strengths of the new website is prominent links to top pages. The homepage begins with a prominent header that displays clear visual and clickable options that direct users to the main categories of Personal Banking, Business Banking & Private Banking and features a clear link to FirstBank\u2019s Contact/Customer Service page with alternate ways for visitors to seek help, such as email and phone.\n\nMoving down the homepage provides visitors with easy navigation for common prospect needs, represented with icons and calls to action. On the new website, these include Open Account, Agency Banking, Find a Branch, Loan Calculator, etc. The intuitive and user-friendly upgrade guides customers to make well-informed decisions about their financial needs, whatever they are.\n\nEasy Access to Online Banking\n\nIn the digital age, a bank is less likely to be considered by younger generations if it does not have online banking. And for banks that do offer online banking, they have to make it easy for consumers to find and use. On its new website, FirstBank puts an obvious button to online banking in top navigation so visitors know exactly where to go. The \u2018Online Banking\u2019 login/enrollment call-to-action is placed at the top of every page, easing the digital experience for existing customers.\n\nSeparate Product Pages with Strong Calls-to-Action\n\nThe FirstBank website has unique secondary pages for every product, and clear calls-to-action for people to be able to navigate to those pages. Across all pages, the main image rotates displaying a variety of themes in line with the banking category and each contains easy-to-navigate dropdown menus, with a simple, straightforward, and detailed breakdown of the bank\u2019s products by the problem that they solve for individuals and businesses. From the product pages, a visitor can easily know how to get or sign up for the product or service they are interested in.\n\nOnline Account Opening\n\nA bank can\u2019t be open all day, but its website can be. Knowing that some potential customers do not live by its operating hours, FirstBank offers banking on their terms through the website.\n\nA standout feature of the new website is that it enables online applications and the ability to submit personal information securely. That makes it easy for interested visitors to open an account, offering a clear start to their banking journey.\n\nTools and Content that Empower Customers\n\nEvery user experience begins with a goal in mind and the new FirstBank website empowers its customers by providing a wide array of financial information and tools that meet customers needs, whatever they are. Among many actions, users can perform various transactions \u2013 make payments, transfer money, manage accounts, buy airtime, calculate loan rates and virtually interact with the bank \u2013 without stepping out of their comfort zone.\n\nThe site also serves as a library to keep customers abreast of various financial services solutions and offers intriguing content that is relevant to FirstBank\u2019s varied customer base \u2013 such as how-to guides that educate consumers on better managing their money and making the best financial decisions, thereby helping them to improve their economic and social wellbeing, as well as unique blog articles/insights on enterprise scaling, global trade and navigating the Covid-19 pandemic, targeted at corporate clients.\n\nLocation Finder\n\nOne of the most intriguing features of the new FirstBank website is its Location Finder, where visitors can browse locations of the bank\u2019s branches and Firstmonie Agents. The feature allows users to search based on their radius or address and helps them find the FirstBank branch that\u2019s closest to them and best fits their needs. The branch locator is interactive and integrated with Google Maps API, which makes it easier for the visitor to browse the locations.\n\nOverall, FirstBank gets it right when it comes to usability, understanding its customers\u2019 needs and expectations, and website navigation behavior while creating a beautiful site that employs some of the latest trends in responsive web design, with exceptional user experience and a perfect mix of exciting features.\n\nWith the new FirstBank website, customers are at an edge in the industry as they establish a relationship with the Bank that puts YOU, its customers, First.\n\nYou can visit the new FirstBank website here.",

          "text": "14th May, 2021 \u2013 Lumos, Africa\u2019s leading solar home system provider in conjunction with Modion Communications, a fast-rising PR Agency in Africa, has won the Sabre Award for 2021 for its social PR campaign supporting indigent schoolgirl Fathia Dele Rasheed, from Ondo State, Southwest, Nigeria in February 2020. The African Sabre Award is the continent\u2019s biggest prize for superior achievement in Public Relations and Corporate Social Responsibility.\n\nAs part of the campaign, Lumos Nigeria tracked Dele after a picture of her doing her homework at night with illumination from an ATM facility surfaced on social media. The company installed a free Solar Home System (SHS) in Dele\u2019s home within 48 hours after the social media reveal, enabling constant access to electricity for her and her family, using Lumos\u2019 SHS. The family joins over 100,000 household and small businesses in Nigeria already connected to Lumos.\n\nThe Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) intervention campaign tagged \u2018Touching Lives Through A Determined School Child \u2013 Dele Fathia\u2019 was adjudged as the overall best social campaign in Africa by the Sabre Awards jury, beating other top nominees from leading brands and companies in Kenya, Mauritius, and Uganda.\n\nCommenting on the recognition, the CEO of Lumos Nigeria, Mrs. Adepeju Adebajo, said; \u201cWhen we saw the desire and determination of Dele Fathia to learn even in the face of difficulties and limitation of power supply, we concluded that it was critical for us to take action by providing our easy-to-install solar home system, allowing her and the family to enjoy the endless possibilities that come with constant power supply,\u201d Mrs. Adebajo said.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to see that the campaign has inspired renewed awareness on the adoption of solar power as an affordable alternative to the perennial power supply deficit in Nigeria. We are pleased that this solution has now gone mainstream, with Nigeria\u2019s government committed to providing 5 million Solar Home Systems to 25 million households as part of the country\u2019s quick-win strategy to deliver electricity to more families.\n\n\u201cWe believe everyone has the right to a better quality of life offered by access to clean, affordable and reliable power. Lumos remains committed to powering one home, one business, one community at a time. It is also pleasing to see that we have inspired other players in the ecosystem, who are now willing to provide similar initiatives to indigent families in communities where power supply from the grid is either inadequate or available,\u201d she added.\n\nAt the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Lumos, in collaboration with All-On, installed solar powered systems in isolation centres across the country as well as the installation of Solar home systems to over 147 primary health centers across Nigeria. This was in addition to installing its solar systems at Primary Health Centres across 20 Local Governments in Lagos State to help improve quality healthcare delivery to grassroots communities.\n\nABOUT LUMOS\n\nLumos is a market-leading provider of high-quality solar home systems in Africa, designed to make reliable and clean power accessible to everyone. We combine easy to use technology with personalised service to power prosperity for millions of people. For more information, visit www.lumos.com.ng.",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has approved the rehabilitation of grazing reserves across the country as from June, to curb the bloody clashes between herders and farmers across the country.\n\nA statement by presidential spokesperson, Garba Shehu, announced that other measures are being finetuned to nip the security challenges occasioned by armed herders across the country which have led to the loss of lives.\n\nThis development comes a few days after southern governors banned open grazing in the entire region. The move was criticised as unconstitutional by the nation\u2019s justice minister, Abubakar Malami.\n\nMr Buhari, who also chided the governors for their resolution, in Monday\u2019s statement said \u201che has approved a number of specific measures to bring a permanent end to the frequent skirmishes as recommended by Alhaji Sabo Nanono, the Minister of Agriculture in a report he submitted\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe President signed off on it back in April, well before the actions of the Southern Governors Forum which attempts to place a ban on open grazing and other acts of politicking intended by its signatories to demonstrate their power,\u201d the release added.\n\nRead full statement below:\n\nSTATE HOUSE PRESS RELEASE\n\nPRESIDENT BUHARI OKAYS DEEP ROOTED SOLUTIONS TO HERDSMEN ATTACKS, CLEARS WAY FOR RANCHING AND REVIVAL OF FOREST RESERVES\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has expressed a strong resolve to address the conflicts of herders and farmers in a sustained and lasting manner that should lead to the emergence of a permanent solution to the frequent clashes between them, as well as the associated problem of the gun-wielding \u201ckiller herdsmen.\u201d\n\nThe President had approved a number of specific measures to bring a permanent end to the frequent skirmishes as recommended by Alhaji Sabo Nanono, the Minister of Agriculture in a report he submitted and the President signed off on it back in April, well before the actions of the Southern Governors Forum which attempts to place a ban on open grazing and other acts of politicking intended by its signatories to demonstrate their power.\n\nIt is very clear that there was no solution offered from their resolutions to the herder-farmer clashes that have been continuing in our country for generations.\n\nBut the citizens of the southern states \u2013 indeed citizens of all states of Nigeria \u2013 have a right to expect their elected leaders and representatives to find answers to challenges of governance and rights, and not to wash their hands off hard choices by, instead, issuing bans that say: \u201cnot in my state.\u201d\n\nIt is equally true that their announcement is of questionable legality, given the Constitutional right of all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and freedoms within every one of our 36 states (and FCT) -regardless of the state of their birth or residence.\n\nFortunately, this declaration has been preempted, for whatever it is intended to achieve and Mr. President, who has rightly been worried about these problems more than any other citizen in consultation with farmers and herders alike, commissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the states, starting with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant with stated requirements.\n\nWith veterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families including schooling \u2013 through these rehabilitated reserves, the Federal Government is making far-reaching and practical changes allowing for different communities to co-exist side-by-side: supporting farmers to till their fields, herders to rear their livestock and Nigerians everywhere to be safe.\n\nThe entire country is acutely aware of the strain the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on public finances, for both Federal and States. Still, given the pressing urgency of addressing the perennial challenges, the federal funding for the project that has been delayed is now being partly unlocked. Actual work for the full actualization of the modern reserve system in a few of the consenting states should take off in June.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s electoral body, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has decried repeated attacks on its offices in different states, especially in Southeast, describing it as a national emergency.\n\nINEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, who said this in a statement after an emergency session today, hours after its office in Igboeze South Local Government Area of Enugu State was razed, regretted that attacks on its offices have continued unabated.\n\n\u201cThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) met in emergency session today, Monday 24th May 2021, as attacks on its facilities in some states of the Federation continue unabated,\u201d Okoye said.\n\n\u201cIn the latest incidents, three offices of the Commission came under attack in Anambra, Imo and Enugu States. The Resident Electoral Commissioners (REC) for Anambra State, Dr. Nkwachukwu Orji; his Imo State counterpart, Professor Francis Ezeonu, and that of Enugu State, Emeka Ononamadu, have reported that the attacks took place at various times on the night of Sunday, 23rd May 2021.\u201d\n\nThe electoral body said attack on its headquarters in Anambra State is a major blow to the preparation for the governorship election scheduled for November 6 in the state.\n\n\u201cThe State Headquarters office in Awka was set ablaze in the most devastating onslaught on the Commission\u2019s facilities so far.\n\n\u201cThe attackers were systematic and selective in their targets. The Pavillion which serves as Collation Centre during major elections was burnt down. In what is a major blow to our preparations for the Governorship election scheduled for 6th November 2021, two stores housing electoral materials were burnt down,\u201d the statement noted.\n\n\u201cNew and old (but serviceable) electric generating machines numbering 376 for all the Electoral Wards and the extra numbers for backup were completely burnt. The electric generators were recently relocated from the Local Government Area (LGAS) to the HQ in the belief that it is more secure than the LGA offices.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, as part of the Commission\u2019s proactive measures to ensure the success of the Governorship election later this year, about 50% of the non-sensitive materials required for the November 6, 20201 Governorship election already delivered to the State have also been lost in the fire. In addition, seven utility vehicles (Toyota Hilux) were burnt.\n\n\u201cIt will be recalled that following the fire incident on the eve of the 2019 General Election in which the Smart Card Readers for the State were destroyed, the Commission moved the replacement Smart Card Readers from the shipping containers to the concrete store for enhanced protection. Fortunately, the Smart Card Readers were not affected.\n\n\u201cAlso yesterday, our office in Ahiazu Mbaise Local Government Area was attacked at about 6.45pm in an obvious attempt to set the building ablaze. Fortunately, the damage was limited to a section of the building, specifically the windows and part of the roof. No electoral materials or office equipment were destroyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt about 1.00pm yesterday, our Igboeze South LGA office was attacked. The store was completely burnt down before the Neighborhood Watch and the Enugu State Fire Service responded and prevented the inferno from razing other parts of the building.\n\n\u201cThis is the third attack on INEC facilities in the State in less than two weeks following the destruction of our Udenu LGA office on 13th May 2021 and the State Headquarters building in Enugu on 16th May 2021.\n\n\u201cAll three incidents in Anambra, Imo and Enugu have been reported to the Police for investigation.\n\n\u201cAlthough no lives were lost, these are clearly orchestrated and targeted attacks aimed at incapacitating the Commission in conducting electoral activities, especially in Anambra State.\n\n\u201cThe attacks on the Commission\u2019s facilities have now become a national emergency. Accordingly, the Commission will brief the Government and stakeholders on these incidents.\n\n\u201cIn spite of these setbacks, the Commission is determined to continue to discharge its responsibilities including the conduct of the scheduled Anambra Governorship election,\u201d the statement concluded.",

          "text": "By Laolu Ayoola, Bayo Obajemu, Emeka Ejere and Obinna Ezugwu\n\nThese technocrats, business leaders and politicians differed in orientation, status, personality and background, but they are currently playing a big part in building a new Nigeria.\n\nBefore their individual interventions, the nation has had a challenge of infrastructural development, despite it having a population of over 200 million and abundant natural resources, including miles of arable land, huge deposits of minerals, crude oil and natural gas reserves, as well as an estimated GDP of over $442.976 billion (2020).\n\nFrom Ikeja, to Port Harcourt, Owerri, Aba, Enugu, Kano, Kaduna, Ibadan, Calabar and many other Nigerian cities and towns, the landscape was littered with hundreds of failed infrastructural projects.\n\nVital utilities like power plants, transmission grids, hospitals, roads, railway lines, schools, seaports and airports that would have spurred economic and social growth were virtually decayed and needed repair or total replacement.\n\nKnowing fully well that infrastructural development is crucial to Nigeria\u2019s economic growth, particularly for the realization of the federal government\u2019s economic diversification agenda, these individuals set out to work.\n\nWith a view to stem the tide, the gladiators set about the task of bridging the infrastructure deficit. And in a spate of six years, the nation has become a huge construction site.\n\nThe hitherto epileptic and weak power infrastructure is today up and running, derelict and out of commissioned hospitals and schools are now wearing new look, many unmotorable and treacherous highways are now paved and pleasurable to drive on, abandoned and unserviceable railway lines have been restored, and are now conveying Nigerians to their desired destinations, while bridges that connect cities and towns, particularly the 2nd Niger Bridge are daily sprouting up to the admiration of many Nigerians.\n\nThe faces behind these transformations are not angels, but mortal beings. They are not expatriates but fellow Nigerians who have largely succeeded where others failed.\n\nIn this special edition, Business Hallmark is unveiling the faces behind the masks. The list of Champions of infrastructure in no particular order is made of former Governor of Rivers State and incumbent Minister of Transportation, RT. Hon. Rotimi Amaechi; Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, Group Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer of Access Bank Plc, Herbert Wigwe, Minister of Works, Babatunde Fashola (SAN), Minister of Aviation, Sen. Hadi Sirika and the Executive Vice Chairman, Nigerian Communications Commission ((NCC), Professor Umar Danbatta.\n\nAlso on the list are Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State and Governor Dave Umahi, of Ebonyi State\n\nWithout their selfless commitments and efforts, there might not have been a remarkable improvement in infrastructure development, with the nation waiting for yet another season of redemption.\n\nBOSS MUSTAPHA: An efficient and effective organiser\n\nIt is said that difficult situations and circumstances do bring out the best in men. This indeed has been the lot of His Excellency, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Gida Mustapha, Esq.\n\nSoft-spoken and unassuming, but indeed most cerebral and professional, when the incidence of COVID-19 broke out and the Federal Government had to set up a team to plot, streamline and execute the Nigerian Governments response to the crisis, it was this man of steel and candour that the onus now rested to coordinate the effort. And it is testimony to his solid sense of leadership and commitment that he has been able to most successfully lead the team on to achieving the quite impressive records that have been seen this far.\n\nMustapha earned his Bachelor of Law (LLB) from the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria in 1979 and was called to bar in 1980. After his National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) programme at the Directorate of Legal Services in the Army Headquarters, his work life has seen him at Sotesa Nigeria Limited, an Italian consultancy firm, where he was Executive Director, Administration, Counsel in the prestigious law firm Messrs Onagoruwa & Co and Principal Counsel in the firm Messrs Mustapha & Associates. He has served as Social Secretary and Chairman at the Yola Branch of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), and later as a member of the National Executive Committee. He has also been a member of the Body of Benchers and member of the Committee on the Reform of the Judiciary in the defunct Gongola State.\n\nIn the public arena, he served as an Executive Member of the Interim Management Committee (IMC) of the defunct Petroleum (Special) Trust Fund (PTF), from 2000 to 2007, and was thereafter appointed Principal Partner of the law firm, Adroit Lex & Co.\n\nOn the political turf, Mustapha has actively contributed towards the growth of our democracy and democratic institutions. He was a member of the Constituent Assembly in 1988 and the 2005 National Political Reform Conference. He has been State Chairman, Peoples Solidarity Party and Social Democratic Party in Gongola State and gubernatorial candidate for SDP in Adamawa State in 1991. He was Deputy National Chairman of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), Founding member of the All Progressive Congress (APC) and member, APC Board of Trustees.\n\nIn June 2016, President Muhammadu Buhari appointed him Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA). In nine months of his appointment, he led NIWA to generate three times the revenue it usually generates in one year. It was from here that he was appointed as the Secretary to the Government of the Federation.\n\nMinister of Transport, RT. HON. ROTIMi CHIBUIKE AMAECHI: Silent political actor with great influence\n\nWithin six years of assuming office as minister in November 2015, Minister of Transportation of the Republic of Nigeria, RT. Hon. Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi, has emerged one of the most colourful and energetic public office holders in the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nBorn on 27 May 1965 in Ubima, Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State to the family of the late Elder Fidelis Amaechi and Mary Amaechi, Mr. Amaechi has been an active politician for more than three decades, serving as Rivers State governor from 2007-2014, and holding a number of government positions in different offices, including Secretary of the National Republican Convention (NRC) in Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State from 1992 to 1994 and Rivers State\u2019s Secretary of the Democratic Party of Nigeria (DPN) caretaker committee in 1996;\n\nHe was Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly from 1999 to 2003 and the Chairman of Nigeria\u2019s Conference of Speakers of State Assemblies for two terms. He was also Chairman of Nigerian Governors Forum from 2011-2015.\n\nAs Rivers State Governor, Mr. Amaechi executed infrastructure projects like construction of roads, hospitals, schools and modernization of transportation services.\n\nAmong the projects is the iconic monorail project which was developed to provide mass transportation within Port Harcourt, as well as power plant projects at Afam, Trans Amadi, and Onne to improve the states power supply. Impressed by these strides, grateful Rivers people nicknamed him \u2018Mr. Infrastructure\u2019.\n\nIt was therefore not a surprise when President Buhari gave him the transportation portfolio in 2015 and 2019 to drive his grand and ambitious infrastructure development agenda, a task he set out to undertake with zeal and vigour.\n\nUnder his watch, the 156 kilometre LagosIbadan corridor of the Lagos-Kano standard gauge project was recently completed and already in use. Also, the 1435mm gauge North-South railway linking Itakpe, Ajaokuta and Warri has been formally opened for commercial operation, following its inauguration by the president in 2020.\n\nAs part of the wider vision, Mr. Amaechi has secured cabinet approval to start work on new lines linking Port Harcourt with Maiduguri.\n\nIn recognition of his numerous achievements, he has won several awards, including the Blueprint Newspapers Award for his contribution to the rail development and building of the first monorail system in Sub-Sahara Africa 2018; Polo Stallion Star Awards for his revolutionary approach in the transportation sector of Nigeria 2019; Ministerial Award for Mass Transportation Infrastructure Development at the National Tourism Transport Summit and Expo 2019 and National honour of the Commander of the Order of the Niger (CON).\n\nHis achievements also include safer Nigerian waterways, as well as the improvement of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) in the area of regulation.\n\nGiven his antecedents in Rivers State and current strides as transportation minister, Mr. Amaechi\u2019s profile over the past year has seen him emerge as one of most famous public officers in the Nigerian system and therefore a national leader in his own right.\n\nRotimi Amaechi is married to Judith Amaechi, and they are blessed with three boys.\n\nBabatunde Fashola: An administrator per excellence\n\nBabatunde Raji Fashola, SAN , is an erudite lawyer and current Federal Minister of Works and Housing. He served two terms as Governor of Lagos State from May 29, 2007 to May 29, 2015.\n\nHe was called to the Nigerian Bar as a solicitor and advocate of the Supreme Court of Nigeria in November 1988 after completing the professional training programme at the Nigerian Law School, Lagos which he undertook between 1987 and 1988.\n\nHis legal career of over one and a half decades, commenced in the law Firm of Sofunde, Osakwe, Ogundipe and Belgore, where he cut his legal teeth as a litigator over such wide-ranging areas of specialisation such as, intellectual property (registration of trade marks), commercial law, covering general contracts, company activities, mergers, acquisitions, right issues, ownership of shares and equity of corporations, as well as land disputes, criminal law and chieftaincy matters, in all of which he has come to acquire appreciable expertise and vast experience.\n\nFashola, a Notary Public of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, has been variously honoured with awards and certificates of merit including the Distinguished Alumnus Award conferred on him by the University of Benin Alumni Association in recognition of contributions to the Alumnus association and humanity.\n\nHe is also a recipient of Lagos State public service club Platinum Award for outstanding contribution towards development. As well as Alliance for Democracy \u201d Igbogbo Bayeku Local Government Award\u201d in recognition of activities towards the success of the party.\n\nBabatunde Fashola is also a Patron of the Law Students Association of the University of Benin and he is the second law graduate from the University of Benin and the first member of the Nigerian Law School graduating class of 1988 to be conferred with the professional rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria.\n\nFashola is also the First ever Chief of Staff to be so honoured. Babatunde Fashola is a member of the Nigerian Bar Association, the International Bar Association and an Associate of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria.\n\nFashola was Chief of Staff to his predecessor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Fashola, had during his tenure as Chief of Staff, also dubbed as the Honourable Commissioner to the Governor\u2019s office. Fashola was the first person to hold both offices simultaneously.\n\nHe also served in Lagos state in various capacities, including:\n\nSecretary of the Lands Sub-Committee of the Transitional Work Groups- 1999.\n\nMember of the panel of Enquiry into allocation of houses on the Mobolaji Johnson Housing Scheme at Lekki.- 2000.\n\nMember of the State Tenders Board- 2002 2006.\n\nMember of the Lagos State Executive Council-2002-2006.\n\nMember of the State Security Council-2002-2006\n\nMember of the State Treasury Board-2002-2006\n\nChairman Ad-Hoc Committee on the Review of Asset distribution among Local Government.\n\nFashola is the first and arguably the best of the technocrats turned politician to utilize politics for public good in contemporary Nigeria.\n\nAs a candidate of the Action Congress party, now known as the All Progressives Congress, Fashola succeeded Bola Ahmed Tinubu, on 14 April 2007, and was sworn in as Lagos State governor on 29 May 2007.Fashola was re-elected on 26 April 2011.\n\nOn account of his sterling performance as governor of Lagos State, on November 11th 2015, he was appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari as the Minister of Power, Works and Housing; he was reappointed Minister of Works & Housing on 21 August 2019.\n\nFashola was born in Lagos on 28 June 1963. He attended Birch Freeman High school Lagos and Igbobi College Lagos. He studied Law at the University of Benin from where he graduated with a Bachelor of Laws, LL.B.(Hon), degree in 1987.\n\nFashola is also a member of the Nigerian Bar Association, the International Bar Association and an Associate of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria.\n\nFashola, had during his tenure as Chief of Staff, also dubbed as the Honourable Commissioner to the Governor\u2019s office. Babatunde Fashola was the first person to hold both offices simultaneously.\n\nGovernor of Lagos state\n\nBabatunde Raji Fashola commenced a four-year tenure as the Executive Governor of Lagos State in Nigeria on 29 May 2007.\n\nAccording to The Tribune Newspaper, Babatunde Raji Fashola remains a reference point in 21st century Governance.\n\nHe is widely considered one of best governors since the return of democracy in 1999.\n\nBabatunde Fashola during his term as governor saw to the successful overhaul of the tax collection system in Lagos that successfully increased revenue for the state and indirectly financed various other reforms. He secured public support for the overhaul after revealing the corruption in the previous tax agency through an orchestrated, public sting operation, which revealed that corrupt officials sold fraudulent tax documents on the street.\n\nHe replaced the old tax agency with a smaller internal revenue service staffed by no-contract employees governed by performance incentives rather than state civil-service workers. The new service better enforced existing tax requirements and expanded the taxpayer base by introducing a simplified, single-page tax form for informal businesses.\n\nHe introduced so many innovations to governance, increased the State\u2019s infrastructure. He embarked on gigantic construction program that changed the face and landscape of the state, and is highly regarded as the architect of modern Lagos.\n\nFashola was born 28 June 1963, and married with children to Dame Abimbola Fashola\n\nLai Mohammed: An efficient communicator with gift of garb\n\nTo many, Alhaji Layiwola Mohammed is a complex man, this is on account of his differing interpretation of his role and duty depending on the side of the political divide he finds himself.\n\nAs an opposition information manager, he employed psychological warfare, propaganda and modern tool of influencing public opinion to deliver on his duty with ruthless efficiency, and the ruling APC owed its success in part to Mohammed\u2019s standing as an efficient communicator.\n\nAs minister of information, he has deployed his skills to manage the information ministry and sell Buhari\u2019s programs to local and international public.\n\nA lawyer by training, and former National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress.\n\nAs a practicing Lawyer, Alhaji Lai Mohammed co-founded the legal firm of Edu & Mohammed as a Senior Partner in 1989.\n\nHe was born into the family of Alhaji Mohammed Adekeye in 1952. He is a native of Oro in Kwara State. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in French from Obafemi Awolowo University, in 1975. He then proceeded to obtain a law degree from the University of Lagos, and then Nigerian Law School in 1986.\n\nMohammed is an astute businessman and served as the Chairman of Optmedia Limited, a subsidiary of Afromedia Plc since 18 December 2008.\n\nHe served as a Director of Afromedia PLC since May 2011 and is also a fellow of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) and had previously worked as Public Relations Officer for almost 10 years with the Nigerian Airport Authority, now Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN).\n\nIn October 2002, Alhaji Lai Mohammed was a candidate for governor in the April 2003 Kwara State elections on the Alliance for Democracy platform. He was assaulted and five vehicles in his convoy were smashed in front of Senator Suleiman Ajadi\u2019s campaign office at Oke-Onigbin during a festivity. But he has had huge following in his native Kwara State, and widely considered one of the most effective and brilliant image makers the country has ever produced.\n\nHe served as Governor Tinubu\u2019s Chief of Staff during his first term.\n\nLai Mohammed is an active politician and has been accused by some local and international news about giving contradictory accounts of events in his country.\n\nThe truth is that as government\u2019s image maker, he is bound to make enemies, but one thing that even his detractors can not deny is his competence and brilliance, his wide canvas and rich repertoire of knowledge of the country, and his ability to connect with events and situation.\n\nHe had accused CNN of being \u201cdesperate\u201d, after the international media released several footages, to prove the massacre of the protesters at the Lekki tollgate, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nHe is one of the most astute and competent information ministers, and in the course of his career, he has displayed wide knowledge and understanding of his country\u2019s convoluted politics.\n\nIn a recent interview, Mohammed, said calls for secession in some quarters in Nigeria was unacceptable.\n\nMohammed, however, said it was rational and ideal for citizens to call for restructuring and true federalism, adding that whatever challenges facing the country can be overcome.\n\nWhile it is alright for citizens to call for restructuring and true federalism, what is not acceptable is the call in certain quarters for secession.\n\nWhatever challenges we have today as a nation, can and will be surmounted. In fact, the Federal Government had set in motion the necessary machinery to tackle the challenge of insecurity.\n\nWe should therefore not allow todays challenges, whether in the area of economy or security, to jeopardise our unity, he said.\n\nThat task has never been more urgent than now against the background of discordant voices in the country and calls for separation.\n\nHe stated that he wanted everybody to be partner in the governments effort to douse the tension in the land and beat the drum of unity rather than the drum of war.\n\nHe added that everyone should raise voice against those fanning the embers of disunity and discord in the country. Without a country that is peaceful and secured, there can be no development.\n\nThis administration is doing everything possible to return peace and security across the country, the minister said.\n\nMany Nigerians will not forget in hurry the role played by Mohammed in the defeat of the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in the 2015 general election that brought in the Buhari administration.\n\nThe man who took charge of the realm of communicating what the APC wanted to say was no other than Alhaji Lai Mohammed, the National Publicity Secretary of the APC who would surely go down in history as the competent explainer-in-chief. It was Lai Mohammed\u2019s lot to define the then ruling party to the Nigerian voter in ways that would make its rejection a forgone conclusion. Lai Mohammed went about this job with the kind of fiery passion that sometimes got him bogged down in the murky waters of partisan debates. The then ruling party was quick to play on the sound of his first name to give the impression that he was full of lies against a performing government. He was also taken to task when he attempted to create a different narrative at the time the government was making progress in its onslaught against terrorists in the North East.\n\nMohammed\u2019s critics insist that on national security, especially where the lives of Nigerians were involved, the then opposition spokesman should have been a little more restrained.\n\nThe knocks notwithstanding, Mohammed acquitted himself as a vibrant and effective opposition spokesman. In a challenging environment like Nigeria and considering the clout of the government in power, the role of the opposition is made much more difficult. But Lai Mohammed understood his environment. He leveraged on the power of constant messaging to shape perceptions. He gave the government sleepless nights by outplaying them in all departments. His strategy was to make any discussion a referendum on the performance of the government. Doing so meant that the contradictions within his own camp were not well scrutinized. Considering issue based attacks as the best form of defence, Mohammed was constantly on the offensive against the Presidency of Goodluck Jonathan. It is to the credit of Lai Mohammed that the tag of cluelessness became one of the albatross that Jonathan as President struggled to shake off. In the realm of strategy too, Lai Mohammed was light years ahead of the then ruling party and even the Presidencys communications team.\n\nWhile some would argue that as opposition spokesman, he was free from the responsibility of communicating in a nuanced and balanced way, the reality is that the APC spokesman understood that to have the upper hand, he had to pin the ruling party to the ropes all the time. And he did so brilliantly, so much that the Jonathan Presidency with all the resources at the disposal of its communications team was constantly on the back foot reeling from the hammer blows delivered by Mohammed.\n\nOn the front lines of the media war, things became so pathetic for the Jonathan Presidency that it could no longer speak with the confidence and authority of the government in power. Hurried responses to allegations lobbed at it by the opposition became the governments sole response as it huffed and puffed, but failed to find a lasting answer to Mohammeds strident onslaughts.\n\nSirika Hadi: Aeronautics expert in charge of aviation\n\nTo many in Nigeria, Senator Sirika Hadi is just a run of the mill politician, whose appointment as aviation minister is typical of one well connected.\n\nFar from it, Hadi has had the best education available in the aviation world , having studied at the prestigious Petroleum Helicopters institute in USA, Flight Safety International, USA and Delta Aeronautics, United States of America, where he honed his aviation skills and developed his extensive knowledge of the industry.\n\nThus far from political, his appointment as aviation minister was a question of proverbial round peg in a round hole.\n\nHe is a former Member House of Representative, and assumed the Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2011, where he represents Katsina North Senatorial District under the platform of Congress for Progressive Change. Sirika held the position of (Vice-Chairman) of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) Committee set by the Nigerian Senate.\n\nIn 2003, Hadi was elected into the Federal House of Representative and he left office in 2007. Had was again re-elected to represent Kastina North in the Nigerian Senate under the platform of Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) in 2011 elections.\n\nWhile in the Senate, Hadi Sirika was the portal vice chairman; Millennium Developmemt Goal (MDG) and a member of the Senate Committee on Aviation. He also served in a number of different committees in the Senate.\n\nIn the early 2015, Hadi became a member of the newly born party APC, after a merger which brought about the All Progressive Congress (APC). Hadi announced in the same year that, Muhammadu Buhari have been convinced to run for the presidential seat in the 2015 general Elections under the banner of the APC.\n\nAfter the Muhammadu Buhari emerged winner of the 2015 Presidential elections, Hadi was appointed minister for state for aviation until 2019. He was reappointed as the Minister of Avaition by President Muhammadu Buhari after he won his second term bid.\n\nAs a former pilot, Sirika is a member of the Senate Committee on Aviation.\n\nAs aviation minister, he has done a lot to reposition the ministry in order to make it more viable, drawing on his extensive expertise and knowledge.\n\nHe was General Manager of Katsina State Transport Authority from 1999 and 2000.\n\nOn the potential for private involvement in airport renovations and ownership and where he sees Nigeria\u2019s airports in the near future, he said in a recent interview that\n\n\u201cThere has been modest investment by government to develop the sector. In terms of airport terminal buildings, Nigeria had to source some funding through an import-export bank loan to build or rebuild terminals at four of our airports.\n\n\u201cEntrepreneurs will find that there is huge potential for investment, especially in the general aviation infrastructure, including terminal buildings, runways, communication and navigation equipment, and security systems. The entire sector is greenfield, waiting for suitable investors to come in. It is important for interested investors to act now because the doors will be closed once we have all of the investors that we can find.\n\n\u201cAirfares in Nigeria are high compared to other emerging markets. From a regulatory and policy perspective, how might airfares fall?\n\nThe first and most important step is to create competition, which is the whole idea behind the national airline we are about to create. This way we can leverage all the bilateral and multilateral agreements between us and other nations that are bringing in their planes. Emirates flies to Nigeria 21 times per week, and British Airways has a similar number of flights.\n\nRecently, he said it is in order to speak truth to power but counterproductive to curse a leader, since in his reasoning, a cursed leader may be pushed by the curse to take evil decision that will affect generality of the people.\n\nLast week, the amiable minister was reported to have said that Nigeria will begin the operation of a new national air carrier in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nIn this 2021, we will try to do all the needful and probably we intend to start operations somewhere around first quarter 2022, he said.\n\nHe said the emergence of COVID-19 delayed the conclusion of plans as well as the takeoff of the project which he said the federal government is still committed to.\n\nMr Sirika said the national carrier was expected to take off initially this year, as an economic necessity for the country with the size of the population, the vantage geographical location, and other natural factors.\n\nIt is still in top gear, we are coming back to Council, hopefully within the next two weeks, to present the memo on the national carrier, he said.\n\nWe went to Council to approve the outline business case for the carrier and then the Council raised some questions and asked us to go and file the memo again and bring it back.\n\nSo, once it comes back and the outline business case is approved by Council, then, of course, we will now go to the full business case, which is now going to the market and then establishing the national carrier.\n\nIt was our intention to have a national carrier running in 2021, which is this year. Unfortunately due to COVID, which took the greater part of last year, since March last year, activities are almost impossible.\n\nOf course, for obvious reasons, we now have access to equipment, that they will come faster to us, deliveries of the aircraft will be faster, perhaps even the rates might be cheaper and so on, and so forth.\n\nHe is widely considered to be an efficient , brilliant administrator.\n\nHadi sirika was born on 2nd March 1964 in Dutsi Local Government area of Katsina state.\n\nJohn Kayode Fayemi: Philosopher King on throne of Ekiti State\n\nJohn Olukayode Fayemi is arguably one of the most cerebral politicians in contemporary Nigeria, hugely in a class of his own.\n\nHis unassuming nature has tended to belie his immense strength and influence, as one of the most important political actors in the current dispensation.\n\nAs the current governor of Ekiti State, he has quietly made his mark redefining the state on the path of growth and development. His foray into politics has a streak of radical in it, having been an important member of National Democratic Coalition, NADECO, the coalition of intelligentsia, political elites, retired military officers, business elites and pro-democracy organizations that fought the Abacha dictatorship and ensured the military handed over power to civil rule.\n\nIt is widely believed that Fayemi was the voice of Radio Kudirat, the opposition voice back then.\n\nAs Governor of Ekiti State, he has been in office since 16 October 2018. He previously served in office between 2010 and 2014 before losing re-election to Ayodele Fayose. He was also the Minister of Solid Minerals Development in President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s cabinet from 11 November 2015 to 30 May 2018, when he resigned to contest for a second time as Governor of Ekiti State. Today, he is the chair of the All Progressives Congress, APC\u2019s governors\u2019 forum.\n\nAn intellectual of international repute, Fayemi has written extensively on governance and democratization, civil-military relations and security sector issues in Africa.\n\nFayemi had his primary education at ICC Primary School, Agodi, Ibadan, Oyo State between 1970-1975 and attended Christ\u2019s School Ado Ekiti from 1975 to 1980. He later went on to receive degrees in History, Politics and International Relations from the University of Lagos and University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University). From 1989 to 1992, he earned a Doctorate in War Studies from King\u2019s College London, specializing in civil-military relations.\n\nCareer\n\nAfter his first degree in 1984, he proceeded on the mandatory one year National Youth service Corps from 1985 to 1986, during which he was a lecturer at the Nigeria-Police Training College in Sokoto.\n\nAfter his service year, he served as a Research Officer at Development & Management Consultants in Ikeja between 1987-1989. When he moved to the UK to pursue his doctoral studies between 1991 to 1993 he worked as a Research Officer at the African Research and Information Bureau in London. In 1992, he was a Tutorial Fellow at the War Studies Department at Kings College, London during his doctoral studies. Later between 1993 to 1995, he was the Strategy Development Adviser of Deptford City Challenge in London and later served as the Secretary General of the Media Empowerment for Africa (The Radio Foundation) in London between 1995-1997.\n\nHe was also a journalist with The Guardian and City Tempo; and the Editor of Nigeria-Now, a defunct political monthly magazine. In 1997, Fayemi returned to Nigeria where he established the Centre for Democracy and Development Centre for Democracy & Development, a research and training institution dedicated to the study and promotion of democratic development, peace-building and human security in Africa, where he served as Director from 1997 to 2006.\n\nIn April 2014, Fayemi was endorsed as the governorship candidates of the All Progressives Congress in the state\u2019s gubernatorial elections slated for 21 June 2014. The emergence of Fayemi was preceded by congress held before the governor who had no contestant was endorsed as the flag bearers of their state in the governorship elections. Kayode Fayemi was defeated at the polls on 21 June 2014 by previous governor Ayodele Fayose.\n\nFayemi recontested for second term as Ekiti state governor under the platform of the All Progressive Congress in the 14 July 2018 governorship election after resigning as the Minister of Solid Minerals Development. He was officially declared the winner of the 2018 Ekiti State gubernatorial election by the Independent National Electoral Commission and subsequently sworn in.\n\nIn October 2020 during the nationwide #EndSars protest he joined the protesters at the pretest grounds to express his support for their demand but advised on the need for them to have an exit strategy and on the need to create a window of dialogue with the Federal Government on their demands before the protest was hijack.\n\nHe narrated his experience as one of the notable faces of the anti-military and protesters that facilitated the current democratic order. He said his group knew when to pause to negotiate with the government and that made them successful. He said this at a virtual symposium held by the Harvard Kenny Alumni Association of Nigeria with the theme :The Africa Policy Dialogue Series: Harnessing Africas Demographic Dividend for Peace, Security and Productivity through Investments in Youth.\n\nHe admitted that the youths, who were actively participating in the #Endsars protest at the time, had a right to demand for good governance and an end to police brutality, saying the government owes that to them.\n\nFayemi is a Fellow of the Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, University of Ibadan\n\nAdjunct Professor of Security Studies at the African Centre for Strategic Studies, National Defense University, Fort McNair, Washington, D.C., USA.\n\nHe was also a Visiting Professor in the African Studies Programme at Northwestern University, Evanston, USA in 2004.\n\nHe serves on numerous Boards including the Governing Board of the Open Society Justice Institute, Baobab for Women\u2019s Human Rights, African Security Sector Network, and on the Advisory Board of the Global Facilitation Network on Security Sector Reform and on the Management Culture Board of the ECOWAS Secretariat.\n\nMember, Africa Policy Advisory Panel of the British Government.\n\nFayemi is an outstanding intellectual who has written on governance and democratization, civil-military relations and security sector issues in Africa. Among his recent books are: Deepening the Culture of Constitutionalism: The Role of Regional Institutions in Constitutional Development in Africa (CDD, 2003), Security Sector Governance in Africa: A Handbook (edited with Nicole Ball, CDD, 2004) and Out of the Shadows: Exile and the Struggle for Freedom and Democracy in Nigeria (CDD, 2005).\n\nNasir El-Rufai: The action man of Kaduna State\n\nProbably now more than ever before has Nigeria needed all the help it can receive to rebuild her aging and dilapidated infrastructures.\n\nAnd one of those that seems to be coming through for the country is the incumbent governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai. Some would say this is not too surprising considering that the Kaduna governor is a developmental expert.\n\nBorn on 16 February 1960 in Daudawa, Faskari Local Government Area of Katsina State, Nasir El-Rufai had early roots in the management and development sectors. Alongside three other partners, he founded a Quantity Surveying and Project Management Consulting firm in 1982, through which they executed several building and civil engineering projects in the country.\n\nIn November 1999, he was appointed the director of the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) by former President Olusegun Obasanjo and secretary of the National Council of Privatisation (NCP) where he used his expertise to spearhead the privatisation of several government owned corporations.\n\nHis efforts were recognized on a larger scale when he was appointed as Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in July 2003 to help restore the bastardised Abuja Master plan to its original vision.\n\nDuring his tenure as FCT minister, he presided over a radical transformation of the federal capital earlier riddled with corruption and vast deviation from the original Master plan.\n\nHe led several bold policy and innovative initiatives, including the establishment of the Abuja Geographic Information System (GIS) in June 2004, making the federal capital the first municipality in Nigeria with a computerised land register and information system and restoration of the Abuja master plan to its original status with the demolition of illegal buildings, which prompted many to give him the nickname \u2018Mr. Demolition\u2019.\n\nMallam El-Rufai also superintended over two other ministries, Commerce and Interior, where he chaired several cabinet committees that facilitated the establishment of a mortgage system in Nigeria, National ID card system, improvement of the nation\u2019s electric power supply, as well as the sale of Federal Government properties in Abuja.\n\nThere was to be no time on the sidelines for El-Rufai after the end of his tenure as minister. After briefly leaving public service, he completed legal and public management training programmes at the University of London and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.\n\nIn 2011, he re-entered politics by joining the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), and was appointed the first deputy national secretary of the newly formed All Progressives Congress (APC) after the merger of the CPC with the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) and the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in 2013.\n\nEbonyi: Unveiling Umahi\u2019s uncommon transformation\n\nEbonyi, Southeast Nigeria\u2019s youngest state, was in many ways, a child of necessity. When, in 1996, the areas that today constitute Ebonyi, were carved out of Enugu and Abia states \u2013 mostly from the former \u2013 it was the realisation of a desire by a section of the Igbo nation that had long felt that their interests were not adequately represented, first in the old Anambra State, and later in Enugu.\n\nIt was for understandable reason. The areas saw little presence of government. Abakaliki, today\u2019s capital of Ebonyi, was a backwater town, often derided by the rest for its lack of development. But today, two decades and a half down the road, the story of Abakaliki has changed from a city being mocked to one leading the light as one of Nigeria\u2019s most beautiful, and modern state capitals.\n\nAbakaliki is Ebonyi. And the story of this transformation, more than anything else, has been down to the sheer ingenuity of Engr. Dave Umahi, the incumbent governor of the state.\n\nUmahi, like every political office holder, has had his issues; and critics, too. But even his worst critics cannot deny that the governors accomplishment in the state is a marvel, particularly in terms of infrastructure, he has been a wonder of sorts.\n\nThe state has witnessed and continues to witness unprecedented road and sundry infrastructure building, and placed side by side with the revenue profile of the state, the governor arguably stands shoulders high above his peers.\n\nYet, besides infrastructure, the state is also making rapid improvement in education and agriculture. Rated as an educationally backward state only a few years ago, Ebonyi has walked up the ladder, largely unnoticed, and now makes top ten in most national examinations.\n\nAnd even as the present economic realities, occasioned by fall in global oil price as Coronavirus pandemic shut down economies, have crippled state finances, Ebonyi remains a construction site. The Enugu-Abakailiki Express Road is easily the best federal road in the Southeast courtesy of the governor, and he has also intervened in other strategic federal roads in the state, including Afikpo Road, Uburu-Amasiri Road among many others.\n\nUmahis projects are particularly noted for their solidity. Road constructions in Ebonyi are mostly eight inches concrete pavement with a lifespan of over 50 years. Along the Enugu-Abakailiki road, at Presco, Spera Indo junctions and the International Market are three massive flyovers well constructed and decorated for aesthetic value. The bridges are part of the trans-Saharan route to Cameroon.\n\nRemarkably, it is a state with annual average internally generated revenue of about N4billion, and yearly federal allocation of about N25 billion, one of the least revenue earning states in Nigeria. But with its little, the state has achieved amazing feats under the governors watch.\n\nThe magic behind what the governor is achieving is highest level of probity and accountability, highest level of transparency, highest level of compliance with the principle of fiscal responsibility and procurement, noted the states Commissioner for Information, Mr. Uchenna Orji.\n\nStill, with little revenue, the governor has not, like a few other states facing financial constraints, plunged Ebonyi into heavy debt burden. Ebonyi is one of the least indebted states in Nigeria. Yet, all over the state, roads and other infrastructural projects are ongoing while many have been completed.\n\nUmahi is doing wonderfully well in Ebonyi, noted Chief Sam Maduka Onyishi, CEO, Peace Mass Transit Limited, a leading transporter in the country. The roads there are very well constructed. The kind of things he is building there, sometimes you begin to wonder if its the federal government that is there building those things.\n\nAs part of their trivial online debates, people of the Southeast once in a while, hold online debates about which capital city in the zone is most beautiful. Abakailiki has arguably emerged as the indisputable winner of that contest. A trip around the city only lends credence: smooth roads, smart roundabouts, modern storey buildings and fine streets.\n\nThe Udensi Roundabout with its fountain waterfall and spotless labyrinth of roads is a marvel, yet same can be said about the Government House Roundabout and the Abacha Roundabout, among others.\n\nWe are happy with what the governor has done, Abakailiki is now a beautiful place, noted a bike rider, Nwede. Yes, Im very satisfied with what he has done.\n\nBut in Abakailiki, its not just about beautiful roads and roundabouts. The administration has also completed the huge international market, the Margret Umahi International Market, which was started by the Martin Elechi administration.\n\nThere is the impressive centenary city and a new governors lodge and ecumenical centre with combined sitting capacity of 12,000, the largest ever built by any government in Nigeria, if not on the African continent.\n\nThere is the Ebonyi International Airport, where it is said, promise met action. A dream conceived few years ago, but which has now fully materialised, with work at advanced state. There is the Uburu College of Medicine; a medical university with huge promise.\n\nFor a state with Ebonyis revenue profile, contemplating an international airport on paper would have seemed like an unrealistic dream. But in Ebonyi, Umahi has continued to prove that impossible is nothing. The airport he promised, he has almost completed.\n\nA now renovated Abakailiki stadium at Ntezi-aba is huge by Nigerian standard, but the governor has since decided that for the future he wants for the state capital and the state, only a brand new stadium that would attract athletes from Africa and beyond would do.\n\nApart from the three massive flyover bridges in Abakailiki, he has also started constructing other eight flyovers at Abaomege in Onicha local government, Nkalagu Junction, Uburu Junction, Ohaozara, among other locations.\n\nThe state capital is easily the best well-organised and has best road network of any in the Southeast, if not the entire country. But its not just about Abakailiki. Across the state, there are numerous road projects. The Abakailiki to Ikwo road is well-constructed, the Abakailiki-Afikpo road is not less so.\n\nAnother secret behind what has been achieved is the fear of God and the fact that the governor was very prepared from the very beginning to govern Ebonyi State. For us, it is a divine project. He came on board via a divine mandate, Orji says.\n\nAnd if you look at his track record, you will understand that he truly came from God. I will also say that his track record, to an extent, explains what is happening now. Im talking about his experience, his exposure, education but most importantly, his passion. The passion is the engine that drives those three elements: exposure, education and experience.\n\nAgriculture Revolution\n\nNoted for its Abakailiki rice, Ebonyi is a largely agrarian state. The Umahi government has continued to support farmers and farming to improve productivity through his administrations agricultural development programmes.\n\nThe government now runs three rice mills with capacity of 24 metric tonne per hour. It also has par-boiling plant with a total of 24 metric tonne capacity that feeds the mill. The governor had also procured four rice mills, each with four metric tonne capacity with parboiling plants with same capacity per hour each, giving to individuals or cooperatives to operate.\n\nEmpowerment\n\nThe governor has introduced a number of empowerment programmes. He trained and empowered 2000 youths and women with N250,000 grant each. Through his Street to Skill Empowerment Programme, the governor had also trained and empowered 520 hawkers with N250,000 each and 400 Okada riders with tricycles.\n\nHe also shortlisted, trained and empowered 403 spouses of security officials of Ebonyi origin with N200,000 each and 508 clergymen with N508 million.\n\nFor the states civil servants, he introduced the Second Address Scheme, a scheme which compels civil servants to have second address in farming either at the primary, secondary or tertiary production. They are subsequently given loans ranging from N250,000 to N1million to support agricultural produce, among other programmes aimed at promoting entrepreneurship.\n\nBeyond Ebonyi, Umahi, as chairman of Southeast governors forum, has also in many ways, held his own as the political leader, in some sense, of the zone. Under his leadership, the southeast governors forum has risen up to the security and sundry challenges of the zone, and only recently launched uniform security outfit, Ebube Agu.\n\nGodwin Emefiele: Redefining central banking\n\nMr. Godwin Emefiele is the first governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to get a two-term mandate since the return to civil rule in 1999. President Mohammadu Buhari had reappointed him in 2019 following the giant strides of his first tenure that started in 2014 under former President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nThe recent sack of the entire board of directors of FBN Holdings Plc and its subsidiary First Bank of Nigeria Ltd by the Emefiele-led CBN in pursuit of corporate governance decency is widely seen as capable of restoring investors and customers confidence; and perhaps, a demonstration of the new dynamism he has brought into the job. He also did the same with Skye bank, now Polaris bank.\n\nThe big irony is that even as the then managing director of Zenith, many did not think that Emefiele was qualified to be saddled with the onerous responsibilities of managing the monetary policy of Africa\u2019s leading economic power house.\n\nDespite his glittering successes at Zenith, a bank whose top line numbers he grew at a very impressive rate, he was still regarded lightly within banking and finance industry circles. Of course, the luminous image of Mr. Jim Ovia, the founder of Zenith Bank had so dominated the banks landscape that Emefieles effervescence was beclouded.\n\nBut with his austere nature and ability to instill financial discipline in the banking sector, which significantly reduced rascality and frivolity in loan approvals, it took him little or no time to disappoint all those who expected nothing but failure from an operator-turn regulator.\n\nSince mid-2014, when he took over the reins of CBN, with a huge task to stabilise an economy that went awry since 2015, Nigeria has experienced stable economic monetary policies, even as it did not witness any crude oil windfall, which is the backbone of the economy, in terms of revenue supply.\n\nConversely, the oil price volatility impacted not only the countrys revenue base, but the inflow of foreign exchange (forex), stoking currency depreciation, system arbitrage and consequent policy measures, leading to calls for the devaluation of the naira.\n\nThe 12th CBN governors ability to hold on to his belief in the economy and not allow the ship sink on his watch may have also earned him the second term, which many of his peers say is well deserved.\n\nEmefiele, through his monetary policies and even interventions in fiscal issues over the past seven years, has insisted that the country still holds a high return on investment, with huge opportunities given its over 200-million-people market.\n\nTherefore, with a cocktail of policy measures, the naira, which fell to N520/$1 in 2017 at the open market, became stabilised around N360$1 , and stayed through to the period of the general elections that brought Buhari to power.\n\nSpecifically, Emefiele oversaw Nigerias widely acclaimed response to plummeting oil prices, a spiraling inflation, significant exchange rate pressures, sharp fall in forex inflows, delisting of Nigeria from the JP Morgan Bond Index, normalisation of U.S. monetary policy, geopolitical tensions amongst global superpowers, and overall uncertainty after the change of administration in 2015.\n\nIndeed, the stability he brought into the system has been attributed to his innovative Investors and Exporters Window worth $25 billion, which liberalised official transactions of forex, as well as directive to banks to sell forex to customers over the counter for basic travel allowance (BTA) and medical and education bills.\n\nBeyond forex stability, which saw massive accretion in Nigerias foreign exchange reserves from about $23 billion in October 2016 to nearly $48 billion in June 2018, Emefieles policies also significantly helped Nigeria achieve fast recovery from recession, which was caused by sharp and sustained oil price declines from 2015 through 2017.\n\nAlso, Emefiele recorded the longest month by month decline in inflation from about 19 per cent in January 2017 to about 11 per cent in July 2018, before the recent climb due to forex crisis while also helping to avert a major economic crisis with labour groups by innovatively offsetting billions of arrears in salaries, pensions and gratuities.\n\nEven in the area of fiscal interventions, the CBN governor sustained large-scale financing of agriculture through the Anchor Borrowers Programme, which has disbursed hundreds of billions of naira in small loans to hundreds of thousands of peasant farmers, thereby creating millions of jobs across the country.\n\nAs an evidence of the new discipline through tight monetary policies, his first tenure witnessed unprecedented profits in the banking industry, with GT Bank and Zenith Bank leading the way with record performances.\n\nOperational discipline also accounted for significant reduction in bad loans, thereby leading to massive expansion of banking services with financial inclusion rate reaching nearly 64 per cent in 2018, up from only 32 per cent in 2012.\n\nWith all these, Emefiele succeeded in facilitating major improvement in Nigerias ranking on the World Banks Doing Business Indicators, through the creation of the collateral registry and credit reference bureaus.\n\nWhile his second term has witnessed a conspiracy of COVID-19 pandemic and global oil price crash to undo his first term achievements in the areas of inflation and exchange rate among others, his effective policy responses are fast restoring normalcy.\n\nFor instance, Nigerias inflation rate reduced by 0.05 per cent in April, the first fall in inflation rate in the last 21 months, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics released last week.\n\nEmefieles CBN is also working tirelessly through a number of policies, including the naira for dollar Scheme, to strengthen the naira. To increase the inflow of diaspora remittances into the country, the bank had in March launched the scheme that pays naira to senders and recipients of international money transfers.\n\nClearly, the efforts of Emefieles CBN have not gone unnoticed as he has received several awards at home and abroad. Perhaps the one that stands out most was the 2017 Best of Africa Achievement Award given to him by Forbes in Washington DC, United States of America.\n\nForbes Emerging Markets honours a person whose achievements fall within the mission of the organization, which is to promote further investment in Africa by United States investors. The only other Nigerian who had received the award is the president of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote.\n\nForbes chief executive officer, Corporate Council on Africa, Florizelle Liser, noted that Emefiele merited the honour, because the body was happy to see the work that is being done on the Ease of Doing Business in Nigeria and they believed it would pay off. He said: Many of our members welcome it as an opportunity to see how they can trade more with Nigeria and invest more in Nigeria.\n\nBefore his banking career, Mr. Emefiele was a lecturer in Finance and Insurance in two Nigerian Universities. He holds degrees in Banking and Finance from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, and is also an alumnus of Stanford University, Harvard and Wharton Graduate Schools of Business where he took courses in Negotiation, Service Excellence, Critical Thinking, Leading Change and Strategy.\n\nProfessor Umar Garba Danbatta : Servant leader\n\nProfessor Umar Garba Danbatta, the Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Office of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), is a brilliant engineer, astute administrator, philanthropist and an outstanding nation builder who has brought his wealth of experience to bear as head of the NCC.\n\nDambatta has, within the few years at the helm in the commission, transformed it into a regulator of global acclaim through implementation of the auspicious strategic 8-Point Agenda, which gave much needed direction to the activities of the commission.\n\nThrough several innovative initiatives such as Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) registration and 112 Emergency Number, Danbatta has helped in the effort against insecurity in the country even as his efforts have led to improvements in Quality of Service (QoS) delivery, broadband infrastructure deployment, broadband penetration, effective spectrum utilisation, consumer empowerment, technology innovation.\n\nProf Danbatta through the NCC has led the charge to drive Nigerias industrial revolution and knowledge economy leveraging telecommunications.\n\nToday Telecommunications contribution to GDP has grown by 70% between 2015 to 2020, whilst broad band penetration has leaped from 8% to 42% in same period. His leadership has enhanced transparency and innovation in the sector, such that recently NCC was acknowledged by International Telecoms Union (ITU) as one of Africas foremost Telecoms regulator.\n\nDanbatta has also made huge impact in the areas of Staff Welfare, Infrastructural Development, Consumers Empowerment and Satisfaction, Job Creation, Standard Information and Communication Technology Revolution, Research, Rebranding of the Telecom Sector, Cordial Relationship with Stakeholders, Increase in Active Mobile Broadband Penetration, Efficient Monitoring and Value Driven usage for the provision of Different Types of Services.\n\nAn academic of repute and a prolific author, Danbatta is a recipient of 18 distinguished awards and certificates of honour. He is a COREN registered engineer, Fellow of the Nigerian Society of Engineers (FNSE), Fellow of the Renewable and Alternative Energy Society (FRAES) and Fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Engineering. He was the Vice President of the Digital Bridge Institute (DBI), International Centre for Advanced Communications Studies, which was established in the year 2004 by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to build capacity for the Nigerian/African telecom industry in the diverse areas of Information and Communication Technology (ICT).\n\nMr. Kennedy Uzoka, Group Managing Director/CEO, UBA Plc: Banker\u2019s Banker\n\nKennedy Uzoka GMD/CEO, UBA Plc is one of the most accomplished bankers on the African continent today. A bankers banker, he has vast experience in banking, business development, financial and business advisory, strategic planning and execution as well as human resource management. He is an advocate of disruptive technology and has led many game changing innovations in the African banking industry over the past two decades of his career.\n\nIn an extremely challenging industry with a high mortality rate of its professionals, Kennedy has excelled. He has previously served as the Group Deputy Managing Director/CEO UBA Africa, with oversight over the Groups subsidiaries in eighteen countries whilst also providing supervisory oversight on the Groups information technology and digital banking suites as well as the personal banking business.\n\nBy August 2016, he assumed the top rank as GMD/CEO. His performance has been sparkling. He has consistently led the Bank to set a year-on-year track record of profitability, wealth creation and innovative financial products across its operations in the African continent despite global economic challenges. Not even the current challenge of COVID-19 has been a dampener as the bank under his watch continues to scale new frontiers and post assuring results.\n\nAudited Year end results for 2020 show that UBA continues to enjoy both top and bottom line growth with Profit after Tax growing by 27.7% to N113.8billion, up from N89.1 billion in the same period of 2019.

So small was the bank then that it ranked 65th in the nation and could only boast of 89 branches across the country, that transforming it into one of Nigerias biggest bank by branches and customer base became a task that must be met.\n\nA strategist, Wigwe and his team deployed assets and skills in management to restore investors confidence in the bank. The move, aside shoring the bank\u2019s brand equity and giving shareholders more reasons to believe, improved its balance sheet.\n\nTwo decades after, Access Bank under Wigwe\u2019s leadership has remained a value-focused financial institution while setting the pace in corporate governance and fiscal.\n\nFrom number 65 in 2000, Access Bank is today the largest bank by asset base, and one of the top five banks in Nigeria in terms of loans, deposits and branch network. In fact, with its merger with Diamond Bank Plc in 2019, Access Bank becomes the largest bank in Nigeria and Africa by customer base (36 million customers), with a network of over 600 branches and service outlets covering three continents and 12 countries.\n\nThe story of infrastructural development, not only in Nigeria, but in Sub-Saharan Africa, cannot be complete without mentioning the contribution of the burgeoning bank. As one of the nation\u2019s foremost corporate bankers, Wigwe has helped develop some of continent\u2019s biggest companies in the construction, telecommunications, energy and oil and gas sectors through the provision of financial support and expertise, particularly MTN.\n\nDespite its successes, Wigwe is not contended with been a local player. He has continued to look at opportunities to build the bank\u2019s network in global trade and payment centres.\n\nThe bank recently acquired controlling stakes in several African banks, including South Africas 74-year-old Grobank for $60 million; Kenyas Transnational Bank and Zambia-based Cavmont Bank.\n\nUnder his leadership, Access Bank has received many awards. They include the BusinessDay Bank/CEO of the Year awards; Outstanding Business Sustainability Achievement Award by Karlsruhe.\n\nIn 2016, the Boys Brigade (BB), inaugurated Wigwe as Patron for the Lagos State Council in recognition of his exemplary role in the society and contributions to youth development.\n\nBorn on August 15, 1966 in Lagos to parents of Ikwerre descent from Omueke Isiokpo, Wigwe attended the University of Nigeria where he acquired a degree in accountancy, an MA in Banking and Finance from the University College of North Wales and an M.Sc in Financial Economics from the University of London. He is also an Alumnus of the Harvard Business School Executive Management Program.\n\nThe Access Bank CEO started his professional career at Coopers & Lybrand, Lagos as a management consultant, later qualifying as a chartered accountant.\n\nAfter a brief stint at Capital Bank, he joined GTBank where he spent over a decade working in corporate and institutional banking, rising to become the executive director in charge of institutional banking.\n\nSince January 2014, he has been the chief executive officer and Group managing director of Access Bank. Before then, he served as the bank\u2019s deputy managing director for over a decade.\n\nApart from being the current Chairman of Access Bank (UK) Limited, Wigwe is a board member of Nigerian Mortgage Refinance Company and a member of the advisory Board for Friends Africa.\n\nHe is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN FCA), a Fellow of The Institute of Credit Administration, and an Honorary member of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria.

Abuja is a planned city, and when you don\u2019t use a particular plot for what it\u2019s meant to be, it becomes a problem, so you create problems for everybody living in the city,\u201d he stressed.\n\nThe enforcement team also raided and cleared makeshift shops and shanties inside an illegal market, along corridors of residential areas, behind Saint Mary and Alfred School, adjacent Main Entrance Gate of Games Village, in Kaura District.\n\nIt was observed that the affected traders were allowed to evacuate their wares from the place, before the enforcement team dismantled and cleared the debris of the structures on ground.\n\nRelated : FG Commences Clampdown On Business Using Altered Measuring Equipment",

The Pavillion which serves as Collation Centre during major elections was burnt down. In what is a major blow to our preparations for the Governorship election scheduled for 6th November 2021, two stores housing electoral materials were burnt down.\n\n\u201cNew and old (but serviceable) electric generating machines numbering 376 for all the Electoral Wards and the extra numbers for backup were completely burnt. The electric generators were recently relocated from the Local Government Areas (LGAs) to the State HQ in the belief that it is more secure than the LGA offices.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, as part of the Commission\u2019s proactive measures to ensure the success of the Governorship election later this year, about 50% of the non-sensitive materials required for the November 6, 20201 Governorship election already delivered to the State have also been lost in the fire. In addition, seven utility vehicles (Toyota Hilux) were burnt.\n\n\u201cIt will be recalled that following the fire incident on the eve of the 2019 General Election in which the Smart Card Readers for the State were destroyed, the Commission moved the replacement Smart Card Readers from the shipping containers to the concrete store for enhanced protection. Fortunately, the Smart Card Readers were not affected.\n\n\u201cAlso yesterday, our office in Ahiazu Mbaise Local Government Area was attacked at about 6.45pm in an obvious attempt to set the building ablaze. Fortunately, the damage was limited to a section of the building, specifically the windows and part of the roof. No electoral materials or office equipment were destroyed.\n\n\u201cAt about 1.00pm yesterday, our Igboeze South LGA office was attacked. The store was completely burnt down before the Neighborhood Watch and the Enugu State Fire Service responded and prevented the inferno from razing other parts of the building.\n\n\u201cThis is the third attack on INEC facilities in the State in less than two weeks following the destruction of our Udenu LGA office on 13th May 2021 and the State Headquarters building in Enugu on 16th May 2021\u201d.\n\nHe disclosed that all three incidents in Anambra, Imo and Enugu have been reported to the police for investigation.\n\n\u201cAlthough no lives were lost, these are clearly orchestrated and targeted attacks aimed at incapacitating the Commission in conducting electoral activities, especially in Anambra State.\n\n\u201cIn spite of these setbacks, the Commission is determined to continue to discharge its responsibilities including the conduct of the scheduled Anambra Governorship election\u201d, he said..",

It will make for physical distancing and will enable our ad hoc staff to carry out their constitutional and legal duties comfortably,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOkoye said that the voter registration was at the heart of the democratic process, as it would enable Nigerians who had attained the constitutional age for registration to register and exercise their democratic franchise.\n\n\u201cTherefore, Nigerians that meet the constitutional and legal threshold for registration will have the opportunity to register,\u2019\u2019 Okoye said.\n\nHe said that Yakubu, at his April 1, news conference, noted that the CRV was open to all Nigerians who were 18 years of age and have never been registered to vote.\n\nThe official said that the registration would also be opened to any registered voter, who had any issue during accreditation at previous elections, so that the agency could rectify such problems.\n\n\u201cAll registered voters who wish to transfer their voting locations from the present one to another; all registered voters who have lost their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) or whose PVCs have been defaced or damaged.\n\n\u201cAlso to all registered voters, who wish to correct their information such as misspellings of names, dates of birth etc,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

          "text": "* Approves rehabilitation of grazing reserves, equipped with veterinary clinics, schools, housing for herdsmen\n\n*Queries the power of the governors to ban open grazing\n\nBy Bayo Onanuga\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari mocked southern governors on Monday over their ban of open grazing of cattle, the cause of deadly clashes between herdsmen and farmers and also a factor in the banditry and kidnapping that have made many parts of Nigeria unsafe.\n\nIn a statement that betrayed Buhari\u2019s bias in statecraft, he dismissed the ban on open grazing by the governors, which was earlier endorsed by their northern counterparts.\n\nHe said the ban was a mere \u2018attempt\u2019,at banning and merely demonstrated \u201cother acts of politicking intended by its signatories to demonstrate their power\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is very clear that there was no solution offered from their resolutions to the herder-farmer clashes that have been continuing in our country for generations\u201d, Buhari said in a statement issued by spokesman Garba Shehu.\n\n\u201cBut the citizens of the southern states \u2013 indeed citizens of all states of Nigeria \u2013 have a right to expect their elected leaders and representatives to find answers to challenges of governance and rights, and not to wash their hands off hard choices by, instead, issuing bans that say: \u201cnot in my state,\u201d Buhari stressed.\n\nThe Aso Rock statement also repeated the fallacy by the Attorney General of the Federation that the governors have no power to ban open grazing, by comparing herdsmen with auto spare parts sellers, who are ubiquitous in many states.\n\n\u201cIt is equally true that their announcement is of questionable legality, given the Constitutional right of all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and freedoms within every one of our 36 states (and FCT) -regardless of the state of their birth or residence\u201d.\n\nThe Presidential statement then grandly announced what was deemed to be a solution to the herdsmen crisis, as approved by the president as far back as April.\n\nThe measures included the reactivation of grazing reserves from June, in states, \u201ctruly committed to the solution and compliant with stated requirements\u201d.\n\nUnder the plan, \u201cveterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families including schooling, will be provided in \u201cthese rehabilitated reserves\u201d.\n\nThe statement skirted the issue of ranching and only made cattle rearing a Federal business.\n\nGarba Shehu said President Buhari, has expressed a strong resolve to address the conflicts of herders and farmers in a sustained and lasting manner that should lead to the emergence of a permanent solution to the frequent clashes between them, as well as the associated problem of the gun-wielding \u201ckiller herdsmen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President had approved a number of specific measures to bring a permanent end to the frequent skirmishes as recommended by Alhaji Sabo Nanono, the Minister of Agriculture in a report he submitted and the President signed off on it back in April, well before the actions of the Southern Governors Forum which attempts to place a ban on open grazing and other acts of politicking intended by its signatories to demonstrate their power.\n\n\u201cFortunately, this declaration has been preempted, for whatever it is intended to achieve and Mr. President, who has rightly been worried about these problems more than any other citizen in consultation with farmers and herders alike, commissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the states, starting with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant with stated requirements.\n\n\u201cWith veterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families including schooling \u2013 through these rehabilitated reserves, the Federal Government is making far-reaching and practical changes allowing for different communities to co-exist side-by-side: supporting farmers to till their fields, herders to rear their livestock and Nigerians everywhere to be safe.\n\n\u201cThe entire country is acutely aware of the strain the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on public finances, for both Federal and States.\n\n\u201cStill, given the pressing urgency of addressing the perennial challenges, the federal funding for the project that has been delayed is now being partly unlocked.\n\n\u201cActual work for the full actualization of the modern reserve system in a few of the consenting states should take off in June\u201d, the statement said.",

President Muhammadu Buhari, Mr Shehu said, has indicated a strong commitment to resolving herder conflicts, as well as the problem of gun-wielding \u201ckilling herdsmen.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the \u201cPresident had approved a number of specific measures to bring a permanent end to the frequent skirmishes as recommended by Alhaji Sabo Nanono, the Minister of Agriculture, in a report he submitted and the President signed off on back in April, well before the actions of the Southern Governors Forum, which attempted to place a ban on open grazing and other acts of politicking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is apparent that their resolutions did not provide a solution to the herder-farmer conflicts that have raged in our nation for generations.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, inhabitants of the southern states \u2013 indeed, people of all Nigerian states \u2013 have a right to expect their elected leaders and representatives to find solutions to governance and human rights concerns, rather than to wash their hands of difficult decisions by issuing prohibitions that declare, \u201cNot in my state.\u201d\n\nMr Shehu further stated that their announcement is problematic in legal terms.\n\nHe underlined the constitutional right of all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and freedoms in each of our 36 states (and the Federal Capital Territory), regardless of where they were born or live.\n\n\u201cFortunately, this declaration has been preempted, for whatever purpose it is intended, and Mr. President, who has rightly been concerned about these issues more than any other citizen, commissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the states, beginning with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant, in consultation with farmers and herders alike.\n\nWith veterinary clinics, animal watering stations, and schools for herders and their families, the Federal Government is bringing far-reaching and practical changes to these rehabilitated areas, allowing various populations to coexist side by side: assisting farmers to till their fields, herders to rear their cattle, and Nigerians everywhere to be safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe entire country is acutely aware of the financial hardship the COVID-19 pandemic has had on both the federal and state governments. Nonetheless, given the critical need to solve the persistent problems, federal financing for the long-delayed project is now being partially freed. In a few of the agreeing states, work on fully implementing the current reserve system should begin in June.\u201d\n\nNEWS DIRECT recalls that seventeen governors from the country\u2019s southern area gathered in Asaba, Delta state, two weeks ago.\n\nA ban on open-grazing of cattle and the need for ranching are among the state governors\u2019 resolutions. The Governors also discussed the urgent necessity for reorganization in order to achieve parity with other areas.\n\nHowever, the meeting\u2019s statement has sparked arguments about whether the restriction is lawful or not.",

We are starting with government schools and will thereafter move to private schools.\n\n\u201cWe are already in good discussion with both states and private proprietors to ensure that this is done because this is the single largest investment you can make to your country, the future generation in ensuring that they get good quality education\u201d, he said.\n\nThe permanent secretary added that the conduct of the examination has been encouraging due to some new IT features introduced to checkmate issues of malpractices.\n\n\u201cThe process is seamless and with the introduction of technology, we also improving efficiency and innovations. We believe that going forward, this is something that people can look up to in a regular calendar and as a prerequisite for you to become a teacher in this country. So if you do not have this certification, you are not a teacher; you do not have the right to practice.\n\nEchono also disclosed that the ministry is collaborating with Ministry of Communication, National Identity Management Commission, NIMC, and other agencies that require data to have a situation where the identity of all primary school children will be stored as soon as a child registers in any primary school in the country.\n\n\u201cOur ultimate goal in the education sector is to be able to collaborate. We have been doing this with the Ministry of Communication, with NIMC and also with other agencies that require data.\n\n\u201cWe want a situation where from the point where a child registers in any primary school in this country up to death, you have your records, you can update them as you move on but you cannot change your identity,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, a database of all qualified teachers has been compiled, adding that the government will make available the database to states to facilitate employment of qualified teachers who are not currently engaged.\n\nOn the new salary structure of teachers approved by President Muhammadu Buhari, he said.\u201cNow, even in the public service, every day I am inundated with requests by people who originally studied education but find themselves working in different agencies and ministries, wanting to return to their original careers because now the remuneration will be higher than the civil service scale, and they even have a tenure that extends five years more than what the average civil servant will do.\n\n\u201cAnd again, we have commenced the implementation of this; we are working closely with the head of service; she\u2019s been wonderful and very supportive, and salaries and wages commission to as we speak, computing those rural allowances, science allowances, hazard and so on to ensure that teachers get their reward her on earth and not hereafter.\n\nEarlier, Mrs Jacinta Ogboso, TRCN Acting Director, Specification and Licencing disclosed that about 17,141 were to participate in the batch \u2018A\u2019 examination nationwide.\n\nWhile disclosing that Osun state has the highest number of candidates, she added that all teachers must sit and pass the examination before they would be considered as qualified teachers.\n\nSpeaking on the issue of teachers with special needs, she said that the TRCN chief executive has been addressing the issue.\n\n\u201cThe issue of people with special needs among the teachers is something that cannot be overlooked. However, there are certain issues that one cannot wake up and deal with in just one day.\n\n\u201cWe have commenced the process of addressing, identifying and knowing them. The number of those with such needs especially the visually impaired. We are already in discussion with institutions that specialise in that area like the federal college of education Oyo\u201d, she added.",

So, this expenditure is not restrictive to NHIS. We have been directed to ensure the protection of our people.\u201d\n\nOn the purchase of diesel, he explained that there was a lot of erratic supply of electricity in the previous year and there was a need to maintain a cooling system at their offices.\n\nSambo informed the lawmakers that the scheme had a huge infrastructure that required cooling.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed a strong determination to address the conflicts between herders and farmers in a sustained and long-term manner, which should result in the emergence of a permanent solution to the frequent clashes between them, as well as the associated problem of gun-wielding \u201ckiller herdsmen.\u201d\n\nThe President had approved a number of specific measures to put an end to the frequent clashes, as recommended by Alhaji Sabo Nanono, the Minister of Agriculture, in a report he submitted, and the President signed off on it back in April, well before the actions of the Southern Governors Forum, which attempted to impose a ban on open grazing and other acts of politicking intended by its signatories.\n\nIt is clear that their resolutions did not provide a solution to the herder-farmer conflicts that have raged in our country for generations.\n\nBut the citizens of the southern states \u2013 indeed citizens of all states of Nigeria \u2013 have a right to expect their elected leaders and representatives to find answers to challenges of governance and rights, and not to wash their hands off hard choices by, instead, issuing bans that say: \u201cnot in my state.\u201d\n\nIt is equally true that their announcement is of questionable legality, given the Constitutional right of all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and freedoms within every one of our 36 states (and FCT) -regardless of the state of their birth or residence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately, this declaration has been preempted, for whatever it is intended to achieve and Mr. President, who has rightly been worried about these problems more than any other citizen in consultation with farmers and herders alike, commissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the states, starting with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant with stated requirements.\n\nWith veterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families including schooling \u2013 through these rehabilitated reserves, the Federal Government is making far-reaching and practical changes allowing for different communities to co-exist side-by-side: supporting farmers to till their fields, herders to rear their livestock and Nigerians everywhere to be safe.\n\nThe entire country is acutely aware of the strain the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on public finances, for both Federal and States. Still, given the pressing urgency of addressing the perennial challenges, the federal funding for the project that has been delayed is now being partly unlocked. Actual work for the full actualization of the modern reserve system in a few of the consenting states should take off in June.",

          "text": "Protesters in Nigeria\u2019s north-central Niger state are currently demonstrating along the Abuja-Suleja-Kaduna expressway over incessant attacks by armed men in the state, with no less than 25 people reportedly kidnapped in Suleja during Monday morning\u2019s raid.\n\nSuleja is less than an hour\u2019s drive from the heart of the West African country\u2019s capital.\n\nReports suggest that the heavily armed gunmen invaded the town and the immediate villages around 7:30 am.\n\nThey stormed the area on motorcycles and were reported to have shot sporadically into the air to scare people and moved from house to house to carry out the raid.\n\nWhile some of the villagers succeeded in escaping, few others who were trapped were reportedly abducted.\n\nThe incident which occurred in Suleja is less than 10 minutes away from the nation\u2019s federal territory and 43km away from the three arms zone where the Presidential Villa, the National Assembly and the Supreme Court are situated.\n\nNiger State Governor Abubakar Bello has in recent weeks warned of an invasion of \u201cBoko Haram elements\u201d in the state he governs. The terrorists hoisted their flag after taking over a number of villages, Bello said. They intended to use the area as a base, just like Sambisa Forest in the Northeast of the country, regarded as a Boko Haram stronghold.\n\nLast week, Nigeria\u2019s Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba said in a circular to commissioners of police in Abuja and Jos, the Plateau State capital, that the force received intelligence report revealing plans by Boko Haram terrorists to attack major cities in the country, particularly Abuja and Jos.\n\nMr Baba in the memo directed the commissioners of police to review their security architecture and beef up security around government facilities particularly in the mentioned cities.\n\n\u201cThe proposed attacks would be coordinated by the duo of Muhammad Sani, a Boko Haram commander, domiciled in Sambisa Forest and his deputy, Suleiman, hibernating around Lawan Musa Zango, Gashua, Yobe State,\u201d Mr Baba had said.\n\nThe rising cases of insecurity in northern Nigeria had forced states including Yobe, Kano, Niger and Zamfara to close down schools.\n\nNigerians have also taken to Twitter to express fear and displeasure over the rise in insecurity across the country and its closeness to the country\u2019s seat of power.\n\n@UNCLE_AJALA said, \u201cWhen they said bandits were moving close to Abuja I thought it was a joke, now there\u2019s tension in Suleja after bandits kidnapped some school children, and Suleja is less than 20 mins from Abuja. If Buhari didn\u2019t tackle this insecurity with all seriousness, it may consume us all.\u201d\n\nOmo Ekiti #PadAGirlByBUTA @BookieFlair said \u201cSeries of kidnapping and butchering has been going on in Suleja for days now, no media outlet is saying anything. Nobody is talking about it.\u201d\n\nNumber1ChelseaSupporter @Omoniyi_13863 on Twitter said \u201cAbuja-Suleja-Kaduna Road Blocked, As Heavily Armed Bandits Storm Niger State, Move From House To House, Kidnap Several Residents, Whisk Them To An Unknown place. #Gauraka\n\nGb\u00e9nr\u00f3 Ad\u00e9gbol\u00e1 \u0646 @GbenroAdegbola also took to Twitter and said \u201cIrate youths in a Niger State town went on a protest this morning barricading the busy Kaduna-Abuja road with bonfire & logs, insisting to stay until insecurity is addressed.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re angered people are being abducted from house to house there on a daily basis. #TheLoomingAnarchy\u201d\n\nHe added \u201cThey\u2019re further angered that despite the presence of Zuma military barracks in the area, residents are helpless and cannot sleep well.\n\n\u201cThe situation has led to heavy traffic congestion on the road.

          "title": "Youth Advocate Releases Book On New Nigerian Vision",
          "text": "Youth advocate Seun Awogbenle has announced his new book titled \u2018The Urgency of Now: Why Nigeria Needs A vision of Prosperity, Protection and Liberty.\u2019\n\nThe book has ten chapters that discuss the imperative of visioning, leadership, youth participation and active citizenship in the country.\n\nCEO The Cable Newspaper Simon Kolawole described the book as a very important book that seeks to infuse vision, passion, and common sense into the quest for Nigeria\u2019s greatness.\n\nNigerian Economist, Tope Fasua who wrote the book\u2019s blurb described it as a very powerful book, worthy of every minute immersed in it even at a time when time has become incredibly valuable.\n\nAwogbenle said he decided to write the book after years of introspection on how he thinks Nigeria can pull back from the brink.\n\nHe said in the face of the present uncertainty and endless agitation, he is convinced that what Nigeria needs is a Vision, not secession or division.\n\n\u201cIn the book, I have taken a philosophical approach at reimagining Nigeria and its future. I argued that Nigeria has struggled with development over the years because of the absence of a binding national vision, which is the minimal and irreducible promise of country to its people regardless of their identity, creed, ethnicity, circumstance of birth and social status,\u201d Awogbenle said in a statement released in Lagos.\n\n\u201cFor some countries, the vision was the result of a well-thought-out decision, for others it was circumstantial, but at some point in their evolution, there were either defining words of promise or events that have shaped the evolution and progression of most nation.\u201d\n\nCiting examples, Awogbenle said: \u201cSingapore, an Island of impoverished people at Independence, without natural resources, created a vision that ensured that in the absence of natural resources, its population became the most important asset. Today, Singapore is one of the top 10 destinations for business and investment, its roughly 5.6 million people also have a GDP per capita which is one of the best in the world. The same can be seen in the United States of America, where the rags to riches story is not uncommon or the United Kingdom which by virtue of the Magna Carta prides itself in rule of law and a strong judicial system.\u201d\n\nThe author added that he is convinced that Nigeria can reinvent itself if the country can agree on a common vision for every of its citizen, noting that the promise will form the basis for patriotism and nationalism.\n\n\u201cI have proposed three planks (prosperity, protection, and liberty). I believe that for Nigerians to have a connection with the country, beyond their certificate of birth, ancestry and origin, there must be a state promise that guarantees citizens prosperity, protection, and liberty,\u201d he said.\n\nThe book goes further to locate a youth agenda, by putting a strong argument for young people to lead Nigeria\u2019s new vision.\n\nAwogbenle added that the book, most importantly, put the work of change in the hands of the people, noting that history has demonstrated over again that to change your own situation you must take responsibility. To therefore fix Nigeria, the people themselves who are mostly affected by the consequence of leadership and government action must take ownership, responsibility and lead the frontiers of change.",
