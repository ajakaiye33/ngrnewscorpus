I said if I\u2019m to secede, where do I go to? Who owns this country more than myself? We either succeed or fail together.\n\n\u201cNigeria will remain one country. My only regret is the number of killings happening in Nigeria every day.\n\n\u201cNo personal regret, but my only regret in life is the position of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere was healthy competition in the past among our leaders. We played politics without fear or favour, without any rancour, but now, it is a different thing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m appealing to everybody, let\u2019s have one Nigeria; a united Nigeria where everybody is equal. A united Nigeria where everybody has a right to aspire to whatever position he wants to aspire to.\n\n\u201cA united Nigeria where religion does not determine what it should be and where ethnicity does not determine what it should be,\u201d Clark said.\n\nMeanwhile, Venerable Festus Nwafili of the Anglican Church, Asokoro, who officiated the mass, urged the celebrator, as a leader, to maintain his truthful disposition.\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s expectation of you is to promote His righteous course by your words and actions. You owe the nation to speak the truth on the challenges bedeviling it,\u201d Nwafili said.\n\nAlso speaking, Sen. Seriake Dickson (PDP-Bayelsa), described Clark as an Ijaw foremost leader.\n\n\u201cHe is our father and we are very happy with the leadership he has given to our people.\n\n\u201cWe are happy with his service to Nigeria. You know, he has been everything, Commissioner of Education in old Midwest, he built all the schools.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, the school I attended in Torebeni, Bayelsa, was built by him.\n\n\u201cAnd then, he became a federal commissioner for information, became a senator, became several things.\n\n\u201cHe has been our foremost advocate, not just for the Ijaw nation, not just of the Niger Delta and the South-South, but for most, an advocate for a fair, just and equitable Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s what he has come to symbolise, and we are very happy with it,\u201d said Dickson.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Ikechukwu Odu, NSUKKA\n\nThe former governor of Anambra State, Mr Peter Obi, on Tuesday said only restructuring can end the escalating criminality, banditry and other forms of insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nMr Obi who said that those fighting against restructuring are beneficiaries of the near failed state of the nation added that the greatest fight against insecurity in the country is to put food on the tables of Nigerians.\n\nHe spoke at the Princess Alexandra Auditorium, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, UNN, during the Association of Nsukka Professors\u2019 4th Adada Lecture, tagged \u2018Restructuring, Security Challenges and Development.\u2019\n\nHe equally bemoaned the rising poverty index in the country, adding that Nigeria has more poor people than China and India put together.\n\nAlso read:\n\nHe also said that if Nigeria must grow, the nation must diversify the economy and equally invest in her youths to acquire a knowledge-based economy.\n\nMr Obi also said \u201cSecurity is the most vital ingredient in a country\u2019s existence. Any government which fails to secure the lives and properties of the citizens has failed. Unfortunately, today, we have seen the impact of insecurity in our country.\n\n\u201cNow that we have found ourselves in this mess, the best thing to do is to restructure the country. People do approach me to contest for the presidency in order to fix Nigeria, but I had always told them that I am not the solution to our problems. If you have a car that has an engine problem, would you change the driver instead of the engine? The engine of our problem in Nigeria is restructuring and until that is done, things would continue to go wrong. It is when we do this that national development can take place.\n\n\u201cWe must invest in human development through education because the more educated a society is, the more development it can attract. The per capita income of Nigerians has kissed the dust. In 1980, Nigeria\u2019s per capita income was $875, China was $ 190. This is to show that China was far below Nigeria then. Today, China\u2019s per capita income has risen to about $12,000, while Nigeria is about $2000. This is one of the reasons we should restructure Nigeria in order to put things right,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in his address, the President, Association of Nsukka Professors, ANP, Prof. Osy Okanya, said the lecture became necessary in order to provide solutions to the heightened and fragile security situation in the country.\n\nHe also said \u201c\u2026 perhaps it is correct to admit that Nigeria\u2019s political architecture has become so dislocated and disrupted that without urgent structural and institutional re-alignment, Nigeria, likened to a floating Calabash, will on its own implode sooner than later. What is, however, depressing and frightening is that while a vibrant section of the Nigerian State has continued to point at the official actions and inactions that accentuate the fault lines, certain sections of the state appear impervious to the steady manifestations of symptoms of state failure and collapse.\u201d\n\nAlso, in his address, the chairman of the occasion, Sir Chinyeaka Ohaa, charged members of ANP, to use their platform to explore all the areas of life necessary for the growth and development of their environment and the nation at large.\n\nOhaa equally enjoined the association to champion the reactivation of Ogurugu River Jetty, which according to him, was the landing post for the British colonial influence in the region.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, on Tuesday, declared open a public consultation on the review of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) in Ado-Ekiti, with a call for the devolution of power and allocation of more resources to the federating units and building a nation where justice and peace reign.\n\nThe one-day consultation was held to harmonise views of the Government and people of Ekiti State on the review process of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\nThis is in furtherance to the announcement by the National Assembly on the commencement of the exercise as part of efforts aimed at ensuring active participation of Nigerians in the proposed alteration of some provisions of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe consultation forum which was chaired by renowned Law Professor and former Vice Chancellor, Ekiti State University, Ado-Ekiti, Akin Oyebode, featured paper presentation of the positions of the three arms of government, eminent personalities and Civil Society Organisations.\n\nFayemi said the 1999 Constitution had been under severe criticism because it was largely a product of military decrees, adding that it did not emanate from process of public involvement, consultation nor pass through any referendum.\n\nAccording to him, attempts to review, rewrite, amend and change the constitution have led to several conferences and discussions that were not inclusive due to the manner the conferences were conducted as well as the polarization of some of the debates.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, constitutional making and review have always been a challenging issue in any society, and the reason for the challenges is not farfetched. The constitution is expected to put together the value, commitment, aspiration, interest and agreement of different groups, communities and individuals.\n\n\u201cAs polarizing as the issues are with meaningful engagement, all-inclusive participation and gathering public opinion we can resolve the contention and agree on some of the issues in the interest of our nation. And as I have always stated that the interest of our dear nation should be placed far above personal interest, the Governor said.\n\nThe Governor proposed that the idea of restructuring must be motivated by a generational responsibility to build a nation where justice and peace reign and made a call for devolution of power and allocation of more resources to the federating units.\n\nHe urged the review committee to critically work and concentrate on the defects of the 1999 Constitution and tap from the resources of constitutional reform veterans like Professor Oyebode, Bishop Ajakaiye, and Dr Kunle Olajide who participated actively in the 2014 National Conference in order to enrich their suggestions and recommendations.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman of the Consultation, Prof Akin Oyebode in his remarks described the 1999 Constitution as a military documents, adding that this was not the first time Ekiti would be participating in the reform of the country\u2019s constitution.\n\nHe lamented that the recommendations of the 2014 Constitutional Conference organised by the President Goodluck Jonathan administration have been conserved to an historical document.\n\nSome of the speakers, who made presentations at the forum included the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Olawale Fapohunda; Speaker Ekiti State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon Funminiyi Afuye represented by his Deputy, Hakeem Jamiu; Chief Judge of Ekiti State, Justice Ayodeji Daramola represented by Justice John Adeyeye; Chairman Traditional Rulers Council and Alawe of Ilawe Ekiti, Oba Ajibade Alabi, Bishop, Catholic Diocese of Ekiti, Rev Felix Ajakaiye and Chairman Ekiti State Civil Society Organisation, Professor Christopher Oluwadare.\n\nMajor issues raised at the conference included, the need for financial autonomy of the legislature and judiciary, state and religion, gender equality for women and girls, public revenue, fiscal federalism and revenue allocation, Nigeria police reform and security architectures, local government autonomy, electoral reforms and judicial reform.",

          "text": "Northern Elders Forum, NEF, has declared support for the ban on open grazing by governors of the southern states.\n\nAbout 17 southern governors had held an emergency meeting in Asaba, Delta State to proffer solutions to increasing security issues in the country and there they announced the ban on open and called for restructuring.\n\nNEF said that it support any programmed transition that will eliminate open grazing and the establishment of productive, safe and sustainable options in managing the country\u2019s huge national asset in animal husbandry.\n\nIn a statement signed by its Director, Publicity and Advocacy Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, and made available to DAILY POST on Tuesday, the forum warned that the solution being sought cannot be achieved with threats and harassment, but with commitment and collaboration involving all governments and stakeholders.\n\n\u201cIt is in everyone\u2019s interests to support an urgent national initiative that will engineer a safe and productive transition to the end of open grazing.In the meantime, the forum must warn those attacking and killing Fulani headers to stop,\u201d NEF said.\n\n\u201cThere are limits to every community\u2019s tolerance, and the forum strongly advises that lines are respected in the manner we treat Nigerians who are vulnerable wherever they live.\n\n\u201cThe forum has always supported initiatives that improve the quality of inputs into how Nigerians can address the limitations in the manner the country is operated.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the current efforts of the National Assembly to amend the constitution enjoys little or no confidence among Nigerians that they will address the fundamental challenges which need to be comprehensively addressed, although this can be redressed if our elected representatives recognize the historic opportunities they have to move this country beyond its strangulating challenges.\n\n\u201cThe negative attitude of the Presidency towards engaging Nigerians to tap into ideas, grievances and goodwill of many citizens who mean well is ill-informed and, under our current circumstances, dangerous.\n\n\u201cSo are postures that issue opportunistic ultimatums over convening national dialogue by the President. The forum supports a citizen-driven national dialogue and a campaign to get the government to accord its outcome the respect it deserves.\n\n\u201cThe forum extends its hands to groups that genuinely believe that Nigerians should demand and design the type of country we want, and should not wait for people we elected to set the boundaries and conditions of our existence.\n\n\u201cThe forum restates that the North will not be cowed and stampeded into escorting political ambitions of politicians at the cost of its rights, security and dignity.\n\n\u201cIt demands that President Buhari asserts the powers our constitution gives him to protect our territorial integrity and secure citizens, or accept that he is incapable of leading the nation through these unprecedented challenges.\n\n\u201cGovernors in the South must be unambiguous in their condemnation and resistance against these dangerous activities. They cannot continue to walk on both sides of the street.\n\n\u201cNorthern governors should note that they are rapidly receding into irrelevance as desperate citizens chalk up their silence over multiple assaults in a country where they have equal rights to their security and dignity.\n\n\u201cIf our country is to survive its current difficulties and build a better nation, President Buhari must improve his levels of competence, awareness that the nation is sliding into disaster and sensitivity to the frustrations of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cOverwhelming majority of Nigerians do not want war or an end to our union. We just want an end to insecurity, escalating cost of living and the hate and the fear which our leaders are triggering.\n\n\u201cThe forum restates its readiness to engage any group of Nigerians in exploring productive paths to a better future.What it will not do is to watch as the North is damaged further by cynical southern politicians and adventurers who think the North is too weak to protect its own interests.\n\n\u201cThe forum once again condoles the nation and families of Lt-Gen I Attahiru and other military officers who died in active duty.May God bestow His Mercies on their souls.\u201d",

That the NYSC has evolved over the years in fulfilling its mandate of bridging ethnic and religious divisions in Nigeria and fostering the spirit of Nigerian nationalism is a statement of fact.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, worrisome that some vested interest would attempt to push for the scrapping of such as initiative that is well-grounded to address the various ethnic and religious agitations and tensions in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, the considered view of the Centre for Social Justice, Equity and Transparency that the call for the scrapping of the NYSC is not only disjointed, it is also of poor taste and a puerile attempt at plunging the country into a crisis of unimaginable proportion.\n\n\u201cIt is also our considered view that the selfish proponents of the Bill seeking for the scrapping of the NYSC failed to realize that hundreds of thousands of young Nigerian graduates look forward to participating in the one-year mandatory service.\n\n\u201cThey also failed to realize that the one-year service year provides most youths with the opportunity for self-reliance in preparation for life ahead through the allowances paid to them and the experiences they go through in their service year.\n\n\u201cThe Centre for Social Justice, Equity and Transparency is therefore alarmed that the Bill seeking for the scrapping of the NYSC has reached second reading in the House of Representatives. This is indicative that patriotism in Nigeria has been thrown to the dogs.\n\n\u201cIt is also indicative that some people have sold their souls to the devil in return for a plate of porridge hence the inglorious attempt at seeking for the scrapping of such an initiative that is more needed and relevant in the country now in the critical point of our existence where there have been politically motivated calls for separation in various parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThe Centre for Social Justice, Equity and Transparency states unequivocal terms that the Bill is anti-youth, anti-people, misplaced and targeted at removing the last institutional framework for national stability and national cohesion to satisfy the criminal mindset of a few Nigerians hiding in the National Assembly as lawmakers.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the press conference calling on all well-meaning Nigerians to see this attempt as an affront to our sensibilities by a select few that are hell-bent on destabilizing the youthful population in Nigeria, which on its own is a recipe for conflict.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that the agents seeking to destabilize the country are behind the Bill and call on all Nigerians to mobilize in their large number to stop the Bill as quickly as possible because if there is any crucial moment in history to reinforce the essence of the Scheme, it\u2019s now.\u201d",

This will promote peace and unity in the party.\u201d\n\nThey also passed a vote of confidence on Obaseki while hailing him for his good work, infrastructural and human capital developments.\n\nIt was however gathered the takeover of the former APC secretariat by PDP members loyal to Obaseki was a prelude to having Anslem Ojezua, the immediate factional chairman of APC, who defected with Obaseki become chairman of the PDP.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn May 10, the Dr. Tony Aziegbemi-led State Working Committee (SWC) of Edo PDP reported Obaseki to members of the Prince Uche Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC) over his alleged plot to dissolve the PDP\u2019s executives at the ward, local government and state levels to accommodate those who defected with Obaseki.\n\nThey described the plot as undemocratic and unacceptable while asking Edo Governor to drop his deputy, Philip Shaibu, for full harmonisation.\n\nOn May 12, Obaseki met with members of PDP SWC while begging them to sheathe their swords to move the party forward.\n\nBut some stakeholders insisted the Governor should not be trusted with the olive branch he extended to SWC members",

          "text": "By Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has warned that the state government will no longer pay salaries of the state\u2019s chapter of Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) if it fails to call off its strike by the end of May.\n\nWike insisted that there was no basis for JUSUN strike in Rivers because the judiciary was already enjoying financial autonomy and improved staff welfare.\n\nThe governor spoke on Tuesday in Port Harcourt at the special court session in honour of the retiring Chief Judge of Rivers State, Justice Adama Iyayi-Lamikanra.\n\nHe explained that the state was not unaware of the agreement among the Federal Government, the Governors Forum and JUSUN on the implementation of financial autonomy for the judiciary and legislative branches across the country.\n\nBut he said: \u201cWe would therefore neither set up any new implementation Committee because it\u2019s simply unnecessary, nor allow the state\u2019s judiciary to submit its budget directly to the state House of Assembly in breach of extant fiscal policies and regulations that regulate the state\u2019s budgeting process.\u201d\n\nWike took a swipe at the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) for instigating unnecessary tension in the state over the appointment of a chief Judge.\n\nHe also castigated International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA) for making \u2018misguided noises\u2019 on gender equality because a woman was not recommended by the National Judicial Council to succeed Justice Adama Iyayi-Lamikanra.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe governor maintained that in the appointment of an Acting Chief judge, the most senior judge in the hierarchy remained an absolute condition.\n\nHe said the condition was not the same in the appointment of a substantive chief judge.\n\nHe said: \u201cApart from the basic qualifications, sound character, ability to lead and work harmoniously with colleagues, hard work and willingness to take on challenging cases without a penchant for returning files for reassignment on flimsy excuses are some of accepted dispositional requirements for such very important appointment.\n\n\u201cAt any rate, the state Judicial Service Commission could not have recommended a judicial officer who has become notorious for returning casefiles for reassignment on flimsy excuses to the prime position of chief judge.\n\n\u201cNo one should have expected the State\u2019s Judicial Service Commission to recommend for appointment as chief judge a judicial officer who had promised to reopen disciplinary cases already dealt with and reinstate persons duly disciplined for corrupt practices and abuse of office.\n\n\u201cAnd no one could have convinced the State Judicial Service Commission to recommend for appointment as a chief judge a judicial officer who had promised to work with the political opposition to make the upcoming political transition process very turbulent and difficult for the state.\u201d\n\nThe governor extoled Justice Iyayi-Lamikanra as a bold, fearless and courageous judge who resisted political pressures and halted the sitting of the kangaroo judicial panel of inquiry set up by the previous governor to indict his political reputation on spurious charges and fabricated facts.\n\nHe stressed that under the leadership of Justice Iyayi-Lamikanra the state\u2019s judiciary effectively enjoyed both administrative and financial autonomy never before experienced in this state.\n\nThe governor presented to her the certificate of occupancy of a new deluxe home built for her by the state government and keys for a brand-new sport utility vehicle and a Hilux van.\n\nIn her remarks, Justice Iyayi-Lamikanra said she would eternally be grateful to Wike, who made it possible for her to emerge as the 8th Chief Judge of the state despite being a non-indigene.\n\nShe said: \u201cNot standing on ceremonies and putting aside all the sentiments and prejudices that have hobbled this otherwise great country of our since its founding. His Excellency, as if against the run of play, appointed me the chief judge on 8th day of March, 2016, making me the second non-Rivers indigene.\u201d\n\nShe described the JUSUN strike as unnecessary because the state judiciary was currently enjoying full financial autonomy.\n\nShe urged the striking workers to call off the strike in the interest of dispensation of justice.\n\nAlso, Rivers State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Prof. Zacchaeus Adangor lauded Justice Iyayi-Lamikanra for developing a unique style of saving precious judicial time that ensured speedy determination of cases and matters before her.\n\nHe said: \u201cYour service to the Rivers State judiciary and contributions to the development of our law and the sustainable growth of the legal profession will forever be appreciated by all men of goodwill.\u201d\n\nFormer President of the Nigeria Bar Association, Onueze C.J. Okocha (SAN), said Justice Iyayi-Lamikanra judicial career was unblemished and commended her for digitalisation of the state judiciary.",

This is also as the APC administration has failed to take decisive steps to protect INEC facilities from assailants.\n\n\u201cOur party wants the APC to know that May 29, 2023 date is sacrosanct for it to leave office, free our nation from its stranglehold and fizzle out from our political firmament.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIndeed, history will not be kind to APC and its leaders given the magnitude of atrocities they have committed against Nigerians in a space of six years.\n\n\u201cThe APC has destroyed our nation, opened our dear fatherland to bandits and terrorists, turned our nation into an expansive killing field and a large funeral palour.\n\n\u201cAPC has wrecked our economy, opened our national vaults to its leaders to pillage over N15 trillion naira and reduced our once thriving country to a beggar nation while mortgaging our future with humongous foreign debts\u201d.\n\nThe PDP called on the Inspector General of Police to immediately invite and question APC leaders over the burning of INEC offices.\n\n\u201cNigerians also expect the police to immediately place APC leaders and their thugs on watch list as a firm step to guarantee the security of INEC facilities and other institutions of democracy in the country.\n\n\u201cThe PDP also calls on Nigerians, across board, to remain at alert and unite in prayers so that our nation survives the next two years under the vindictive, insensitive, incompetent, treasury looting, divisive and violent APC and its administration.\n\n\u201cOur party further urges Nigerians not to be deterred by the actions of the APC but to remain united in rallying in the defense of our democracy to rescue our nation from the misrule of the APC,\u201d the PDP added.",

          "text": "\u2022Okays ranching, revival of grazing reserves\u2019 take-off in June\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday took issue with Southern governors over their ban on open cattle grazing in the region.\n\nThe president, in a statement by his media assistant, Mallam Garba Shehu, described the ban, announced as one of the resolutions the 17 governors from the zone made during their May 11 meeting in Asaba, Delta State, as of questionable legality.\n\nAccording to him, the governors\u2019 action is of \u201cquestionable legality, given the constitutional right of all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and freedoms within every one of our 36 states (and FCT)-regardless of the state of their birth or residence.\u201d\n\nBuhari, hoever, approved ranching and revival of grazing reserves nationwide.\n\nThe president\u2019s stance on the Southern governors\u2019 Asaba Declaration came a few days after the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), expressed similar views.\n\nMalami, while fielding questions on a live television programme, had kicked against the open grazing ban, saying it was unconstitutional.\n\nThe AGF had compared the Southern governors\u2019 decision to their Northern counterparts banning spare parts trading in the North, considering the fact that the majority of spare parts traders in the North are from the South.\n\nHe had said: \u201cIt is about constitutionality. Within the context of the freedoms enshrined in our constitution, can you deny a right of a Nigerian? It is as good as saying maybe the Northern governors coming together to say that they prohibit spare parts trading in the North. Does it hold water? Does it hold water for a Northern governor to come and state expressly that he now prohibits spare parts trading in the North?\u201d\n\nHowever, Malami came under fire over his criticism, with the Southern governors daring him to challenge their decision in the court.\n\nChairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, had described Malami\u2019s opposition to the ban on open cattle grazing as \u201cwicked and arrogant.\u201d\n\nSome senior lawyers and the Founder of Stanbic IBTC and Anap Foundation, Mr. Atedo Peterside, also criticised the minister for his comments.\n\nWhile the pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, and the spokesman of the Senate had called on Buhari to remove the minister for opposing the ban, the South-east Governors\u2019 Forum had said those who opposed the ban wanted the killings to continue.\n\nBut Buhari, while rejecting the governors\u2019 ban, expressed the determination of his administration to address the conflicts of herders and farmers in a sustained and lasting manner that should lead to the emergence of a permanent solution to the frequent clashes between them, as well as the associated problem of the gun-wielding \u201ckiller herdsmen.\u201d\n\nThe statement from the presidency said Buhari had approved some measures to permanently end the frequent skirmishes between farmers and herders as recommended by the Minister of Agriculture, Alhaji Sabo Nanono.\n\nThe statement added that Nanono had submitted a report detailing the recommendations to the president, who endorsed it in April, \u201cwell before the actions of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, which attempts to place a ban on open grazing and other acts of politicking intended by its signatories to demonstrate their power.\u201d\n\nThe president said the Southern governors\u2019 resolutions didn\u2019t offer any solution to the herder-farmer clashes that have been continuing in the country for generations.\n\nHe said: \u201cBut the citizens of the Southern states\u2013 indeed citizens of all states of Nigeria\u2013 have a right to expect their elected leaders and representatives to find answers to challenges of governance and rights, and not to wash their hands off hard choices by, instead, issuing bans that say: \u201cnot in my state.\u201d\n\nThe statement said: \u201cFortunately, this declaration has been pre-empted, for whatever it is intended to achieve, and Mr. President, who has rightly been worried about these problems more than any other citizens in consultation with farmers and herders alike, commissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the states, starting with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant with stated requirements.\n\n\u201cWith veterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families including schooling \u2013 through these rehabilitated reserves, the federal government is making far-reaching and practical changes allowing for different communities to co-exist side-by-side: supporting farmers to till their fields, herders to rear their livestock and Nigerians everywhere to be safe.\u201d\n\nIt added that despite the COVID-19 pandemic that took a toll on public finances, the federal funding for the forest reserve project is ready and will take off in interested states by June.\n\n\u201cThe entire country is acutely aware of the strain the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on public finances, for both federal and states. Still, given the pressing urgency of addressing the perennial challenges, the federal funding for the project that has been delayed is now being partly unlocked. Actual work for the full actualisation of the modern reserve system in a few of the consenting states should take off in June,\u201d the statement said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "OPS Excited over Manufacturing Sector\u2019s Recovery from COVID-19 Headwinds",
          "text": "By Dike Onwuamaeze\n\nThe Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) and the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) have expressed excitement over the rebound of the manufacturing sector in the first quarter of 2021, which recorded a growth rate that was higher than its pre-COVID-19 performance.\n\nData released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Sunday showed that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 0.51 per cent (year-on-year) in the first quarter of 2021, (Q1 2021) compared with the 0.11 per cent recorded in the fourth quarter (Q4) 2020.\n\nThe data also showed that the manufacturing sector recorded a 3.40 per cent growth rate in Q1 2021 after recording negative growth in the Q4 of 2020.\n\nIn addition, its Q1 2021 performance was also higher than the 0.81 per cent and 0.43 per cent it recorded in Q1 2019 and Q1 2020 respectively, which were pre-COVID-19 era.\n\nMAN Director-General, Mr. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, while reacting to the GDP report said yesterday that the reported 3.40 per cent growth rate of the manufacturing sector in Q1 2021 came as a surprise, giving the numerous challenges facing the sector.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are currently experiencing the rising cost of manufacturing inputs, so it is surprising to see a rate higher than the rate of 0.81per cent in Q1 2019 and 0.43 per cent of Q1 2020, which were relatively stable periods.\n\n\u201cIn Q1 2021, manufacturing activities more or less rebounded to the level of pre-COVID-19 period. So, it is expected that the sector will present a better performance in Q1 2021 than what obtained in Q4 2020. Particularly the food, beverage, and tobacco and the chemical and pharmaceutical sub-sectors are expected to post higher growths due to the relatively higher capacities utilisation they enjoyed since 2020.\n\n\u201cIn addition, it is not out of place for the cement and basic metal, iron, and steel sector to present high growths in Q1 2021 due to the increased level of construction work going on in different parts of the country backed by government spending across the country.\u201d\n\nHe added that the NBS\u2019s Q1 2021 report on the manufacturing sector corroborated MAN\u2019s Manufacturers CEOs Confidence Index (MCCI) of Q1 2021. The MCCI is a quarterly survey of the manufacturing sector. Its index showed improvement in the confidence of manufacturers in a good number of manufacturing sectoral groups.\n\nHe, however, appealed to the \u201cgovernment to intensify its intervention initiatives and follow through on the cost reduction aspect of ease of doing business. There is urgent need to create a friendlier operating environment and deliberately support the productive sector in a strategic manner.\u201d\n\nLCCI Director-General, Dr. Muda Yusuf, also stated that the recovery of the manufacturing sector from a negative growth territory in Q4 2020 to a positive growth level of 3.4 per cent in Q1 2021 was a surprise.\n\nYusuf said: \u201cThe sector has been grappling with an unprecedented foreign exchange illiquidity crisis over the past few months. This is coupled with the structural, policy, institutional and macroeconomic challenges that have bedeviled the sector. The data does not reflect the reality of the experiences of most manufacturers.\u201d\n\nBut the Chief Consultant of the B. Adedipe Associates Limited, Dr. Biodun Adedipe, said during the breakfast meeting of the Nigeria-South Africa Chamber of Commerce held last Thursday that the country\u2019s manufacturing sector was recovering contrary to the sentiments that the manufacturing entities are closing down.\n\nAccording to him, there are enough activities along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and the Ogun State corridor where new factories are sprouting up to confirm the survey outcomes of the NBS.\n\nHe said: \u201cThese things are real. I can tell you here on authority that there are many conversations with foreign investors trying to put money into manufacturing in Nigeria as we speak. These are real foreign investors. I will not want us to go with the sentiment that nothing is happening there. You will see manufacturing always growing.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "After his arrest, Eze Ebuka insisted he was not a cultist, so SARS tortured him into admitting he was.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m Eze Ebuka, a welder, and the first in a family of three.\n\nEze Ebuka\n\nThis is my SARS story.\n\nAround 1 am on Saturday, May 23, 2020, my sleep was disturbed by loud knocking on the door of the main entrance of my home in Ekwulobia, a town in Anambra state.\n\nFive officers of the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Nigeria police had come in over the fence, with guns and machetes, screaming my name.\n\nMy mother opened our door, asking why they were calling me at that hour. They said they had a message for me. My mother asked why they did not wait till daybreak. They did not answer, and instead forced their way past my mother, and into our house. They barged into my room - meeting me in my shorts. The officers asked me to throw on some clothes, then scattered my room, looking for something.\n\nI did not know what they were looking for but it was clear they didn\u2019t find it. They then handcuffed me, told my mother they had come from the Central Police Station (CPS) in Nnewi, 25 kilometers west of Ekwulobia. The officers said my mother would have to go to CPS if she wanted to know why I was being arrested.\n\nOn the way to the station, the officers asked me to provide names of five cult members if I wanted to be released. I told them I wasn\u2019t a cultist and did not know any cult members. But they accused me of lying and said they would make me confess at the station.\n\n\n\nForced confession\n\nWe got to the station at 3 a.m. and I was taken into custody with five other boys they had arrested that morning. I was told I would be the first suspect to be tortured in order for me to confess my cult membership.\n\nI was led somewhere within the station where I was asked to sit on the ground. They asked again if I was a cultist, and I continued to defend myself. I told them that I had a legitimate job that occupied me from the early hours of the day into late night. I told them I had nothing to do with cultists, and I knew of no other family member associated with cultism.\n\nThey didn\u2019t believe me. They started to torture me. They bound my legs and hands behind my back, with my head facing the ground. Two of the officers then put rods between my hands and legs, which they used to lift me so I\u2019d be suspended in the air.\n\nLet me tell you, it was a nightmare.\n\nThe rod started to injure my hands and legs, so I started crying. It was unbearable, and I remember shouting for help. Some officers came in, and I told them, out of desperation, that I was a cult member. I had no choice. I just wanted the torture to end.\n\n\u201cDo you belong to Aromate (a notorious cult group that usually causes trouble around the Ekwulobia town)?\u201d they asked.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I responded. I was at my breaking point.\n\n\u201cWhen did you join the cult?\u201d they asked.\n\n\u201cJanuary,\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cHow many members were there when you got initiated?\u201d\n\n\u201cFive,\u201d I lied in response.\n\nThey then told me that I had my finger punctured for a blood covenant as part of my initiation process. This was not a question - they were establishing it and asking me to accept it as truth. They were telling me what to say to suit their agenda.\n\nAfter they were satisfied that I was not resisting, they brought me down. They tortured the other five boys, most of whom were quick to admit to being cult members to escape being tortured.\n\nWe were then asked to write statements, which was further torture for me as my hands and fingers had become numb.\n\nInside the cell, we were beaten by the other inmates. At night, I could not sleep, not only because I was in pain, but also because there was no space for me to even lay my head.\n\nThe cell conditions were terrible. Inmates urinated and emptied their bowels at the same place they slept. The officers did not care whether we ate or not - I only drank water, as they didn\u2019t allow my people to bring me food.\n\nAll the officers cared about was when our relatives would come to bail us, or if we wanted to make calls to our relatives at a fee they would charge us.\n\nMost people I met in the cell seemed to have stories that suggested they had been wrongly arrested. Some of them told me they had been arrested in place of their sons, whom SARS officers had come in search of and hadn\u2019t found.\n\nI later learned that three of my uncles drove for one hour to the station on the evening of the day of my arrest, but the SARS officers had told them that the officer in charge (OC) was not around. My uncles had to leave and come back again, only to be told the same story. The officers said the OC was yet to return and that it was not possible to obtain bail on a Sunday. My uncles tried again on Monday, then Tuesday, all without success.\n\nOne of my uncles got annoyed and threatened to sue unless the officers provided evidence of my cult membership, to which the officers responded by revealing that their OC had miraculously returned.\n\nThey asked my family to pay 200,000 naira before they would let me go. My family raised half the money, but the officers claimed it was not enough, especially as it was a cult case.\n\nAfter three days of detention, the officers accepted the 100,000 naira and let me go.\n\nBack to a difficult life\n\nMy mother cried when I returned home.\n\nBefore my arrest, I had been saving up to buy my own tools to help me grow out of my apprenticeship, but my savings were pumped into negotiating my freedom.\n\nFollowing my injuries from the torture, I was stuck at home for three weeks, unable to work.\n\nIn my neighbourhood, people really believed that I was a cultist, after hearing that I had confessed to being one. They said I was a sheep in wolf\u2019s clothing, a cult member pretending to be a \u2018holy boy\u2019.\n\nTo clear my name, I had to go to the local government office to get a court affidavit rejecting cultism. But not even this could change what people thought of me.\n\nI will never forget what I went through. I doubt if I am over it. SARS wounded my body and destroyed my reputation.\n\nIt was not a funny experience.\n\n_______\n\nThis story is part of a multimedia project by Tiger Eye Foundation and media partners across Nigeria, documenting police brutality in Nigeria, and advocating for police reform.",

          "title": "Jo\u2019Burg, Marrakesh, Lagos: Which African cities have the highest internet speeds?",
          "text": "In a world of online gaming, Zoom meetings and video-on-demand streaming, internet speed is everything.\n\nTo watch Netflix in high-definition, your internet download speed must be at least 5 megabits per second (Mbps), while ultra-high-definition requires 25 Mbps. A clear and stable Facebook Live or Twitch stream requires an upload speed of up to 5 Mbps. On Zoom, group video calls in full HD require between 3 and 3.8Mbps.\n\nAs these services acquire more global audiences, the internet needs to be faster everywhere to provide uniform experiences to users. So how does speed vary within Africa, and when compared with countries outside the continent?\n\nSouth Africa leads mobile, Ghana fixed broadband\n\nUsers can test internet speed using a number of options. Netflix launched fast.com five years ago and it\u2019s a pretty handy tool. But to compare speeds across geographies, we will rely on data from Speedtest Global Index, a service owned by Ookla, a US-based internet analytics company.\n\nSpeedtest provides data for mobile and fixed broadband internet for more than 130 countries around the world. Mobile broadband is the connection available through SIM card-based network operators while fixed broadband typically requires a cable connection.\n\nAccording to their latest data for the first quarter of 2021, the global average for download speed is 53.38 Mbps for mobile and 102.12 Mbps for fixed broadband.\n\nAfrica\u2019s best performers scored below these marks. The best average speed for mobile internet in Africa was in South Africa (44.80 Mbps) while the mark for fixed broadband was in Ghana (51.93 Mbps).\n\nIn descending order, South Africa, Mali, Morocco, Cameroon, Tunisia, Egypt, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Kenya (20.98 Mbps) were the top ten countries for mobile internet speeds in Africa in Q1 2021. The worst-ranked African country was Sudan (131st out of 134 overall) at 12.21 Mbps.\n\nThe top ten standings for fixed broadband are different: Ghana, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, South Africa, Madagascar, Egypt, Senegal, Seychelles, Morocco, Congo and Burkina Faso (23.81 Mbps). Guinea is the worst-ranked African country in this category (173rd out of 176 overall) with 6.66 Mbps.\n\nGhana leads on fixed mobile broadband\n\nSouth Africa, Egypt and Senegal appear in both top 10 lists. But which cities stand out across the continent? For this, we\u2019ll focus on mobile internet speeds and latency \u2013 a measure of how responsive an internet connection is.\n\nFrom Johannesburg to Kairouan\n\nSpeedtest shows the top cities for mobile internet speeds in South Africa, Morocco, Tunisia, Nigeria and Kenya, but not for other countries in the top ten \u2013 like Mali and Cameroon. As such, we are limited in how certain we are of the cities with the top internet speeds in Africa.\n\nHowever, we are able to guess that the major cities in South Africa, Morocco and Tunisia have the fastest speeds on the continent. Johannesburg leads the way with 55.64 Mbps while Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, comes in at 31.32 Mbps.\n\nIn Nigeria, Speedtest data shows Port-Harcourt \u2013 an oil-rich city in the Niger Delta region \u2013 has the fastest speed at 23.02 Mbps. Lagos, one of Africa\u2019s capitals of tech startups records an average of 19.72 Mbps \u2013 a lower mark than Nairobi (24.60) and Cape Town (36.68).\n\nWhere latency is concerned, Nigeria\u2019s main cities (Port-Harcourt, Lagos, Benin city, Kano, Ibadan) also lag behind main cities in comparable African countries.\n\nThe highest latency among South Africa\u2019s top five cities (Johannesburg, Pretoria, Cape Town, Durban and Soweto) is 29 milliseconds. The highest among Kenya\u2019s top five is 39 milliseconds (in Eldoret). Latency is 40 milliseconds in Lagos but that\u2019s the least among Nigeria\u2019s top five. In Kano, the average is 75 milliseconds \u2013 more than twice the global average of 37 milliseconds.\n\nWhat are the numbers revealing to us?\n\nThe numbers above reflect internet performance between January and March 2021. As such, longer-term data will be needed to make better judgement.\n\nHowever, the numbers show a wide gap between internet speeds in Africa and the rest of the world. Africa has the fastest-growing mobile telecoms market but internet penetration is still at about 42%.\n\nLatency is not such a big deal if you are merely browsing social media, attending a Zoom meeting or streaming on Instagram. Anything below 100 ms is fine. But for gaming, between 20ms and 40ms is optimal.\n\nIncreasing download speeds and reducing latency will require more investment in infrastructure from telcos who provide mobile internet but also from fibre optic providers. On the mobile side of things, it means expanding 4G coverage and more 5G investment.\n\nOokla\u2019s 5G map shows South Africa has raced ahead of everyone else in terms of commercially available 5G, with 16 deployments mostly by MTN. Kenya has three deployments but they are limited. Nigeria, on the other hand, hopes to catch up soon by tapping into its satellite infrastructure.",

For years, the state-owned Ethiotel has held a monopoly but will now have competition.\n\nBeyond competition, it will have a significant economic impact, considering that the consortium will create 1.1 million jobs and invest $8.5 billion in the next ten years. According to a tweet by the country\u2019s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, \u201cit will be the single largest foreign direct investment into Ethiopia to date.\u201d\n\nThe country also announced that it would not grant a second telecoms licence after rejecting a second bid from MTN.\n\nMTN\u2019s bid is not good enough\n\nThe prospect of a market with 112 million people is as good as it gets for many telcos, so it wasn\u2019t surprising that all the big names initially planned to make bids. Etisalat, Orange Telecoms, MTN and Saudi Telecom Company were some of the companies that registered interest.\n\nIn the end, only two companies put bids forward; the Vodafone consortium and MTN. Safaricom, one of the consortium companies, had announced prematurely in March that it had won the bid.\n\nRegardless, MTN also made a bid of $600 million which was considered not good enough, and now the second telecoms licence will now be retendered for new offers.\n\nOne interesting point is that MTN\u2019s bid was financed in part by a Chinese investor, while a newly created US foreign-aid agency backed the Vodafone consortium\u2019s bid. It is a continuation of what some observers call a competition on the tech front in Africa.\n\nA similar situation played out in Kenya as Safaricom rolled out its 5G service initially with Huawei providing support. The US reportedly had concerns with the decision to use Huawei, in line with a strategy of using its diplomatic might to dissuade African governments from buying into the technology solutions from the Chinese company.\n\nIn the end, Safaricom stuck with Huawei but also included the Finnish company, Nokia. Despite this, it is clear that this is not the last we\u2019ll see of the continuing competition between the US and China in Africa\u2019s tech space.",

          "title": "Successful product managers are walking encyclopedias.",
          "text": "It takes a great team to build an equally great product. Centre Stage exists to tell the behind-the-scenes stories of the people building brilliant products and services in Africa.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Tobi Lufadeju to Centre Stage because I admire how determined she is to succeed in her role and how invested she is in her personal and professional development. Even when she has moments where she feels like a small fish in a big sea, she doesn\u2019t allow her youthful insecurities to slow her down or get in the way of her responsibilities.\n\nTwo weeks after my meeting with Feranmi, I\u2019m back at Eric Keyser to meet with a very nervous but confident Tobi Lufadeju who is a young product manager at Reliance HMO.\n\nWhat were you doing in your early 20s? When I was Tobi\u2019s age, I was wrapping up my MFA (Master of Fine Arts) in English literature and overthinking my future and career path.\n\nAt Reliance, Tobi is in charge of the consumer business unit.\n\n\u201cThe consumer business unit is basically the retail side of the business. But I don\u2019t just handle retail products \u2013 I also handle products for SMEs and our partners.\u201d\n\nCuriousity is a product manager\u2019s super power\n\nTobi describes herself as a curious person, so I had to ask how curiosity plays a role in her work:\n\n\u201cProduct management is the intersection of business, technology and design. Successful product managers need to learn a little bit about each of them because we do a lot of directing in our work. In my role, I have an overview of what everyone is working on \u2013 from the frontend engineers to the DevOps team.\u201d\n\nWhen Tobi uses the word \u2018directing\u2019, I immediately picture a sharp-minded captain steering a large ship in open waters. The captain is responsible for not only the ship but her diverse team of crew members and cabin hands. Should aspiring product managers expect to manage diverse teams? This is what Tobi had to say:\n\n\u201cYes, they absolutely should have that expectation. As the product manager, you are the product\u2019s encyclopedia; so if the head of marketing needs information about the product, you have to know enough to give an appropriate answer. Being a curious person helps me learn as much as I possibly can about what we are building.\u201d\n\nWhen you picture product managers, what do you see them doing? Crunching numbers? Creating colourless spreadsheets? Tracking the lifespan of a product? Counting app downloads? What does their day-to-day work life look like for Tobi?\n\n\u201cI prioritize the work we are doing at all times and carve out time to do the work. I collaborate with different people and communicate our products\u2019 progress reports so everyone on the team knows what they need to do. I also make out time to speak to my direct supervisor \u2013 the business lead \u2013 and realign myself with our goals and plans for the quarter.\u201d\n\nWinning the battle over Impostor Syndrome\n\nProduct managers not only have to speak their product\u2019s language, but they also have to speak their team\u2019s language. How then do successful product managers navigate team management?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a common myth that product managers are micromanagers; this isn\u2019t the case with me,\u201d Tobi said in-between bites of her chicken sandwich.\n\n\u201cAlthough I operate as a kind of middle man, I don\u2019t meddle with the work. I trust my team to do what they are skilled at and leave them to run on their own. I also remember to connect with them as human beings. Yeah, I have to meet my deliverables but I have to support my team as well.\u201d\n\nThere are an estimated 64 million young people aged between 15 \u2013 35 years old living in Nigeria. It\u2019s obvious that our youth population is increasing rapidly with no plans of slowing down. But how prepared are they to enter local and global workplaces? How do young managers deal with issues such as impostor syndrome?\n\n\u201cThe first two months on the job were not easy. I joined an existing team which meant that I had to do a lot of learning and observation in the beginning. My team members would throw around in-house language during meetings and I also had to figure out how to speak the engineering team\u2019s language. I dealt with impostor syndrome big time.\u201d\n\nWhen you get hired by a new company, you have to make your first 100 days count. But being the newbie hire can be a daunting experience. How can new employees quieten the insecure voices in their heads and trust their abilities and skills?\n\n\u201cEven though the learning curve was steep in the beginning, I had to figure it out. I couldn\u2019t afford to fail because that\u2019s my name on the line. So whenever I felt confused after a meeting, I would call one of my team members back and ask questions. I still have moments where I\u2019m confused about certain things but I\u2019ve been given the leeway to experiment and try different tactics.\u201d\n\nCentre Stage tip: When in doubt or confused, ask questions.\n\nTips and tricks for aspiring and existing product managers\n\nEarlier in our conversation, Tobi mentions how important it is to be curious on the job. I asked her what other skills she believes aspiring product managers need to be excellent in their roles?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll start with effective communication. You can\u2019t just tell people what to do, you have to help them understand what needs to be done, why it needs to be done, and who needs to do it. If you cannot communicate clearly, you will not get the results you desire.\n\nPrioritisation is the second skill. Successful product managers must own the product and visualize the bigger picture at all times. When you have the bigger picture in your mind, it\u2019s easier to assign priority levels to different tasks.\n\nFinally, you need interpersonal skills. Although my team members don\u2019t directly report to me, I still have to learn how to speak to them with respect and empathy. When we have long weeks, I ensure I check in on the engineers because, at the end of the day, we are humans and need breaks from time to time.\n\nProduct managers need to learn how to give praise and encouragement, especially when they notice their team members are stressed or when their energy tanks are empty.\u201d\n\nTobi\u2019s role at Reliance HMO is her first stab at being a product manager. In addition to learning on the job, she\u2019s also had to invest her personal time in picking up new knowledge about her responsibilities and that of her team. So, what is she doing to improve her skills?\n\n\u201cPractice. I consciously track what I\u2019m doing and how I\u2019m doing my work. I make out time to reflect on my progress regularly. I follow product leaders and managers on LinkedIn\u2013 I read their articles and make note of the tips they share. I also use Blinkst to read books at an accelerated pace. At one point, I had access to Masterclass, I took some business and product-focused courses. My business lead also sends me resources like podcasts and articles.\u201d\n\nWhere your professional career is concerned, one thing you never stop doing is learning. Tobi is ambitious about being successful in her role and isn\u2019t afraid to do what it takes to achieve her definition of success. My key takeaway from my conversation with Tobi is that managers, no matter how young or experienced they are, must be courageous, curious, and competent.\n\n\u201cIf I had to share any tip with aspiring product managers, I would recommend researching what goes into being a product manager and taking one or two courses about what tools you need to use and what to do on the job. If you are on social media, follow conversational product leaders and engage with them on Twitter or LinkedIn. There\u2019s a lot to learn at once and the work hit me like a wrecking ball in the beginning.\n\nMeasure as objectively as you can. You cannot fit everything into an OKR or KPI framework. Sometimes, you have to use your intuition to measure yourself and how well you are succeeding as a manager and team member. How are you handling your team? Are you driven by impact or are you working for the sake of it? If you are focused on making an impact, you will always deliver value to the business.\u201d",

          "title": "Samsung A12 Vs Infinix HOT 10T: Which Is A Better Buy?",
          "text": "Infinix and Samsung are two major players in the African smartphone market. Both brands have managed to maintain their edge over other competitive brands through the consistent production of exceptional smartphones that meet the varying needs of gadget lovers within the space. Phones like the Infinix HOT 10 and the Samsung Galaxy A12 are one in the number of stellar products offered by both brands.\n\nBoth devices fall within the same range (the mid-range) and it might get a little tricky deciding which to pick if you walk into a store and are faced with both of them. We hope that we can give you a bit of clarity for your next shopping expedition through this comparison of the Infinix HOT 10T and Samsung Galaxy A12.\n\nIn terms of looks, we know that both brands always bring their A-game. The two smartphones are designed with beautiful frames and colors that are easy on the eyes. If we were to judge by looks, you\u2019d definitely want to go home with both. But since we know that you\u2019d prefer to walk away with either one of the two devices, we\u2019d drill a little further.\n\nLet\u2019s start with something of interest to all our mobile game and Netflix lovers.\n\nDisplay\n\nThis is an all-important feature for smartphone entertainment. Whether it\u2019s movie watching and game blasting, you want to be able to enjoy that from a big and sharp screen. To a large degree, both devices offer amazing displays. They both use a drop-notch screen that allows for a higher screen-to-body ratio and a better viewing experience. But here\u2019s where the difference starts to kick in.\n\nScreen size\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy A12 uses a 6.52-inch HD+ screen while the Infinix HOT 10 pushes its screen size up to 6.82 inches. The Infinix HOT 10\u2019s display is also high definition (just like Samsung\u2019s A12) but it\u2019s also specified that it has a 90Hz refresh rate. This translates to smoother images on the Infinix HOT 10T.\n\nResolution\n\nAnother metric with which users can determine the quality of the display is the pixel count also known as resolution. Higher resolutions equal higher quality pictures. This explains why the 1080 movie on your laptop shows more detail than the 720p movie you downloaded from\u2026you know where.\n\nALSO READ: Infinix Launches All-New Hot 10T, The Ultimate Smartphone Entertainment Experience\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established that, here\u2019s the pixel count for both devices. The Samsung Galaxy A21 has a pixel count of 1600 x 720. On the other hand, the Infinix HOT 10\u2019s resolution equals 1640 x 720. Now here\u2019s where this could get a little tricky. Although Infinix has a higher resolution, Samsung fits 1600 x 720 pixels into a relatively smaller screen, while Infinix fits 1640 x 720 (a slightly higher amount of pixels) into a bigger screen. The result? Samsung is left with a higher pixel density which could very well contribute to better display quality.\n\nProcessing power\n\nHere both devices bring entirely different offerings to the table. Although both processors are designed by the same company MediaTek, the devices use processors from different families under MediaTek. Samsung Galaxy A12 uses the MediaTek p35 processor while the Infinix HOT 10T uses the MediaTek G70 processor. Both processors are 8 core processors but according to a Nano review, here\u2019s what you get out of them.\n\nFrom the breakdown above, it seems like the MediaTek G70 rules flawlessly over the MediaTek P35. Overall CPU performance for multitasking is better, gaming performance is also better and to cap it all up, the MediaTek G70 works at a faster clock rate of 2.oGHzcompared to Samsung at 1.8GHz.\n\nBattery\n\nIn this next round, we talk about the battery capacity. Both brands seem to be fairly pitched against themselves with 5000mAh batteries apiece. However, the Samsung Galaxy A12 provides better charging ability with 15w fast charging technology against Infinix HOT 10\u2019s 10W charging technology.\n\nOperating system\n\nBoth devices run on the Google-sponsored Android OS. However, Samsung uses an older version of android 10. Well, it wasn\u2019t old until the 8th of September last year when Android 11 hit the market. Infinix HOT 10 on the other hand, runs on Android 11 the most recent version.\n\nFingerprint unlock\n\nOver the years, this has become another important smartphone feature. Using PINs and passwords has now been termed as taking the longer route. The only alternative solution to fingerprint unlock which has also gained attention is the facial unlock feature. However, it has been reported to be less secure in comparison with fingerprints.\n\nInfinix uses the common rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. Meaning its sensor is positioned at the back of the device and easily accessible with a touch from the pointer. However, Samsung uses a placement that I and a lot of other tech bros have come to enjoy better. Samsung A12 uses a side-mounted fingerprint sensor. Side-mounted fingerprint sensors are perfect because of how they\u2019re used to replace the power button (a button that we\u2019ve already become accustomed to). It\u2019s a lot easier and more seamless.\n\nCamera\n\nSamsung is known to be a king in the area of smartphone photography. At the rear side of the Galaxy A12 Samsung uses a 48+5+2+2MP camera while the Infinix HOT 10 uses a 48+2+AI camera. Both cameras perform brilliantly under varying light conditions. However, the Infinix HOT 10 focuses on night life photography and performs exceptionally well in that regard. Using its Seper night mode and support from its QUAD led flash, Infinix brings more light into the beauty of the night life as contrasted below.\n\nSelfie comparison\n\nThe Infinix HOT 10T is available across all authorized retail stores nationwide at a retail price of 64800 while the Samsung A12 is sold at 67,200. Now that you have more information on what they offer, you can walk into any store and pick whichever one perfectly suits your need.",

          "title": "New FirstBank Website Puts YOU, the customer, First!",
          "text": "Banking has evolved over the years and the industry now abundantly relies on web-based applications for providing services to customers. With more and more people increasingly glued to connected devices, banks that hope to compete in today\u2019s market must focus on digital channels.\n\nOne of the pillars of a digital strategy is having a website that serves as the face of a company on the internet and its first virtual touchpoint. But in the digital age, just rolling out a website with a visual style and design stuck in the 90s does not cut it. Consumers have high expectations when it comes to online experience, so banks must find a way to offer the best digital experience possible. Hence the importance of having a unique site with world-class design and functionality.\n\nIf there\u2019s any bank that understands this so well, it\u2019s First Bank of Nigeria Limited, the West African premier financial inclusion services provider. Established over a century127 years ago, FirstBank continues to evolve, successfully adopting the latest technology and embracing innovation in delivering seamless banking solutions to its customers across the world. The bank recently launched a newly-designed corporate website that fits right in with its quest to be Africa\u2019s bank of first choice \u2013 even when it comes to banking on digital channels.\n\nFrom online banking, loan calculator to customer support, here are some standout features of the new FirstBank website:\n\nDesigned for Banking on the Go\n\nThe new FirstBank website has a simple yet striking and modern design in a fresh, magazine-style look that promotes access to essential information for its customers, FirstMonie agents, prospective agents and the public.\n\nThe site leverages the bank\u2019s brand colors to attract attention to certain areas. FirstBank uses its blue color on the call-to-action buttons, with the backdrop remaining mostly gold. This makes them stand out from the other menu items and brings user attention to where it matters most without overwhelming visitors.\n\nMore importantly, the website is designed from a mobile-first standpoint, which is responsive, considering increased usage of mobile devices compared to desktop computers. With this design, the FirstBank website reformats to fit the screen of whatever device the visitor is using to view it and allows users the flexibility to conduct business wherever they may be.\n\nIntuitive site navigation\n\nWhen people visit their institution\u2019s website, it is not because they are looking for somewhere to spend their extra time. They are often seeking help and want to get to things quickly. FirstBank offers a wide array of financial services for a varied customer base, which can make it difficult to maintain a clean and easily navigated website. But the new platform \u2013 with a simple and clearly labeled navigation \u2013 allows users and potential customers to find exactly what they\u2019re looking for quickly and easily.\n\nOne of the core strengths of the new website is prominent links to top pages. The homepage begins with a prominent header that displays clear visual and clickable options that direct users to the main categories of Personal Banking, Business Banking & Private Banking and features a clear link to FirstBank\u2019s Contact/Customer Service page with alternate ways for visitors to seek help, such as email and phone.\n\nMoving down the homepage provides visitors with easy navigation for common prospect needs, represented with icons and calls to action. On the new website, these include Open Account, Agency Banking, Find a Branch, Loan Calculator, etc. The intuitive and user-friendly upgrade guides customers to make well-informed decisions about their financial needs, whatever they are.\n\nEasy Access to Online Banking\n\nIn the digital age, a bank is less likely to be considered by younger generations if it does not have online banking. And for banks that do offer online banking, they have to make it easy for consumers to find and use. On its new website, FirstBank puts an obvious button to online banking in top navigation so visitors know exactly where to go. The \u2018Online Banking\u2019 login/enrollment call-to-action is placed at the top of every page, easing the digital experience for existing customers.\n\nSeparate Product Pages with Strong Calls-to-Action\n\nThe FirstBank website has unique secondary pages for every product, and clear calls-to-action for people to be able to navigate to those pages. Across all pages, the main image rotates displaying a variety of themes in line with the banking category and each contains easy-to-navigate dropdown menus, with a simple, straightforward, and detailed breakdown of the bank\u2019s products by the problem that they solve for individuals and businesses. From the product pages, a visitor can easily know how to get or sign up for the product or service they are interested in.\n\nOnline Account Opening\n\nA bank can\u2019t be open all day, but its website can be. Knowing that some potential customers do not live by its operating hours, FirstBank offers banking on their terms through the website.\n\nA standout feature of the new website is that it enables online applications and the ability to submit personal information securely. That makes it easy for interested visitors to open an account, offering a clear start to their banking journey.\n\nTools and Content that Empower Customers\n\nEvery user experience begins with a goal in mind and the new FirstBank website empowers its customers by providing a wide array of financial information and tools that meet customers needs, whatever they are. Among many actions, users can perform various transactions \u2013 make payments, transfer money, manage accounts, buy airtime, calculate loan rates and virtually interact with the bank \u2013 without stepping out of their comfort zone.\n\nThe site also serves as a library to keep customers abreast of various financial services solutions and offers intriguing content that is relevant to FirstBank\u2019s varied customer base \u2013 such as how-to guides that educate consumers on better managing their money and making the best financial decisions, thereby helping them to improve their economic and social wellbeing, as well as unique blog articles/insights on enterprise scaling, global trade and navigating the Covid-19 pandemic, targeted at corporate clients.\n\nLocation Finder\n\nOne of the most intriguing features of the new FirstBank website is its Location Finder, where visitors can browse locations of the bank\u2019s branches and Firstmonie Agents. The feature allows users to search based on their radius or address and helps them find the FirstBank branch that\u2019s closest to them and best fits their needs. The branch locator is interactive and integrated with Google Maps API, which makes it easier for the visitor to browse the locations.\n\nOverall, FirstBank gets it right when it comes to usability, understanding its customers\u2019 needs and expectations, and website navigation behavior while creating a beautiful site that employs some of the latest trends in responsive web design, with exceptional user experience and a perfect mix of exciting features.\n\nWith the new FirstBank website, customers are at an edge in the industry as they establish a relationship with the Bank that puts YOU, its customers, First.\n\nYou can visit the new FirstBank website here.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nInfinix and Samsung are two major players in the African smartphone market. Both brands have managed to maintain their edge over other competitive brands through the consistent production of exceptional smartphones that meet the varying needs of gadget lovers within the space. Phones like the Infinix HOT 10 and the Samsung Galaxy A12 are one in the number of stellar products offered by both brands.\n\nBoth devices fall within the same range (the mid-range) and it might get a little tricky deciding which to pick if you walk into a store and are faced with both of them. We hope that we can give you a bit of clarity for your next shopping expedition through this comparison of the Infinix HOT 10T and Samsung Galaxy A12.\n\nIn terms of looks, we know that both brands always bring their A game. The two smartphones are designed with beautiful frames and colours that are easy on the eyes. If we were to judge by looks, you\u2019d definitely want to go home with both. But since we know that you\u2019d prefer to walk away with either one of the two devices, we\u2019d drill a little further.\n\nLet\u2019s start with something of interest to all our mobile game and Netflix lovers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisplay\n\nThis is an all-important feature for smartphone entertainment. Whether it\u2019s movie watching and game blasting, you want to be able to enjoy that from a big and sharp screen. To a large degree, both devices offer amazing displays. They both use a drop-notch screen that allows for a higher screen-to-body ratio and a better viewing experience. But here\u2019s where the difference starts to kick in.\n\nScreen size\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy A12 uses a 6.52-inch HD+ screen while the Infinix HOT 10 pushes its screen size up to 6.82 inch. The Infinix HOT 10\u2019s display is also high definition (just like Samsung\u2019s A12) but it\u2019s also specified that it has a 90Hz refresh rate. This translates to smoother images on the Infinix HOT 10T.\n\nResolution\n\nAnother metric with which users can determine the quality of display is the pixel count also known as resolution. Higher resolutions equals higher quality pictures. This explains why the 1080 movie on your laptop shows more detail than the 720p movie you downloaded from\u2026you know where.\n\nALSO READ: Infinix Launches All-New Hot 10T, The Ultimate Smartphone Entertainment Experience\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established that, here\u2019s the pixel count for both devices. The Samsung Galaxy A21 has a pixel count of 1600 x 720. On the other hand, the Infinix HOT 10\u2019s resolution equals 1640 x 720. Now here\u2019s where this could get a little tricky. Although Infinix has a higher resolution, Samsung fits 1600 x 720 pixels into a relatively smaller screen, while Infinix fits 1640 x 720 (a slightly higher amount of pixels) into a bigger screen. The result? Samsung is left with a higher pixel density which could very well contribute to better display quality.\n\nProcessing power\n\nHere both devices bring entirely different offerings to the table. Although both processors are designed the same company MediaTek, the devices use processors from different families under MediaTek. Samsung Galaxy A12 uses the MediaTek p35 processor while the Infinix HOT 10T uses the MediaTek G70 processor. Both processors are 8 core processors but according to a Nano review, here\u2019s what you get out of them.\n\nFrom the breakdown above, it seems like the MediaTek G70 rules flawlessly over the MediaTek P35. Overall CPU performance for multitasking is better, gaming performance is also better and to cap it all up, the MediaTek G70 works at a faster clock rate of 2.oGHzcompared to Samsung at 1.8GHz.\n\nBattery\n\nIn this next round, we talk battery capacity. Both brands seem to be fairly pitched against themselves with 5000mAh batteries a piece. However, the Samsung Galaxy A12 provides better charging ability with 15w fast charging technology against Infinix HOT 10\u2019s 10W charging technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOperating system\n\nBoth devices run on the Google sponsored Android OS. However, Samsung uses an older version android 10. Well, it wasn\u2019t old until the 8th of September last year when Android 11 hit the market. Infinix HOT 10 on the other hand, runs on Android 11 the most recent version.\n\nFingerprint unlock\n\nOver the years, this has become another important smartphone feature. Using PINs and passwords have now been termed as taking the longer route. The only alternate solution to fingerprint unlock which has also gained attention is the facial unlock feature. However, it has been reported to be less secure in comparison with fingerprints.\n\nInfinix uses the common rear mounted finger print censor. Meaning its sensor is positioned at the back of the device and easily accessible with a touch from the pointer. However, Samsung uses a placement that I and a lot of other tech bros have come to enjoy better. Samsung A12 uses a side mounted fingerprint sensors. Side mounted fingerprint sensors are perfect because of how they\u2019re used to replace the power button (a button that we\u2019ve already become accustomed with). It\u2019s a lot easier and seamless.\n\nCamera\n\nSamsung is known to be a king in the area of smartphone photography. At the rear side of the Galaxy A12 Samsung uses a 48+5+2+2MP camera while the Infinix HOT 10 uses a 48+2+AI camera. Both cameras perform brilliantly under varying light conditions. However, the Infinix HOT 10 focuses on night life photography and performs exceptionally well in that regard. Using its Seper night mode and support from its QUAD led flash, Infinix brings more light into the beauty of the night life as contrasted below.\n\nSelfie comparison\n\nThe Infinix HOT 10T is available across all authorized retail stores nationwide at a retail price of 64800 while the Samsung A12 is sold at 67,200. Now that you have more information on what they offer, you can walk into any store and pick whichever one perfectly suits your need.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "Egyptian agritech startup, Mozare3, has raised over $1 million in a pre-seed round. Algebra Ventures, Disruptech, and some angel investors like EFG-EV, participated in the round.\n\nMozare3 CEO, Hussein Abou Bakr, and his Co-founder, Tamer El-Raghy, founded the company in 2020 to assist more than 20 million smallholder farmers in Egypt by making markets and credits accessible to them.\n\nThe startup also plans to develop the first digital community for Egyptian farmers and offer them agronomy support through its professional network.\n\nThe agritech startup assists farmers sell their crops by working with institutional buyers like frozen vegetable processors, large retailers, and wholesalers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe farmers sign an offtake agreement \u2014 an arrangement between a producer and a buyer to purchase or sell portions of the producer\u2019s future goods \u2014 with Mozare3 to sell their produce at a particular price for institutional buyers.\n\nThis reduces the likelihood of the farmers not getting buyers after the harvest season. Most importantly, it encourages farmers to focus on their work without worrying about after-harvest sales.\n\nAccording to MENabytes, Abou Bakr said they currently have offtake agreements with 100 farmers and three large institutional buyers.\n\nAlthough most of Mozare3\u2019s work is done offline, a small group of farmers is currently beta testing its app.\n\nWith the app launch at the end of 2022, the company wants to reach over 10,000 farmers.\n\nIt would also allow farmers to access credit, receive agronomy support, buy fertilisers and other products to grow crops, and sell their products through its digital offtake agreements.\n\nAbou Bakr has over 20 years of experience in subsistence and commercial farming, food processing, and international trading. Before he founded Mozare3, he founded an agri processor and exporter, Plantform, that used to source produce from smallholders in over ten governorates in Egypt.\n\nThe CEO and the team hope to increase Mozare3\u2019s network to over 2,500 farmers with whom they have offtake agreements and increase its institutional buyers to over 37.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Egyptian agritech startup plans to introduce credit solutions to fund purchases of different products like motorbikes for the farmers and their families.\n\nEl-Raghy believes that Mozare3 would make supply more efficient by providing farmers with innovative financial products and turning them into contract farmers to fulfil consumers\u2019 growing demand, processors, and exporters.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, approximately 24 million people \u2014 over one-quarter of the population \u2014 work in Egypt\u2019s farming and fishing sectors. And being a major component of the economy, 6.5 million people depend on agriculture for survival.\n\nPerhaps Mozare3\u2019s plans to develop its tech, expand its team, and grow its network of farmers would help farmers and boost the economy as agriculture contributes 11.3% to the country\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nFeatured Image Credit: MENAbytes\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "Real estate GDP improving but concerns remain",
          "text": "In the last two quarters, the Nigerian real estate sector has shown significant improvement, recording positive growth and showing prospects for investors. But these have been diminished by soaring building materials prices within the same period.\n\nThe sector posted positive nominal growth of 8.04 percent as reflected in the first quarter 2021 gross domestic product (GDP) report released at the weekend by the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nThe sector returned to positive growth with 2.81 percent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2020. This enabled it to crawl out of recession after six consecutive quarters of negative growth. Its last positive growth of 0.93 percent before this period was recorded in Q1 2019.\n\nIn 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged the economy, the real estate sector was also affected as the health crisis elevated vacancy rates in commercial properties, reduced average footfalls across retail centres and slowed the completion time of many residential developments and infrastructure projects.\n\nThe performance of the sector in the last two quarters, therefore, reflects the full reopening of the economy as many residential and commercial projects have begun full operations following quantitative easing of the pandemic.\n\nThe positive growth has also been attributed to increased construction activities and investment by investors scrambling for attractive yields in real estate as a preferred investment destination.\n\nBismarck Rewane, CEO, Financial Derivative Company, affirmed this at a breakfast meeting in Lagos. As of November 2020, residential construction spending in the private sector alone was up almost 7 percent while privately-owned housing starts also recorded 12.8 percent year-on-year growth.\n\nBased on this, experts predicted significant growth for the sector from Q1 2021 going forward. \u201cWe expect to see growth in the sector as many projects that were put on hold amid the COVID-19 lockdown will commence,\u201d Temitope Runsewe, CEO, Dutum Construction, said.\n\nThe implication of these developments is that opportunities are opening up for investors while hope of more jobs coming is rising. The construction sector is said to be the highest employer of labour. Analysts estimate that every square metre of real estate activity creates jobs for three people.\n\nThe slowdown in other investment asset classes such as equities, bonds and Treasury bills has swayed investment interest in real estate and that also explains why there is an influx of investors, especially those with patient capital and long-term view of the market, into the sector.\n\nIncreasingly, real estate developers have become innovative, according to Rewane, and that attracts more investment which is why land and house ownership packages now come with instalment payment plans. This has the advantage of bringing more people on to the property ladder.\n\nMeanwhile, the gains of these recorded growth and the attendant opportunities are under threat from rising building materials, many of which, notably cement and iron rods, have seen over 60 percent price increases in the last six months.\n\nAcross Nigeria, cement price has hit the roof. In Lagos, for instance, Dangote Cement increased from N2,600 in October 2020 to N3,800 or N3,600 in some areas in April 2021; Lafarge Cement and BUA Cement increased from N2,400 and N2,250 to N3,600 and N3,250, respectively, within the same period.\n\nThe story is not any better in Port Harcourt where the price of the commodity has moved from N2,600 in November 2020 to between N4,000 and N4,200 in April 2021 for a 50kg bag.\n\nIn Abuja, the price hovers between N3,600 and N3,700. Dealers buy from the cement depot at N3,400, but the cost of transportation and off-loading push the price to N3,700 per bag at retail shops.\n\nThe price of steel reinforcement bars otherwise known as Rebars is a major source of concern in the building industry. From N275,000 per ton in September 2020, the price rose to N345,000 per ton in January/February and stood at N400,000 per ton in March 2021.\n\n\u201cAt the current price, it means the price of cement within the first quarter of this year has moved over 70 percent. That means the dream of an average Nigeria to own a home is now very slim,\u201d noted Kunle Adeyemi, CEO, Sterling Homes, in an interview.\n\nHe added that, for developers, that is a huge challenge because they have already fixed the prices of houses that are still being built. \u201cAt this cement price, you cannot deliver at your price,\u201d he lamented.\n\nThe price of iron rods, according to Debo Adejana, the chairman of the South West Zone of Nigerian Real Estate Developers Association (REDAN), has almost doubled in the last six months too.\n\n\u201cWe have found ourselves at the crossroads where we cannot discontinue on-going developments, yet it is difficult to continue because of rising prices. It is a dilemma and I believe this affects everybody. If you are not a developer or landlord, you must be a tenant; so we are all victims,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Covid-19: We have achieved 96% target of our vaccination status",
          "text": "*Urges individuals eligible for second doses to do so\n\nDoosuur Iwambe, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government, FG, has revealed that it has been able to achieve over 96%( 1,929,237) of its covid-19 vaccination target in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking while updating Nigerians on the status of the COVID-19 vaccination in Abuja on Tuesday, the Chief Executive of National Primary Health Care Development Agency, NPHCDA, Dr. Faisal Shuaib, noted that the nation has also started the second doses, and the number has reached 4,683.\n\nWhile calling on Nigerians who have received their first dosage of the vaccine to check their vaccination cards for their due date, the NPHCDA boss said, it is only by doing so that they can be fully protected from the disease.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are very pleased to announce today that we have almost completed administering all first doses included in this campaign, as of 24th May. We have now provided the first COVID-19 vaccine doses to a total number of 1,929,237 Nigerians, representing 96% of the targeted population.\n\nIn addition, we have begun providing second doses, and that number has reached 4,683. Those individuals currently eligible for second doses will have received their first dose 6 to 12 weeks ago.\n\n\u201cWe are advising that all Nigerians who have received their first dose should check their vaccination cards for the date of their second dose, and ensure that they receive the second dose to gain full protection against COVID-19\u201d.\n\nWhile reiterating the commitment of his agency in raising more awareness on the pandemic which is currently ravaging the world, Dr Shuaib added that the agency is putting in place measures to ensure that Nigerians have access to accurate information about COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n\u201cAs we transition to administering second doses, our teams have assessed the communication and mobilization activities that have been undertaken thus far to create awareness for the COVID-19 vaccine and encourage uptake. We will be building on the work we\u2019ve already done in these areas to ensure that Nigerians can easily access accurate information about COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nOur goal is to do everything possible to educate, combat misinformation, and ensure confidence in the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, and to ensure all Nigerians have clear information on how, where, and when to get the vaccine. We will do this through continuous engagement and communication with communities across our country\u201d.\n\nOn the success achieved so far, he said, \u201cPermit me to say that the success we have achieved with the first dose is the collective efforts of all stakeholders, for which we are most grateful\u201d.\n\nHe further disclosed that about 440,000 health workers have so far taken the core BD19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cConcerning the proportion of health workers that have been vaccinated so far, 440,000 health workers have taken the core BD19 vaccine. This represents about 23 percent of the total number of people who have been vaccinated so far.\n\n\u201cIn particular, I want to use this opportunity to sincerely appreciate the father of the nation, His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, for his exemplary leadership and for providing all the needed resources to enable us successfully conduct this unprecedented massive vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe also wish to appreciate the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 response under the leadership of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha for his guidance. Our partners and donors have been with us providing technical support and resources.\n\n\u201cAs most people here know by now, the global community is facing great challenges regarding vaccine supply. Like most nations, this impacts the clarity over Nigeria\u2019s next shipment. While we have information that we may get the next consignment of vaccines by the end of July or August, these have not been officially confirmed.\n\nWhen we are able to, we will provide an update regarding timelines and details of the next shipment. At present, we do not have that information available due to the wider context we are in.\n\n\u201cHowever, we can update you on some positive developments. Pfizer and BioNTech pledged on Friday of last week to provide 1 billion doses of their COVID-19 vaccine to low-and-middle income countries by the end of 2021, and another 1 billion doses in 2022. Johnson & Johnson also announced it has signed a deal to provide 200 million doses of its vaccine to Covax\u201d.\n\n\u201cSeparately, the International Monetary Fund is now advocating for a $50 billion fund to be spent on ensuring a faster rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and is calling for at least 40% of the global population to be vaccinated by the end of this year, and at least 60% by June 2022.\n\nThe fund would be used to increase COVAX vaccine coverage, procure additional tests, and expand vaccine production capacity. We strongly endorse the creation of such a fund, and emphasize that all nations must have comparable access to COVID-19 vaccines in order to end this pandemic.\n\nAdditionally, the United States announced it will donate 20 million vaccine doses by the end of June to the COVAX scheme\u201d.\n\nHe also rolled out the rescheduled dates for the PSC\u2019s Zonal Town Hall meetings across the remaining Zones.\n\nHe further assured Nigerians that the Federal Government has taken significant precautions to protect Nigerians against B.1.617.2, known as the Indian variant.\n\n\u201cFlights from India and other high-risk countries such as Turkey and Brazil have been barred from entering Nigeria, we are ramping up our test and trace measures, and we are accelerating the national project to establish production of oxygen supplies across all states of Nigeria.\n\nI want to seize the opportunity to enjoin Nigerians to continue to observe the Public Health or non-pharmaceutical measures in place to curb the transmission of Covid-19, as we are not out of the woods yet\u201d, he added.\n\nHe commended World Health Organization, WHO and United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, UNICEF, Country Representatives Dr Walter Mulombo and Peter Hawkins respectively, for coming for the press conference.\n\nEarlier, UNICEF Country Representative, Peter Hawkins, called on governors, traditional, religious leaders and community leaders to encourage their people to step forward and be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cI want to encourage all governors, traditional, religious leaders and community leaders to encourage their people to step forward and be vaccinated. Protecting yourself is important and by doing so you also protect your family and your communities.\n\n\u201cWe hope that by the end of this year we will be able to vaccinate 40 million people and then in 2022 the remaining 60 million will be vaccinated to make up the 112 million which is our objective.\u201d",

          "text": "Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu has attacked Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu for criticising the ban on open grazing by Southern governors.\n\nAkeredolu\u2019s reaction was contained in a statement issued by the Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties and Strategy, Dr Doyin Odebowale, on Tuesday, title \u2018Mr Garba Shehu: On the trail of an agent provocateur\u2019.\n\nAccording to Akeredolu, anyone who has been following the utterances of Shehu, as well as his fellow travellers on the self-deluding, mendacious but potentially dangerous itinerary to anarchy, could not but conclude that he works, assiduously, for extraneous interests whose game plan stood at variance with the expectations of genuine lovers of peaceful co-existence among all the peoples whose ethnic extractions were indigenous to Nigeria.\n\nHe said Shehu must disclose, this day, the real motive(s) of those he served, definitely not the President.\n\n\u201cHe cannot continue to hide under some opaque, omnibus, and dubious directives to create confusion in the polity. The easy recourse to mendacious uppity in pushing a barely disguised pernicious agendum is well understood.\n\n\u201cThe declaration that the recommendations of the Minister of Agriculture, Alhaji Sabo Nanono, a mere political appointee like Garba Shehu, are now the \u201clasting solutions\u201d which eluded all the elected representatives of the people of the Southern part of the country, exposes this man as a pitiable messenger who does not seem to understand the limits of his relevance and charge,\u201d he said.\n\nAkeredolu added that Shehu contended that \u201ctheir announcement is of questionable legality\u201d, referring to the 17 Governors of the Southern States, but the decision of certain elements to take the ancestral lands of other people to settle their kinsmen, including the \u201cgun-wielding \u201ckiller herdsmen\u201d and their families, and provide \u201cveterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families including schooling through these rehabilitated reserves\u201d for which \u201cthe Federal Government is making far-reaching and practical changes allowing for different communities to co-exist side-by-side\u201d, does not appear to him as a comprehensive plan for land grabbing, a precursor to internal colonialism.\n\n\u201cHe wants to \u201crevive forest reserves\u201d but seems particularly uninterested in the current position of the same law, that he and his cohorts often misinterpret to serve parochialism and greed. Governors no longer have powers over the lands in their territories. They must take instructions from appointees of the Federal Government on such matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is superfluous, and that is being charitable, for anyone to remind us of the constitutional right of bona fide citizens \u201cto enjoy rights and freedoms within every one of our 36 States (and FCT)-regardless of their state of birth and residence\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere has never been any contention on this provision. It is clear that Mr Garba seems to have issues understanding the difference between licentious criminality and qualified rights under our law. It is our duty to continually nudge him off his current state of cognitive dissonance. His pronouncement betrays dubiety and mischief,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to Akeredolu, most traditional families in Nigeria have occupations, saying that pastoralism is not an exception.\n\nHe said any ethnic group still trapped in anachronism might be assisted to embrace modernity, adding that dispossessing communities of their ancestral lands, encouraging denizens of the forests to overrun lands belonging to other people, and forcing alien bands of migrants on the local populace to live \u201cside-by-side\u201d with other communities, could not be for the purpose of animal husbandry\n\nThe governor stated that this raised suspicion on a grand, deliberate, persistent, and insidious design to use naked force to subjugate the real owners of the land.\n\n\u201cMr Garba Shehu is a major supporter of the current pervasive anarchy in the land,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom on Tuesday said the Federal Government\u2019s insistence on open grazing suggests it has a hidden agenda.\n\nThe Presidency had on Monday faulted the recent resolutions of the Southern Governors, including the ban on open grazing in the entire southern part of the country.\n\nA statement signed by Presidential spokesman Garba Shehu said the Governors\u2019 resolutions failed to provide any solution to the lingering crisis between farmers and herders in the country.\n\nInstead, the statement added, President Buhari has \u201ccommissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the States, starting with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant with stated requirements.\u201d\n\nBut the Benue State Governor, in a statement signed by spokesman Terver Akase, said the insistence on open grazing reserves was curious.\n\n\u201cWe find the move not only shocking and curious but also as a misplaced priority,\u201d the Ortom statement said.\n\n\u201cAt a time the country is worried about the worsening security situation and many Nigerians are calling for national dialogue to address the fundamental issues that have led to the present state of affairs, the Federal Government considers the reopening of cattle grazing routes as the only solution available to it.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Open Grazing Ban: Southern Governors Did Not Provide Any Solution \u2013 Presidency\n\nThe Governor faulted the Federal Government\u2019s plan to commence rehabilitation work on grazing reserves in the country next month.\n\nOrtom recalled that the Northern States Governors\u2019 Forum (NSGF) had met on February 9 and agreed that the current system of herding mainly by open grazing is no longer sustainable, in view of the growing urbanisation and population of the country.\n\nWhile noting that the Forum consequently resolved to sensitize herders on the need to adopt ranching as the new method of animal husbandry, Ortom said the 17 Governors of Southern Nigeria also met on May 11 in Asaba and banned open grazing in the entire region.\n\nThe Southern Governors, the Benue leader added, adopted ranching as the alternative method of rearing animals.\n\nHe added, \u201cAs it stands, the Presidency is the lone hand pushing for the continuation of open grazing and the return of cattle routes of 1950s and 60s. The Presidency has, by its endorsement of open grazing, emboldened armed herders who lay claim to all lands in Nigeria as belonging to Fulani, hence their invasion of farming communities and killing of original owners of such lands.\n\n\u201cThe fact must be established that grazing reserves or cattle routes are no longer tenable in the 21st century when Nigeria\u2019s population far exceeds that of the fifties at a time these routes were contemplated.\n\n\u201cAt present, the routes have been taken over by airports, roads, schools, hospitals, as well as markets, houses and other human activities. The country\u2019s land mass has also reduced to less than 923 square kilometers with the excision of Bakassi to Cameroon. Besides, the international best practice of animal husbandry is ranching; and that\u2019s the stand of Benue State.\u201d",

          "text": "Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu has heavily lashed out at Garba Shehu, the Nigerian Presidential spokesman over his recent comment that queried the legality of the resolutions reached by the country\u2019s 17 southern state governors made at a meeting in Asaba Delta State.\n\nMr Akeredolu observed that the presidential spokesman assiduously works for extraneous interests and must disclose the real motives of those he serves, and who\u2019s definitely not the President.\n\nAccording to the Governor, Mr Shehu\u2019s game plan stands at variance with the expectations of Nigerians who are lovers of peaceful coexistence among all the peoples whose ethnic extractions are indigenous to Nigeria.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu\u2019s views were expressed in a statement on Tuesday and issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties and Strategy, Dr Doyin Odebowale.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has been following the utterances of this man, as well as his fellow travellers on the self-deluding, mendacious but potentially dangerous itinerary to anarchy cannot but conclude that he works, assiduously, for extraneous interests whose game plan stands at variance with the expectations of genuine lovers of peaceful coexistence among all the peoples whose ethnic extractions are indigenous to Nigeria,\u201d the statement\n\n\u201cMr Garba must disclose, this day, the real motive(s) of those he serves, definitely not the President. He cannot continue to hide under some opaque, omnibus and dubious directives to create confusion in the polity. The easy recourse to mendacious uppity in pushing a barely disguised pernicious agendum is well understood. The declaration that the recommendations of the Minister of Agriculture, Alhaji Sabo Nanono, a mere political appointee like Garba Shehu, are now the \u201clasting solutions\u201d which eluded all the elected representatives of the people of the Southern part of the country, exposes this man as a pitiable messenger who does not seem to understand the limits of his relevance and charge.\n\n\u201cMr Garba contends that \u201ctheir announcement is of questionable legality\u201d, referring to the 17 Governors of the Southern States, but the decision of certain elements to take the ancestral lands of other people to settle their kinsmen, including the \u201cgun-wielding \u201ckiller herdsmen\u201d and their families, and provide \u201cveterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families including schooling through these rehabilitated reserves\u201d for which \u201cthe Federal Government is making far-reaching and practical changes allowing for different communities to co-exist side-by-side\u201d, does not appear to him as a comprehensive plan for land grabbing, a precursor to internal colonialism. He wants to \u201crevive forest reserves\u201d but seems particularly uninterested in the current position of the same law, that he and his cohorts often misinterpret to serve parochialism and greed. Governors no longer have powers over the lands in their territories. They must take instructions from appointees of the Federal Government on such matters.\n\n\u201cIt is superfluous, and that is being charitable, for anyone to remind us of the constitutional right of bona fide citizens \u201cto enjoy rights and freedoms within every one of our 36 States (and FCT)-regardless of their state of birth and residence\u201d. There has never been any contention on this provision. It is clear that Mr Garba seems to have issues understanding the difference between licentious criminality and qualified rights under our law. It is our duty to continually nudge him off his current state of cognitive dissonance. His pronouncement betrays dubiety and mischief.\n\n\u201cMost traditional families in Nigeria have occupations. Pastoralism is not an exception. Any ethnic group still trapped in anachronism may be assisted to embrace modernity. Dispossessing communities of their ancestral lands, encouraging denizens of the forests to overrun lands belonging to other people and forcing alien bands of migrants on the local populace to live \u201cside-by-side\u201d with other communities cannot be for the purpose of animal husbandry. It raises suspicion on a grand, deliberate, persistent and insidious design to use naked force to subjugate the real owners of the land. Mr Garba Shehu is a major supporter of the current pervasive anarchy in the land.\u201d\n\nThe Governor also warned \u201cMr Garba Shehu and his cohorts to desist from hurling insults at the elected representatives of the people. He lacks the authority to make policy statements for the Federal Government, unless directed, expressly. His acts are clearly those of an agent provocateur. Other closet dreamers, aspirers to colonial fantasies, must be weaned off their delusion.\n\n\u201cHe also declared that \u201cno inch of the space delineated and known, currently, as South West, and indeed the whole South, will be ceded to a band of invaders masquerading as herdsmen under any guise.\n\n\u201cNo inch of the space delineated and known, currently, as South West, and indeed the whole South will be ceded to a band of invaders masquerading as herdsmen under any guise.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

Cracks several centimetres (more than an inch) wide appeared in the ground and on roads in several areas, including near the main hospital in Goma, a city of some two million people which lies about 12 kilometres (seven miles) from Mount Nyiragongo.\n\n\u201cThe situation in the city is confused.

One headed towards Goma, stopping at the very outskirts of the city.\n\nIt engulfed homes in its path, smothering the surrounding area with suffocating gas and cutting off the road between Goma and Butembo, the main highway in North Kivu province.\n\n\u201cThirty-two people died in incidents linked to the eruption, including seven people killed by lava and five asphyxiated by gases,\u201d the UN\u2019s refugee agency (UNHCR) said in a statement, raising an earlier toll \u2013 drawn from NGOs and other sources \u2013 of 20 dead.\n\n\u201cThe lava flow stopped on Sunday, but there have been repeated earthquakes since the eruption and the lava lake in the volcano\u2019s crater appears to have refilled, prompting fears of new fissures opening or another eruption,\u201d it added, noting that a significant effort was under way to reunite several hundred children who were separated from their families as they fled.\n\nFive people died from suffocation on Monday after they tried to cross the cooling lava some 13km (eight miles) north of Goma, civil society leader Mambo Kawaya told AFP.\n\nSeveral strong aftershocks were also felt in Rwanda on Monday, including a magnitude 5.1 earthquake under Lake Kivu, the Rwanda Seismic Monitor said.",

The country ended its combat mission in 2013.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Australian prime minister said the facility would close as an \u201cinterim measure\u201d on May 28 \u2013 in just three days \u2013 \u201cin light of the imminent international military withdrawal from Afghanistan\u201d.\n\nThe United States and allied forces have begun withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, 20 years after they toppled the then Taliban regime in a military invasion in the wake of the September 11 attacks on US soil.\n\nThe Taliban on Tuesday pledged to provide a \u201csafe environment\u201d to foreign diplomats after Australia announced it would shutter its embassy over security concerns.\n\n\u201cThe Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan assures all foreign diplomats and staff of humanitarian organisations that [we] will not pose any threats to them,\u201d Taliban spokesman Mohammad Naeem told AFP news agency. \u201cWe will provide a safe environment for their activities.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban, which waged an armed rebellion against the US-led NATO troops, has emerged as a strong force controlling many parts of the country. The US withdrawal is part of an agreement Washington signed last year with the Taliban to end the war.\n\nThe elected government in Kabul and the Afghan security services remain fragile despite two decades of foreign support, and their success is far from clear without full-scale US backing.\n\nAll US troops are expected to leave by September 11, the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIn recent days, violence in the country has soared and Afghan forces have clashed with Taliban fighters not far to the east of Kabul.",
