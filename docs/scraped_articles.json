          "text": "THE Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, on Thursday claimed that not less than N3bn was paid as ransom to rescue about 400 people kidnapped in the South-West in a period of two years.\n\nAdams also lamented that over 200 persons were killed in the South-West region by the kidnappers within the years under review.\n\nThe Aare Onakakanfo said this at the fourth edition of the South-West Security Stakeholders\u2019 Group conference held in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.\n\nHe claimed that he always received first hand information about kidnapping happening in any part of the communities in the region.\n\nAdams described the conference is an opportunity to bring all security agencies together so as to enhance his capacity.\n\nHe added, \u201cAs the Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, I am privy to some certain information that certain security organisations do not have. When things happened in any community, they will call my line that Aare, what can you do?\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t have enough power to act like the olden days Aare, but I am doing my own bit as a person that has a liberation organisation.\u201d\n\nAdams, who regretted that the region had been ravaged by killer herdsmen, stated that should Yoruba leaders fail to act, the region might record same experience in the North.\n\nHe appealed to the Federal Government to consider regionalism as an option to rescuing the country from its current situation.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen you quantify the amount of ransom that has been paid in Oke-Ogun, Ibarapa, Ekiti, Akoko and Yewa, it is even more than N3 billion.\n\n\u201cWhen you quantify those people that were killed, maimed in all these jurisdictions, they are more than 400 people.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s need for self-government or regionalism in the country where states governors would control the police and other security architectures of their states.\n\n\u201cIn the North, the story is even worse; bandits have taken over the entire North-East, North-West and Central. In Kaduna for instance, about 500 schools have been shut indefinitely.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Mercy Eke: Living Her Dream",
          "text": "Our cover personality Mercy Eke needs almost no introduction. Since 2019 when she emerged winner of the Big Brother Naija, BBN, Season 4, Eke has grown in leaps and bounds, evolving from just a reality TV show contestant, to a video vixen, brands\u2019 ambassador, actress and successful real estates entrepreneur.\n\nThe Imo State University graduate is an embodiment of boldness, style and energy; three features that have continued to distinguish and endear her to many.\n\nIn this interview, she speaks of her newly-launched platform for giving back: The Mercy Eke Foundation, life as the only woman to have won the BBN grand prize so far; her love life and much more.\n\nHow has life been since 2019 when you won the Big Brother Naija Season 4?\n\nLife has really been good. Life has been amazing. I can\u2019t take anything for granted. God has been so wonderful to me and I\u2019ve really, really been working hard. So I would say life after Big Brother has been amazing.\n\nHas the win translated into gains as much as you expected?\n\nWell, I would say win plus hard work equals growth. I mean, there\u2019s been a lot of changes and a lot of growth. I\u2019m doing a lot of things. So, yes the win translated into growth.\n\nHow have you been handling the fame and celebrity status/lifestyle that comes with winning?\n\nWell, let me breath in first. It hasn\u2019t been easy. Ah! Celebrities! God! It\u2019s so hard to be a celebrity in Nigeria or in Africa. It\u2019s so hard like, it\u2019s so demanding but, you know, I just have to take it slowly and a step at a time. But we\u2019ll get there.\n\nGrowing up, did you dream of a life of fame?\n\nYes, I did. I had a lot of dreams and one of the major one was being famous. That was why I auditioned four times for BBNaija because I felt that my redemption might come from there; and it did!\n\nYou remain the only woman to have won the grand prize in the competition. What do you think women in each editions haven\u2019t realised about winning?\n\nYes, I\u2019m the only woman to have won the grand prize in the competition for Big Brother Nigeria. Like I always tell people, it\u2019s a game. It\u2019s not a do or die affair and at the end of the day, there can only be one winner. I tried my best, and Africa and Nigeria were behind me; and they crowned me.\n\nI don\u2019t know how other women see it but for me, I am happy and I can\u2019t wait to welcome the next female winner because my back is already hurting me. I need someone else to join me on that seat.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to be the only female winner; so I pray a woman wins this year\u2019s Big Brother Naija.\n\nWhat\u2019s your opinion of the ongoing BBN Season 6?\n\nI think the season 6 housemates are unique in their own ways, but of course some people stand out more than others. So far, Maria, Whitemoney, Liquorose, Angel and Cross are giving me the vibes. As a BBN fanatic, if I have the power, these will be my top 5, and I will be so happy if any of them ace the game.\n\nDo you see yourself in any of the housemates?\n\nI see myself in Maria, Angel and Whitemoney; selfless, loving and outspoken.\n\nWho has the biggest chance of winning?\n\nThey all stand a chance of winning and may the best man win.\n\nTell us about your recently launched foundation?\n\nYes, I just recently launched my foundation; which has been, one of the things I wanted to do a long time ago. The Mercy Eke Foundation is about giving back to the society; giving back to the people that have nothing, giving back to the people who need it the most, and giving back to the people who made me what I am today. Helping small business owners, helping kids on the streets, single mothers, widows, students and more. So, yes, my foundation is just about giving back to the society.\n\nWhy did it take you this long to set it up?\n\nWell, it took me so long to start up my foundation because I wanted to get it right. I don\u2019t want to start a foundation because everyone has a foundation. I want to do it and I want to do it right, and also impact lives in the process. So, I had to take my time.\n\nHas it always been your dream to formally giveback to society or did this come as an afterthought?\n\nYes, it has been my dream to give back to the society. I\u2019m a giver. My heart is so big; I can\u2019t stand people suffering. I wish I could even do more. And it\u2019s been on my mind to help people; especially people that really need it. Our country is so bad right now that every day, I put this country in my prayers. I just want to see millions of struggling people in this country have at least, two square meals a day. So yes, I\u2019ve been giving, and giving back has always been my thing. I\u2019m glad I am able and I can do this at this point in my life.\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen much of you in Nollywood as expected, aside Fate of Alakada, a few skits and in the forthcoming TV series \u2018TRIPS\u2019. What\u2019s happening?\n\nYes. You haven\u2019t seen me so much in Nollywood as expected because coming out as a winner, I had a lot of things I had to do and I have been doing. Like now, I\u2019m currently shooting my reality show, setting up my business, foundation and working as an ambassador for brands I represent.\n\nBut right now, I\u2019m doing more of movies. I recently finished shooting a movie, Shanty Town, which is yet to be out. And I did another one Trips, which is a TV series. There\u2019s also another script I\u2019m currently on; so, I\u2019m ready for Nollywood. I think this is the time. And remember, whenever you wake up, it\u2019s your morning. So right now, Nollywood, here comes your girl!\n\nDoes this have anything to do with your venturing into the real estate sector last year with the establishment of Lambo Homes?\n\nYes. I wasn\u2019t accepting the scripts then because I wanted to set up my businesses and also push other things. So, yeah, I think those were the reasons you all haven\u2019t seen me so much in Nollywood.\n\nThe BBN Lockdown Season\u2019s reunion was staged recently; what do you think of the various housemates?\n\nI think all I see is growth and I love it. All of them are doing amazing. I\u2019m so proud of them.\n\nWho was your favourite and why?\n\nI think all of them. You know, they\u2019re all unique in their own ways.\n\nCan you recall your three best moments since 2019?\n\nI think the day I entered the BBN house, the day I came out of the house, and saw my parents from the stage and I was like \u201cMama, I made it\u201d, and also, the day I paid for my first home. These are my three best moments.\n\nYour fans were hopeful about your relationship with Ike Onyeka; what contributed to its crash?\n\nYou know, I was there and I have been there. Breakup happens and it is what it is. What crashed the relationship? I seriously don\u2019t know. I think we were not compatible; so it crashed.\n\nSo who\u2019s the man in your life right now and what do you love most about him?\n\nI can\u2019t mention his name. You know what they say about protecting people you love and cherish? That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. I have a handsome, loving man by my side who supports and loves me. What I love about him is that, he is so consistent and intentional about me, and also, he\u2019s not about the social media life. He\u2019s a businessman and I love that he loves God. I just love him.\n\nWhat\u2019s your biggest regret?\n\nI don\u2019t think I regret anything because everything that has happened to me is either a blessing or a lesson; so, I don\u2019t regret anything.\n\nWho inspires you?\n\nI have quite a number of people and women who inspire me across the globe. A lot of people inspire me, especially people I can relate with; people I see myself in. People that have been through a lot.\n\nFrom which of your parents did you draw your resilient, goal-getting spirit from?\n\nIt is from my mother; she is a hardworking woman and has been there for my siblings and I despite how we troubled her. My mother inspires me the most; she\u2019s my biggest supporter and she\u2019s my everything.\n\nYou did a butt job; what advice do you have for young women who also want to have cosmetic surgery?\n\nWell, do what makes you happy. Do what you want to do; it\u2019s your body, you call the shot and it is your money \u2014 spend it how you like to. Do whatever makes you happy.\n\nDescribe your style in two words?\n\nMy style in two words will be glam and fun.\n\nWhat do you look forward to? I look forward to greatness, opportunities, more growth, and everything good because I deserve everything good. I also look forward to good health, more business opportunities, open doors and all the good things of life.",

          "title": "Moet and Nicole: Spilling The Tea",
          "text": "With the COVID-19 pandemic, the rise of digital media such as podcasts has only continued to increase. Jumping on the train of making it a part of their life and most importantly, giving listeners an opportunity to learn from different life issues, celebrity radio presenter and actress, Moet Abebe, and multimedia journalist Nicole Abebe are poised to giving the audience visual elements of a Talk Show, as well as the possibility of enjoying a show on a podcast format with the launch of in producart format ; \u2018Spill the Tea With the Abebes.\u2019\n\nThe show seeks to \u2018address topics that affect young people, but often shy away from. For the Abebes, talking about these topics such as rape, human trafficking, sexual assault, and gender violence amongsts others need to be discussed because talking about, them they believe is the beginning of making certain individual corrections and ultimately correcting the ills prevalent in our society today. They tell us more.\n\nMOET ABEBE: Being an only child helped shape me Between you and Nicole, whose idea was Spill the Tea and what inspired it?\n\nIt was a joint effort as well as that of the new Director and Producer, Sefinah Lamii. We all were casually having a \u201cgirl\u2019s night, in\u201d and we all realized how well Nicole and I work together, our chemistry and banter are effortless. So, it just came about naturally that we should work together.\n\nWho is your target audience and why?\n\nOur target audiences are millennials both here in Africa and in the Diaspora. That is, men and mostly, women between the age of 25 and 45.\n\nWhat should your viewers expect from your podcasts?\n\nThey should expect a show that entertains, enlightens, and educates. Viewers should be expecting to see different perspectives, opinions and views about these said topics. This would leave them no choice but to want to do their own bit, to change some of these backdated social narratives.\n\nAre you planning on bringing guests and what would you look out for in your guests?\n\nYes, we are planning on having guests on the show. The guests on the show have been handpicked specifically in relation to the topics. Every guest present on this season is able to add their own perspective ,by bringing in their personal experiences, and using them as examples. The viewer will easily be able to relate to these guests because they are all celebrities and social contributors who are doing very well in their various fields. The guests give out their own advice and also gain a thing or two from myself and Nicole\u2019s contributions and vice versa.\n\nTell us a bit about yourself, growing up years and events that shaped you into who you are today?\n\nI spent most of my developing years here in Nigeria and the United Kingdom. I did my nursery and primary education in Lagos, then secondary and University was in the UK. I feel the constant back and forth between these two countries really shaped me into becoming the open-minded and non judgmental person that I am today. I have always had to deal with the two cultures and to create a balance. As an only child, this has really helped to shape me into becoming an independent and hardworking woman.\n\nYou read Law but have been in the media for some time now; tell us what informed the switch?\n\nYes, I have. I honestly didn\u2019t want a monotonous life. I felt I could contribute more and what better way than delve into the media industry where my voice can be heard and creatively expressed.\n\nWhat do you find fascinating about being a radio personality?\n\nI love the fact that my voice and input can touch someone many miles away. The fact that people know the voice and can spot it anywhere is exciting. The fact that just being myself and speaking on my interests or things that affect me, equally affect the listener is such an exhilarating and powerful feeling. I absolutely love it.\n\nWhat or who inspires you in life and why?\n\nIn all honesty, I inspire myself. I am such a survivor and fighter. I keep pushing myself. I believe I can do more and guess what, I keep proving myself that I can achieve anything I put my mind to\n\nDo you intend to practice law in future?\n\nNo, I do not intend to practice.\n\nShare an example of when you established and accomplished a goal that was personally challenging. What helped you succeed?\n\nBeing the Executive Producer of this show has been the most challenging thing I have done. Having to do everything practically on my own, especially the funding of the show. From its inception to now, the accomplished product has not been an easy road. However, what I believe helped me succeed definitely has been God, and having the best production team to support me and bring my ideas to life.\n\nWhat do you do to keep fit and stay healthy?\n\nI try to, at least, stay active as much as I can. I am also very particular about what I take into my body and at what time.\n\nHow do you balance your work and private life?\n\nI\u2019m able to balance the two, by not allowing factors from either, cross into the other. I just try my best not to mix the two. The parties present in my work life are not in my private life and vice versa.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you spend your \u201cme\u201d time?\n\nThere are two things I love aside from being in front of the camera and a microphone. They are going to the spa and going to the beach. Those are the ways I really get to relax and spend \u201cme\u201d time.\n\nBest holiday destination?\n\nIt would have to be Seychelles.\n\nWhat lessons would you say life has taught you over the years?\n\nNothing is permanent, not even being alive. So just live your life to the fullest, and love with a pure and good heart.\n\nNICHOLE ABEBE: Our visual podcasts provide fresh and fun new content\n\nHow did you and Moet get together on this job, what is your relationship like?\n\nWhere do I begin with my big cousin Moet? In my first year of university, we had to gain some work experience in the media industry, and luckily for me, I was coming home to Nigeria for the summer. It is where I first met Moet, and I am glad I met her. Moet has become one of my favourite people in this world. She\u2019s beyond caring, as real as real can be, and I know hands down she\u2019s got my back. I love to annoy her at times (which you will see in the podcast) but it\u2019s really all love. I\u2019m super grateful to have her in my life. We always joke about working together one day, but now that it\u2019s a reality, I wouldn\u2019t want to do it with anyone else.\n\nOf what benefit do you think the podcast will be to your viewers?\n\nI believe our visual podcasts will provide viewers with fresh and fun new content. When Moet and I set out to create \u2018Spill The Tea\u2019, we wanted something people could get lost in. From the visually appealing set design, to the fun and colourful outfits we wear, down to the intriguing conversations we have. Every aspect of Spill The Tea With The Abebes was intentional. We only got better as the season went on.\n\nHow do you hope to come up with fresh interview ideas?\n\nThe fact that we wake up every morning, with breath in our lungs, and God\u2019s grace to be granted the gift of sight, we will always have new content. Things happen every day, not just to us, but to the viewers watching. As human beings, we have so much in common that we don\u2019t even realise. We all go through similar emotions and experiences at different stages in our lives. As long as our content is relatable, I don\u2019t think we have a problem there.\n\nWhat was growing up like for you?\n\nI was born in London before I moved back to Lagos when I was three months old. I attended Corona Primary School in Victoria Island up until primary three. At this point, my family moved back to London where I finished up my primary school education at Lady Banks Junior School. When I was 11 years old, I attended Burford School, a boarding school in Oxfordshire.\n\nI spent my formidable years there. I often say this is where I spent some of my best school years. I left Burford when I was 16 and attended The Chelsea Independent College in London for my A-Levels. I gained my undergrad degree from the University of Bedfordshire in Broadcast Journalism, before attending The New York Film Academy in New York City for my masters in Broadcasting. I have great memories when I think back to my school days, a lot of cringe memories too\u2026but I\u2019m trying to forget those.\n\nWhat informed your choice of career as a teenager?\n\nSo, growing up, I loved Hollywood for all the amazing movies they produced. I used to say to myself, \u201cwell I know I can\u2019t act, so how can I be a part of Hollywood without being in the movies?\u201d That was when my attention moved to Ryan Seacrest, the American television presenter, producer. I became obsessed with his job and how he did it so well. I looked into his education and that was when I started visualising a path for myself. I thought to myself that if I could gain the same skills he has, what would stop me from getting on E? I actually wrote my University application letter about him and got accepted to all my choices: So it worked. Here I am today. Thanks to Ryan.\n\nWho is your biggest role model?\n\nMy mother! She is the strongest, most helpful, caring, supportive, hard-working individual I have ever come across. I thank God every day that he made her my mother. I wouldn\u2019t be the young woman I am today if not for the discipline she instilled in me at a young age. She is the last person I ever want to disappoint. I\u2019m working so hard so that one day, my brothers and I can tell her to sit back and relax.\n\nWhat do you do to keep fit and stay healthy?\n\nI\u2019m striving every day to become a full-time member of a Fitness club but it\u2019s hard. I\u2019ve learned to reduce my portion sizes. My choice of exercise is swimming. I love the fact that it works your whole body, plus, I find being in a huge body of water extremely calming and relaxing.\n\nWhat puts you off in people?\n\nI hate bad attitudes for no reason. If someone else upsets you, don\u2019t put that negative energy on me, it\u2019s not my fault. So when you first meet someone, show them the good sides of you. My mum always used to tell me, \u201calways look your best and act your best, people never forget the first impression\u201d.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you spend your \u2018me\u2019 time?\n\nWhen I\u2019m not working, I like to catch up on my favourite TV shows. I\u2019ve also gotten into exploring TV shows from other countries. I also find time to self-care. I give myself a facial every Sunday night and that makes me feel great when I wake up on Monday morning.\n\nBest holiday destination?\n\nMy best holiday destination is anywhere that gives me a tropical vibe. On my bucket list, I\u2019d like to visit places like Thailand, Bali, Greece, more destinations in the Caribbean and of course, The Maldives \u2013 but I\u2019ll save that one for my honeymoon.\n\nWhat lessons would you say life has taught you over the years?\n\nOver the years, life has taught me to look out for number one. I used to be a people pleaser and would get really upset when people weren\u2019t giving me the same energy I give them. It was a rude awakening when I realised most people don\u2019t care how they make you feel.",

          "title": "Ruth Kadiri Ezerika: Life as Filmmaker",
          "text": "By Rita Okoye\n\nRuth Kadiri Ezerika is a multiple award-winning Nigerian actress, scriptwriter, and film producer. She is also the CEO/Founder of Ruth Kadiri Films and Ruthkolors; an online hair store. Her passion for acting started in the church; she sees her career as a compulsory service unto God. After bagging an Ordinary National Diploma (OND) in Business Administration from Yaba College of Technology, and a degree in Mass Communication from the University of Lagos, Ruth in her quest for more knowledge proceeded to writing school. She wrote her first script, Wild and Dirty and eventually started featuring in her movies as an actress. Thus far, Ruth has featured in over 100 movies, and has also written and co-written several movies.\n\nNow happily married to Mr Ezerika, and blessed with a daughter, Reign Ezerika, the beautiful actress, shares with us her journey so far as a filmmaker, challenges of a female producer, changes brought on by motherhood and more.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nWhat is new with Ruth Kadiri?\n\nWhat\u2019s new is that I\u2019m working on my first cinema project. We are still in the pre-production stage and I\u2019m trying to get partnership deals because it\u2019s all incorporated in the story. We hope everything goes well, that\u2019s where we are.\n\nHow has life been since COVID-19?\n\nPersonally, it\u2019s been good but a lot of people were affected. However, new streams of revenues have been created. I have also used the opportunity to create more income-making avenues for myself.\n\nYou are an Actor, Screenwriter and Producer. Why didn\u2019t you just confine yourself to acting?\n\nI\u2019m a very restless soul. I pretty much started as a writer. I love writing and working behind the scenes. It gives me a different kind of feeling than I get being on screen. There are two different things; making money as an actor, and making money as a producer. One is way bigger and riskier. As a producer, you are taking more risks but making more money.\n\nWhat are the lessons of life that you have learnt in the course of your profession as \u201can imitator of life?\u201d\n\nLife is a journey and not everyone is meant to stay forever in your life.\n\nEvery filmmaker has a philosophy of life that is reflected in their movies. What is yours and how do you reflect it in your films?\n\nMy philosophy of life is, \u201cit only gets better.\u201d You can\u2019t meet me where you left me. Don\u2019t block anyone and no one will block you. I\u2019m sure these things don\u2019t make sense to you but I promise you, these are the things that keep me going in an industry where it is pretty hard to trust anyone.\n\nYour movies are always family oriented. Why is that so?\n\nNigeria as a country is a family-oriented nation and as a filmmaker, I get my creativity from happenings around me. So, regardless of how crazy Nigerian movies eventually get in the future, there will always be a streak of family in most of our stories.\n\nWhat has been your best and worst moments in the movie industry?\n\nMy best moments are moments when I feel like I\u2019m doing good, and my worst moments are moments when I feel like I\u2019m under-achieving. It\u2019s basically a general thing.\n\nSome female actors have complained about sexual harassment in the industry. Give us your perspective about this much-talked-about issue?\n\nThe higher you go in life, the more difficult it becomes to understand the pain of the people that are down there. Most of the sexual harassment cases in the industry are of people who are struggling to get into the field, or trying to find their feet. We don\u2019t hear of many cases anymore. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019ve grown to a point where nobody can say nonsense to me. I have my ears to the ground. People are not coming to me anymore to say, this person requested sex for a role. This may also be because the industry is now female-dominated. These are the reasons why I think that sexual harassment has reduced. I can\u2019t say it has been eradicated, but I think it has drastically reduced. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong.\n\nIt is said that you are one of the Nollywood actors without baggage (scandals). How did you manage it?\n\nThe word scandal is relative. What is called scandal to one person might mean absolutely nothing to another person. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve been without a scandal, I\u2019ll just say that some of the things that might have disastrously affected a lot of other people, I have been able to manage well to the point where it didn\u2019t look like a scandal.\n\nGive us your Nollywood survival tips?\n\nI think it\u2019s forgiveness! Nollywood is a place where close friends constantly betray you, fall short of your expectations, do things that you probably didn\u2019t expect them to do that do not make sense to you. I grew up in the industry and I told myself that I wasn\u2019t going to let myself carry all the unhealthy burdens that a lot of people are letting themselves carry. Many are bottling things up. If I feel uncomfortable about something, I say it. If you offend me, I say it. I\u2019m always able to articulate my feelings and I forgive you. I just have to let it go for my sake.\n\nWhat triggered your outburst on the Eko Film Festival awards?\n\nIt still boils down to what I said earlier. If I feel something is not right, I say it. I would rather not bottle things, see you on the street, say \u2018hello, hi\u2019 and fake a smile. I can\u2019t do that. If I feel uncomfortable about something, I just say it and move on. You know, when you are upset about something and you express yourself, the anger will always reduce. When you can express yourself to someone who listens. So, that was just one of them. It wasn\u2019t about any form of drama.\n\nDo you feel it was a \u2018clique thing\u2019?\n\nI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m over that now.\n\nIf you are not a filmmaker, what other profession do you think would have caught your fancy?\n\nIf I were not a Filmmaker, I would have been a Prophetess! It\u2019s not easy to combine both worlds but personally and deeply, I know that\u2019s where I should have been.\n\nWhat are some of the burdens of filmmaking that producers have to shoulder because of the Nigerian socio-economic matrix?\n\nFilmmaking in Nigeria is a lot more difficult because of noise, getting funds, and a no- friendly, film-making nation where you can literally walk into somewhere with all the paperwork and say please, I want to make a film. It doesn\u2019t work like that. There are so many places that won\u2019t let you in. These are the things that basically limit your ability to tell certain stories because there\u2019s just a lot of NOs that people get when trying to get to a certain location. Certain things that should be made available for us are just not there. So, we literally pay our way through everything. Even when you have your money to pay, they will still say no.\n\nWhat types of roles will never appeal to you as an actor?\n\nThe moment you sign up to be an actor, you should be able to play any role.That\u2019s what being an actor is all about, I think.\n\nROK TV has continued to serve Nigerian movie lovers with great movies, what is your position with the brand?\n\nI have a good relationship with ROK. I am a ROK producer and actor; and so far, ROK has been so supportive, much more than they take credit for. ROK Tv has also been able to redefine the face of filmmakers and actors. Seeing where we are coming from and where we are now, I know that one platform that actually cares about its people is ROK.\n\nGod rest his soul, there was a colleague, Abiodun Alega, a producer who recently passed. You know that as a producer, people don\u2019t know you. It\u2019s easier to raise money when an actor falls ill because he is known. But as a Producer, so many people don\u2019t know you and because they don\u2019t know you, they don\u2019t feel compelled to help you. When this man died, in no time, we were able to raise about five to six million Naira for him.\n\nThis is one of the benefits and reasons why I love being part of the ROK family. There are many other things I cannot even mention publicly. It\u2019s beyond a production company, it\u2019s a production company that does care for its people. This is a lifestyle I\u2019m personally trying to emulate in every other thing I do moving forward.\n\nWhat has been your staying power in Nollywood?\n\nI think it\u2019s basically being myself and constantly aspiring to be a better version of myself. Most importantly, it\u2019s making my own money. Laughs.\n\nYou have a hair brand, how has it been running such a competitive business?\n\nI\u2019m already in the filmmaking business, which is very competitive; that\u2019s why I don\u2019t consider the hair business as a competition. Also, knowing that I try to cater to certain kinds of women; people who find it difficult to go to a salon because of their busy schedule, and people who are skeptical and scared to spend their money online because of social media scams. These are the two key staying powers that I feel like I have and of course, the hair itself is very good.\n\nHow affordable are your products?\n\nIt\u2019s quite affordable for the quality that you\u2019ll get. May God help us with this dollar rate but so far, it\u2019s good. It\u2019s just that the cost of goods is increasing but what can we do?\n\nA lot of women complain about the price of motherhood such as loss of their body shape, impact on their career and lack of time to pursue personal developments. How has it been with you?\n\nThese are all genuine concerns and cause for worry. Every person that has been a mother has gone through that process of worry. But, when you have supportive people around you; your partner, your family, it\u2019s always easier to deal with and eventually, you\u2019ll come to terms with the new reality. Nothing is ever lost. The time you used to cater for your baby is never lost. Whatever is yours will always come to you regardless of when. So far, it\u2019s been good. I have loving people around and so; I don\u2019t feel that much pressure. I thought I was even going to have it so; basically, it was just fear that held me down at some point. But, after the whole process, I don\u2019t even feel any of such pressures or restraints.\n\nHow do you cope with the demands of motherhood?\n\nI just cope. I\u2019m still a mother, am I not? I\u2019m doing okay. It\u2019s an endless journey, there\u2019s no coping, you just cope.\n\nYou have continued to keep your marriage and husband a top-secret, what scares you?\n\nOkay, first of all, my marriage is not top-secret. If it were top-secret, you wouldn\u2019t know that I\u2019m married. Secondly, my husband is not top-secret, if you are close to me and you know me in the real sense, you would know that he\u2019s not a secret. My husband goes to the location, he visits my set when I\u2019m working. He\u2019s home, my friends come home, they know him, they\u2019ve had interactions with him, family and friends know him, what else? That\u2019s just about it. I\u2019m not about stressing emotionally, mentally, I\u2019m just okay. Anybody who knows me personally, knows my husband and that\u2019s alright.\n\nWho are your three best Nigerian fashion designers?\n\nDT Clothing, CEO Lumini and Tope Efinara.\n\nWhat will you not be caught wearing?\n\nNothing. I will not be caught wearing \u2018nothing\u2019.",

Awwal was rushed to the hospital and is responding to treatment.\n\nAwwal was said to be a cousin of Olatunji\u2019s neighbour, Samuel, who she took in on the request of his uncle.\n\nTwo goats were also found dead outside the house, eyewitnesses told DAILY POST.\n\nThe family of seven died mysteriously from their sleep while the true nature of the death is still uncertain.\n\nLife of the mother of five\n\nOlatunji is a food vendor in the town of Apomu, Isokan Local Government Area of Osun State.

          "text": "The Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has resumed operations in the Oil Mining License 11 (OML 11) after a recent favourable judgement in Appeal Court.\n\nIt hailed the Appeal Court judgment affirming its operatorship, describing it as a huge victory for Nigeria and the beginning of addressing decades of host community restiveness.\n\nThe Appeal Court sitting in Abuja on Monday upturned the August 23, 2019 ruling of the Federal High Court, Abuja which held that the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) was entitled to the renewal of the Lease on OML 11.\n\nIn the ruling, the Appellate Court held that the Minister of Petroleum Resources has the discretion whether or not to renew the OML 11 Lease in favor of SPDC.\n\nThe Court further held that the Minister rightly exercised his discretion in awarding the OML 11 Lease to NPDC, a subsidiary of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nA statement by the Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division of the NNPC, Garba Deen Muhammad, quoted the NNPC Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, as saying that the ruling has paved the way for the NPDC to lead a formidable OML 11 team towards bolstering productivity in a responsible, efficient, environmentally friendly, and sustainable manner.\n\nAccordingly, resumption of operations on OML 11 will demonstrate the NPDC\u2019s full commitment to develop and add value to its communities and the nation as a whole.\n\n\u201cWe now have an opportunity to reconstruct a new beginning on OML 11, driven by global best practices and a social contract that would put the people and environment of the Niger Delta above pecuniary considerations.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge victory for the government and people of Nigeria as we now have the impetus to responsibly unlock the oil and gas reserves the block offers for the benefit of all Nigerians,\u201d Mallam Kyari stated.\n\nThe statement further stated that the NPDC has taken over the assets and operations are in full gear, adding that the company is working closely with all stakeholders and partners to achieve the new vision of \u201cresponsible, smart engineering and environmental sustainability,\u201d that the Federal Government has endorsed for OML 11.\n\nThe NNPC GMD stated that the NPDC will pursue promotion of clean energy via its gas production with prospects of gas-to-power initiatives to \u201clight up opportunities in the region,\u201d and provide the much deserved industrialization.\n\nThe statement noted that the environment will be a top priority for NPDC\u2019s operations, as well as implementation of a robust host community engagement strategy to address subsisting issues, while agreeing to a transparent engagement model going forward.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe NNPC cautioned against any further legal challenge by the SPDC, stressing that it was about time Nigeria derived the benefit of the OML11 after over three decades.\n\n\u201cIt is time to roll back the decades of despair and destruction with the emphatic Appeal Court ruling. It is time to unlock opportunities for economic development in the region.\n\n\u201cIn the light of their inability to work on the Ogoni region of the block for over 30 years and the new beginning this judgement presents, further legal action by Shell will not only be futile, it would be depriving Nigeria of an opportunity to make meaningful gains from OML 11 when the nation needs all the revenue it can get to move Nigeria forward,\u201d the GMD said.",

Enough is enough, I will no longer take any of these in our Kingdom\u201d, he said.\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, Amos Ehinomen Uagbor, queried: \u201cIs this obtainable elsewhere? We should now have Oba and Sultan in Edo State? In fact, the venue should be sealed\u201d.\n\nAlready, Enogie of Eyaen and owner of the hotel proposed for the coronation, has also distanced himself from the event.\n\nBut one of the RSVP numbers on the invite, when contacted with the truecaller on the phone, gave his identity as Hassan Yakubu Jidda, and confirmed the planned ceremony.\n\n\u201cWe have already done the coronation with Seriki Hausa, what we are planning is the party to celebrate the coronation. The Oba of Benin is aware and the government is aware,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti have called on Nigerians to be vigilant and defend the nation\u2019s democracy .\n\nThey made the call at the National Dialogue and Public Presentation of a book titled: \u201cRemaking Nigeria: Sixty Years, Sixty Voices \u201c in Abuja, yesterday. Abubakar, who was chairman of the occasion, called on Nigerians to defend democracy saying fixing or restructuring Nigeria would help in nation-building, adding that such would help to foster a sense of nationhood.\n\n\u201cOne lesson for all of us is the need to always be vigilant and be prepared to defend our democracy for it is through the democratic process that we can more easily promote the unity of our country. Strongly believe that Nigeria can and will remain one strong and united nation with significant strides in economic development to improve the lives of our peoples.\u201d He said that Nigeria should be restructured in a manner that allows various segments to develop at their own pace and not be held back by the centre or other segments.\n\nHe said developed segments would spur development in other segments because what they do well would attract the attention of others therefore making Nigerian union more attractive and nation-building easier.\n\nThe former vice president said that nationhood has to be forged through what people do as a country, and that leadership was critical in the process of nation-building.\n\n\u201cLeaders give direction and the example they set determines the extent to which their followers will trust them. Without trust, there\u2019s no leadership. Without leadership, a country drifts and becomes more difficult to forge into a nation. When we start developing with what we have, more of our people will want to identify with the country, love the country and commit their lives to the country.\n\n\u201cWhen that happens, especially with fairness and justice, nation-building accelerates, however imperfectly; development and nation-building do not happen by themselves. They are guided by people, especially leaders, thoughtful, insightful, and visionary leaders who are willing to make sacrifices and reach compromises,\u201d he said.\n\nAbubakar said when people see their leaders making efforts genuinely, and experience improvements in their lives, they were likely to follow suit.\n\nHe, however, said that citizens needed to work hard and make necessary compromise to accommodate one another.\n\nEkiti Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi and keynote speaker at the launch said there was no nation today that was wholly satisfied with its present status, adding that every nation at all times worked to become better. \u201cFor us as a people, our focus should be about how we can reinvent our nation, work for the prosperity of our people and ensure peace and prosperity. Indeed few people will disagree with the view that there is a significant gap between our potential for greatness as a country and the reality of where we are now. It is therefore a great duty for all of us, to continue to seek every opportunity to make the dream of a great nation come to pass.\u2019\u2019\n\nFayemi urged Nigerians to uphold the message of the second stanza of national anthem which says \u201cto build a nation where peace and justice reign.\u201d\n\nDr. Chido Onumah, editor of the book, said the book was a product of 11 years of planning, adding that the original idea was conceived in 2010 to coincide with Nigeria at 50.\n\nOnumah said that the book was the product of discussion on what needed to be done to rescue Nigeria.\n\nHe added that the aim was to give an opportunity to young Nigerians to help the country understand and sharpen its focus on the issues that should hold key to its survival.",

Then why denying our rights to benefit, right to have clean environment, right to have potable water to drink, good hospital, electricity, good roads but leaving us in abject poverty, in a desecrated environment without considering the UNFCCC/ CDM criteria.\n\n\u2018We will still study other areas in the Bill to address it in due course, for example, section 104 (2) on gas flaring where funds on penalty should be paid to the government, we reserve to study all sections, but is a fruitless exercise as usual,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the approved bill, the Senate approved a funding mechanism of 30 per cent of NNPC\u2019s profit from oil and gas for frontier basins. This fund is for oil exploration in frontier states.\n\nHowever, in the report, the states referred to as \u2018frontier basins\u2019 were not clearly stated.\n\nThis had also generated controversies as it is provision is seen to be in favour of Northern states where oil exploration is being carried out.\n\nIn their July 5 meeting, governors of Nigeria\u2019s southern states also rejected the proposed three per cent share to host communities in the Petroleum Industry Bill.\n\nA communique issued by the governors at the end of their meeting in Lagos, said the governors, instead, supported five per cent share to the communities.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Forum rejects the ownership structure of the proposed Nigeria National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC).\n\n\u201cThe Forum disagrees that the company be vested in the Federal Ministry of Finance but should be held in trust by Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) since all tiers of Government have stakes in that vehicle,\u201d it said.\n\nAlso, the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) rejected the three per cent approval for the development of host communities by the Senate.\n\nThe national publicity secretary of PANDEF, Ken Robinson, while reacting to the approval, said the government cannot transform the oil industry without transforming the communities in whose backyard the industry is operated.\n\n\u201cThe region is the biggest victim of the fraudulent Nigerian Constitution we are using and the lopsided nature of the country. So, what played out is what is playing out in every aspect of the country, particularly under this President,\" he said.\n\nA former Provost Marshal of the Nigerian Army, Brigadier-General Idada Ikponmwen, said the three-five per cent proposed as a benefit for host communities under the Host Community Trust, despite the abundant oil wells in their land, while 30 per cent is earmarked for exploration of oil in the northern part of the country in the PIB is an open invitation to anarchy.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe idea of three percent or five percent proposed as a benefit for host communities from oil proceeds while 30 per cent is embarked for exploration of oil in the northern part of the country clearly reveals arrogance, insensibility, disdain on part of the proponents of the PIB.\n\n\u201cDeeply examined, it is an open invitation to anarchy. This move cannot be acceptable to those who have borne the brunt of oil exploration and exploitation of oil and gas in Niger Delta, the President must be enjoined to reject the bill and have same returned to the National Assembly.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria's Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila were paid in dollars (millions of naira) to ensure the passage of the controversial Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) recently signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari, SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\nA top source told SaharaReporters that other federal lawmakers \u2013senators and House of Representatives' members \u2013also received bribes in dollars to ensure the passage of the bill.\n\n\"Lawan was paid $2 million (N823 million) while Gbajabiamila was paid $1.5 million (N617 million) as bribes,\" the source said.\n\nThe payment of the monies was said to have been facilitated by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva.\n\n\"Each senator was paid $20, 000 (N8.2 million) while members of the lower chamber (House of Representatives) were paid $5, 000 (N2 million) each,\" the source added.\n\nThe Nigerian Senate recently passed the Petroleum Industry Bill approving 3 per cent for host communities despite calls from various quarters that the provisions made for host communities should be reviewed upward.\n\nThe upper chamber passed the PIB, 2021 after the clause by clause consideration of the report of its joint committee on Petroleum (Upstream, Downstream and Gas) on PIB.\n\nThe Senate had before then, held a closed session with Sylva, and the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mele Kyari.\n\nStakeholders had vehemently rejected the provisions of the bill in respect to the percentage ceded to host communities, urging Buhari not to sign the bill into law.\n\nFor instance, the Host Communities of Nigeria Producing Oil and Gas, HOST ON, said it was insulting for the Senate and House of Representatives to cede only three and five per cent equity shareholding respectively to the oil and gas producing communities in the Petroleum Industry Bill, passed.\n\nTheir president, Benjamin Tamanarebi said the PIB passed by NASS was a fruitless exercise and unacceptable to the host communities.\n\nHe was quoted as saying, \u201cImagine for over 63 years of neglect, deprivation and marginalisation of the aborigines who have suffered untold hardship in the midst of wealth, for the first time after many years of agitation, asking for only 10 per cent equity shareholding and the leadership of NASS is considering five per cent and three per cent viewing it that they have done us a favour.\n\n\u201cThis is unacceptable and we reject the offer.\n\n\u201cIt is our sole right as the aborigines, it is our land, it is our water ways, Nigeria is claiming it because we are from Nigeria state. Then why denying our rights to benefit, right to have clean environment, right to have potable water to drink, good hospital, electricity, good roads but leaving us in abject poverty, in a desecrated environment without considering the UNFCCC/ CDM criteria.\n\n\u2018We will still study other areas in the Bill to address it in due course, for example, section 104 (2) on gas flaring where funds on penalty should be paid to the government, we reserve to study all sections, but is a fruitless exercise as usual,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the approved bill, the Senate approved a funding mechanism of 30 per cent of NNPC\u2019s profit from oil and gas for frontier basins. This fund is for oil exploration in frontier states.\n\nHowever, in the report, the states referred to as \u2018frontier basins\u2019 were not clearly stated.\n\nThis had also generated controversies as it is provision is seen to be in favour of Northern states where oil exploration is being carried out.\n\nIn their July 5 meeting, governors of Nigeria\u2019s southern states also rejected the proposed three per cent share to host communities in the Petroleum Industry Bill.\n\nA communique issued by the governors at the end of their meeting in Lagos, said the governors, instead, supported five per cent share to the communities.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Forum rejects the ownership structure of the proposed Nigeria National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC).\n\n\u201cThe Forum disagrees that the company be vested in the Federal Ministry of Finance but should be held in trust by Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) since all tiers of Government have stakes in that vehicle,\u201d it said.\n\nAlso, the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) rejected the three per cent approval for the development of host communities by the Senate.\n\nThe national publicity secretary of PANDEF, Ken Robinson, while reacting to the approval, said the government cannot transform the oil industry without transforming the communities in whose backyard the industry is operated.\n\n\u201cThe region is the biggest victim of the fraudulent Nigerian Constitution we are using and the lopsided nature of the country. So, what played out is what is playing out in every aspect of the country, particularly under this President,\" he said.\n\nA former Provost Marshal of the Nigerian Army, Brigadier-General Idada Ikponmwen, said the three-five per cent proposed as a benefit for host communities under the Host Community Trust, despite the abundant oil wells in their land, while 30 per cent is earmarked for exploration of oil in the northern part of the country in the PIB is an open invitation to anarchy.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe idea of three percent or five percent proposed as a benefit for host communities from oil proceeds while 30 per cent is embarked for exploration of oil in the northern part of the country clearly reveals arrogance, insensibility, disdain on part of the proponents of the PIB.\n\n\u201cDeeply examined, it is an open invitation to anarchy. This move cannot be acceptable to those who have borne the brunt of oil exploration and exploitation of oil and gas in Niger Delta, the President must be enjoined to reject the bill and have same returned to the National Assembly.\u201d",

          "text": "Duoye Diri, governor of Bayelsa state, has faulted the use of LGAs as a basis for revenue sharing in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe governor, represented by Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, his deputy, expressed his displeasure while declaring open a sensitisation programme on the review of the existing revenue allocation formula.\n\nThe event was organised by the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) in Yenagoa, the state capital, on Thursday.\n\nDiri said the existing formula needs to be looked into, adding that the RMAFC should review some of its revenue sharing parameters in the interest of equity and fairness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe current formula gives 52.68 percent to the federal government, the 36 states share 26.72 percent, while 20.6 percent goes to the 774 LGAs.\n\nThe governor said Bayelsa, with only eight LGAs and more square kilometers than several states in the country, is being shortchanged.\n\nHe said Bayelsa has about 11,000 square kilometers and some of its LGAs like Southern Ijaw are bigger than five or more council areas in some states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe believe that some of the indicators, you are using to share revenues currently do not promote equity and fairness in this country and therefore not acceptable to us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor instance, we do not agree that you should continue to use local government areas as a basis for sharing revenues. It is faulty because the creation of local governments was not done scientifically.\n\n\u201cIt was purely political and a case of who was holding the knife and the yam at the time of creating them. And so, those who had the knife cut more to themselves.\u201d\n\nDiri also faulted the decision of the commission to allocate revenues accruing from the disputed Soku oil wells to Rivers, even as the case is yet to be finally determined.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the funds ought to be placed in an escrow account pending the final determination of the disputed case.\n\n\u201cIt is unfair that for a judgment that we are still contesting in court, RMAFC is in a hurry to allocate revenues coming from the Soku oil wells to Rivers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe ordinarily had expected that that money would have been kept in an escrow account pending when the case is finally determined.\n\n\u201cWe know that Rivers state has a lot of resources and connections, but our take is that the right thing should be done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI say so because this oil dispute we are talking about, RMAFC itself had taken a decision on it several years ago. So, we expect the commission to stand by that decision.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the event, Konbowei Benson, secretary to the state government, said the commission needs to review extant revenue sharing formula, saying the current method is outdated.\n\nBenson, represented by Anthony Ikhobo, the permanent secretary, general services, asked the participants to come up with a more equitable distribution formula for accrued revenues from the federation account.\n\nIn his remarks, Alfred Egba, the RMAFC team leader at the occasion, said the commission will consider the recommendations of the various stakeholders.",

          "title": "Meet Regina Honu, a Ghanaian software developer teaching thousands of girls to code",
          "text": "Choosing the name of her company was the easiest aspect of Regina Honu\u2019s journey.\n\nIt only took her a few hours to connect the dots. She wanted her business to be unique; the word unique in Ghanaian language Twi translated to Soronko, so she named her company Soronko Academy \u2014 the first coding and human-centred design school for children and young adults in West Africa.\n\n\u201cSome people take days to pick their company name, I tell entrepreneurs that they\u2019re majoring in the minor. I say pick what you like and keep it moving, you can build a brand on it,\u201d she said over a call.\n\nAlmost ten years after she made that decision, Soronko Academy has trained over 20,000 young people in Ghana and Burkina Faso and connected about 5,000 of them to job opportunities. She\u2019s won multiple awards from brands such as Coca Cola and CNN for her contribution to tech in Ghana and Africa. She\u2019s also a Mandela Washington Fellow and an Ashoka Fellow.\n\nBut the road to starting Soronko Academy was paved with many obstacles and difficult decisions. She has worked at two major banks in Ghana as the only woman in the IT department, participated in a reality show and even almost joined Microsoft but turned back to pursue her dream of ensuring that young ladies have access to the same opportunities that she did while growing up.\n\nPlaying PAC-man, flying with rockets and ending up in the Kitchen\n\nHonu grew up in the 90s, a time where there were only a few reputable careers that people could explore. At the age of 12, she wanted to be a doctor until her father brought home a personal computer (PC). She mostly played PAC-man on it, which sparked her interest in computer science and inspired her to want to create her own game.\n\nA few months later, she watched a movie about a man being able to fly with a rocket strapped to his back. So she decided she was going to build her own rocket. To show how determined she was to make this a reality, she sketched a rocket and showed it to her teacher who quickly downplayed her ambition.\n\n\u201cHe said it\u2019s impossible, girls don\u2019t build rockets and I\u2019ll end up in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nThat experience made her shelve her ambition to build rockets and detest the fact that people always told her what she could do based on her gender. From then on she decided to become a computer scientist \u2014 the only one in her class with such ambition.\n\nFailure is not final\n\nIn her first year in senior secondary school, Honu had her first taste of failure during an Inter-school quiz competition. She missed a question in the final causing the school to not clinch the winning spot.\n\n\u201cI told myself I wasn\u2019t going to try anything again, I\u2019m a failure in life.\u201d\n\nThe experience left a sour taste in her mouth but being one of the brightest in her school meant that when another competition came along she was selected to represent her school. This time she was determined to go all out and win.\n\nIn order to impress the judges, she went as far as learning some Latin. Fortunately, she ended up winning the competition. This win was a huge confidence booster and a reminder that failure is not final.\n\nThe best part about winning the competition was that it gave her the opportunity to spend one year in Norway on a school exchange program.\n\nA year in Norway\n\nAt the age of 16, Honu had her first exposure to a different culture. She continued as a science student but quickly found out that things were different in Norway. The focus in her new school was more on comprehension but she was used to memorizing and regurgitating information without necessarily understanding it.\n\n\u201cI found out that I didn\u2019t understand anything. I could draw a very complex electrical circuit but if you give me two wires and a bulb to connect, I\u2019ll be lost.\u201d\n\nIn Norway the mode of training was different; students had access to formula books and calculators. All they had to do was understand how to apply the formula. She was initially lost but soon found her feet as she adapted to the more practical learning style.\n\nOutside of schooling, she learnt how to ride a bicycle, rollerblade and climb mountains. She even got a taste of activism by joining a protest. The experience taught her that she could do more than she thought she could.\n\n\u201cI think that Norwegian experience has shaped the way I am. People always ask me, were you born and raised in Ghana you seem different. I came back with a different way of thinking. \u201c\n\nGetting into University\n\nWhen it was time to choose where to get her first degree, there was some dispute between whether she should school abroad or remain in Ghana. Her mother opted for the former while she wanted the latter.\n\nFor Honu, she had lived abroad and wasn\u2019t fascinated by the idea. She was also concerned about the prospects of travelling out and not returning. She didn\u2019t want to be part of the brain drain phenomenon.\n\nHonu won the dispute but was faced with one more challenge. She wanted to study computer science but wasn\u2019t impressed by the fact that courses being taught in the universities in Ghana weren\u2019t evolving quickly.\n\n\n\nIt seemed like she\u2019ll have to concede to her mum until her dad spotted an advert in the newspaper for Ashesi University, a new school that was recruiting its first set of students. Asheshi promised its future students a world-class education with an up-to-date curriculum.\n\nConversation between Regina Honu and students of Ashesi University during a visit. Photo Credit: Ashesi Unversity\n\n\u201cI remember at that time, Ashesi was just a house at Labone. I walked in and saw that the university was a house but it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, she got into Ashesi to study computer science. At that time the total population of the school was 30 students, with 14 of them in the computer science program.\n\nAmerican futurist, Alvin Toffler is credited with saying that the illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn. Honu definitely agrees with this quote as she spent her first year at Ashesi unlearning many of the wrong ideas she had.\n\nGoing through University wasn\u2019t without its own struggles. In her second year, she found visual basics difficult to understand and considered switching to a business major.\n\nBut on her way to the dean\u2019s office she had a rethink.\n\n\u201cI asked myself, \u2018Is this how I\u2019m going to give up?\u2019 I decided to give it one more shot. I immersed myself in work. They\u2019ll give us group assignments and I will do it myself. I carried the load on my head, I was doing all the work and it became easy for me.\u201d\n\nIn her third year, she got her first internship at a software company. At this company, the stamina she had built for solving difficult problems came in handy, as Ashesi students were expected to go above and beyond.\n\n\u201cThere were times when my boss would give me tasks and I wouldn\u2019t understand it or know what to do but how would I say \u2018excuse me, sir, they didn\u2019t teach us that in class.\u2019 So I\u2019ll take out time to understand the question first before even trying to answer it, then go on to solve it.\u201d\n\nAfter the internship, she was retained by the company while still in school. This experience was her first taste of independence as she had moved on from relying on her dad who was giving her pocket money.\n\nWelcome to the Corporate world\n\nAfter school, she returned to work for the software company briefly before joining Zenith bank.\n\nTwo things attracted her to the bank: an increase in the pay and the expectation that because the bank closed to customers by 5 pm, the workers also closed at that time. But upon joining the bank she found out that the latter was not the case.\n\nShe quickly excelled on the job and became popular after she built an intranet system for the bank. She was responsible for re-engineering the bank\u2019s IT products used in Lagos for Ghana.\n\nBeing the only female in the IT department at the bank came with its own challenges. During meetings the men on the team tried to apportion the job of taking minutes or getting refreshments to her. She grew a thick skin to ward off such stereotypical remarks. She also had to learn to work with her male colleagues without bruising their egos.\n\n\u201cThe male ego is very interesting, if we\u2019re all working on a problem and I arrive at the solution first, I can\u2019t announce it because it\u2019ll come off as a show-off. I had to learn to bring everyone to my way of thinking and then have us arrive at the solution together.\u201d\n\nEveryone in the department got promoted\n\nHaving proved herself on the job, she decided to apply for an opening for the role of head of electronic banking \u2014 naturally, she expected to get the job. At the interview, she noticed something was off, the interviewer first verified she was in the right place and then went on to ask her non-work related questions.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t give me the benefit of doubt. He felt that I couldn\u2019t be the head of electronic banking. I was devastated.\u201d\n\nWhile sharing her awkward interview experience with a colleague, she mentioned her grade level at the bank. It was then she learnt that her colleagues were on higher grades than her and she was the lowest paid in the department.\n\n\u201cI was the lowest-paid not because I was female but because I didn\u2019t know how to negotiate. They don\u2019t tell women on the continent how to negotiate, you don\u2019t ask for more. While growing up, you take what you\u2019re given, smile and say thank you. There\u2019s nothing like asking for more. That\u2019s insolent behaviour.\u201d\n\nArmed with this information, she requested to be promoted to a particular grade or she\u2019ll resign. Her request was granted but ironically, her colleagues were also promoted to make it seem like a general department-wide promotion.\n\nThe Apprentice Africa\n\nIn the midst of all this, she took unpaid leave to participate in a reality TV show The Apprentice Africa; for her, it was an opportunity to get an MBA training. She didn\u2019t win the competition but it equipped her with a valuable understanding of business concepts and showed her a glimpse of how reality TV shows work.\n\n\u201cI was a resource person but I didn\u2019t assert myself, I was a bit shy. The thing with reality TV is that they create characters. They only edit it and show places of you behaving in a particular way. If you\u2019re loud, they show that, if you\u2019re quiet that\u2019s what they show.\u201d\n\nThe participants of The Apprentice Africa. Don\u2019t bother looking for Regina Honu, she\u2019s not in this picture.\n\nUpon leaving the show, she remembers that one of the crew persons walked up to her and said she\u2019ll be a great team player but not a leader.\n\n\u201cI was like hmm, maybe it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nShe got an offer to work for Bank PHB, headline sponsor of the show, but couldn\u2019t imagine living in the fast-paced Lagos, so she returned back to Ghana.\n\nSame experience at another bank and turning away from a job at Microsoft\n\nShe eventually left Zenith bank for Fidelity bank, a Ghanaian Bank. And it was the same experience all over again.\n\nIt was at this point that the idea to start her own company came but she shelved it at first.\n\n\u201cI always say I put a snooze button on my dream. I thought entrepreneurs are born but not trained. There are people who are born with charisma and are bold. I never saw myself that way.\u201d\n\nWhile at the bank, she got an opportunity to interview at Microsoft. She went through the process and got to travel to Seattle at Microsoft head office. While waiting for her turn, she made up her mind that she\u2019ll return to Ghana to build something.\n\nResigning from her Job\n\nThe morning of the day Honu resigned from her job, she didn\u2019t know it would happen. She was used to a certain comfortable life, earning a decent salary, but she wasn\u2019t happy.\n\n\u201cI told my friends that I wanted to resign and they were like no, it\u2019s a bad idea, don\u2019t be stupid. Bonus is coming. I just had that feeling that if I didn\u2019t do it that day. I won\u2019t have the courage to do that again.\u201d\n\nSo she took the jump, resigned, bought a computer and desktop to start training kids.\n\nShe also decided to move back to her parent\u2019s house to reduce costs and increase her runway. That was the start of Soronko Academy.\n\nRegina working with some students at Soronko Academy\n\nFinding the right kind of love\n\nAfter calling off a three-year-long relationship with a guy, who was putting up with her. Honu wasn\u2019t sure she might find the right man and was ready to make peace with that.\n\n\u201cHe felt that as soon as he put a ring on it, I\u2019ll start behaving like a typical Ghanaian woman. I remember attending a particular event where everyone kept coming to me and it was as if he was invisible. He was so angry. I started seeing that he couldn\u2019t deal with a woman who would outshine him.\u201d\n\nShe eventually met her husband on an interview set, a South African who was on holiday in Ghana. In 2015, they got married.\n\nRichard and Regina Honu on their wedding day. Photo Credit: Regina Honu\n\n\u201cI always advise women that who we marry is important, it makes a difference. The fact that my husband is supportive allows me to be different.\u201d\n\nThese days she spends her free time with her husband and daughter.\n\n10 years and counting\n\nIt\u2019s been almost 10 years since Honu started Soronko Academy, for her there\u2019s still so much more to do. She\u2019s looking to get a bigger space in order to accommodate more women and run a residential program.\n\nThese days her number one pet peeve is people asking her to do something else, that\u2019s she has done enough.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now doing some programs in the other Ghanaian regions and some women don\u2019t have an idea of what an email address is. So we still have a long way to go, we shouldn\u2019t count the minorities and privileged as progress.\u201d\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria has just frozen the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove and Chaka for the next six months.\n\nAccording to The Whistler, the Federal High Court in Abuja has granted an exparte motion which sought temporary freezing of bank accounts belonging to these online investment and trading platforms where Nigerians are transacting business online.\n\nThe motion was filed by Chief Micheal Kaase Aondoakaa, SAN, on behalf of the Central Bank Of Nigeria Governor for the purpose of probing the financial activities of these four fintech companies in Nigeria.\n\nThe CBN alleged that Rise Vest Technologies Limited, Bamboo Systems Technology Limited, Chaka Technologies Limited and Trove Technologies Limited were complicit in operating without license as asset management companies \u201cand utilizing FX sourced from the Nigerian FX market for purchasing foreign bonds/shares in contravention of the CBN circular referenced TED/FEM/FPC/GEN/01/012, dated July 01, 2015.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor told Justice Ahmed Mohammed that the foreign exchange deals done with the defendants were making the Naira weaker to the United States dollars, hence, the need to block 15 of their accounts for about 180 days.\n\nNotably, all four companies affected by this action have gotten licenses from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate as digital platforms for buying and selling stocks.\n\nIn response to this announcement, Risevest\u2019s CEO Eke Eleanya Urum and Bamboo have come out on Twitter (that\u2019s banned) to assure users of Risevest that trading activities will continue as usual and the issue will be sorted out with the regulators.\n\nHey guys, in respect to the most recent news regarding @Risevest and our FX dealings, rest assured all user investments and funds are safely managed, funding and withdrawals will continue to be processed as normal and all our US operations are intact. \u2014 Indaboski of Investing \ud83d\ude80 (@eldivyn) August 17, 2021\n\nHi everyone, we\u2019re aware of the recent reports about us.

This action comes on the back of the recent move by the CBN to stop the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country, and a restriction on these platforms for not being duly registered in April.\n\nAccording to a source from one of the affected companies, they lost a lot of users and deposits after the April announcement.

          "title": "Nigerian startup checks out of Afghanistan post Taliban takeover",
          "text": "Yesterday, a horrific video from Afghanistan broke the internet. Hundreds of Afghans, in a desperate bid to flee the country, were captured in the footage running after and clinging to the body of a US Air Force plane as it prepared to depart Kabul airport.\n\nOver the weekend, the Taliban hijacked the government and assumed total control of the capital city\u2014 it wasn\u2019t long before they had the whole country to themselves. The central government was disbanded; Ashraf Ghani, the president of Afghanistan fled the scene unannounced, leaving what remained of his administration in the mercy of the Taliban.\n\nAfghani citizens aren\u2019t the only ones affected by the current crisis. African entrepreneurs and skilled workers who run operations in Kabul are also dealing with the consequences of the Taliban\u2019s actions. How are they coping with this heat? Are they packing their loads and fleeing or are they staying put to see where the leaf drops?\n\nLast year Olumuyiwa Olowogboyega, former senior reporter, TechCabal, interviewed Vincent, a Nigeria Cybersecurity expatriate working out of Kabul, who described Afghanistan as a city on the edge, an unstable mountainous city with two presidents.\n\nMore recently, Chekkit, a Nigerian authentication and product tracking startup, expanded to Afghanistan after landing a partnership with the Afghanistan Ministry of Health to help in combating the endemic counterfeit medicine products in the country.\n\nIn a conversation with Tosin Adelowo, Chekkit CMO, I asked: why Afghanistan? Tosin disclosed that the country was urgently looking for a solution to the counterfeit market plaguing its cities and streets and \u201cChekkit has the perfect solution to the problem\u201d and that, alongside other brokering factors, is a major determinant of the expansion.\n\nAfter a successful pilot of Chekkit\u2019s drug verification solution in collaboration with their blockchain partner, Fantom Foundation (which was the major broker of the deal), the Afghanistan Ministry of Health announced the rollout of the service nationally on the 2nd of May 2021.\n\nNow, a little over three months later, Chekkit is pulling the plug on all its operations in Afghanistan. Their exit wasn\u2019t much of a decision as all their partners have been forced to exit the country.\n\n\u201cWe have discontinued our communication/operation in the region as our partners have also exited the region due to the civil unrest,\u201d Adelowo told TechCabal in an email. \u201dOur heart is with the people of Afghanistan and we pray for strength for them to withstand and surpass the current issues.\u201d\n\nChekkit\u2019s exit is just the beginning of a series of backward movements that are expected to happen in Afghanistan as a result of this unrest. And in the absence of Chekkit\u2019s solutions, and similar solutions in the market, there\u2019s a likelihood that counterfeit products will return with unchecked and unverified vengeance.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSince the takeover, different analyses have been released on the impact it will have on trade and economy of the country. According to Times Now, the Afghan economy has been reliant on international aid with a limited private sector. Nearly half (around 44%) of its workforce is in agriculture. Observers predict that with the Taliban in control, international trade will come to a standstill, leading to a surge in smuggling.\n\nThe prediction is already happening, we can see that international businesses and organisations are already closing shops and evacuating their people. Though after the capital takeover, the Taliban announced that the war is now over, can the dust settle that easily?\n\n\u201cToday is a great day for the Afghan people and the Mujahideen. They have witnessed the fruits of their efforts and their sacrifices for 20 years,\u201d Mohammad Naeem, the spokesman for the Taliban\u2019s political office, told Al Jazeera TV.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "Businesses could be back on the brink of scrambling for strategies to escape the weight of an economy at standstill as the surge of COVID-19 third wave brings Nigeria closer to a possible lockdown decision.\n\nThe peak of Nigeria\u2019s third wave of Covid-19 pandemic has begun, disease experts confirm, predicting that further rise in infections should be expected in the coming days as weak compliance with preventive measures persist.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) reported a 222 percent rise in infections on Wednesday as 1, 149 new cases were confirmed.\n\nThe spike following a daily average of 560 infections since the beginning of August marks the start of what experts describe as a peaking curve, which they say isn\u2019t shocking since community spread of the virus has continued and importation through in-bound travellers keep pacing.\n\nIf the rate of new infections blows out of the government\u2019s control, businesses still struggling to match their growth with pre-pandemic levels could lose current gains of recovery.\n\nThe last time Nigeria saw a similar amount of single-daily infections was in December 2020 (1,145 cases) just as the second wave of the pandemic began to peak towards 2,314.\n\nOyewale Tomori, a professor of virology in a chat with BusinessDay wondered why many Nigerians still do not believe the COVID-19 virus is circulating in the country despite rising numbers from only one-third of the 36 states.\n\nCaution has been thrown to the wind since governments lifted lockdown and eased activities in many sectors of the economy. People stopped wearing masks, hand-washing basins have disappeared in public places and physical distancing are not maintained except in some corporate organisations.\n\nThe rising cases are especially bad news for business entities in Lagos state where a majority of the cases (37.6 percent) come from and has the potential to be hardest hit by any severe measure taken to stop the virus in its tracks.\n\n\u201cThe virus-like mobile phone is immobile until human beings move it around and allow the virus to mutate and become variants of concern. Masks can stop the virus in its tracts including the variants,\u201d Tomori, former vice-chancellor of Bowen University told BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cMore important than government regulation and guidelines is the compliance by the citizens. We, the people, play a more important role than the government in covid19 control.\u201d\n\nThe first wave of the pandemic in 2020 and the economic meltdown that followed had companies experience little or no sales, leading to expiration, damage of inventories and reduction in prices in some cases.\n\nIn other instances, a complete shutdown of operations resulted in idle property, demand and revenue decline for companies, increase in operating costs and fall in share prices amongst others, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), an international consulting firm said in a report on key financial reporting implications of COVID-19 on organisations in Nigeria.\n\nApart from those in the telecommunication and digital entertainment industries that experienced a significant increase in revenue from increased demand for voice and data services, most others saw declining revenue, affecting employees.\n\nRead also: Covid-19: African Alliance says its Business Continuity Management key to sustainable operations\n\nA survey conducted by the Centre for Economic Policy Research in March indicated that traders had virtually zero revenue during a month-long lockdown.\n\nAnd even though sales rebounded more than employment after reopening, neither returned to pre-pandemic levels. Traders reported low sales, lack of cash on hand, and challenges with sourcing as significant problems facing their business.\n\n\u201cAlthough most traders raised their prices to cope with the impacts, very few took out loans. Traders are interested in new strategies to cope with low demand and supply challenges. Policies to facilitate traders\u2019 access to e-commerce and remote sales, as well as strategies to improve supply chain failures could help address these issues,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThe country has seen substantial relaxation in containment measures locally and internationally, which has supported the resumption of commercial and trade activities and spurred a modest economic performance in the first half.\n\nSome considerable increases in trade volume have been recorded since the start of the year, amid a low vaccination rate, with Nigeria\u2019s trade with the global community, for instance, rising to around N9 trillion between January and March this year.\n\nSimilarly, the scale of contraction in the Nigerian trade sector moderated from a double-digit to a single digit in the first quarter.\n\nIf these gains must be protected, a lockdown situation must be averted.\n\nAlthough the federal government on Thursday ruled out a third lockdown over the presence of the Delta variant of coronavirus in the country, saying that the current threats are not at a level where another national shutdown will be considered.\n\nIf need be, he said it would be a precision lockdown.\n\nOsagie Ehanire, Health minister said that apart from the vaccines sourced free of charge, Nigeria has paid for about 30 million doses of Johnson & Johnson doses.\n\n\u201cLockdown is the last measure that countries have taken because our lockdown stifles economic activity, restricts your own freedom and your business \u2013 both corporate business, government business, private business are affected,\u201d Ehanire said.\n\n\u201c\u2026when we were compelled to have that lockdown at the beginning we learnt a lot of lessons. We are not at the level yet where we are feeling that threat to do any lockdown,\u201d\n\nIn a mailed response to BusinessDay, Chikwe Ihekweazu, NCDC director-general said the recent increases in COVID-19 infections which has been associated with the Delta variant of the virus in most countries has more to do with the resumption of social gatherings with poor adherence to public health and social measures in Nigeria.\n\nThe situation, he said, highlights the urgent need for Nigerians to take personal and collective responsibility, noting that the pandemic is not over.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we recognise the risk the virus poses and adhere to the known preventive measures by avoiding large gatherings, wearing a face mask properly in public settings, washing hands regularly with clean water and soap or using alcohol-based hand sanitiser where the former is unavailable,\u201d Ihekweazu said.",

          "text": "The minister of labour and employment, Chris Ngige, has sought the approval of President Muhammadu Buhari to meet the leadership of the Nigerian Medical Association, Medical and Dental Consultants Association of Nigeria (MDCAN), Association of Medical Doctors in the Academics and the striking National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), among other concerned parties, in a bid to resolve the lingering labour conflicts in the nation\u2019s health sector.\n\nThe minister, who disclosed this on Thursday, shortly after meeting with the president, said the meeting is scheduled to hold 2 p.m. on Friday.\n\nSimilar meetings in the past ended in stalemates after the doctors accused the government of insincerity.\n\nHowever, the new move is coming after failed attempts to seek a court order to compel the striking members of NARD back to work after all entreaties failed.\n\nLegal battles\n\nThe labour ministry, on behalf of the federal government, had earlier approached the National Industrial Court at the Federal Capital Territory to seek an order declaring the strike illegal. But following the failure of the parties involved in the matter to appear before the court, hearing on the matter was adjourned till September 15.\n\nHowever, in another surprising move, a non-governmental organisation, Rights for All International, also approached the same court with an ex parte application to restrain the striking doctors from continuing the industrial action.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES, however, reported on Thursday that John Targema, the presiding judge in the matter, rejected the application, saying issuing \u201ca restraining order\u201d against the doctors to stop the strike without hearing them would be in breach of their right to fair hearing.\n\nScheduled meeting\n\nAddressing the media at the state house on Thursday, the minister said his meeting with Mr Buhari was to brief the latter on the efforts made so far to address the lingering crisis.\n\nHe said; \u201cThe Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), came over on the prompting of the Medical Elders\u2019 Council Forum; that is, experienced senior doctors, former government officials who are doctors, and we started dialogue two days ago.\n\n\u201cSo, we are continuing the dialogue tomorrow (Friday). At least, they are expected to bring to the discussion, the sub associations of NMA, including the resident doctors, the Medical and Dental Consultants Association of Nigeria, who also threatened strike over some more issues\u2026 So, we have agreed to meet tomorrow at 2 p.m.\u201d\n\nMr Ngige said the president also directed him to liaise with his chief of staff, Ibrahim Gambari, so that other relevant government officials can be part of the meeting.\n\n\u201cSo I have just finished briefing the president on the situation as we presently have it on ground. And he has given his blessing for us to proceed. He also gave me permission to liaise with the Chief of Staff so that some government agencies; Federal Ministry of Health, Budget Office of the Federation, Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Accountant General, National Salaries Wages and Incomes Commission, Office of Head of Service, and all the government agencies involved or that have anything to do with some of the complaints of these three groups of medical doctors should come on board tomorrow so that we can sort the issues out. That is what I came for primarily,\u201d the minister said.\n\n\u2018No work, no pay rule\u2019 stands\n\nMr Ngige, however, said the new efforts would not stop the government from implementing the \u2018no work, no pay rule,\u201d saying it is about law and not sentiments.\n\nHe said; \u201cI invoked Section 43 of the Trade Dispute Act, 2004 on withdrawal of wages during strike periods, which, in common parlance here, is called the principle of no work no pay. It is not the law of Ngige, or the law of Buhari.\n\n\u201cYou all know that this is COVID-19 period. And we were expecting Delta variant upsurge with a third wave. And suddenly, the resident doctors downed their tools, claiming that they were resuming a suspended strike. I then told them that there was nothing like a suspended strike, and that a strike is a strike.\u201d\n\nHe said the rule is not new to the country, saying such was applied against members of the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) when they went on strike.\n\nDialogue with NGF\n\nMeanwhile, the minister has said he was prepared to meet the Nigerian governors as part of efforts towards addressing some of the demands of the striking doctors, which he noted are within the purview of some concerned state governments.\n\nMr Ngige, also a former governor and a medical doctor by profession, said he was prepared to meet the governors through their body, Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum. The forum is currently chaired by the Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNARD to attend meeting\n\nMeanwhile, the leadership of the striking doctors has said it would attend the meeting but said it was not invited to the meeting by the minister but by NMA.\n\nThe union\u2019s President, Okhuaihesuyi Uyilawa, who spoke with PREMIUM TIMES on Friday on the phone, said his team would be at the meeting.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has said Nigeria\u2019s unity, like every relationship, is negotiable and can always be negotiated.\n\nAtiku, the presidential candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party in the 2019 general election made the remark at the launch of a book, \u201cRemaking Nigeria: sixty years, sixty voices,\u201d a compendium of sixty essays written by sixty different authors from different sectors, which treated various aspects of Nigeria\u2019s existence, while also questioning the values the country has passed through since independence.\n\nThe was edited by Chido Onumah and published by Premium Times Books, Premium Times reported.\n\nSpeaking as the chairman of the event \u2013 during which he launched the book for N2 million \u2013 Mr Abubakar said it was \u201camusing\u201d to hear people declare Nigeria\u2019s unity as fixed, yet they do everything to \u201cdestroy the (nation\u2019s) fragile unity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen we start developing with what we have, more of our people will want to identify with the country, love the country and commit their lives to the country. When that happens, especially with fairness and justice, nation-building accelerates, however imperfectly,\u201d Mr Abubakar said.\n\n\u201cThis is why I find it amusing when people declare Nigeria\u2019s unity as fixed and non-negotiable, while doing everything in their power to destroy that fragile unity. Nothing in the relationships among peoples is fixed for eternity.\n\n\u201cYou cannot declare your marriage as non-negotiable, while doing everything to sow seeds of discord in that same marriage. Countries can be created by force. You can whip groups of people into forming a country but you cannot whip them into forming a nation.\n\n\u201cNations are built through conscious or even unconscious agreement by peoples who believe that being together is, on balance, more beneficial than being apart.\u201d\n\nThe editor of the book, Chido Onumah, said the book was \u201ca product of eleven years of planning\u201d initially conceived in 2010, during the country\u2019s 50th year of independence, but it was published after its \u201cthird missionary\u201d journey.\n\nHe said the focus was to foster \u201cnational dialogue\u201d towards \u201ca viable union.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are Nigerians who think one option open to the country is a revolution; there are those who say the problem of Nigeria is leadership and that if we get our leadership recruitment process right, every other thing will fall in place; yet, there are others who think the fundamentals of nationhood are flawed and nothing will work if we don\u2019t fix it.\n\n\u201cThis book is the product of discussion on what needs to be done to rescue Nigeria. The aim is to give an opportunity to young Nigerians \u2014 the critical change agents \u2014 to help the country understand and sharpen its focus on those issues that hold the key to our collective survival as a people.\n\n\u201cThe essays that make up (the book) critically examine Nigeria\u2019s social, economic, and political situation and explore the options open to us, suggest solutions and how to actualise them. They take a critical look at the country\u2019s democratic experiment since independence in 1960, where the country is today and some of the major issues that have dogged the country\u2019s march to genuine democracy and nationhood,\u201d he noted.\n\nAlso speaking at the event was the Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, who said every nation strives towards getting better, and Nigeria cannot be an exception.\n\nHe said it was important to do everything possible in \u201cremaking,\u201d as the title of the book goes, without \u201cunmaking\u201d Nigeria. This he said was possible by upholding the line in the second stanza of the national anthem which says \u201cto build a nation where peace and justice reign.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor us as a people, our focus should be about how we can reinvent our nation, work for the prosperity of our people and ensure peace and prosperity,\u201d Mr Fayemi, who doubles as the chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u02bc Forum, said in his address.\n\n\u201cIndeed few people will disagree with the view that there is a significant gap between our potential for greatness as a country and the reality of where we are now.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore a great duty for all of us, to continue to seek every opportunity to make the dream of a great nation come to pass,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe launch also featured a panel discussion where some of the articles in the book as they relate with the Nigerian reality were discussed.\n\nThe discussants were consistent with their calls for redefining Nigeria through systemic and deliberate change in the attitude of Nigerians toward their country.\n\nThey panellists included Amina Salihu, Tope Fasua, Dike Chukwumerije, Chris Ngwodo, Mojeed Dahiru and Ahmadu Shehu.\n\nAlso present at the event were Mahmud Jega, the Editor-in-chief of 21st Century Chronicle who reviewed the book; Nkoyo Toyo, Nigeria\u2019s former ambassador to Ethiopia and the permanent representative to the African Union, Premium Times reported.\n\nOthers were Alero Ayida-Otobo, the CEO of the School of Politics, Policy and Governance (SPPG), and Pius Anyim, former senate president and secretary to the government of the federation as well as other authors in the book.",

          "text": "The Islamic Movement in Nigeria, IMN, has said officers of the Sokoto State Police Command killed 3 of its members and injured 12 on Thursday.\n\nThe group stated this in a statement sent to PM News on Friday.\n\nIMN said police lied by claiming that \u201cneither a Shi\u2019ite member nor anybody was killed or injured,\u201d after attacking Ashura mourners in Sokoto.\n\nThe group, however, identified Bello Muhammad Illela, Imrana Umar Yabo, and Hasan Abubakar Sokoto as the persons killed during the attack.\n\nPlease read IMN\u2019s full statement below\n\nThe attention of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria has been drawn to a mischievous press statement issued by the Sokoto State Police Command, claiming that \u201cneither a Shi\u2019ite member nor anybody was killed or injured,\u201d after Policemen attacked Ashura mourners in Sokoto who were about to disperse, firing teargas canisters and live ammunition on Thursday, 19 August 2021.\n\nEven though the Police Command in Sokoto claimed it acted professionally in quelling what it said was a clash between brothers and sisters of the Islamic Movement and some Area boys in Sokoto, it lied to the public, as if being transparent in its operations is not an act of professionalism.\n\nFirstly, there wasn\u2019t any clash that warranted the intervention of the Police in the first place. Probably that was what some security agents had planned and hoped for, but it never happened. The Ashura mourning procession started from Trade Fair on Kano road, passed through NNPC to Mahmud Gumi road and ended at Madam Karo peacefully without any incident. It was while the closing prayer was being said that the police started firing live bullets at the mourners.\n\nSecondly, the Islamic Movement has in its possession the pictures of those killed and injured, which will be released to the public, to discern who the liar is in the killing of innocent citizens who came out to exercise their constitutional rights of freedom of association and religion during Ashura commemoration anniversary.\n\nThe following are those killed by the police as a result of bullet wounds they sustained during the attack: Bello Muhammad Illela, Imrana Umar Yabo, and Hasan Abubakar Sokoto. Their pictures are attached to this statement.\n\n12 others were seriously injured and are being treated by the Islamic Movement.\n\nAt Least the public deserves to know the truth from those who are entrusted with protecting their lives and properties, but instead the police choose to protect its own members, who we believe acted pre-judiciously.\n\nWe, therefore, call on the Sokoto State Police Command to own up to the cold murder of unarmed civilians yesterday, and pay the blood ransom prescribed by Islamic Shari\u2019a and offer apologies to the public for the erroneous press statement it issued in regard to the needless attack it carried out against the Ashura mourners.\n\nSimilar Ashura processions were held across the country, in various state capitals and major towns, including the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. There wasn\u2019t any report of a breach of the peace by the security agents in those states, why is Sokoto different?\n\nWe believe this brutal attack on innocent mourners is a clear exhibition of religious intolerance by the state government. As such we wonder how a state governor who couldn\u2019t tolerate the religious freedom of his fellow Muslims can guarantee the religious rights of others of different faith when given the opportunity to serve at the federal level. Hence we demand a clear explanation and demand for justice from the state government.",

From that time till now, a lot has happened within the security domain. Mr. President called for this meeting. And it was actually supposed to be for next week, but he drew it back for today, for obvious reasons.\n\n\u201cThe meeting briefed Mr. President on the current security situation in the country. Well, I\u2019ll say from the last time we met till now, and all the issues that were brought before the president, were mainly issues arising from the successes recorded in the theatre of operations throughout the North East.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that a lot of successes have been recorded. Large numbers of people are surrendering in the north east as a consequence of the relentless efforts of the Armed Forces, intelligence and security agencies.\n\n\u201cThis is very, very evident. We\u2019ve never had such large numbers of people defecting from the other side, back to the Nigerian side, mainly, as a result of many issues within the theatre, issues of infighting among the various factions of the terrorist groups.\n\n\u201cBut with the new drive of the Armed Forces, the police, the intelligence agencies, there have been greatest cooperation, greater synergy in intelligence sharing, as well as our partners in the regional intelligence fusion unit.\n\n\u201cSo, the president was briefed, the president is quite happy that there\u2019s been tremendous success, especially with the advent of the new service chiefs and Inspector General of Police. And he\u2019s also made it very, very clear that he\u2019s not ready to exit government as a failure. He is not going to tolerate failure and that he\u2019s made changes and is ready to make further changes if he is not satisfied.\n\n\u201cHe is completely determined to ensure that there\u2019s a turnaround in the fortunes in the theatre of operations. We also addressed the issue of the prevailing situation, which is widespread, you know, issues of hunger,\u201d Monguno said.\n\nPlans for repentant fighters\n\nThe NSA also told journalists that government had plans for the large number of Boko Haram insurgents that surrendered.\n\n\u201cYes, there are plans. But I don\u2019t want to immediately divulge what has been decided on those plans till the President takes a firm decision on the plans.\n\n\u201cBut definitely that is one of the things that he intends to address, the number of people coming. And it\u2019s not just in Nigeria, even in northern Cameroon, you have equally large numbers of people surrendering to the bonafide agencies of government. But that is all as a consequence of the regional cooperation between the various countries and the agencies of those countries,\u201d he said.\n\nOn hunger in the land\n\nOn the widespread hunger and pains among Nigerians, he said: \u201cThe President is not oblivious of the pains of the people, and is working with the Vice President and other members of council. He is going to employ the relevant ministries, departments and agencies of government to address this issue.\n\n\u201cAs far as he is concerned, it\u2019s also an emergency situation that people should not be left to wallow in hunger, and in despair, this is something that he\u2019s also going to look into. And he\u2019s going to use all the necessary, all the relevant tools at his disposal to address the issue of widespread hunger.\u201d\n\nNorth-west\n\nThe NSA also said the meeting dwelt on the security challenge in the North-west.\n\n\u201cAnd then also the issue of insecurity in the northwest, which is still, even though for those of us who are within the security system, we have seen a significant drop in the number of incidents of kidnapping and banditry, nevertheless, a lot has to be done. Because like I\u2019ve always said in the past, as far as the people are concerned, there shouldn\u2019t be any incident of kidnapping, banditry, and other incidents of insecurity.\n\n\u201cSo, the president is also aware of that and he has also made certain assertions which I am not willing to say right now, till he\u2019s made the final decision on those things. But generally, the atmosphere is improving, especially in the north eastern part of the country. The president is very, very happy with the drive in that part of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nPlateau killings\n\nThe NSA said the meeting also deliberated on the recent killings in Plateau state.\n\nHe said while President Buhari lauded Governor Simon Lalong for his efforts at bringing the situation under control, he charged security agencies to step up and restore normalcy to the troubled spots across the state.\n\nThe NSA said there was the need for Nigerians to forge a sense of oneness, unity, and put aside whatever suspicions, apprehensions or agitations that exist.\n\n\u201cIn the context of the 21st century, you can\u2019t deal with these emerging crises in a cut and dried manner. We have to use everything at our disposal, all the elements of national power, including the population, the wider community needs to work with the security agencies to deal with these problems.\n\n\u201cResponses have to be fast. We can\u2019t act on stale intelligence. And that is why as things are happening, right from the grassroots level going all the way up, the local government, the state governments, and then of course, the federal government has its own parts to play.\n\n\u201cPeople should not cover for those who they have identified, unscrupulous, undesirable people, it is very, very important that we share because in today\u2019s context, the highest value intelligence doesn\u2019t necessarily need to come from the agencies of government. It could come from any other tangential organisation, institution or group,\u201d he said.\n\nWe are not failed state -Lai\n\nAnd further to this, Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed has said Nigeria is not a failed state and cannot go the way of Afghanistan where the Taliban took the rein of power.\n\nThe minister stated this in Washington DC during his engagements with international media organizations, including the BBC Radio and Television, Bloomberg and Politico.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports the minister is in the U.S. to meet with international media organisations and think tanks on the achievements of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration and efforts made so far in tackling insurgency, banditry and all form of criminality.\n\nSpeaking with NAN after his respective meeting with the three media organisations, Mohammed said insinuation in certain quarter that the security situation in Nigeria could degenerate to that of Afghanistan was not correct.\n\nHe said Nigeria was winning the war against terror and the country cannot go the way of Afghanistan where Taliban, a terrorist group took over power.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cNigeria is not and will not be a failed state. Yes, we have challenges in some corners of the country but that has not made Nigeria a failed state.\n\n\u201cA failed state is one where basic facilities are not available and everything has broken down but, Nigeria is not in that stage.\u201d\n\nWhile insisting \u201cNigeria is not at war\u201d, the minister said fake news and disinformation were being used to portray the country in precarious situation.\n\nMohammed said the development in Afghanistan had proven right the position of President Buhari that when fighting an unconventional war; the country had to be resourceful.\n\n\u201cIf what happened in Afghanistan is something to go by, then the federal government should be given kudos for the way it has handled insurgency in the last couple of years.\n\n\u201cThe lessons from Afghanistan today is that for over 20 years of American intervention and over a trillion dollar spent and thousands of American lives lost, it took the Taliban just few weeks to recapture Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThis should be a lesson for everybody that when you are fighting an insurgency or movement driven by ideology, it is always difficult to overcome and you must be resourceful, deploying both kinetic and non-kinetic approach.\n\n\u201cWhen people were saying we should invite mercenaries, the president was focused and maintained that our military have what it takes.\n\n\u201cThe president should be given kudos for believing in our military and deploying both kinetic and non-kinetic approaches,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister said while a lot of efforts had been put on kinetic approach, the Nigerian military also engaged in non-kinetic approach, building hospitals, reviving schools, teaching in some of the schools and delivering medical care to people in the affected areas.\n\nHe said the non-kinetic approach to fighting insurgency in the North-east had led to droves of insurgents coming out to surrender arms and pledging their loyalty to the government.\n\nMohammed also said with the recent development of many Boko Haram coming out voluntarily to surrender their arms, the country is winning the war against insurgency.\n\nOn banditry, the minister said bandits were now suffering more casualties than ever before.\n\nHe assured that the delivery of the Super Tucano military platforms by U.S. to the military would be a game changer in the fight against banditry.

          "text": "\u2026to launch a campaign next week\n\n\u2026INEC action irrelevant, contempt of valid order of Owerri High Court \u2013 Umeoji\n\nActing national chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, High Chief Jude Okeke, has frowned at a press release by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, titled \u2018Candidates For Anambra Governorship Election,\u2019 dated August 19, 2021, in which the electoral body disclosed the publication of Prof. Charles Soludo as the candidate of the party, instead of that of Honourable Chukwuma Umeoji , as ordered by an Owerri High Court.\n\nThe acting national chairman insists that by the provisions of both the Electoral Act and the INEC time table, the electoral umpire ought not to make any other publications of candidates until October which would be the final publication. \u201cThis publication by INEC is unknown to law and should be discountenanced as we would not be a party to aiding INEC in violating the laws of our land.\n\n\u201cThe Court of Appeal, Kano Division, did not make any finding that Victor Oye is chairman or that Prof. Soludo is the candidate of our party. The court only set aside the judgement of the Jigawa High Court for want of jurisdiction. In the absence of any direct order by the Appeal Court, the judgement that conclusively determines the question of who is chairman and candidate of APGA is the judgement of Justice B.C. Iheka of the Owerri High Court was reaffirmed by Justice V. C. Isiguzo of the same High Court.\n\n\u201cBoth the judgement and order from the honourable justices of the Owerri High Court had been served on INEC before this contemptuous action of changing the name of our candidate.\n\n\u201cAPGA will consider action in contempt against the commission, as it has not gone down well with Ndi Anambra to have a neutral electoral umpire succumb to the whims and caprices of a section of the political class.\n\n\u201cBased on the foregoing, Hon. Chukwuma Umeoji is still the candidate of our party and all preparations for the kickoff of his campaign as the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA , in Anambra State is in top gear. The launch of the campaign which will lead to Umeoji winning the November 6 governorship election and becoming the next governor of the state will hold next week,\u201d a statement from the party said.\n\nIt insisted that the authentic chairman of APGA, High Chief Jude Okeke, will be presenting the flag of the party to Umeoji at the launch of the campaign that will be attended by party leaders, members and loyalists across the state and the country, who have been yearning for the comforting touch of Hon. Umeoji as governor of Anambra State.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the Supreme Court will correct the wrong done by the appellate court; hence we shall not be distracted from our plans to campaign in all parts of the state to make our programmes and plans for the state known to the people. We entertain no iota of doubt that our victory both at the apex court and at the polls is certain,\u201d Chief Okeke noted.",

          "text": "Researchers in Nigeria have advocated the formulation of a national policy on industry and academia partnership to enhance synergy and the transfer of research into products and services.\n\nSpeaking during a virtual meeting organized by the Tertiary Education Trust Fund, TETFund, Research and Development Standing Committee, RDSC , on Institutionalisation of R&D in Industrialisation, manufacturing, Trade, Investment, and Economy thematic group, the researchers stressed the need for Nigeria to utilize research to grow a competitive economy on its areas of comparative advantage such as agriculture.\n\nPresident of Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, Engr Mansur Ahmed, who chaired the meeting, noted that the country should aim for sustained economic growth, build the capacity of its manufacturing sector and expand its trade policies.\n\nWhile appreciating the leadership and commitment of the Executive Secretary of TETFund, Prof Suleiman Bogoro for initiating the process of institutionalizing R&D in the country, Ahmed said \u201cwe need a clear strategy for expanding our energy sector to support our industrialization strategy; we need to upscale the skills of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHe expressed confidence that R&D has enough potentials to grow the country\u2019s manufacturing sector, noting that the country must factor research in a way that fits the industrialization process to grow its economy in a way that Nigeria becomes an industrialized nation.\n\n\u201cWe all recognized that R&D has been the major driver of economies across the world and every aspect of life but it has not had that impact in Nigeria, that especially, we believe that we have potentials given the enormous human and material resources that are at our disposal,\u201d he said.\n\nAhmed added that the R&D initiative which seeks to anchor research in the country\u2019s economy was overdue, stating that the time to institutionalize research in Nigeria is now.\n\nAccording to him, the socio-economic aspects of industrialization, manufacturing, trade, investment and economy constitute the social transition from the output of research and development into the provision of products and services for human livelihood.\n\nA Vice-Chairman of the TETFund RDSC , Prof Anya O. Anya, in his remarks, noted that Nigeria must aim at double digits economic growth and single-digit inflation, adding that it is only when the country\u2019s economy grows at 7.5 percent of GDP per annum that the country can overcome some of its challenges and induce competitiveness.\n\nAnya said the reason Nigeria must keep its inflation down is that the high unemployment and poverty rates in the country cannot be managed except its inflation is brought down.\n\nAlso speaking, the Chairman of the RDSC, Prof Njida Gadzama, said given the potentials Nigeria has, the country deserves to be better than it is.\n\nGadzama, who lamented that the country imports virtually everything, called on all Nigerians to lay aside their differences, unite and develop the country.\n\nOn the insecurity in the country, he noted that the nation must return to the era when it used to manufacture its own military weapons such as rifles.\n\nIn a presentation, a Professor of Agronomy at Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi, Prof Ali Garba, noted that the manufacturing sector accounts for only 11 percent of the country\u2019s economy as of 2019, adding that manufacturing in Nigeria is hindered by the poor power supply, government policies, among others.\n\nWhile giving a breakdown of Nigeria\u2019s economic performance, Garba said the country\u2019s largest export sector is crude petroleum with 76 percent, while petroleum gas has 14 percent and agricultural products 22 percent.\n\nHe lamented that as of 1980, Nigeria used to refine its crude, and all vehicles were assembled in Nigeria but now they are all imported, stating that agriculture and the industry are important mutual partners in the industrialization process.\n\nAccording to him, adequate infrastructural development such as good road networks and electricity were very critical to the country\u2019s quest for industrialization.\n\nOn defense and military, he said if the defense could step up its security investment in the country will improve and industrialization will take place, adding that military equipment can also be manufactured locally.\n\nHe said industrialization in Nigeria was the solution to unemployment and poverty, while noting that all counties that developed were at one point suffering from unemployment until they achieved industrialization.",

          "text": "The Taliban have stepped up their search for people who worked for Nato forces or the previous Afghan government, a UN document has warned. It said the militants have been going door-to-door to find targets and threaten their family members.\n\nThe hardline Islamist group has tried to reassure Afghans since seizing power in a lightning offensive, promising there would be \u201cno revenge\u201d.\n\nBut there are growing fears of a gap between what they say and what they do.\n\nThe warning the group were targeting \u201ccollaborators\u201d came in a confidential document by the RHIPTO Norwegian Center for Global Analyses, which provides intelligence to the UN.\n\n\u201cThere are a high number of individuals that are currently being targeted by the Taliban and the threat is crystal clear,\u201d Christian Nellemann, who heads the group behind the report, told the BBC.\n\n\u201cIt is in writing that, unless they give themselves in, the Taliban will arrest and prosecute, interrogate and punish family members on behalf of those individuals.\u201d\n\nHe warned that anyone on the Taliban\u2019s blacklist was in severe danger, and that there could be mass executions.\n\nForeign powers are continuing efforts to get their nationals out of Afghanistan. A Nato official said on Friday that more than 18,000 people have been evacuated in the last five days from Kabul airport.\n\nSome 6,000 more, among them former interpreters for foreign armed forces, are on standby to be flown out late on Thursday or early Friday.\n\nThe aim is to double evacuation efforts over the weekend, the official said.\n\nOutside the airport the situation remains chaotic. The Taliban have been blocking Afghans trying to flee, with one video showing a child being handed to a US soldier.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who has come under scathing criticism over what his opponents say is a \u201cshambolic\u201d US withdrawal, is expected to speak on Friday about the evacuation effort.\n\nIn other developments:\n\nMore anti-Taliban protests have taken place in several cities. In the capital Kabul, demonstrators waved the national flag while there were reportedly casualties among protesters in Asadabad\n\nOne of those who died falling from a US plane leaving Kabul has been identified as 19-year-old Zaki Anwari, who played for Afghanistan\u2019s national youth football team\n\nThe Taliban now control thousands of US-made armoured vehicles, 30-40 aircraft and a large number of small arms, US officials told Reuters\n\nThe Taliban captured Kabul on Sunday, having swept across the country as foreign forces withdrew.\n\nTheir victory returns the group to power 20 years on from when they were toppled in a US-led invasion.\n\nThe group\u2019s previous stint in power saw widespread abuses, including public executions and banning women from the workplace.\n\nBut in their first news conference since retaking control of Afghanistan, the group presented a conciliatory tone, promising women\u2019s rights would be respected \u201cwithin the framework of Islamic law\u201d.\n\nThe Taliban have reportedly pledged not to force women to wear the burka \u2013 a one-piece veil that covers the face and body. Instead, the hijab \u2013 or a headscarf \u2013 will be compulsory.\n\nThey also said they did not want \u201cany internal or external enemies\u201d and that there would be an amnesty for former members of the security forces and those who worked with foreign powers.\n\nInternational powers \u2013 and many Afghans \u2013 remain sceptical.\n\nThe UN chief Antonio Guterres said the only leverage the body had over the Taliban was the militant\u2019s desire for international recognition.\n\nAsked in an interview if he thought the Taliban had changed, President Biden said no, adding the group faced an \u201cexistential\u201d choice about whether they want to be recognised.\n\nBBC",

          "title": "Nigeria: International Oil Companies Owe Niger Delta Commission $4bn, Minister Says",
          "text": "The Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, has accused all international oil companies (IOCs) operating in Nigeria of being indebted to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) to the tune of $4 billion.\n\nThis is just as the Minister also disclosed that the forensic audit carried out on the activities of the NDDC has been completed and awaiting presentation to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe former Akwa Ibom State Governor also did not hesitate to assure the people of the Niger Delta region that the on-going rehabilitation of the East West Road would be completed by government in 2022.\n\nAkpabio, who spoke on Friday, at the weekly ministerial press briefing organised by the Presidential Communications Team at the State House, Abuja, said the IOCs who are required to deposit three per cent of their annual budgets to the commission as their statutory contribution to its funding have failed to do so for several years.\n\nHe said: \u201cNDDC is being owed $4 billion by the OICs unremitted funds. The federal government is owing a little bit of its own part that it should do to the NDDC. I believe that with the audit of the commission, we will begin to offset those things working closely with the ministry of finance.\n\n\u201cThere are plans to pay those debts. I want to see a balance sheet of the NDDC that is bankable. The IOCs are expected to pay to the NDDC three per cent of their annual budgets. All of them have failed to do so at different times\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, the debt profile of the 21-year old NDDC stands at over N3 trillion, adding that no significant project executed by the Commission matched the figure.\n\nHe explained that it was in a bid to unearth where the huge sums of money given to the NDDC had been utilised that led to the setting up of the forensic audit team.\n\nAkpabio stressed that government\u2019s aim was to use the forensic audit report to correct all the ills of the past in the Niger Delta region, saying time has come for the Amnesty programme to end in order for the people to get better deal instead of the peanuts ex-agitators are being paid.\n\nHis words: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any major thing that has touched the lives of the people in the region done by the NDDC. We are still searching for the project they have done. The money given to the NDDC has not been utilised well.\n\n\u201cThe major agent of intervention, the NDDC failed, that has been the problem\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe (NDDC) have a commitment in the excess of N3 trillion. The forensic audit will clarify these things\u201d.\n\nCommenting on the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021, the Minister said the Niger Delta people are happy that President Buhari has shown commitment to their cause through the Act.\n\nAccording to him, the major concern about the law was not the amount of resources it will make available to the people in the host communities, but the way and manner the resources would be applied and those to be involved.\n\nHe, however, said the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, as the ministry charged with the welfare of the people, would get in touch with the community trusts that would manage the funds and get them to properly focus the appropriations.\n\n\u201cThe PIA when implemented is going to assuage the feelings of the people of the host communities because they never had half a percent since 1956 when oil was discovered in Olobri.\n\n\u201cThat is why I said that it is not the percentage that is the issue. Some communities could not even do this solar powered toilet, some had no drinking water, even water tankers supplying them water failed because they had oil exploration and exploitation had destroyed their water system.\n\n\u201cBut now with the PIA, they would be able to do certain things for themselves without waiting on oil companies, the federal government or the state to do it for them.\n\n\u201cMy prayer is that the people would see this as a major step. People are arguing about percentages, I am not interested in that. We would manage this three per cent, but the major thing is to use it well. Even the small percentages that used to come to the NDDC, at least, they did not utilise it well.\n\n\u201cWe will do a lot of sensitization from the ministry, visit the people. When we look at the Act and know the composition of those who should be in charge of the money, we will also make our inputs and it should be mostly project based.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be like a normal contract. It should almost be like direct labour. It is a major leap forward,\u201d he added.\n\nOn the East-West road project still under construction, the Minister said over N10 billion have been committed into the project by the current administration, adding that delays associated with the project include paucity of funds and the 15km Eleme, Onne sections which were not originally captured in the project.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",
