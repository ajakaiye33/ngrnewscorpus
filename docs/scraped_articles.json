          "text": "While we are still in the euphoria of children\u2019s day celebration, it\u2019s important to take a shot at teaching these treasures how to take care of themselves against sexual molesters.\n\nIt\u2019s true most parents often teach their children all sorts of ways to keep themselves safe- ranging from telling not take what does not belong to them, making them to watch the hot gas cooker, to look both ways before crossing the roads, the list is endless; but most times, never about the child\u2019s body safety. Teachings on this always come much later when they are older which sometimes comes too late.\n\nAccording to research conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), it estimated that approximately 1 in 6 boys and 1 in 4 girls are sexually abused before the age of 18, and almost all of them knew their perpetrators.\n\nNo one particular race, culture, religion or socio-economic group is spared when it has to do with child sexual abuse. Although there\u2019s no foolproof way of protecting them from sexual abuse, but there are actually steps you can take to reduce the risk. As it\u2019s very glaring these days, sexual molesters are everywhere, they can strike at any time, and they come in different shapes/sizes/friendly/unfriendly.\n\nMost parents often say it cannot happen to their children because they will never expose them to strangers. Here are a few questions for you- Do you have friends or family come over to your house? Do they play at the neighbour\u2019s house? Do your children go to sleep over? Are they in day care/pre- school?\n\nThe simple truth is that you cannot fully prevent the risk of your child being sexually abused but you can teach them what to do to prevent them being victimized when they go out or interact with those around them. Below are some likely precautions you can take to gauge the situation/putting an end to the abuse.\n\nStart that conversation \u2013 Having a straight conversation about body parts can go a long way in protecting the children without scaring them off. Talk about body parts early, name body parts as it\u2019s never too soon to talk about them while they are still very young. Always use the right names for the different body parts. Sweet-coated names are not allowed. Feeling comfortable using the proper names and knowing what they mean can give them the ability to come to you when something is wrong and help them talk clearly if something inappropriate has happened.\n\nLet them know that some body parts are private \u2013 Tell him/her that their private parts are called private because they are not for everyone to see. Gently explain to them that only mummy and daddy can see them naked up to a certain age; but outsiders like relatives, friends/strangers are not allowed.\n\nTeach your child body boundaries \u2013 That under no circumstance should any one touch their private parts, and also no one should ask them to touch somebody else\u2019s private parts. This second part is very important because sexual abuse often begins with the molester asking the child to touch them or someone else.",

          "text": "By Jemi Ekunkunbor\n\nFrom an abused background that left him emotionally broken, with low self esteem and long struggle with identity crises, Taiwo Akinlami has risen to become not only a voice for children, but a catalyst for good parenting and family strengthening education in Nigeria. The Social Development lawyer of over two decades is a Children\u2019s Human Rights / Protection and Family Strengthening Advocate, as well as, Subject matter expert on Securing a friendly environment for the African child.\n\nThe author of 11 books and four e-books, has worked with several organizations like UNICEF, British Council, USAID, UNFPA, SOS Children\u2019s Village, Facebook and Google reaching over 25,000,000 children.\n\nAgainst the background of International Children\u2019s day celebrated last Thursday, Allure had this interesting chat with the husband of Oluwafunmilayo as he brings one more time, his message of hope to a world where Children\u2019s rights are violated by primary and secondary caregivers.\n\nNigeria marked International Children\u2019s Day on Thursday. How would you describe the state of the Nigerian child?\n\nThis question invokes a deep feeling of sadness. Is there really anything for the Nigerian child to celebrate? We cannot discuss the state of the Nigerian child without first discussing the state of Nigeria, which is the national landlord of the Nigerian child.\n\nIt is sad that this country which UNICEF describes as \u2018country of the young,\u2019 seems to have no plan for the young. The nation has been christened the Poverty Headquarters of the world. The impact of the state of our nation is reflected in the fact that 13.5 million Nigerian children of ages 5-14 are out of school, the highest in the world; 1 in 5 Nigerian children never reach the age of 5. according to the World Bank in 2018, \u2018108 million Nigerians are estimated to be homeless, based on an average family of six people per housing unit.\u2019\n\nAccording to UNICEF, \u2018clean water, basic toilets and good hygiene practices are essential for the survival and development of children and only 26.5 per cent of the population use improved drinking water sources and sanitation facilities. UNICEF submits, \u2018Nigeria has the second highest burden of stunted children in the world.\n\nAs you can see, the precious Nigerian children are not only denied their rights, but they are also abandoned and except we advocate for a quick intervention, the nation does not have a future.\n\nWhat is her situation considering covid 19?\n\nIt is important to note that the state of the Nigerian Child is not worsened by the COVID -19 Pandemic. The real problem is the mismanagement of the pandemic by the Nigerian government. Do you know that according to UNICEF, over 42 million Nigerian children could not access education during the COVID-19 lockdown as they had no access to the internet and the tools to learn online? Do you know that many of our precious children do not have access to healthcare, nutrition, and the rest because of the gross mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic? It is sad that even today, many public schools across the country are yet to resume fully.\n\nThe violation of children in recent times has been on the rise. Why do you think this is so?\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the tension created by the lockdown, made worse the cases of domestic violence especially as a Third World nation. Also, the primary parents, who have the duty of care, are distracted by the state of the nation. There is no serious nation on earth where the responsibility of raising children rests solely on the shoulders of the primary parents.\n\nThere are four institutions, responsible for raising children. The family is first, and it is its responsibility to inculcate a positive value system in their precious children and be their first line of defence against all forms of abuse. The second is the community; the neigbours, the religious bodies, the media, the schools etc, and their role is to reinforce the positive value system being inculcated by the family and provide the second line of defence against all forms of abuse. The third is the state whose role is to create an egalitarian society, where social protection is provided and equal opportunities for social and economic emancipation are made available for most of the citizenry.\n\nAs it is in Nigeria today, the parents are the only ones playing the roles that four institutions are designed to play. Therefore, they are distracted from their primary duty of inculcating positive value system, and being the first line of defence for the protection of their precious children from all forms of abuse, particularly, child sexual abuse.\n\nWould you say that the parenting style by some parents makes their children vulnerable to violation?\n\nWell, Nigerian parents need to be encouraged because they are raising their children under exceedingly difficult circumstances, doing the duties of four institutions.\n\nPoverty is the number one threat to effective parenting in Nigeria. When the existence of a people is abused, they have nothing to offer but to abuse their precious children or expose them to abuse.\n\nThose living above the poverty line must accept the onerous responsibility of raising children in an over sexualized 21st century, and give themselves to acquiring the right knowledge, skills, and attitude to protect their precious children. They must keep their children away from strangers, be vigilant, and watch out for signs of abuse.\n\nWhat kind of lessons can children be given to help them against rapists?\n\nOur children need sound sexuality education which focuses on their personal safety and self-protection. It begins with making it clear to them that every part of their body is private, and that nobody has the right to touch it, except, for the purpose of providing cautious care and moderate affection. They must be taught that no touch is good except it is necessary. So, instead of focusing on teaching them good touch/bad touch, we must focus on necessary and unnecessary touch. They must be taught to raise an alarm and ensure they are heard when they consider a touch unnecessary.\n\nChildren must be aware that superior to protecting the areas we call the private part, is protecting what I call healthy and safe private space. which he/she must be taught not to allow anyone to breach.\n\nChildren must also be taught that those who want to abuse them do not start from the place we call private parts. They start with profiling the child, to ascertain his/her level of vulnerability. Then they proceed to grooming, making suggestive statements to the child like, calling him or her my wife or my husband, touching parts of his/her body, and building a secret relationship with the child. The goal of grooming is to get the child to be comfortable with abuse and the abuser. After grooming, the abuser attacks and violates the child and thereafter, manipulates the child by promising him/her pleasure, or employing subtle or direct threats to keep him/her quiet. Our children are not safe until they have the right teaching and understand how the mind of the abuser works.\n\nRecently, sex education seems to have been brought back aggressively with a viral music video \u201cprivate part\u201d. How appropriate is that video?\n\nI think it is a good place to start, but sexuality education must transcend teaching our precious children about the private part and public part. They should be taught that every part of their body is private to them and nobody can touch it except for the purpose of providing care and conscious affection.\n\nWhat is your take on people sharing videos of minors who are being violated?\n\nI think sharing videos or other materials, which show the nakedness of children is both morally reprehensible and illegal. It is nothing but distributing child pornography and expanding the frontiers of child sexual abuse. This is against the provisions of the Child\u2019s Rights Act 2003. In developed climes, people are arrested and prosecuted for being in possession of such materials.\n\nPersonally, I do not watch such videos or expose myself to such materials and I warn people not to send them to me. I do not think I need such materials in which the innocence and sexual dignity of our precious children are being denigrated for me to know that child abuse by adults or peers are taking place, and that we need to do something about it. The facts are palpable to the blind and audible to the deaf. I think what we need to do is to hold the parents, community, state and international community responsible and accountable for the protection of our precious children from sexual and other forms of abuse through the establishment of a system of protection, codified into a policy and broken down into processes for the ease of implementation in both private and public institutions.\n\nAre there tips to identifying a potential rapist/child molester?\n\nMost child sexual abusers are people close to our children; fathers, mothers, stepfathers, stepmothers, siblings, uncles, aunties, cousins, nephews, nieces, e.t.c Secondary caregivers like teachers, nannies, neighbours, and others. The closer people are to a child, the more sexual abuse is likely. It does not mean everyone in the categories mentioned above are all the time abusers.\n\nSo, we teach our children to suspect those who give them the slightest reason to suspect them, and they must speak up.\n\nHow can the girl child be best protected?\n\nFirst, the girl child has to be raised as a strong vessel and as an individual who can hold her turf in society. We must never raise her as a victim or property and an appendage of men. Teach the girl child how to protect herself. Serve her the right menu of Child Sexuality Education.\n\nNever put the girl child in harm\u2019s way for whatever reason because, we have seen instances where the girl child\u2019s father, stepfather and men, who her mother has one form of relationship with, is the abuser. In some bizarre instances, the mother is aware but does not speak up or even covers it up because she wants to save her relationships with these men. Abuse must be reported. Silence only weakens the abused and strengthens the abuser. But if for whatever reason sexual abuse occurs, we must teach the girl child to speak up. Many do not speak up because they claim that the girl child may not find a husband in the future.\n\nSilence shields the abuser from facing the consequences of his actions, including prosecution and conviction.\n\nShare with us your most memorable experience of a rape case you were ever involved in handling?\n\nI have been in the middle of many cases, but I think the most memorable was the case of a boy child, who was allegedly sodomized by her two seniors in a highbrow private school in Nigeria. It is memorable because it exposed my thinking that the fact that a school is big and looks sophisticated, does not mean they can provide the best of protection for our precious children.\n\nThe most painful aspect of this case was that the school in question did not have a child protection policy, no anti-bullying policy, no plan to educate the children on their sexuality and strategies for playing their roles in their personal safety and self-protection. It was a painful case because the parents trusted the school because of its sophistication and size; but the school let the parents down by not having in place a system of protection.\n\nAs someone, who was serially, sexually molested from age 6-8 by a female adult and neighbour, I understand what it means for the boy child to be sexually abused and most importantly, I understand what it means for those who have the duty of care to abandon their duty, exposing us to danger of child sexual abuse, which impact is for a lifetime. Knowing all of these, we fought relentlessly to get justice for our client and ensure that the parents get help for him.\n\nWhat can the government do in light of children\u2019s day celebrations?\n\nI do not think the present government can do much as it seems to be absent. I do not think we can put our fate in the hands of the government. We must make it a point of duty to agitate for an egalitarian society, where the rights of every Nigerian, parents and their precious children\u2019s rights to basic needs in life are respected as priorities in governance.",

          "text": "By Jemi Ekunkunbor\n\nFrom an abused background that left him emotionally broken, with low self esteem and long struggle with identity crises, Taiwo Akinlami has risen to become not only a voice for children, but a catalyst for good parenting and family strengthening education in Nigeria. The Social Development lawyer of over two decades is a Children\u2019s Human Rights / Protection and Family Strengthening Advocate, as well as, Subject matter expert on Securing a friendly environment for the African child.\n\nThe author of 11 books and four e-books, has worked with several organizations like UNICEF, British Council, USAID, UNFPA, SOS Children\u2019s Village, Facebook and Google reaching over 25,000,000 children.\n\nAgainst the background of International Children\u2019s day celebrated last Thursday, Allure had this interesting chat with the husband of Oluwafunmilayo as he brings one more time, his message of hope to a world where Children\u2019s rights are violated by primary and secondary caregivers.\n\nNigeria marked International Children\u2019s Day on Thursday. How would you describe the state of the Nigerian child?\n\nThis question invokes a deep feeling of sadness. Is there really anything for the Nigerian child to celebrate? We cannot discuss the state of the Nigerian child without first discussing the state of Nigeria, which is the national landlord of the Nigerian child.\n\nIt is sad that this country which UNICEF describes as \u2018country of the young,\u2019 seems to have no plan for the young.

          "title": "Babatunde Rufai: Art Of Selling Luxury",
          "text": "Babatunde Rufai is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Wear It All Luxury; a men\u2019s luxury boutique. Fondly and popularly called Tunde Wear It All, he has over the years in the fiercely competitive Nigerian fashion industry, carved a niche for himself by establishing a reputable brand that is synonymous with class. His luxury boutique in high brow Lekki is richly designed to cater for men who want to be simple, yet, be sure of the authenticity of the premium brands they wear.\n\nHe shares with Allure his passion for fashion, how to handle rejection and important success tips for every fashion entrepreneur. Excerpts;\n\nWhen you decided you wanted to do luxury, what steps did you take to learn the ropes?\n\nMy decision to go into luxury clothing had stemmed from the fact that there were a lot of copies of the original designer pieces down this part. I also had friends who wanted to buy the original and have to always travel out to get them. I\u2019ve always had an eye for fashion, so it was a bit easy for me to delve into it. Also, because I have always engaged in buying and selling right from time, so all the experiences needed, I already had them.\n\nWhat is the significance of your education in Italy to your fashion business?\n\nAs the saying goes \u2018speak English, kiss French, drive German and dress Italian. Italy is renowned for its high quality craftsmanship, luxury designs, sharp tailoring, manufacturing and exporting of fashionable items since the 11th century. I believe anyone going into a fashion related business needs to understand and study this unique fashion heritage to be able to be successful in it. My education in Italy was, and still is, the number one foundation in my business as I apply what I\u2019ve learnt on a daily basis to improve and solve business related issues.\n\nDuring my time in Italy, I also engaged myself in social education as I visited 15 cities, absorbing both the fashion and general culture. This is really important in the fashion business as this has helped me apply what I learnt in building my brand.\n\nWhat particularly motivated you to decide to go into the fashion business?\n\nI have always had a flair for and attachment to fashion for as long as I can remember. I decided to go into it fully and opened my first store in 2007 at Akoka, close to University of Lagos (UNILAG).\n\nAs a tertiary institution, fashion is always one of the things that matters to students and I decided to take advantage of that as I had a lot of interest from them, thus, turning my passion and motivation into a blossoming business.\n\nWhat were the hurdles you had to scale at the beginning?\n\nIt was clearly a challenge, walking into stores to convince people that you single-handedly want to start something as big as that. It took a lot of conviction, consistency, perseverance and hard work. First any big brand you walk into in Europe to stock, wants to know other big brands you are dealing with. They want to be sure their brand is going out into the big class. I had to attend fashion shows and fashion trade fairs, which helped to build my profile and connection.\n\nEvery business no matter how small, comes with its own challenges especially when you are trying to break even into the market. Selling luxurious brands comes with its challenges especially when you have to convince people to pay such a high price for something as little as a shirt when there are replicas that go way cheaper. They stand in the way of you generating sales or even a take home. It was not an easy task but with time and consistency, we stood and have been able to build this brand to what it is today.\n\nGenerally, what is the big lesson you have learnt about running a high-end fashion and footwear business?\n\nBrand in itself is determined by a customer\u2019s overall perception of your business. I did a lot of research in the industry niche and took notes of the salient things missing as regards imitation and competition which wasn\u2019t exactly there. The quality always stood for itself and people always wanted that. I maintained consistent communication, alongside experience across a lot of platforms \u2013 sales and customer service, print, packaging, environment and the most recent, which does go a long way, social media.\n\nI look particularly for style that carries an aura and speaks volume when people see it. It goes a long way in defining who you are.\n\nWhat is it like selling in times of economic melt down such as that brought by covid 19?\n\nTo be sincere, we have had the best sales ever since we opened after the lockdown. I think two possible reasons must have led to that. One is that a lot of people can\u2019t travel again, so they have to rely on buying locally. Second, even those who shop online couldn\u2019t do that simply because the banks have restricted monthly spending on cards to about $200usd. So, that must have led to the increment in sales we have been experiencing since the COVID-19 pandemic. So, it\u2019s either to buy from the local store, or make use of personal shoppers who are based abroad.\n\nWhat is the ultimate goal of WIA Luxury and how do you hope to achieve it?\n\nWear It All speaks aura, pervasive quality and luxury that comes with style. With all of the biggest names in fashion, you\u2019ll be guaranteed to find the best men\u2019s designer clothing.\n\nAlso, find stylish seasonal pieces from some of fashion\u2019s most influential labels like Gucci, Alexander McQueen, Versace and Dolce & Gabbana among others. \u2018Wear It All\u2019 stays what it stands for; originality and transparency in our mission and vision. We speak class, style and most of all, luxury! Our motto is to \u2018Let Your Wears Speak For You\u2019.\n\nI intend to turn Wear It All Luxury into a fashion empire, in every room and whenever this brand is mentioned, luxury is the only thing that comes to mind. I intend to achieve this through progressive rebranding to attain the highest level of Luxury in Nigeria and the most sought-after for fashion needs in Nigeria and abroad.\n\nWhat is your best advice to anyone who wants to run a similar business?\n\nI\u2019ll say running a business successfully is not as easy as it seems, luxurious or not. Over time, I was able to put together a few things that have made me even better at things I do. I have learnt that team work and communication does go a long way. The lack of teamwork in itself is enough to make business not thrive. It kills the dream and eventually the business and what you stand for. Also, you have to be true to your words because some people hold it highly. That\u2019s all that they need to partner with you or even be consistent in you styling them. From employing staff members to cash flow, to whatever it is that surrounds a business, you must serve a purpose. Keep exploring, and always get feedback. These things go a long way. Also you need to employ people that have passion for the business and make them feel comfortable working with you.\n\nNever ever get comfortable with your situation; strive, never give up and understand that time is an important factor in becoming that one person you want to become.\n\nSince you operate in other countries, how would you compare the Nigerian business environment to other African countries vis-\u00e0-vis profitability and challenges of setting up business?\n\nWe don\u2019t operate in other countries, we only have clients we ship to in other countries.\n\nHow do you balance work and your personal life considering how busy work and family can get?\n\nI work about 10-12hrs daily and 7days a week when in the country and when I\u2019m out of the country to stock up. My typical day starts with waking up at 6am for my morning prayer, then to the gym, take a little rest before getting ready to go to work.\n\nWe work officially from 10am to 8pm but they\u2019re also unofficial demands that require my attention sometimes at odd hours, I have to balance all these. In my spare time, I hang out with my friends and family to ease off tension and relax.\n\nHow do you handle rejections as an entrepreneur?\n\nRejection is part of entrepreneurship. It offers us the opportunity to make sure what we\u2019re doing is right for us. To handle this, I evaluate why the rejection came, I determine if this is something I really want to do, but need a better approach with. If I need more expertise, then I get that, and if it is a warning message telling me to desist, I listen to my instincts. A rejection can be a bump in the road or worse. What happens next is your choice. I vote for learning and coming back even stronger.\n\nIt takes a lot to build a business. There will be more than a few times when you\u2019re just not feeling it. You\u2019ll need to be inspired and motivated to keep going when it feels like nothing is going right. Use each rejection as fire to light you up and motivate you. Every experience in life offers a lesson. Those lessons help you become the best version of yourself. Shift the way you view rejection. Get even more determined to accomplish that goal. Use the rejection as your motivation to continue doing the work. At the end of the day, doing the work consistently is what builds your business and accomplishes your goals.\n\nWho are some of the designers you look up to and why?\n\nOne important person that has inspired me is Mr Ojukwu Onwuzulike, the CEO of Wardrobe Boutique. He\u2019s a great man who has dedicated his whole life to the fashion business and is excelling in it.\n\nWhat should the public expect from you before the year runs out and in the near future?\n\nWe are currently working on total rebranding for the Lekki brand and also working on Abuja branch\n\nHow do you relax?\n\nI hang out with my friends and spend time with my family.\n\nYour favorite holiday destination?\n\nI don\u2019t have one yet as I haven\u2019t been on proper holiday till today.\n\nHow would you describe your fashion style?\n\nVersatile, you can\u2019t predict my style.",

          "text": "By Philip Nwosu\n\nCatholic Archbishop of Lagos, Alfred Adewale Martins, has said on Tuesday that Nigerians and particularly Christians being attacked and killed in the northern part of the country have right to defend themselves against incessant attacks on their communities by invaders, tagged: herders.\n\nMartins, who spoke during the celebration of its 62nd birthday anniversary, said one of the moral principles in life is that, \u201cif a person is under attack, he has the right to defend himself with equal force that he is being attack. So, in principle, every human being has the right to defend himself or herself. But the practice of that needs to be examine thoroughly before putting it to use.\u201d\n\nThe clergy also chided those criticising the church for speaking about issues relating to governance, explaining that \u201cthe church has the moral authority that it uses in interfacing with the people and the word of God being the basis for such interaction.\n\n\u201cThe church will continue to awaken the conscience of the people of our nation on the values that are necessary for the common good, the church will assist in teaching the people about issues concerning love for one another. If we stick to the teaching, the society will be good for it.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the current mood of the nation does not call for celebration, but for sober reflection.\n\nCiting a Biblical verse: \u201cGive to Caesar, that which is Caesar\u2019s and to God that which is God\u2019s,\u201d he said if people\u2019s aspirations were largely met, there would be less crisis in the society.\n\n\u201cWhen the people enter into a social contract with the state, there are obligations and responsibilities on both parties to strike an equilibrium in the pact.\n\n\u201cThe people owe the country their civic duties while the country owes the people provision of services to retain their trust and for a better society.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, those salient conventions have taken flight from our polity and thereby paved the way for mistrust, corruption and banditry.\n\n\u201cIt is callous for a human being to take another person\u2019s life while the country, under whose control it is to check such inhumanity, appears helpless.\n\n\u201cFrom the North to the South, every part of the country is witnessing one form of brigandage or the other,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Zika Bobby\n\nDiaspora Igbo group, the Igbo World Assembly (IWA), has said there was need to restructure Nigeria to ensure true federalism as it was in the 1963 Constitution based on regions.\n\nIt condemned Federal Government\u2019s shoot-on-sight position, noting that such could be termed an act of ethnic cleaning.\n\nIWA Chairman, Nwachukwu Anakwenze, who stated this in a keynote address in Abuja at the just-concluded 2023 Presidential Transition Inter-ethnic Peace Dialogue, said true fiscal federalism was needed in Nigeria to address issues affecting the country.\n\nRestructuring of Nigeria, according to him, should be a means of tackling the worsening security situation and the agitation for secession.\n\n\u201cWe need a Nigerian political structure that is based on equity, fairplay, balance and equal access to political power for the good of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIWA feels that what Nigeria needs on the long run is true fiscal federalism which is a system of government based on democratic rules and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and regional/state governments. The individual federating units need to have more control over their affairs.\n\n\u201cThe regional government should control their resources and pay a percentage royalty tax to the Federal Government. The Federal Government should control issues in the single exclusive list such as military or foreign policy. We should return to agricultural businesses such as was practiced in the sixties by our former leaders. There is a need to restructure Nigeria to ensure true federalism as it was in the 1963 Constitution based on regions or zones.\u201d\n\nWe need a Nigerian political structure that is based on equity, fair play, balance and equal access to political power for the good of Nigerians,\u201d Anakwenze said.\n\nHe said a future Nigeria requires respect for our constitution and rule of law, respect for human rights and civil rights, respect for the federal character commission rules from 1979 constitution, implementation of restructuring, regionalisation and devolution of powers, merit-based appointment to government positions, firm knowledge and competent management of Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nAnakwenze said detribalised appointments and leadership in all sectors of the government, equal and equitable treatment of all Nigerian regardless of tribes of origins or religion, elimination of ethnic cleansing in the Nigerian political space, free and fair electoral process, a government that unites all Nigerians and not one that is divisive, were needed now.\n\n\u201cWithout mincing words, if we cannot work this out quickly, a referendum might be needed so that all the major Nigerian groups can go their separate ways,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the group position about presidency of Nigeria of South East extraction, he said: \u201cWe ask that all political parties should zone Nigerian presidency to South East in 2023. And efforts should be geared to achieving that goal. IWA states only restructuring can prevent Nigeria from disintegration.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the Fulani herdsmen, he said Ndigbo will no longer tolerate the attack by herdsmen.\n\n\u201cWe are very concerned about that because the well-being of our people is involved. We will no longer accept this condition and we are going to talk to our people on what to do about it.\n\n\u201cEverybody needs to prepare to defend themselves and his family against the herdsmen because we are not prepared to cede an inch of Igbo land to anybody because our land is very small.\n\n\u201cOur people must protect their crops always. If any animal comes to eat the crops, it means hunger will be in the land because that is what the people use after harvesting and sales to train their children or pay for hospital bills.\n\n\u201cIf the herders kill our people and destroy our things, we have the right to reciprocate. We want peace for us and for everybody, but if somebody comes to fight us on our land, we will fight back,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended southern governors on their decision to ban open grazing in the region.",

The project would cost an estimated N5.6 billion.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, who briefed on behalf of Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, at the end of the FEC meeting said the approval was to cushion the effect of COVID-19 pandemic, which had made oxygen a very critical commodity.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Health presented a memo, which was approved, for the emergency supply, installation and maintenance of oxygen production plants and construction of plant houses in each of the 36 States of the federation and Abuja. The contract was approved in the sum of N5, 615, 127, 479 inclusive of 7.5 per cent VAT, in favour of four different companies, with a completion period of 20 weeks.\u201d\n\nThe Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) had on Monday announced that, in case of a third wave of COVID-19, increased oxygen reserve capacity would be one of its three areas of focus.\n\nMohammed said council also approved the sum of N9.2 billion as premium for insurance companies to manage group life insurance for federal civil servants, para military and intelligence community for the year 2021-2022.\n\n\u201cThis premium is for a period of 12 months. This is part of the government\u2019s welfare programme for our public employees so that in case of death, they are assured that there would be compensation.\u201d\n\nThe minister said council also approved N18.1 billion for the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, for the development of infrastructure and Kano and Calabar Free Trade Zones, as well as the Textile and Garment Park in Lagos and the Special Economic Zone in Lekki, Lagos.\n\nMohammed said the approval was of critical importance to the infrastructure development plan of the country.\n\nThe minister added that council also approved the sum of N1. 1 billion for the procurement of aviation security uniforms and accessories for use in various airports across the country.\n\nMohammed also disclosed that the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs also got an approval of N864.7 million for two road contracts that were abandoned by previous administrations.\n\nHe listed the projects as Okpula-Igwartanta Phase I linking Imo and Rivers State started in 2010 which got approval for a variation of N620, 763, 000., and erosion flood control on Ndemili-Utagba-Onitsha road in Delta State started in 2014, which got approved N244 million to augment the original contract sum.\n\nEnvironment Minister, Mahammad Mahmud, said council approved the revised national policy on climate change. He said \u201cthe last one was in 2012 and it became necessary for us to revise based on what has been happening in the last three years since 2012 particularly with the various agreements.\n\n\u201cWe all know climate change is our topic of today, it has serious implications on economy, livelihoods. The environment in general and economic change affect every body but we have realised that it affects women even more and on this, we also know that we have national polIcy on gender and climate change as approved.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu, Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Okwe Obi, Abuja Abuja and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nApplause and condemnations, yesterday, trailed Twitters decision to delete President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s civil war tweet.\n\nIn the tweet shared on Tuesday, Buhari spoke about the civil war experience and threatened to deal with those \u201cbent on destroying\u201d Nigeria through \u201cinsurrection.\u201d\n\nBuhari had in series of tweet on Tuesday via is verified Twitter handle @MBuhari tweeted: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian civil war. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nTwitter rules prohibit a number of actions from users, including violence, abuse and hateful conduct.\n\nFollowing several complaints, Twitter deleted the tweet, stating: \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d\n\nReacting to the development, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, accused Twitter of double standard. He said while the social media giant had conveniently ignored inciting tweets by Nnamdi Kanu, leader of proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and his cohorts, displaying the same biases it did during the EndSARS protest last year, where government and private properties were looted and set on fire but finds Buhari\u2019s tweet offensive.\n\nHe alleged Twitter\u2019s role is suspect and Nigeria would not be fooled.\n\n\u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule. If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concern about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges. If an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed.\n\n\u201cTwo, any organisation that gives directives to its members, to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that? We are the ones guilty of double standards. I don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation, a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria, and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\u201d\n\nAccording to the minister, Buhari\u2019s comment cannot be compared to the directive by Kanu to his followers to kill soldiers, policemen and burn down government facilities.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very, very suspect. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the EndSARS protests that was funding EndSARS protesters, it was the first to close the account of former president of US, Trump. And you see, when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during EndSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened on the Capitol, it became insurrection.\n\n\u201cYou see, we are not going to be be fooled by anybody. We have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter mission in Nigeria citing those two examples is very suspect. What is their agenda?\n\n\u201cHow does Mr. President\u2019s speech that anybody who is destroying infrastructure, who is destroying police offices, who is destroying INEC offices should be ready for the consequences, is that inciting violence?\u201d\n\nHowever, Former President of Aka Ikenga, Chief Goddy Uwazuruike and former second vice president of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Monday Onyekachi Ubani and others hailed Twitters.\n\nUbani described Buhari\u2019s tweet as hate language.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the tweet has been pulled down shows that some of us who said it was wrong of the president to threaten his citizens are justified in our position. I saw that tweet as sensational especially as he was talking to his children and said he will unleash a language they will understand; that is hate language and I\u2019m happy that it has been deleted. What the president needs to do is to say I didn\u2019t mean it. What we need now is to call for a truce and listen to what the people are saying; threats will not solve our problem.\u201d\n\nAdeolu Ogunbanjo, national president, National Association of Telecommunications Subscribers (NATCOMS) said: \u201cI see his (Buhari) choice of words offensive to the younger generation and obviously it is a threat because his words were too open ended and coming. I think he should calm down and look at what Twitter is saying; that you can\u2019t use their medium to be threatening a whole generation of a country. These people he is threatening are supposed to be the ones in charge.\u201d\n\nJide Awe, chief executive officer of Jidaw Systems Limited said: \u201cThe truth is that all social media big tech platforms are private platforms. My assumption is that such actions are taken when a user\u2019s post is deemed to be against the social media platform\u2019s community guidelines and terms. All users agree to those rules when they sign up. Having social media accounts is a choice.\n\n\u201cIn view of their reach and influence, many world leaders use these platforms to communicate with their citizens and the world. The global response to posts and tweets is a sign of the power of social media platforms. However, they own their private platforms. On their own, these platforms determine when a user breaks the rules and the actions to take when there is a violation.\n\n\u201cFormer US President, Donald Trump had his tweets deleted and received several warnings and \u201cviolation\u201d reports on his tweets before he was eventually banned from Twitter.\u201d\n\nTwitter has also been on fire of the president\u2019s utterance. Former Ekiti governor, Peter Ayodele Fayose, @GovAyoFayose, tweeted: \u201cNigeria is boiling everywhere and all that the president can do is to be threatening genocide up and down? Now that Twitter has dealt with our almighty President Buhari, won\u2019t he \u201cdeal\u201d with Twitter too? Like Trump, like Buhari.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that those using the president\u2019s powers for him do not know when and where to stop their power-madness. Regrettably, Twitter may not know that Buhari is not the one operating the handle. Can our president operate android phone not to talk of making genocidal tweets?\n\n\u201cA president who cannot address his own people in time of crisis can certainly not be the one tweeting on the crisis. Twitter should rather hold Garba Shehu, Lie Mohammad and co accountable.\u201d\n\nSenator Shehu Sani @ShehuSani: \u201cThe President should talk to us\u2026.The President should address us\u2026The President should speak to us\u2026.now una don hear am.\n\nReno Omokri @renoomokri: \u201cLie Mohammed accuses @Twitter and @Jack of sponsoring\n\n@MaziNnamdiKanu: \u201cHow pathetic! When Twitter permanently suspended Trump\u2019s account, Buharists celebrated. Then, Twitter was not sponsoring IPOB. And you are surprised Twitter chose Ghana over Nigeria?\n\nDele Momodu Ovation @DeleMomodu: \u201cI had no answer until i saw the video\u2026 it was a sad day for those who still have some modicum of belief in project nigeria. The president did not declare war on bandits and herdsmen but was interested in fighting another civil war, and said so openly. That was an all-time low!!\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding the trenchant criticisms, a group, Vanguard for Peace and National Development, backed President Buhari\u2019s vow to crush separatist groups.\n\nIts Executive Director, Mr Ahmed Tijani, in a statement, commended the president for his stance on the agitation\n\nTijani also enjoined the government to probe alleged alliances between some highly placed politicians with managers of various security agencies in the country.\n\nAccording to him, Buhari\u2019s zero tolerance for the activities of proscribed groups was evident in his resolve to ensure Nigeria remains an indivisible entity.\n\nHe said it had become imperative to investigate true identities of some high-ranking security officers and politicians with proscribed groups.\n\n\u201cWe are equally privy to series of secret meetings between some politicians and managers of security outfits in the country.\n\n\u201cAs a group of patriots, we cannot afford to keep mute when these types of issues come up,\u201d Tijani said.\n\nBut Uwazuruike wondered why Buhari has not threatened Boko Haram, kidnappers and bandits, but was quick to threaten peaceful protesters asking for a referendum.\n\n\u201cI am not surprised, the president acted true to type, he has shown his true colour. He was speaking from his heart, he was not reading a speech. His speech manifests his 97 per cent versus 5 per cent stance. Not long ago in Kaduna, Buhari appealed to armed bandits to release kidnapped university students, Mr President has not threatened the bandits, Boko Haram or kidnappers, he has not threatened bandits and kidnappers in his home state of Katsina, but he found it very convenient to threaten unarmed people asking for a referendum. Most people don\u2019t know that what IPOB is asking for is a referendum, not secession. What President Buhari does not understand is that if a referendum is conducted those opposed to IPOB/ESN may be more. I\u2019m not surprised that he is threatening us. I want to let Mr President know that he may defeat the Igbo but he cannot liquidate us.\u201d\n\n\u2022Igbo, Arewa groups fume\n\nLeading Igbo body, Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) condemned what it called the president\u2019s penchant for ethnic profiling, stating that his body language has given impetus to allegation that the violence in the South East was being perpetrated by some imported mercenaries to orchestrate military invasion.\n\nA statement by ADF\u2019s spokesman, Chief Abia Onyike, yesterday, expressed disappointment that instead of fishing out the criminals and making them face the law, president Buhari had rushed to threaten the people of the region.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like a message of collective annihilation. Why did he not talk like this when Fulani herdsmen killed hundreds of people in the South East and other parts of Nigeria? He should stop his policy of ethnic profiling in order to save us from genocide.\n\n\u201cThere are people who believe that the violence in the South East was imported by mercenaries from outside the zone in order to create an alibi for the military invasion of Igboland. That must be a very wicked plot. Buhari should summon a national conference to restructure/reconstitute Nigeria along the lines of genuine federalism and fiscal federalism.\n\n\u201cWe need autonomy for the regions or federating units. Calling out security agencies to invade Igboland and kill people on the streets is not the solution to the current crisis in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso, pan-Arewa Socio-political Organisation, Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG), in a statement by Abdul-Azeez Sulaiman, contended that Buhari\u2019s remark was not only empty but unpresidential, adding that the tweet merely amounted to admission of failure and loss of capacity.\n\n\u201cWe find it ridiculous that most parts of the president\u2019s tweet concentrated more attention to infrastructure than on the lives of citizens that are wasted daily with virtually no response from the authorities.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s revelation that most of those involved in the current agitation for secession are those who have not witnessed the 1967 civil war is a vindication of our position that the only reasonable option to ensure a more secure future is for the Igbo to be allowed to have their wish for a Biafran nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that the strength of the Igbo agitation rests on youth who are mainly below the ages of 50, with diseased mindsets induced by their forefathers and encouraged by their political, cultural and religious leaders to take up arms against the Nigerian state and Northerners, has rendered the nation\u2019s unity negotiable.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore unreasonable for those older Nigerians who are mostly above 70 to insist that the unity of Nigeria is sacrosanct whereas the people executing the dangerous Southeast secession agenda are almost entirely below 50,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "\u2022Accuses microblogging site of double standards\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nThe federal government yesterday accused the social media giant, Twitter, of double standards in its treatment of issues affecting Nigeria.\n\nIt warned that it would not allow the microblogging site to dictate to President Muhammadu Buhari his views on national issues.\n\nThe accusation followed the decision of Twitter to delete a controversial post by Buhari on the Nigerian civil war.\n\nThe president, in the post on Tuesday, had warned against insurrection, saying that those fomenting trouble in the South-east are in for a rude shock.\n\nBuhari, in a series of tweets on Tuesday via his verified Twitter handle @mbuhari had said: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian civil war. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nBuhari\u2019s statement, which was also tweeted, sparked outrage on the social media with some Nigerians reporting it to Twitter.\n\nHowever, some said the president sounded firm in his warning against perpetrators of violence in the South-east.\n\nBut yesterday, Twitter pulled down the tweet for violating its community standards.\n\nTwitter, in a comment, said: \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d\n\nThe federal government, however, kicked against the decision with the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, wondering why Tweeter would object to a submission by the president on national issues but would ignore provocative postings by the leader of the proscribed Independent People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu on its site.\n\nThe minister told journalist at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the State House, Abuja that Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is suspect.\n\nHe wondered if Twitter has ever deleted offensive tweets by Kanu.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspect. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the ENDSARS protests promoted tweets trying to raise funds for the ENDSARS protesters. It was the first to close the account of former President of US, Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd you see, when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during ENDSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest.

If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concerned about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges. If an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed. Two, any organisation that gives directives to its members to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that?

By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m saying that you cannot compare anybody with Kanu who boldly say, go and kill policemen.\n\nI think sometimes\u2026policemen are brothers, they are our uncle, they are children. We kill them their wives become widows, their children become orphans. And what is the offence of these policemen \u2013 because they are working to keep the country one. What about soldiers that are putting down their lives so that you and I can sleep? It is not acceptable anywhere in the world for anybody, anywhere, to stay in the comfort of wherever he is and now give directives to go and kill soldiers, go and kill policemen.\u201d\n\nAsked why Sheikh Ahmed Gumi whose comments were perceived as justifying Boko Haram actions has not been arrested, Mohammed asked who appointed Gumi as the go-between between government and Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cWho appointed Gumi middleman between government and Boko Haram? Listen, for me, unless you come and tell me this what Gumi said that is inciting that you are comparing to Kanu\u2026 anyway what we\u2019re discussing is different. We\u2019re discussing Twitter. If you want to ask any question about Gumi or any other person, go ahead but please, be objective,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said if government had resolved to pick up all those critical of the Buhari administration, the detention centres would have been full by now.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are so many people who have been spewing hate against Mr. President, against this governments. So if you want to comment, be fair; don\u2019t take a position, which is not objective. If we were to pick up everybody today who had been abusing this administration, the detention centres will be filled up and you will be the first person also to talk about lack of tolerance, lack of rule of law.\u201d\n\nReacting to Buhari\u2019s tweet, human rights activist, Aisha Yesufu, described as \u201cinsensitive\u201d the civil war analogy by the president.\n\nYesufu, in a video statement yesterday, said: \u201cMy name is Aisha Somtochukwu Yesufu. I am Igbo, a threat to the Igbo people is a threat to me. Any attack on the Igbo people is an attack on me. Any malignment of the Igbo people is a malignment to me. We are all Nigerians and no Nigerian is more Nigerian than the others.\n\n\u201cThe government must ensure that it deploys its resources and its apparatus equally to every section of this country.\n\n\u201cI totally condemn the tweet from the president where the president is threatening the Igbo people. He is threatening them with what happened in 1967. What happened in 1967 was a genocide; a crime against humanity and it must never ever be allowed to happen again.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cFor a president to come out today and use 1967 as a yardstick to threaten people with what happened then, with the 30 months of gruesomeness, with the 30 months of heinousness, with the 30 months of atrocities that were meted out on human beings, on fellow brothers and sisters, on children in this country, is inhumane, it is insensitive, it is callous, and it is unspeakable.\u201d\n\nFormer Ekiti State Governor, Mr. Ayodele Fayose, however, called on Twitter to hold presidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu and Mohammed accountable for the controversial \u2018civil war\u2019 post.\n\nReacting in a string of tweets, Fayose wrote: \u201cA president who cannot address his own people in time of crisis can certainly not be the one tweeting on the crisis. Twitter should rather hold Garba Shehu, Lai Mohammed and co (others) accountable.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that those using the president\u2019s powers for him do not know when and where to stop their power. Regrettably, Twitter may not know that Buhari is not the one operating the handle.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Editors express concern over growing insecurity\n\nBy Alex Enumah\n\nA former Governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife, yesterday accused sponsors of the ongoing violence in the South-east of plotting to forestall elections in 2023 with the sole aim of thwarting the clamour by the zone to produce the next president.\n\nEzeife, while featuring on ARISE NEWS CHANNEL, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, however, exonerated members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN) from the recent killings of police personnel and the torching of public institutions in the zone.\n\nHe spoke hours after the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) expressed concern over the growing insecurity in the country and advised government at all levels to activate their structures in tackling the challenges.\n\nEzeife described the insurrection in the South-east as an attempt to provoke indigenes of the South-east.\n\nHe added that their findings showed that those behind the killings and destruction of public institutions such as offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) are not Igbo.\n\nHe said: \u201cWho are the people burning INEC\u2019s offices, who are killing the police? There is the impression that some people even within the government are guilty of organising such threat and blaming it on IPOB and ESN.\n\n\u201cNow we know that more than 80 per cent of the people caught by the CCTV are not from the South-east.\n\nWas it a design to blame it on IPOB and ESN? We are learning more now that there is a design to provoke the East.\u201d\n\nHe, however, could not identify the sponsors but suspected that some of them might be in government going by some of the findings by South-east leaders.\n\nHe stated that a South-east governor who had earlier accused IPOB and ESN of executing the attacks had since exonerated the secessionist group.\n\nHe also expressed reservation that the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, could hold the groups responsible for the violence without evidence.\n\nHe said: \u201cIPOB does not have tradition of shedding blood or burning down things. It is not Igbo tradition to shoot police, burn down houses. During the ENDSARS protests, people attributed what was happening in Lagos to some Igbo people and it was later discovered to be untrue.\n\n\u201cThose who are sponsoring this destruction don\u2019t want election; they don\u2019t want president from South-east zone and would even want to scatter the Anambra election and go for emergency situation and appoint someone.\n\n\u201cNigeria should understand what is going on and not jump into conclusion.\u201d\n\nWhile not justifying the activities of IPOB and its leader, Ezeife stated that the federal government by its alleged continued marginalisation of the South-east, is pushing Igbo out of Nigeria.\n\nHe listed some of the injustices the youths are fighting to include the absence of tangible federal government projects in the area as well as the alleged disregard for the principle of federal character in appointments, to the detriment of the Igbo.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has been working hard pushing the Igbo out of Nigeria. The young men are reacting to what is coming from the federal government. Whether it is project location, we don\u2019t have any in Igboland; whether it is appointment, you don\u2019t find it but if it is retirement, we\u2019re dominant.\u201d\n\nEzeife also alleged that many Igbo businesses are being crippled by the government.\n\nHe dismissed insinuation that the Igbo cannot speak with one voice when it comes to presenting a candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nAccording to him, the South-east has many individuals that can govern the country and the zone is currently working hard to win the support of other zones to clinch the presidency in 2023.\n\nOn the ongoing public hearing to review the constitution, the former governor urged legislators to stop wasting their time and public resources because what the people need now is a new constitution.\n\nEditors Express Concern over Growing Insecurity\n\nMeanwhile, the NGE has expressed concern over the growing insecurity in the country and advised government at all levels to activate their structures in tackling the challenges.\n\nIt also called for an enabling political and economic environment for the media to discharge their constitutional and social responsibilities.\n\nIt added that creating a conducive environment for the media to thrive would guarantee and sustain democratic space, sustainable development and provide incentives for social/democratic change.\n\nThe guild, in a communiqu\u00e9 issued and signed by its President, Mr. Mustapha Isah, and General Secretary, Mr. Iyobosa Uwugiaren, at the end of its 2021 Biennial Convention in Kano, called on the federal government to, as a matter of urgency, expunge, repeal or amend as may be appropriate, all existing obnoxious media laws that are inimical to press freedom.\n\nIt also urged editors and journalists to continue to subscribe to and uphold the journalism code of ethics \u2013 as developed by the Nigerian Press Organisation (NPO).\n\n\u2018\u2019The guild observes the need for the Nigerian mass media to exercise their freedom to operate freely with a sense of responsibility. And considering the spikes in the levels of insecurity across the length and breadth of the country, it is high time for the media to set the agenda and lead the country\u2019s drive to sustaining national cohesion.\n\n\u2018\u2019While observing Nigeria\u2019s consistent deterioration in the Global Press Freedom Index since 2005, the guild notes that it is worrisome that the slide is happening in a democracy, whereby the guild has had cause in recent times to issue three press statements on the threats of closure and imposition of fines on some broadcast stations by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC),\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 added.\n\nThe guild noted that the huge disruption the COVID-19 pandemic has created globally, saying that the disruption has also had negative effects on the Nigerian media industry, leading to drop in revenues.\n\n\u2018\u2019For the media to respond to these challenges creatively, there is urgent need for the media managers to evolve diversification, designing of a dynamic management system, producing innovative contents, restructuring their production technologies and adapting new funding and business models.\n\n\u2018\u2019Considering that the role of information dissemination by the mass media is an essential public and social service, the guild calls on government to consider mitigating the media\u2019s operational costs and economic challenges by floating a national media subsidy regime, including tax holidays and waivers, lifting of licence fees for the broadcast media and offsetting debts of government media agencies in the country,\u2019\u2019 the guild stated.\n\nThe guild\u2019s national convention, which attracted over 300 editors and media owners across the country, also expressed concern over the prevalence and massive elevation of fake news, disinformation and propaganda due to the mishandlings of the social media platforms by negative persons.\n\nThe guild harped on the need for Nigeria\u2019s media publics, particularly the youth whom the media must carry along, to use, decipher and rely on the conventional media for reliable and credible information in taking their decisions.\n\nThe safety of journalists also attracted the attention of the editors, as they called on both the public and the private media operators to devise measures inclusive of guaranteed welfare and insurance schemes for the safety and security of journalists working for them.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 added: \u2018\u2019Against the backdrop of the assailing new media trends, the guild highlights the essence of training and retraining of the Nigerian journalists to update their knowledge, skills and expertise of the profession \u2013 with a view to attaining the needed proficiency and competencies that are required to overcome the new media drifts that dragging journalism profession.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile commending Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State for keeping the state safe even in the midst of the prevailing insecurity in some parts of the country, the editors also appreciated the state government\u2019s phenomenal drive of infrastructure development; as well as the state government\u2019s determination to turn Kano into a modern city.\n\nThe guild thanked Ganduje and members of the state Executive Council for providing the enabling environment for the national convention to hold.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Barkindo: Oil industry\u2019s upstream spending slumped 30% in 2020\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said that the Nigerian oil and gas industry will require at least $40 billion in direct investments in basic infrastructure to achieve the federal government\u2019s much talked-about about \u201cDecade of Gas.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Secretary General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, said the cartel\u2019s latest assessment showed that capital investments in the upstream of the oil and gas industry fell by 30 per cent in 2020.\n\nNNPC said yesterday that it was targeting between 7.4 billion cubic feet to 10 billion cubit feet of gas in the next couple of years, compared to its current 1.6 bcf supply capacity.\n\nSpeaking at a virtual forum organised by the Association of Local Distributors of Gas (ALDG), tagged \u201cThe Decade of Gas: Unlocking Opportunities in the Domestic Gas Market,\u201d the Chief Operating Officer, Gas and Power, NNPC, Mr Yusuf Usman, stated that a major constraint in achieving local content through the programme is the difficult conditions placed by foreign lenders.\n\nHowever, he stated that the corporation expects to grow about 10 gas-based industries as it works towards the 10-year target.\n\nHe added that the figure on the quantum of funds needed is based on the submissions NNPC has received from potential investors.\n\nIn addition, he stated that about 39 thermal power plants were being targeted as opposed to the current 33.\n\nAccording to him, by the end of this year, the NNPC is projecting an added gas sales of about 600 mmscfd, compared to its current 1.6 bcf to hit 2.2 bcf by the end of 2021.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn terms of benefits, we will generate 45,000 megawatts of power in terms of gas use, creating massive employment and import substitution.\n\n\u201cThere are changes we need to look at to actualise the decade of gas. We see the huge amount of investment, both Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) that will come into the country upward of $40 billion or much more than that in order to achieve all the aggressive plans that that are outlined in the decade of gas.\n\n\u201cThis investment will come in the upstream, midstream and downstream, but there are challenges as well because there have been a lot of announcements around funding for fossil fuels and these are some of the things we have to look at as we go forward and we need to figure out the announcement vis-a-vis the foreign estimate that we expect.\u201d\n\nHe added that the corporation has a supply plan to deliver up to 4.5 bcf of gas into the market, while going forward, the country expects 7.4 bcf of gas.\n\nAccording to Usman, there are urgent plans to complete ongoing gas projects in the country, including the AKK project , which he described as one of the most aggressive and biggest pipeline infrastructure ever embarked upon by the country. The pipeline spans 614 km.\n\nHe said all the gas activities going on around the country were being handled by local construction companies and local providers of services due to the COVID-19 restrictions.\n\n\u201cGoing forward into 10 years, we expect to do another big pipeline that will take up gas from south, all the way into Ajaokuta and possibly we extend it all the way to Maiduguri,\u201d he said.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) will be passed this year, noting that the corporation is ready to adjust to the changes that the law will impose.\n\nUsman stated that by the corporation\u2019s projection, demand for gas to generate electricity in the country will consume between 60 to 70 per cent of the entire commodity produced, with the ongoing plan to generate 45,000MW.\n\n\u201cThe other challenge we have is the liquidity in the power sector, and there\u2019s a lot of work going on because it is a very huge market. If you see the demand projections that we have done, it is going to consume 60 to 70 per cent of the gas that we have.\n\n\u201cNot only that; without power, all the development programmes we are thinking of will be a mirage. It is an inevitable equation that we have to solve to move towards development and issues around it have to be resolved,\u201d he stated.\n\nUsman urged policy makers to answer the questions surrounding gas pricing, since Nigeria is interested in using gas as a source of revenue as well as balancing between investment and local content drive.\n\n\u201cAll these FDI come with conditionality before taking the money. That will put a limit to our local content drive. As you all know, the restrictions by itself affect the kind of projections that we look at,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stated that if Nigeria will achieve the decade of gas, it must transit to a willing-buyer willing-seller market.\n\nBesides, there must be a document with timelines as well as defined investment strategies on the announcement that is being made about the restriction for fossil fuel to achieve the decade of gas.\n\nBarkindo: Oil Industry\u2019s Upstream Spending Slumped 30% in 2020\n\nMeanwhile, the Secretary General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, has said that the cartel\u2019s latest assessment shows that capital investments in the upstream of the oil and gas industry fell by 30 per cent in 2020.\n\nHe said at the first meeting of the OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue that despite that, crude oil will continue to be relevant, especially in Africa.\n\nDescribing the future of Africa\u2019s oil industry as bright and the opportunities vast, Barkindo stated that the continent is currently home to five of the top 30 oil-producing countries in the world.\n\nAccording to him, oil is expected to retain the largest share of the global energy mix throughout the forecast period, providing nearly 28 per cent of global requirements in 2045, followed by gas at around 25 per cent and coal at roughly 20 per cent.\n\nIn 2019, Barkindo stated that the continent produced 8.5 mb/d of oil, which is around nine per cent of world\u2019s output.\n\nHe said at the end of 2019, Africa was estimated to have proven oil reserves amounting to around 126 billion barrels,with Nigeria holding the lion\u2019s share with 36.9 billion barrels, representing 29 per cent of Africa\u2019s reserves.\n\nBarkindo said demand in developing regions, including Africa, with its rapidly growing population and dynamic demographical shifts, would be intensified, and all forms of energy would be needed, not only to support the post-pandemic recovery but to satisfy long-term energy requirements.\n\n\u201cOne major issue looming in the long-term horizon is the lack of adequate industry investment.\n\n\u201cAccording to our latest assessments, upstream capital spending is estimated to have fallen in 2020 by a staggering 30 per cent or more.\n\n\u201cOur 2020 World Oil Outlook estimates that $12.6 trillion will be required between now and 2045 in the upstream, midstream and downstream.\n\n\u201cWe must continue to advocate a turnaround in this very upsetting trend. The very future of our industry is at stake,\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to him, oil and gas will continue to be a vital part of the energy needs to ensure future demand is met, adding that policies must change in that regard.\n\nHe stated that another issue of utmost concern in Africa is the scourge of energy poverty, which continues to impact millions across the continent.\n\nCiting OPEC data, Barkindo said an estimated 47 per cent of the population in Sub Saharan Africa had no electricity and approximately 85 per cent of people lacked access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking.\n\nHe stated that considering the richness of the continent\u2019s resources, both conventional and renewable, this situation is hard to accept.\n\nHe urged all stakeholders to unite on the issues to ensure an equitable distribution of energy that leaves no one behind.\n\n\u201cWhen all is said and done, access to energy, like education and health care, should not be considered a luxury but a human right.\n\n\u201cOPEC will continue to work closely with our member countries to advocate for real and lasting change on this issue,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Seven Times Nigerian Presidents, Governors Made Inflammatory Remarks Capable Of Destroying Nigeria",
          "text": "There have been countless occasions when Nigerian leaders threw caution to the wind and made heavy, insensitive statements about national issues which generated tension and only heated the polity the more.\n\nSaharaReporters, in taking a look at seven of such occasions, reports that notorious among the leaders known for reckless comments are; President Muhammadu Buhari, former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai, among others.\n\nElection Is Do-Or-Die Affair \u2013 Obasanjo\n\nIn February 2007 as Nigerians were preparing for the third general elections since return to democracy in 1999, the then President Olusegun Obasanjo in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, said the April general elections would be a do-or-die affair for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nBy his reckless statement which already did not give room for opposition\u2019s victory, Obasanjo confessed that his party would do everything to stop some politicians from leading the nation as from May 29.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is left to you to ensure that we elect credible and committed leaders. I commend those of you in the PDP for your efforts so far. You must remain committed to the party. I will campaign. This election is a do-or-die affair for me and the PDP. This coming election is a matter of life and death for the PDP and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThey Do It To Get Money In Their Bank Accounts \u2013 El-Rufai Blasts Southern Kaduna Leaders Over Killings\n\nThe Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai, in August 2020 accused Southern Kaduna leaders of instigating killings in their own communities so as to get money into their bank accounts.\n\nThe governor blamed them for the ongoing crisis, saying, \u201cI have no time for nonsense.\u201d\n\nSouthern Kaduna has continued to experience killings of genocidal proportions in the hands of those mostly identified as Fulani herdsmen.\n\n\u201cI have no time for nonsense. I will not appease criminals. I will not appease idle people who have nothing to do but to raise a spectre of genocide. They do that to get money into their bank accounts and get donations from abroad instead of standing up. Anyone that is moderate; anyone that is promoting peaceful co-existence between various ethnic groups is considered a sell-out,\u201d he had said.\n\nThey Will Return In Bodybags\u2014El-Rufai\n\nAlso, El-Rufai, ahead of the 2019 elections said people from overseas who sought to intervene in the polls would go back in body bags.\n\n\n\nEl-Rufai made the comments during a discussion programme on the Nigerian Television Authority when the topic of the international community's role in elections was raised.\n\nBuhari was seeking a second term in office.\n\nThe discussion about the role of foreign countries in elections was raised on the programme in which reference was made to concerns expressed by the European Union, the United States and Britain over the suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Walter Onnoghen over allegedly breaching asset-declaration rules.\n\n\"We are waiting for the person who will come and intervene.

I only want to help this state.\u201d\n\nSouth-East Will Be Treated In Language Of Civil War They Understand \u2013 Buhari\n\nThe most recent and trending of the verbal insults which Nigerian leaders have hurled on the citizens was that of President Muhammadu Buhari on Twitter which ultimately forced the micro blogging platform, Twitter, to delete the tweet.\n\nBuhari had in a tweet on Tuesday stated that his government will get \u201charder\u201d on those hell-bent on destroying the country.\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War.

          "text": "There have been countless occasions when Nigerian leaders threw caution to the wind and made heavy, insensitive statements about national issues which generated tension and only heated the polity the more.\n\nSaharaReporters, in taking a look at seven of such occasions, reports that notorious among the leaders known for reckless comments are; President Muhammadu Buhari, former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai, among others.\n\nElection Is Do-Or-Die Affair \u2013 Obasanjo\n\nIn February 2007 as Nigerians were preparing for the third general elections since return to democracy in 1999, the then President Olusegun Obasanjo in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, said the April general elections would be a do-or-die affair for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nBy his reckless statement which already did not give room for opposition\u2019s victory, Obasanjo confessed that his party would do everything to stop some politicians from leading the nation as from May 29.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is left to you to ensure that we elect credible and committed leaders. I commend those of you in the PDP for your efforts so far. You must remain committed to the party. I will campaign. This election is a do-or-die affair for me and the PDP. This coming election is a matter of life and death for the PDP and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThey Do It To Get Money In Their Bank Accounts \u2013 El-Rufai Blasts Southern Kaduna Leaders Over Killings\n\nThe Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai, in August 2020 accused Southern Kaduna leaders of instigating killings in their own communities so as to get money into their bank accounts.\n\nThe governor blamed them for the ongoing crisis, saying, \u201cI have no time for nonsense.\u201d\n\nSouthern Kaduna has continued to experience killings of genocidal proportions in the hands of those mostly identified as Fulani herdsmen.\n\n\u201cI have no time for nonsense. I will not appease criminals. I will not appease idle people who have nothing to do but to raise a spectre of genocide. They do that to get money into their bank accounts and get donations from abroad instead of standing up. Anyone that is moderate; anyone that is promoting peaceful co-existence between various ethnic groups is considered a sell-out,\u201d he had said.\n\nThey Will Return In Bodybags\u2014El-Rufai\n\nAlso, El-Rufai, ahead of the 2019 elections said people from overseas who sought to intervene in the polls would go back in body bags.\n\n\n\nEl-Rufai made the comments during a discussion programme on the Nigerian Television Authority when the topic of the international community's role in elections was raised.\n\nBuhari was seeking a second term in office.\n\nThe discussion about the role of foreign countries in elections was raised on the programme in which reference was made to concerns expressed by the European Union, the United States and Britain over the suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Walter Onnoghen over allegedly breaching asset-declaration rules.\n\n\"We are waiting for the person who will come and intervene. They will go back in body bags because nobody will come to Nigeria and tell us how to run our country,\" said El-Rufai.\n\n\"We have got that independence and we are trying to run our country as decently as possible,\" he said.\n\nFulani Herdsmen Need To Carry AK-47 Rifle to Defend Themselves \u2013 Bauchi Governor\n\nBauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, has been seen recently as a godfather to the killer Fulani herdsmen going by his open support for them to be armed and to defend themselves if need be, through killings.\n\nOn February 11, 2021, Mohammed said herdsmen need the AK-47 rifles to defend themselves from cattle rustlers and other challenges encountered on the road.\n\n\"It is not his fault, it is the fault of the government and the people,\" he had said.\n\nEven if schools close for eight months, I remain constituted authority \u2013 Late Ajimobi\n\nLate former Oyo State Governor, Abiola Ajimobi, had a spell with aggrieved students of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, who staged a protest to his office over the closure of their school in January 2017.\n\nBut the governor felt they were unruly.\n\n\u201cYou are complaining that your school has been shut for eight months.

You are supposed to have little respect for constituted authority, no matter what,\u201d the governor had yelled at the students.\n\nI am Richer Than Osun State \u2013 Tinubu Boasts\n\nA former Governor of Lagos State and national leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu, stirred controversies in September 2018 when he said Osun State is not as wealthy as he his.\n\nTinubu, wanted for many mega fraud cases when he served as governor, boasted in front of the Ataoja of Osogbo, Jimoh Olanipekun, some states do not even have enough money from which a person of his calibre could \u2018steal\u2019.\n\nAddressing the Osogbo monarch, he said, \u201cPeople may be saying that Jagaban, Asiwaju has appointed someone to help him plunder Osun\u2019s funds, and all, and I ask them: \u2018How much exactly do you (Osun State) even have?\u2019\n\n\u201cKabiyesi I don\u2019t want to say this in front of you but, Osun is not as rich as I am, that one would steal. I only want to help this state.\u201d\n\nSouth-East Will Be Treated In Language Of Civil War They Understand \u2013 Buhari\n\nThe most recent and trending of the verbal insults which Nigerian leaders have hurled on the citizens was that of President Muhammadu Buhari on Twitter which ultimately forced the micro blogging platform, Twitter, to delete the tweet.\n\nBuhari had in a tweet on Tuesday stated that his government will get \u201charder\u201d on those hell-bent on destroying the country.\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War.

          "text": "A tweet by Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria\u2019s president, that seemed to imply certain people in the country will be dealt with violently caused a stir on Tuesday evening.\n\nAlmost immediately, there were calls for Buhari\u2019s tweet to be removed from the social media platform.\n\nTwitter answered that call on Wednesday afternoon. The tweet was part of a thread in which Buhari expressed displeasure at \u201cattacks on critical national infrastructure,\u201d including on facilities belonging to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nBuhari\u2019s deleted tweet was widely criticised as summoning the ghosts of the Nigeria civil war, a deadly three-year combat between the Nigerian government and a government in southeast Nigeria, which had seceded from the republic.\n\nThe Biafra war, as it is alternatively called, led to the death of nearly 1 million people, according to various accounts.\n\nWhile he may have intended to send a strong message against recent vandalism in the southeast supposedly led by the Indigenous People of Biafra, a proscribed militant group, Buhari\u2019s comment was interpreted as an affront and a threat to people in the region.\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War,\u201d the tweet read.\n\n\u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe controversial tweet was from what Buhari said in a televised meeting with the leadership of INEC. He did not seem to be reading from a script, according to a video recording.\n\nTwitter had never deleted tweets by the Nigerian president before. Given that Nigeria is the platform\u2019s biggest market in Africa, it marks a new paradigm in the role it plays shaping civic spaces and citizen-government relations in Africa.\n\nTwitter may have been nudged to take action on Buhari\u2019s tweet following complaints by multiple accounts. Peoples\u2019 Gazette, an online publication on political affairs, reports that Twitter initially said Buhari\u2019s tweet did not violate its policies but reversed itself later.\n\nIn a statement to TechCabal, Twitter said the tweet \u201cwas in violation of the Twitter Rules. The account owner will be required to delete the violative Tweet and spend 12 hours with their account in read-only mode.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Lai Mohammed, Nigeria\u2019s information minister, has accused Twitter of not being clear in its standard for deleting tweets, implying the US company has a longstanding bias against the Nigerian government.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very very suspect,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\n\u201cHas Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? The same Twitter that was funding #ENDSARS protesters\u2026 When people were burning Police stations and killing policemen, for Twitter it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened at the [US] Capitol, it became an insurrection.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria, citing those two examples, is very suspect. What is their agenda?\u201d\n\nLast October, Twitter became the platform where the world learned much about END SARS protests in Nigeria. Jack Dorsey, the company\u2019s CEO, expressed solidarity in a couple of tweets. But it is not clear that the company funded protesters in the way the minister alleges.",

          "title": "Banks don\u2019t fund African renewable energy startups. So where can founders find money?",
          "text": "Small and medium scale enterprises in Africa receive about $70bn of credit each year. But the International Finance Corporation estimates that the gap exceeds $300bn.\n\nWhy does the gap exist? Michael Famoroti, chief economist at Stears gave two reasons during a recent TechCabal Live event on financing renewable energy companies in Africa.\n\nFirst, there is an information problem.\n\nCredit providers seem to lack enough information with which to assess the risk worthiness of many borrowers. This problem exists at the retail level as most bank customers who have tried to take personal loans will be aware.\n\nBut it is arguably a bigger problem for SMEs and startups whose businesses are typically regarded as high-risk and unproven.\n\nThe second reason Famoroti gave is that credit providers may not find enough value in the use proposed for the funds. In this case, creditors may play safe by lending to legacy industries like real estate or banking, while taking a skeptical approach to promising but new ventures. Like renewable energy for example.\n\nSo if you are setting up a renewable energy startup to provide electricity to the more than 50% of people living in SubSaharan Africa who lack access, how do you find funding?\n\nThe TechCabal Live event had Marly Diallo, Wiebe Boer and Christian Wessels in attendance as guests.\n\nDiallo runs BRT Energy, a startup that regenerates batteries by reducing lead-acid waste. She started her career in fintech and banking, but when it was time to raise money for BRT, she hid many roadblocks.\n\nIn BRT\u2019s early days, she met the criteria for a certain funding program. But because she could not produce three years of financial statements, she did not get access to the money.\n\nMarly\u2019s experience is not an anomaly.\n\nWessels, co-founder and CEO of Daystar Power, also has a banking background having worked at Barclays for years. Founded in 2017, Daystar now operates hybrid energy solutions that combine solar and generator sets in Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal and Ivory Coast.\n\nLast year, they raised $38 million in a Series B round but it was mainly from development finance institutions in Nordic countries. But Wessels still remembers the anxiety that came with sourcing funds locally.\n\n\u201cNigerian banks played zero role in our financing. That\u2019s not great because we don\u2019t like the idea that as a West Africa company, that we are getting money mainly from overseas.\n\n\u201cI mean, thank God we get the money but why is it that we need to rely on DFIs and European investors when what we are doing is locally valuable?\u201d\n\nSuch experiences scar founders and make it seem like there are no funding opportunities for renewable energy financing within Africa. But some organisations have come aboard bearing some hope.\n\nAll On is an independent, off-grid energy impact investment company. It was founded by Shell, the oil company, as a vehicle for giving back to Nigeria by making impact investments into the renewable energy sector. Shell provided the seed funding but doesn\u2019t make any money from the venture.\n\nWiebe Boer, All On\u2019s managing director, empathizes with founders who need funding but have little sources to reach out to. With banks an obvious \u201cwaste of time,\u201d he advises that family and friends will continue to be the first base for most founders.\n\nFrom there, it might be possible to access funding from All On\u2019s initiatives for projects at the ideation stage. At the moment, the firm partners with two organisations for this purpose: the Clean Tech Hub in Abuja and the Nigeria Climate Innovation Centre in Lagos. These initiatives give up to $10,000.\n\nAbove that is another stage of up to $50,000 debt investment for companies that are, for example, doing their first minigrid or importing solar equipment. All On does this in partnership with the US Africa Development Foundation. USADF matches All On\u2019s $50,000 loan with a grant of $50,000.\n\nAll On could invest further in startups that show promise after this stage. For example, Auxano, a solar equipment company, received the $50,000 loan in 2018. It performed well enough for All On to invest $1.5 million last September to help the startup scale its assembly plant over the next five years.\n\n\u201cIt really is about being credible from the beginning and delivering even at a small level. With that, investors can give you more money,\u201d Boer says.\n\nWhat Marly, the BRT founder, has learned is that a pilot program can be useful in showing how useful an investor\u2019s funds will be.\n\n\u201cYou need to prove your concept by doing pilots to get customers.You need to make sure that what you are pushing is adopted by the market,\u201d she said.\n\nWessels, who now has access to entrepreneurship support networks like Endeavor Nigeria that give Daystar access to more funding, says new founders will need much tenacity and patience along the way. But he hopes they persevere because \u201cultimately, there is a big market to serve.\u201d\n\nWatch the full video of the TechCabal Live event on financing an African renewable energy company here.",

They started with a seed round of $3.5m.\n\nThe initial plan was to generate $10,000 in sales just to validate the business idea but they ended up making $300,000 in sales that year.\n\nIn 2019, they crossed the $1 million revenue line and raised the next funding round \u2013 Series A. Almentor\u2019s Series A round was led by Sawari ventures.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition of Ask an Investor I talk to one of the oldest venture capital firms in the Middle East and North Africa \u2013 Sawari Ventures.\n\nFikry pointed out that Sawari Ventures helped Almentor in three critical areas: Governance, networking with the ecosystem and technical support.\n\nSawari Ventures helped them put structures that enable the company to last for decades. It also helped with meeting relevant people in the ecosystem and provided good technical support and advice.\n\nI talk to Tamer Azer, a principal at Sawari Ventures; he joined the firm in 2019. One of the first things he pointed out to me early in our initial email exchange was that he had done an Ask an Investor series before. His own version was a free-flowing conversation with people interested in learning about how investors make decisions and the differences between concepts like equity and convertible notes.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: Tell me about Sawari Ventures\n\nTamer Azer: Sawari ventures has been around since 2010. It was founded by three partners \u2013 Ahmed El Alfi, Hany Al-Sonbaty and Wael Amin. They\u2019re also the founders of Flat6Labs \u2013 the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator. Sawari Ventures is also a limited partner in Flat6Labs Cairo and Flat6Labs Tunis. We invest in companies anywhere from a million to $3 million per ticket and up to $5 million for the life of the company, across Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco. We\u2019re fairly sector-agnostic. We most definitely look for companies who have a very clear product-market fit and are doing something really innovative and meaningful.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the premise behind the investments you make?\n\nTA: There\u2019s an argument to be made that the tech entrepreneurship ecosystem in Egypt became a lot more attractive after the Arab Spring when a lot of people found their sense of purpose and sense of independence.\n\nIt\u2019s picking up a lot from there. A lot of people saw it as a way to express themselves in a way to be able to engage on their own terms. There\u2019s an argument that a lot of people make that\u2019s connected somehow. In terms of the investment thesis, we\u2019re definitely sector-agnostic. We look out for companies that really have unique intellectual property. I\u2019m not just talking about documentation. The company has to be doing something really defensible and really unique. It can be doing something that we all know and love, but in a way that nobody else has done. Obviously, teams factor in a huge way. We\u2019re looking for professionally mature people who work with intention, who are coachable, who understand why, what and how they\u2019re doing it.\n\nDA: How do you find these companies or better still how do people get your attention?\n\nTA: I made a decision when I first started working in this industry to respond to absolutely everybody. I respond to anyone who messages me on LinkedIn, anyone who emails me. I try to put myself out there a lot and speak at events and do articles like the one I\u2019m doing with you right now, so that people hear about me and they try to reach out to me. Deal sourcing is always two ways.\n\nSometimes it takes me longer than I\u2019d like to admit, but I do try my best to respond to absolutely everyone.\n\nDA: That\u2019s really generous. If you get more popular you\u2019ll probably need to get an assistant. So does Sawari invest in cohorts?\n\nTA: We\u2019re not an accelerator. These are types of activities that Flat6Labs would organize. For us, we look for companies that are a bit more mature than that.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the relationship between Flat6Labs and Sawari ventures?\n\nTA: The founders of Sawari Ventures and the founders and Flat6labs are the same. When Sawari Ventures raised its North Africa fund, we invested in Flat6Labs Cairo and Flat6Labs Tunis. There\u2019s something really important here I need to point out between when a company joins Flat6Labs and when it can join Sawari Ventures. There has to be a bit of a gap, where they go out into the world and raise their middle round.\n\nJust because you get into Flat6Labs does not mean that once you graduate you\u2019re going to get money from Sawari Ventures automatically. We look out for whoever survives, manages to go out into the world, get a seed fund, grow their business even more, and then they can come to Sawari for their Series A round.\n\nDA: What does support from Sawari Ventures look like?\n\nTA: Typically, one of the partners of the firm would sit on the board. We\u2019ve worked very closely with our companies in the beginning to build a strong relationship and to build a strong plan for the business. Moving forward, we work very closely with them to help with business development, growth, as well as fundraising. We work with them to analyze the data that they share with us and help them make data-driven decisions. Obviously, we deploy our entire network to support their growth.\n\nThese are how most VCs support the portfolio companies. We\u2019re also in a position where we have some very strong limited partners who are interested in co-investing. We have a really wide network that allows us to bring a lot of international VCs into the next rounds for the companies. For instance, we brought in Partec to co-invest with us in MoneyFellows.\n\nDA: How does due diligence happen and how long does it take?\n\nTA: Each company will have a different level of preparedness, investment readiness, and every company will have different rounds. A priced round will have a very different timeline than a convertible note round or a safe round. So ultimately, every process is fluid depending on the nature of the round and the co-investors in the round and the lead.\n\nWe will always want to be the lead on any investment that we make and we\u2019re always trying to bring co-investors into the process. We definitely conduct four layers of due diligence. There\u2019s commercial, financial, legal, and tech.\n\nThe rest happen a little later in the process. Initially, there has to be a good solid commercial due diligence, so we can buy into the market, the team, the company, and then we take it forward from there.\n\nDA: What are some red flags?\n\nTA: One that comes to mind is coachability. I\u2019m turned off when I see that a founder or co-founders are not really being responsive to feedback from an investor or a customer. When they have a reputation for being not just defensive, but being uncoachable. That\u2019s a major red flag because when you invest in someone, the relationship is very close for a very long period of time. If you can\u2019t give and take, then it becomes really tricky to nurture this relationship over that period of time. Another thing I really look for as a red flag is co-founder dynamics. Are they both at the pitch? How do they talk during the pitch? How do they answer questions? What does the dynamic and the relationship between them look like? If it looks out of sync, that\u2019s a pretty major red flag.\n\nDA: You said Sawari Ventures typically takes the lead on investments. Why the emphasis on this?\n\nTA: We also co-lead. As regards the times we lead investment rounds, it\u2019s because of the environment. Many companies in this region find investors who can\u2019t and won\u2019t lead, who will tell them, find the lead and we\u2019ll follow. It\u2019s part of a fund ethos that we like to lead our own investments because we really believe in them. Another reason is the market dynamics in the region, there\u2019s a lot of people who want to follow on, but not lead, which ultimately leaves you in a strong position when you are capable and willing.\n\nWe\u2019re a very experienced team. We have very clear intentions about what we like to invest in and why we invest in certain things.\n\nDA: What are your thoughts on exits and M&A?\n\nTA: I think the African market, we\u2019re all suffering from a lack of exits. We all have that problem. Angel investors all over the continent are just dying for an exit because they\u2019ve been investing for years and years. We\u2019re all really dying for exits but exits are really a function of foreign direct investment. It\u2019s a function of mature stock exchanges. I think we\u2019re going to start seeing more and more exits from North Africa. We have seen a few and they\u2019re getting bigger, but we still need so many more before more capital comes into North Africa and that capital gets redeployed.\n\nYou know how it works, you have a company and you exit, all of a sudden you\u2019re an angel investor. Then you\u2019re a fund manager or you start another company that people want to invest in quickly because you already have a successful exit. We\u2019re seeing the industry in North Africa mature, and it\u2019s heading more and more towards some of these interesting exits. We\u2019re starting to see bigger rounds. We\u2019re starting to see exits, we\u2019re starting to see mergers in the continent, in North Africa and in Egypt especially because it\u2019s the market that I\u2019m closest to. We are seeing a lot of maturity, a lot of growth. For example, a lot of ex-Uber and ex-Careem staff are starting companies that have been doing fantastically well. As more and more of these things happen, the maturity of the entrepreneurs and investors grows, and exits will come. We just have to keep at it.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup?\n\nTA: VC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime, They have a 10 year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\nJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time, and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\nWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing checks, we have to get the money to be able to write these checks first.\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these checks. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\n\nDA: What are some trends you\u2019re seeing in the market?\n\nTA: I think for me, the main trends are the fact that people are starting to solve deep-rooted fundamental problems. They\u2019re starting to solve access to finance. They\u2019re starting to solve financial literacy and financial inclusion. They\u2019re starting to solve healthcare problems. People are actually tackling the big-ticket issues that were previously left to the public sector. We\u2019re seeing the market respond very positively to that.\n\nDA: Any final words?\n\nTA: It\u2019d be interesting to see more engagement from large institutional investors with investing in startups. There\u2019s immense potential and having your local financial institutions support you as a fund manager helps immensely when it comes to getting international development. It\u2019s a team effort, we have to do it together.\n\nI\u2019m encouraging more engagement from African financial institutions, not just banks but hedge funds, insurance companies and pension plans.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you <a href=\u201d \u201c> subscribe now </a>.\n\nGood day.\n\nVictoria here.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nGoogle accepts crypto ads\n\nTwitter tackles misinformation\n\nAirtel\u2019s Tanzanian towers\n\nGoogle accepts crypto ads\n\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n\nYesterday, June 2, Google made some additions to its policy on cryptocurrency advertising which will take effect on August 3, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, this means that any Google certified advertiser in the world offering cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets aimed at the US can promote their services and products if they meet the requirements.\n\nRead this to know how to be certified by Google.\n\nI know cryptocurrency traders and investors are excited. However, according to Google, some ads are not allowed. These include initial coin offerings (ICOs), Decentralised Finance (DeFi) trading protocols, or promotion of their sale and purchase.\n\nJust last month, Bitcoin and some altcoins experienced a decline that bothered some investors and traders. While the additions to Google\u2019s cryptocurrency ad policy are a welcome development, it\u2019s too early to tell if they will lead to an increase in the number of crypto users in Africa.\n\nTwitter launches Birdwatch to tackle misinformation\n\nFour months after announcing its plan to launch Birdwatch \u2014 a community-based approach to misinformation \u2014 Twitter has begun rolling out the feature in tweets.\n\nWell, as of yesterday, only pilot participants could view it.\n\nWhy Birdwatch? Twitter believes it will keep people informed by adding helpful context to tweets, easily identifying and rating the most helpful notes.\n\nWhat does this mean? Once the Birdwatch notes are added to a tweet, users can rate whether or not the feedback is beneficial. If none is considered good, the Birdwatch card will disappear, but if any notes are deemed helpful, they\u2019ll pop up inside the tweet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis probably sounds familiar because, in November 2020, Twitter announced that it was working on the use of its \u201cmisinformation\u201d labels on misleading tweets.\n\nThe \u201cmisleading information\u201d label was supposed to pop up whenever a user tried to \u201clike\u201d a tweet labelled misinformation.\n\nI guess they discarded that idea for the Birdwatch feature. Hopefully, it helps reduce the spread of misinformation, even though I still don\u2019t know how this would work in the current social media landscape.\n\nJust yesterday, Twitter pulled down President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweets on the Nigerian-Biafran Civil War.\n\nStay tuned to Techpoint Africa as Chimgozirim explores this in context later today.\n\nAirtel Africa sells its Tanzanian towers for $175 million\n\nAirtel Africa has announced the sale of its Tanzanian tower portfolio for $175 million to settle its debts.\n\nIn 2020, Airtel Africa CEO, Raghunath Mandava, outlined plans to sell approximately 4,500 towers in five countries, including Tanzania.\n\nThis sale has helped pay part of the company\u2019s $3.5 billion debt and prepare for upcoming bond repayments.\n\nThis divestment focuses on an asset-light business model and Airtel Africa\u2019s core subscriber-facing operations.\n\nSadly, the telecommunication giant has recorded significant losses in India due to low data prices and high competition among telcos.\n\nRead Airtel Africa has announced the sale of its Tanzanian tower portfolio for $175 million to settle its debts for context.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nFollowing a partnership between Releaf \u2014 an agritech startup \u2014 and API-fintech startup, OnePipe, farmers in Cross River and Akwa Ibom states can now easily access digital financial services.

          "text": "Airtel Africa has announced the sale of its Tanzanian tower portfolio for $175 million. According to the company, the sale to SBA Communications Corporation and Paradigm Infrastructure Limited would allow it to prioritise its core subscription services.\n\nAirtel Africa will receive approximately $157.5 million of the total amount in the first instalment, which is expected to take place in the second half of the group\u2019s financial year.\n\nA portion of the proceeds would be distributed to the Tanzanian government as part of the terms of the company\u2019s public listing in 2019. The rest is to be used for debt reduction at the group level and investment in network and sales infrastructure in Tanzania.\n\nIn 2020, Airtel Africa CEO, Raghunath Mandava, outlined plans to sell approximately 4,500 towers in five countries: Chad, Gabon, Madagascar, Malawi, and Tanzania.\n\nThe move aimed to reduce the company\u2019s $3.5 billion debt and prepare for upcoming bond repayments.\n\nThe telecommunications giant has recorded significant losses in India because of low data prices and high competition among telcos. There is also the considerable cost of the infrastructure associated with running a telecoms business.\n\nHowever, there is a growing trend of asset-light telcos focused on core network and services provisions like calls and data services with third-party providers tasked with providing last-mile access. This results in a reduction in operational and maintenance overhead.\n\nAn example of a company divesting its assets is the Indonesian telco XL Axiata which has sold 6,000 radio towers since 2014.\n\nIn 2020, the Lagos State Government also moved to provide the infrastructure that telcos can latch on to provide telecommunications service to customers through its partnership with Western Telecommunications and Engineering Services Metro Limited.\n\nIt appears that Airtel is choosing to go this route as it aims to reduce its debt and increase competitiveness.",

          "text": "Following a partnership between Releaf \u2014 an agritech startup \u2014 and fintech startup, OnePipe, farmers in Cross River and Akwa Ibom states can now easily access digital financial services.\n\nSpeaking on the partnership, Releaf\u2019s Co-founder and CTO, Uzoma Ayogu, said, \u201cSince inception, Releaf has empowered over 1,000 farmers to supply over 10 million kilograms of quality crops to various food factories.\n\nWhile disbursements to our farmers have been largely cash-based, we now have access to digitised fund disbursement via embedded, customised accounts, provisioned by OnePipe, to drive financial inclusion of previously financially excluded farmers in the digital economy.\u201d\n\nHe also revealed that Releaf is exploring the provision of insurance services leveraging OnePipe\u2019s infrastructure and partnerships. The partnership provides the farmers with an embedded account branded as Releaf Wallet, which can be opened and operated by USSD and Progressive Web Apps (PWA) channels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith these accounts, the farmers can receive money from any bank/channel, transfer funds to any Nigerian bank account, and purchase airtime for themselves or third parties.\n\nLike most digital finance services on offer, they can also access loans with the loan amounts increasing according to their wallet usage.\n\nAccording to OnePipe\u2019s Founder and Chief Plumber, Ope Adeoye, \u201cworking with Releaf was inevitable as the company\u2019s vision to transform Africa\u2019s agricultural future by making decentralised food processing scaleable coincides with OnePipe\u2019s social mandate to drive financial inclusion through technology for all \u2014 including the 700m+ smallholder farmers on the continent.\u201d\n\nData from the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System Plc (NIBSS) reveals that as of May 30, 2021, 48 million Nigerians had a BVN. With Nigeria\u2019s adult population sitting at 105 million according to the World Population Review, that means that 57 million Nigerians are unbanked.\n\nWhile fintech startups have sprung up trying to increase the number of Nigerians connected to financial services, they have mostly solved the problems associated using existing financial services.\n\nResearch shows that poverty, a lack of education, or living in rural areas \u2014 all qualities of the average Nigerian smallholder farmer \u2014 are barriers to financial inclusion.\n\nReleaf\u2019s partnership with OnePipe is a welcome development that follows the playbook used by super apps in Asia.\n\nMost of the farmers who work with Releaf are smallholder farmers who live in rural areas. By providing them with an opportunity to access financial services through digital channels, they can create a digital footprint enabling them to access more financial services, thus accelerating their financial inclusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it is not yet clear if this service is available to farmers outside Releaf\u2019s network.\n\nFounded by Isaiah Udotong, Ikenna Nzewi, and Uzoma Ayogu in 2017, Releaf was originally an online marketplace that connected buyers and sellers of agricultural commodities to trustworthy customers.\n\nThe startup was accepted into Y Combinator in 2017, receiving $120,000 in funding. After the founders returned to Nigeria, they continued to provide a marketplace for agricultural commodities until they realised that food factories were struggling to secure raw materials for their operations.\n\nThis led to a change in priority as the startup now functions as a raw materials procurement and logistics platform with oil palm as the leading product.\n\nThrough this partnership with OnePipe, it is expected that smallholder farmers in Nigeria, most of whom lack access to financial services, can now access financial services and, in the process, drive Nigeria\u2019s financial inclusion goals.",

Hon. Francis Okiye, for being absent from the House proceedings for the mandatory 181 days.\n\nThe governor, reacting to calls to pardon the erring Assembly members-elect during an interactive session with stakeholders from Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Trade Union Congress (TUC) and other civil society groups, called for the support of all stakeholders towards achieving lasting peace and development in Edo.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSome characters said they sent congratulatory letters to me and put it in all kinds of conditions.\n\n\u201cHow can you tell me to forgive those 14 lawmakers-elect who are responsible for sedition and treason in Nigeria? Of course, we are going to start charges.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cYou see, what is bad is bad. Let\u2019s stop covering up things so that people can learn and not do it again. We have gotten support from all of you and are very glad and happy; your support gives us the confidence to continue to fight.\n\n\u201cFor us as a government, we are open. There is nothing that we are hiding and this is why we have to kill anything that links us to godfatherism. We have killed it at the national level and need to kill it locally as it is everywhere. I urge you to please be activists for good, peace and development.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis engagement is to see how we can collaborate and make things work differently; this is a time that we need leadership more than ever before,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn his part, the Chairman of NLC in Edo State, Mr. Sunday Osanyande, urged the government to digitize revenue collection by migrating to e-revenue collection systems, which will check leakages.\n\nOsanyande said that the e-revenue collection system would further increase the state government Internally Generated Revenue (IGR).\n\n...",

Let us build strong institutions and not individuals. The buildings are there; people have come and gone.\n\n\u201cLet us begin to think of government that way.

The only way this will happen is when we realize that the government is about you and when you participate in governance.\n\n\u201cThe structure of government that we run needs to change; it has to be more localized; it has to be more inclusive. You need to participate \u2013 not just sit down and participate on social media \u2013 in your community; speak up,\u201d the governor charged.\n\nEarlier, the State Head of Service, Anthony Okungbowa, while giving his opening remarks, said that the state civil and public service has been the focal point of government\u2019s attention.\n\nAlso, a participant, Alhaji Evbareke Ahmed, urged the governor to ensure the completion of the Benin River Port, adding that it would further create job opportunities for youths.\n\n...",

          "text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has arrested a Nigerian, Charles Onus, for his alleged involvement in diverting $800,000 into prepaid debit cards.\n\nThe amount translates to about N320 million at the current official rate of N410 per dollar.\n\nThis comes less than a month after Abidemi Rufai, an aide to Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, was arrested for fraud in the United States.\n\nAccording to a statement on the United State Department of Justice website, Mr Onus was arrested and detained on April 14, in San Francisco.\n\nHe was presented before the Manhattan federal court on Wednesday.\n\nThe prosecution accused him of hacking over 5,500 company user accounts.\n\nHe allegedly participated in a scheme that stole nearly $1 million by hacking into a payroll processing company\u2019s system to access user accounts and divert payroll to prepaid debit cards he controlled.\n\n\u201cAs alleged, Onus did this as effectively as someone who commits bank burglary, but with no need for a blowtorch or bolt-cutters. Thanks to the FBI and IRS-CI, Onus is in custody and facing serious federal charges,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nIn the indictments filed against him in court, Mr Onus allegedly participated in the scheme between July 2017 through about 2018, obtaining over 5,500 company user accounts through a cyber-intrusion technique referred to as \u201ccredential stuffing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter Onus successfully gained unauthorised access to a company user account, he changed the bank account information designated by the user of the account so that Onus would receive the user\u2019s payroll to a prepaid debit card that was under Onus\u2019 control.\n\n\u201cFrom at least in or about July 2017 through at least in or about 2018, at least approximately 5,500 company user accounts were compromised and more than approximately $800,000 in payroll funds were fraudulently diverted to prepaid debit cards, including those under the control of Onus,\u201d the statement partly read.\n\nCharges\n\nHe was charged with \u201cone count of computer fraud for causing damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.\n\n\u201cOne count of computer fraud for unauthorised access to a protected computer to further intended fraud, and one count of receipt of stolen money, each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; and one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison to be served consecutively to any other sentence imposed,\u201d the statement further read.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reported how Mr Rufai, an aide to Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun was arrested for $350,000 fraud in the U.S. last month.\n\nHe was arrested while trying to board Royal Dutch Airlines flight KL644 at John F. Kennedy International Airport (\u201cJFK Airport\u201d) in Queens, New York, to Amsterdam, with a final destination of Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nHe is to be arraigned on fraud charges before a United States Courthouse, in Tacoma, Washington, on June 8, 2021.\n\nMr Onus\u2019 arrest adds to the growing list of Nigerians arrested for cybercrimes abroad. Some of the common allegations many some of the Nigerian suspects have been accused of include bank verification number scams, fraudulent emails, hacking, cyber harassment, spamming, ATM spoofing, social media hi-jacking etcetera), and exploits vulnerabilities of both electronic devices and their users.\n\nThis act destroys the reputation of a country, making the business environment difficult for start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises, while discouraging investment in the economy by foreign companies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

          "text": "By Ukpono Ukpong\n\nThe National President of the Medical and Health Workers Union of Nigeria, (MHWUN) and the National Chairman, Joint Health Sector Unions of Nigeria, (JOHESU), Comrade Biobelemoye Josiah has emerged Ogbodo VIII(8), Amayanabo of Opu-Nembe kingdom, the first-class stool in Nembe Local Government Area of Bayelsa State, South-South Nigeria.\n\nComrade Biobelemoye Josiah, now to be known as His Royal Majesty, King Biobelemoye Josiah attained the Royal stool after defeating two others at the final contest to the throne.\n\nKing Biobelemoye Josiah polled 64 votes to defeat Admiral Victor Ombu with 5 votes and Chief (Arc). Baratuaipre Edoghotu with 2.\n\nHis emergence has brought an end to the nine years aberration where a revered kingdom such as Opu-Nembe were without a King despite frantic efforts to ensure that a traditional stool is reinstalled to oversee the long-established affairs of the domain following the vacancy brought about by the death of the previous occupant, His Royal Majesty Ralph Iwowari.\n\nOpu-Nembe, also known as Basambiri is made up of two major dynasties. They are Mein and Ogbodo dynasties. Each dynasty had produced seven successive monarchs of the ancient city.\n\nHaving produced the last King, who died nine years ago, the Mein dynasty was therefore out of the kingship contest to allow Ogbodo to produce the next King in the spirit of fairness, equity and justice.\n\nExplaining the traditional processes to his emergence, Daily Times gathered that soon after the election, the king-elect was led by the Council of Chiefs to Ogbodo-Square for presentation to the Deputy Chiefs, Elders, Women, Youths and citizens of the Kingdom.\n\n\u201cThereafter, the traditional rites of chalking on the forehead and Knocking on the head were conducted in King Ogbodo masoulium to formalise the election winner and ending all humiliation of the King.\n\n\u201cAfterwards, King Biobelemoye Josiah was dressed in the warrior attire and fashion of the ancient King. A dress code he will put on for the next seven days, although with different designs for each day.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigerian Army repels ISWAP attack on Damboa, kills 50\n\n\u201cThe king remains in the mausoleum, where he receives visitors from all works of life for the next seven days, thereafter he takes a familiarisation tour of the whole kingdom.\n\n\u201cAfter the tour, the initial traditional rites of anointing ends. Official coronation date to be decided by the King and his Council of Chiefs.\u201d\n\nIt is pertinent to note that His Royal Majesty, King Biobelemoye Josiah remains a unifying voice, not only among health workers across Nigeria and the global community, but has kept replicating the same in his home town, thereby earning him the first class paramount stool.\n\nHRM Biobelemoye Josiah was born on Wednesday, December 16, 1964 in Nembe-Bassambiri(Opu-Nembe), in what is today Nembe Local Government Area of Bayelsa State. He attended St. Peters State School Odioma for his primary schooling, finishing there in 1976.\n\nBy 1981, he secured his West Africa School Certificate (WASC) and two years later, was admitted by the Rivers State Ministry of Health, to pursue a medical laboratory course at the School of Health Technology, which he finished in 1986.\n\nBio, as he is fondly called, subsequently bagged a Higher Diploma in Environmental Health and Industrial Safety from the Institute of Administrative Management of Nigeria in 2013.\n\nThis was after securing a Bachelors degree from the Rivers State University of Science and Technology, nine years earlier.\n\nWith the creation of Bayelsa state in 1996, he has been in the employment of the Bayelsa state Hospital Management Board since then, till date.\n\nHRM, King Biobelemoye Josiah is an experienced trade unionist who has served in all levels of the MHWUN organisation.\n\nFilled with a passion for justice and a fervent commitment to the cause of the working class, he has a sterling track record of stewardship at the local branch and state councils over the last three decade.\n\nHe was the Bayelsa State Council Chairman from 2005 till he was elected as the 7th National President of MHWUN at the union\u2019s 9th National Delegates Conference which held on April 28-29, 2015 and has also subsequently emerged as Chairman of the Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU).\n\nHRM, King Bio loves reading, music, playing scrabble and football and he is happily married and blessed with children.",

          "title": "Foreign Fulani herdsmen planning a big strike against South West",
          "text": "By Abankula\n\nForeign Fulani herdsmen in the South West of Nigeria are poised to launch a \u2018big strike\u2019 against their hosts, any time.\n\nGeneral Kunle Togun, chairman of Amotekun Corps in Oyo State gave the warning on Wednesday, saying it was based on intelligence.\n\nTogun, was a former Director of Military Intelligence (DMI) and former Deputy Director-General of State Security Service (SSS).\n\nHe addvised Yoruba people to be security conscious and be prepared to defend themselves.\n\nAccording to the Oyo Amotekun boss, the foreigners have been penetrating localities in the region to monitor the environment over the years to pave way for the big strike.\n\nThe strike, according to intelligence report, he said will be aided by local collaborators based on the belief God has given them Nigeria, especially, the Southwest as inheritance.\n\nTogun spoke after a lecture he delivered at an event staged by the Institute of Peace and Strategic Studies Student Association (IPSSSA) University of Ibadan.\n\nHis lecture was entitled: \u201cSecurity Challenges, The significance of regional security dimensions.\u201d\n\nHe said:\u201cThe foreign Fulani herdsmen have invaded South West. There is nowhere in the South West that they are not. They are there.\n\n\u201cThey are the Okada riders. They are the ones using wheelbarrows to sell carrots and other things. I said they are foot soldiers.\n\n\u201cThey said they have come in to take the inheritance given to them by Allah and that is Nigerian land, particularly South West.\n\n\u201cSo, they will still strike. I am not just screaming aloud. So, everybody has to be ready.\n\n\u201cIt is only a foolish soldier that would say he wants to die for his country. His death cannot help his country. You are to stay alive to help your country.\n\n\u201cWhen as a soldier, you are sent to capture a particular place, they did not send you to go and die. If he gets there and scared them and the people run away, he has done what he supposed to do.\n\n\u201cBut if he was shot at and he fired back, he did not shoot to kill anybody, but to defend himself and keep himself alive, so that he can help his country.\n\n\u201cFor over 10 years, I have been saying it that the 10 local government areas of Oke-Ogun and the three local government areas of Ibarapa, both in Oyo State, have been saturated by these foreign Fulanis.\n\n\u201cAfter that, they brought in their children, selling pepper, tomatoes, carrots and so on with wheelbarrows.\n\n\u201cAll of us are looking at them. You cannot say Amotekun will do everything. Members of the public must help with credible information.\n\n\u201cMy advice to the Federal Government is that they should support regional security outfits.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore Amotekun took off, this problem has been there. They have invaded all Yorubaland. These people are just starting the plans they already had on ground, not that they are just coming in.\n\n\u201cAnd these foreign Fulani are still coming in. They have saturated already Yorubaland before Amotekun was established.\u201d\n\nGeneral Togun for many years have been drumming about the dangers of the foreign Fulani herdsmen in Nigeria, who invade farms and allow their animals to eat up crops and who also are ready to kill when the farmers complain.\n\nIn an interview with Nigerian Tribune in 2017, he spoke about a security meeting he attended in Abuja, where he made specific mention of the menace of the foreign herdsmen.\n\nHere is a reproduction of part of the interview:\n\nI was also in Abuja last June; all of us who were former directors of military intelligence were invited to Abuja by the current director of military intelligence. He tabled the security challenges of the country and we all had to make contributions.\n\nWhen it came to the issue of Fulani herdsmen, people said different things. When it came to my turn, I said these Fulani herdsmen, who the Northerners see as part of them, are foreigners.\n\nThey are foreigners; they are from Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger Republic and Chad; that is why they are so merciless. They are of no fixed address. I told them that Fulani people should call these herdsmen and ask where they come from in Northern Nigeria and ask them who their district heads are. The herdsmen are not Nigerians.\n\nI am a security man and I know my level of security status in the world. Some of these herdsmen were Al-Qaeda terrorists who took over Northern Mali and France had to send troops while ECOWAS and African Union added troops to expel them from Northern Mali and hand over the territory back to Mali. That was where they came about their assault rifles. Why are security agents not investigating how Fulani herdsmen are going about with AK 47?\n\nI told them in Abuja that you call them Fulani, but we call them Bororo in Oke Ogun and they have been harassing us for the past 25 years; it is not a joke. I said at DAWN three years ago that the 10 local governments of Oke Ogun and three local governments of Ibarapa were under the siege of herdsmen, but nobody listened and I see the invasion of these people as if someone is trying to expand their territory to Yorubaland.\n\nDo you think the problem can be solved through the provision of grazing routes across the country?\n\nHow can anyone legislate on grazing routes? How? How much grazing routes have these people been given in the North? They are now saying we should give grazing routes.\n\nThere is a claim that there are grazing routes across the country.\n\nWho made the grazing routes?\n\nIs there no grazing route in Saki?\n\nLet me tell you, from a very long time ago, they used to take cows from the North to Lagos on foot. That was when they used to pass through here and that is what they are now saying that there used to be grazing routes. Who created the grazing routes? The Fulani herdsmen we grew up to know around here do not graze on anyone\u2019s farm; we lived with them for decades. But these foreign invaders come and start grazing on people\u2019s farms. They go to people\u2019s farms to graze and tell you do you want their cows to die and once you challenge them, they shoot and kill. You see, things are happening and some idiots are sitting down somewhere making case for non-Nigerians. And do they know that if we give grazing grounds to these clowns, tomorrow they will say they own the place. That was what started the problem in Jos till date. That was what started the problem in Agatu.\n\nAnd someone expects that to happen in the South-West? Nobody should give grazing grounds in the South-West.",

Also, that the Federal government\u2019s refusal to name them (bandits/kidnappers) terrorists shows that they \u201dhave no blood in their hearts\u201d.\n\n\u201cThose who govern us are allowing this killing of citizens in their innocency because they have no blood in their hearts,\u201d Kukah said.\n\n\u201cThere is nowhere citizens can be slaughtered in the whole world without the government showing empathy and concern.\n\n\u201cThe continuous barbaric slaughter and murder of our people in their innocency suggest that our beautiful Presidential Villa, National Assembly, government houses, are not evidence of civilization.\n\n\u201cHow did Nigeria come to this tragic situation?

          "text": "There have been countless occasions when Nigerian leaders threw caution to the wind and made heavy, insensitive statements about national issues which generated tension and only heated the polity the more.\n\nSaharaReporters, in taking a look at seven of such occasions, reports that notorious among the leaders known for reckless comments are; President Muhammadu Buhari, former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai, among others.\n\nElection Is Do-Or-Die Affair \u2013 Obasanjo\n\nIn February 2007 as Nigerians were preparing for the third general elections since return to democracy in 1999, the then President Olusegun Obasanjo in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, said the April general elections would be a do-or-die affair for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nBy his reckless statement which already did not give room for opposition\u2019s victory, Obasanjo confessed that his party would do everything to stop some politicians from leading the nation as from May 29.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is left to you to ensure that we elect credible and committed leaders. I commend those of you in the PDP for your efforts so far. You must remain committed to the party. I will campaign. This election is a do-or-die affair for me and the PDP. This coming election is a matter of life and death for the PDP and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThey Do It To Get Money In Their Bank Accounts \u2013 El-Rufai Blasts Southern Kaduna Leaders Over Killings\n\nThe Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai, in August 2020 accused Southern Kaduna leaders of instigating killings in their own communities so as to get money into their bank accounts.\n\nThe governor blamed them for the ongoing crisis, saying, \u201cI have no time for nonsense.\u201d\n\nSouthern Kaduna has continued to experience killings of genocidal proportions in the hands of those mostly identified as Fulani herdsmen.\n\n\u201cI have no time for nonsense. I will not appease criminals. I will not appease idle people who have nothing to do but to raise a spectre of genocide. They do that to get money into their bank accounts and get donations from abroad instead of standing up. Anyone that is moderate; anyone that is promoting peaceful co-existence between various ethnic groups is considered a sell-out,\u201d he had said.\n\nThey Will Return In Bodybags\u2014El-Rufai\n\nAlso, El-Rufai, ahead of the 2019 elections said people from overseas who sought to intervene in the polls would go back in body bags.\n\nEl-Rufai made the comments during a discussion programme on the Nigerian Television Authority when the topic of the international community\u2019s role in elections was raised.\n\nBuhari was seeking a second term in office.\n\nThe discussion about the role of foreign countries in elections was raised on the programme in which reference was made to concerns expressed by the European Union, the United States and Britain over the suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Walter Onnoghen over allegedly breaching asset-declaration rules.\n\n\u201cWe are waiting for the person who will come and intervene. They will go back in body bags because nobody will come to Nigeria and tell us how to run our country,\u201d said El-Rufai.\n\n\u201cWe have got that independence and we are trying to run our country as decently as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nFulani Herdsmen Need To Carry AK-47 Rifle to Defend Themselves \u2013 Bauchi Governor\n\nBauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, has been seen recently as a godfather to the killer Fulani herdsmen going by his open support for them to be armed and to defend themselves if need be, through killings.\n\nOn February 11, 2021, Mohammed said herdsmen need the AK-47 rifles to defend themselves from cattle rustlers and other challenges encountered on the road.\n\n\u201cIt is not his fault, it is the fault of the government and the people,\u201d he had said.\n\nEven if schools close for eight months, I remain constituted authority \u2013 Late Ajimobi\n\nLate former Oyo State Governor, Abiola Ajimobi, had a spell with aggrieved students of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, who staged a protest to his office over the closure of their school in January 2017.\n\nBut the governor felt they were unruly.\n\n\u201cYou are complaining that your school has been shut for eight months. Am I the person who closed your school? If you want to go violent, we are here waiting for you. Whatever you want to do, do it. You are supposed to have little respect for constituted authority, no matter what,\u201d the governor had yelled at the students.\n\nI am Richer Than Osun State \u2013 Tinubu Boasts\n\nA former Governor of Lagos State and national leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu, stirred controversies in September 2018 when he said Osun State is not as wealthy as he his.\n\nTinubu, wanted for many mega fraud cases when he served as governor, boasted in front of the Ataoja of Osogbo, Jimoh Olanipekun, some states do not even have enough money from which a person of his calibre could \u2018steal\u2019.\n\nAddressing the Osogbo monarch, he said, \u201cPeople may be saying that Jagaban, Asiwaju has appointed someone to help him plunder Osun\u2019s funds, and all, and I ask them: \u2018How much exactly do you (Osun State) even have?\u2019\n\n\u201cKabiyesi I don\u2019t want to say this in front of you but, Osun is not as rich as I am, that one would steal. I only want to help this state.\u201d\n\nSouth-East Will Be Treated In Language Of Civil War They Understand \u2013 Buhari\n\nThe most recent and trending of the verbal insults which Nigerian leaders have hurled on the citizens was that of President Muhammadu Buhari on Twitter which ultimately forced the micro blogging platform, Twitter, to delete the tweet.\n\nBuhari had in a tweet on Tuesday stated that his government will get \u201charder\u201d on those hell-bent on destroying the country.\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe President\u2019s Twitter account was reported by Nigerians who understood the last part of the thread as threats against the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its military wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\nMany reminded Buhari of the consequences of the Nigerian Civil War which lasted from 1967 to 1970, stating that such must not be repeated.",

          "title": "Anambra Election: The Master players and their Achilles Heels -NigPilot",
          "text": "Anambra State gubernatorial election is gradually gathering momentum in all party divides, as aspirants in some parties are busy like bees, shopping for primary delegates from wards to state levels while others are still trying to contend with the inherent party difficulties in emerging as flag bearers.\n\nThe political sound tone in some parties seems to be lowered in order to ambush some aspirants that could not be favoured in getting nominations from some major parties like Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA and All Progressives Congress, APC.\n\nSome of the ambush parties which have decorated their party houses and set up some cormorants that will attract wealthy political voyagers are Social Democratic Party, SDP, Labour Party, LP, Zenith Labour Party among others.\n\nMeanwhile, the epic battle in November 6 will definitely have a place in the state historic archive because of the unprecedented composition of aspirants who are exceptionally rich on mundane acquisitions and cerebrally greasy amongst the academia.\n\nThis has quickly sent a reason of no dull moment to the ruling party, APGA, that Anambra Government House has no trademark of monopolistic bargain with any party which the governor of the state and leader of the party, Chief Willie Obiano is not letting it lie low.\n\nThough, unlike previous gubernatorial elections, this is believed not to be a business as usual or a work-over victory of sort but will be most keenly contested.\n\nHowever, other strong opposition parties particularly PDP and APC are boasting that APGA will seize to exist as a party after the forthcoming election, for the fact that leadership of the state will be wrestled out from their only elected governor in the country.\n\nOn this premise, all parties are struggling to achieve this lofty dream by trying to produce sellable and winnable candidates who would be more acceptable to the masses. In the other page, Anambra voters are still waiting with bated breath to cast out their votes on the bases of what you have done to humanity than on vainglory of party affiliations.\n\nHaving this privy to these underlining determinant factors, some aspirants have indirectly embarked on dousing-bruised-spirits campaign for the people who they advertently or inadvertently offended for one reason or the other.\n\nAt this point, they re-enacted the spirit of attending all manner of burials, naming ceremonies, child dedications and a lot more. While some of them usually remember the promise made to the religious denominations especially whenever election is around the corner. To add flesh to this, there is one aspirant or maybe an automatic candidate of a party in the state who always embark on an endless church project in their town whenever he wants the brethren to give him a bulk vote in every election. This has earned him the sobriquet, \u201cBillionaire without a cathedral\u201d.\n\nThe poker before all parties is the expectations of any to produce wrong candidate which others would capitalise as an advantage to score better political point in the coming election. Particularly, all eyes are on APGA to make a wrong choice and that would be their Achilles heels.\n\nNevertheless, here is an analysis of the peculiar problems in the three major parties in the state.\n\nAPGA\n\nObiano\u2019s led administration is working acidly to produce a very formidable successor who will contain the spirit of continuity in his scheme of developmental plans.\n\nThe administration was grossly attacked by the political adversaries who never believed that he has laid down any meaningful development in the state. Some accused him of mismanaging the huge amount left by his predecessor while others feel that he derives pleasure in the spirit of Bacchus which overrides the interest in infrastructural expansion.\n\nBut Gov. Obiano took his blamers to the cleaners when he unmasked the future potentialities in his legacy projects particularly the ongoing International Cargo airport which was recently test ran by three \u2018Air Peace passengers\u2019 planes.\n\nThis opened a new zest among the Anambrarians and it quickly provoked a new belief of an industrious leadership of Obiano\u2019s administration.\n\nTo this end, Governor Obiano, having had deep thought about the kind of person the society expects to replace him and having been a brain child of equitable zoning formula in the party, he declared for power shift to Anambra South. This equally paved way for him to apparently make the choice of the former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Prof. Charles Chukwuma Soludo as most eligible person who may likely be a consensus candidate of APGA for the November 6 election.\n\nThis singular action which was primarily meant for the betterment of the party didn\u2019t go down well with party stakeholders. More so, his action was misconstrued by some aspirants who insisted that there should be a level playing ground for all contestants by conducting primary election.\n\nThe aspirants in the party are, Hon. Chukwuma Umeoji, Prince Nicholas Ukachukwu, Hon. Smart Okafor, Akachukwu Nwankpo, Hon. Okwudili Ezenwankwo and Prof. Charles Soludo.\n\nNevertheless, nobody can presently draw a yawning chasm between the pretenders and real contenders of the party until after the deadline of purchasing of nomination forms for the June 23, party primary.\n\nActually, it was gathered that the main headache against Soludo\u2019s ticket was the Governor\u2019s wife, Mrs Ebelechukwu Obiano who was apparently adherent to the popular assumption that Soludo is too aristocratic or may not be dictated due to his single mindedness laced with academic superiority.\n\nTowing this line, other aspirants like Hon. Umeoji and Hon. Okafor came up bold to deodorize this stench of leadership supremacy of the Governor by challenging this perceived act of favouritism, thus, insisted for an open primary.\n\nMeanwhile, Prince Ikechukwu Reuben Tabansi, chieftain of the party regretted that the only setback for Soludo not to be the next governor would be from in-house problem on the bases of deprivation of party ticket by APGA. He boasted that Soludo has all it takes to win the governorship election because, according to him, \u201cAPGA is a strong force in winning elections in the state because it is a mass movement of both the Igbo elites and the grassroots.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the coast is seemly becoming clearer for Soludo for the fact that Mrs. Obiano has reportedly changed her mixed feelings she had beheld on Soludo\u2019s free walk to the main election.\n\nPresently, the party is working towards harmonisation of interest whereby it would probably necessitate to consensus candidature.\n\nPDP\n\nOne wonders that since ever the existence of PDP in Anambra state for any governorship election, the present web of aspirants has became so unprecedented in the history of Nigeria politics. PDP has always been a top contender when it comes to Anambra politics.

          "text": "Anambra State gubernatorial election is gradually gathering momentum in all party divides, as aspirants in some parties are busy like bees, shopping for primary delegates from wards to state levels while others are still trying to contend with the inherent party difficulties in emerging as flag bearers.\n\nThe political sound tone in some parties seems to be lowered in order to ambush some aspirants that could not be favoured in getting nominations from some major parties like Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA and All Progressives Congress, APC.\n\nSome of the ambush parties which have decorated their party houses and set up some cormorants that will attract wealthy political voyagers are Social Democratic Party, SDP, Labour Party, LP, Zenith Labour Party among others.\n\nMeanwhile, the epic battle in November 6 will definitely have a place in the state historic archive because of the unprecedented composition of aspirants who are exceptionally rich on mundane acquisitions and cerebrally greasy amongst the academia.\n\nThis has quickly sent a reason of no dull moment to the ruling party, APGA, that Anambra Government House has no trademark of monopolistic bargain with any party which the governor of the state and leader of the party, Chief Willie Obiano is not letting it lie low.\n\nThough, unlike previous gubernatorial elections, this is believed not to be a business as usual or a work-over victory of sort but will be most keenly contested.\n\nHowever, other strong opposition parties particularly PDP and APC are boasting that APGA will seize to exist as a party after the forthcoming election, for the fact that leadership of the state will be wrestled out from their only elected governor in the country.\n\nOn this premise, all parties are struggling to achieve this lofty dream by trying to produce sellable and winnable candidates who would be more acceptable to the masses. In the other page, Anambra voters are still waiting with bated breath to cast out their votes on the bases of what you have done to humanity than on vainglory of party affiliations.\n\nHaving this privy to these underlining determinant factors, some aspirants have indirectly embarked on dousing-bruised-spirits campaign for the people who they advertently or inadvertently offended for one reason or the other.\n\nAt this point, they re-enacted the spirit of attending all manner of burials, naming ceremonies, child dedications and a lot more. While some of them usually remember the promise made to the religious denominations especially whenever election is around the corner. To add flesh to this, there is one aspirant or maybe an automatic candidate of a party in the state who always embark on an endless church project in their town whenever he wants the brethren to give him a bulk vote in every election. This has earned him the sobriquet, \u201cBillionaire without a cathedral\u201d.\n\nThe poker before all parties is the expectations of any to produce wrong candidate which others would capitalise as an advantage to score better political point in the coming election. Particularly, all eyes are on APGA to make a wrong choice and that would be their Achilles heels.\n\nNevertheless, here is an analysis of the peculiar problems in the three major parties in the state.\n\nAPGA\n\nObiano\u2019s led administration is working acidly to produce a very formidable successor who will contain the spirit of continuity in his scheme of developmental plans.\n\nThe administration was grossly attacked by the political adversaries who never believed that he has laid down any meaningful development in the state. Some accused him of mismanaging the huge amount left by his predecessor while others feel that he derives pleasure in the spirit of Bacchus which overrides the interest in infrastructural expansion.\n\nBut Gov. Obiano took his blamers to the cleaners when he unmasked the future potentialities in his legacy projects particularly the ongoing International Cargo airport which was recently test ran by three \u2018Air Peace passengers\u2019 planes.\n\nThis opened a new zest among the Anambrarians and it quickly provoked a new belief of an industrious leadership of Obiano\u2019s administration.\n\nTo this end, Governor Obiano, having had deep thought about the kind of person the society expects to replace him and having been a brain child of equitable zoning formula in the party, he declared for power shift to Anambra South. This equally paved way for him to apparently make the choice of the former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Prof. Charles Chukwuma Soludo as most eligible person who may likely be a consensus candidate of APGA for the November 6 election.\n\nThis singular action which was primarily meant for the betterment of the party didn\u2019t go down well with party stakeholders. More so, his action was misconstrued by some aspirants who insisted that there should be a level playing ground for all contestants by conducting primary election.\n\nThe aspirants in the party are, Hon. Chukwuma Umeoji, Prince Nicholas Ukachukwu, Hon. Smart Okafor, Akachukwu Nwankpo, Hon. Okwudili Ezenwankwo and Prof. Charles Soludo.\n\nNevertheless, nobody can presently draw a yawning chasm between the pretenders and real contenders of the party until after the deadline of purchasing of nomination forms for the June 23, party primary.\n\nActually, it was gathered that the main headache against Soludo\u2019s ticket was the Governor\u2019s wife, Mrs Ebelechukwu Obiano who was apparently adherent to the popular assumption that Soludo is too aristocratic or may not be dictated due to his single mindedness laced with academic superiority.\n\nTowing this line, other aspirants like Hon. Umeoji and Hon. Okafor came up bold to deodorize this stench of leadership supremacy of the Governor by challenging this perceived act of favouritism, thus, insisted for an open primary.\n\nMeanwhile, Prince Ikechukwu Reuben Tabansi, chieftain of the party regretted that the only setback for Soludo not to be the next governor would be from in-house problem on the bases of deprivation of party ticket by APGA. He boasted that Soludo has all it takes to win the governorship election because, according to him, \u201cAPGA is a strong force in winning elections in the state because it is a mass movement of both the Igbo elites and the grassroots.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the coast is seemly becoming clearer for Soludo for the fact that Mrs. Obiano has reportedly changed her mixed feelings she had beheld on Soludo\u2019s free walk to the main election.\n\nPresently, the party is working towards harmonisation of interest whereby it would probably necessitate to consensus candidature.\n\nPDP\n\nOne wonders that since ever the existence of PDP in Anambra state for any governorship election, the present web of aspirants has became so unprecedented in the history of Nigeria politics. PDP has always been a top contender when it comes to Anambra politics. However, various internal party problems keep making the party\u2019s shot at power a mirage which includes but not limited to zoning and arriving a consensus candidate.\n\nThe party has 16 aspirants which include three females that have procured their forms.

Maybe I shouldn\u2019t say it yet but I\u2019ve already talked with the man who is likely to become the new coach. It was a very positive conversation,\u201d Lukaku told Belgian broadcaster VTM.\n\nInter will be Inzaghi\u2019s second job in club management. He coached the youth teams at Lazio, where he spent much of his playing career, before taking over the main role in 2016.\n\nHe led Lazio to the last 16 of the Champions League last season, the club\u2019s first appearance in Europe\u2019s premier club competition since 2007-08.\n\n-AFP",
