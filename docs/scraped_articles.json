          "title": "APC congress: Lagos, Osun, Ogun get parallel excos, Sokoto, Yobe, others back consensus candidates",
          "text": "The local government congress of the All Progressives Congress held on Saturday across the 35 states and the Federal Capital Territory, with factional executive members emerging in some states while consensus party officials were elected in others.\n\nDelta State did not participate in the exercise based on a restraining order by the state high court against the party and its leadership.\n\nA dissatisfied group within the Lagos APC \u2014 Lagos4Lagos Movement \u2014 held a parallel congress at locations in the state different from where the mainstream APC led by the state Caretaker Committee Chairman, Tunde Balogun, held its congress.\n\nThe Lagos4Lagos Movement, led by Olajide Adediran, premised its action on alleged impunity, imposition and marginalisation in the party.\n\nAt the factional congress, 27 local government executives and three national delegates emerged. The three national delegates elected by the group are Mr Sunday Ajayi, Dr Kayode Opeifa, and Mr Afolabi Rasheed.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen after the congress, Ajayi, Vice Chairman, Apex Committee of the Lagos4 Lagos Group, said the group was returning the party to the people.\n\nAjayi said the group had conducted the congress as directed by the national body of the party.\n\nHe stated that the group on Friday inaugurated all the ward executives that emerged in its camp at the July 31 ward congress in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur executives are the legitimate executives of the party in the state today. Lagos4Lagos Movement is for everybody. We will run the party according to the wishes of members.\u201d\n\nBut Balogun, the APC caretaker chairman in the state, said he was not aware of the parallel congress.\n\n\u201cIt is news to me; I am just hearing that. The reports I got from those local governments are different from what you are saying,\u201d he told the News Agency of Nigeria.\n\nParallel congresses also held in Osun State as APC members loyal to Governor Adegboyega Oyetola and Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, elected separate part executives in the 27 local government areas of the state.\n\nThe Chairman, The Osun Progressives, a faction backed by Aregbesola, Lowo Adebiyi, had in a statement on Friday said TOP would hold its congress in 28 out of 30 local government areas in the state.\n\nBut sources in TOP said the group eventually shelved the idea of holding a parallel congress in Boripe, where Oyetola hails from, due to security concerns.\n\nIn Osogbo Local Government, for instance, the faction loyal to Oyetola held its congress at Osogbo Federal Constituency Office, Ladsol Area, Osogbo, where new local government executives emerged through a consensus arrangement.\n\nBut the group loyal to Aregbesola in the council area held a parallel congress at Ola Oni Centre, Gbongan Road, Osogbo.\n\nCommenting on the exercise, TOP\u2019s Legal Adviser, Kolapo Alimi, said the group successfully elected executives in 27 out of the 30 local government areas of the state.\n\nHe said the group did not field candidates in Boripe, Ila and Boluwaduro LGAs.\n\n\u201cIt was generally peaceful going by the report. But in Ede North, members of TOP were attacked by hoodlums,\u201d Alimi added.\n\nHe also said the congress committee led by Gbenga Elegbeleye did not observe the exercise held by the group in any local government, but said men of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps and operatives of the Department of State Services were present in most of the venues.\n\nIn a statement by the Press Secretary to the governor, Ismail Omipidan, Oyetola, applauded members of the party for allowing peace to reign.\n\nThe statement also noted that Elegbeleye, while briefing the governor on the exercise, commended the consensus model adopted by the leadership of the party.\n\n\u201cNothing like parallel congress was seen or observed by the committee in any of the visited places or being reported by the committee members observing and supervising the election process in any of the councils in the state,\u201d Elegbeleye was quoted as saying.\n\nAlso, the crisis rocking the APC in Ogun State was further laid bare on Saturday as loyalists of the state Governor, Dapo Abiodun, and his predecessor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, conducted parallel congresses across the 20 local government areas of the state.\n\nBoth factions have been at loggerheads over the control of the structure of the party in the state and had inaugurated factional ward executives elected during the exercise held on July 31.\n\nOn Saturday, the two groups elected their respective local government party executives, through a consensus approach.\n\nOur correspondent, who monitored the exercise in some local government areas, including Abeokuta South and Abeokuta North, observed that it was peaceful.\n\nSunday PUNCH learnt that parallel congresses held in Imeko-Afon, Yewa-South, Yewa-North, Odogboolu, Yewa-South, Ifo and Odeda local government areas.\n\nIn Abeokuta South, while Abiodun loyalists held their congress at the Centenary Hall, Ake, Amosun\u2019s followers conducted theirs at the Panseke Park.\n\nAmosun\u2019s faction held their congress on the premises of the African Church Grammar School, in Abeokuta North, while Abiodun\u2019s loyalists held theirs at Unity High school, Ago-Ika.\n\nAmosun was seen monitoring the congress in Abeokuta South and Abeokuta-North.\n\nAbiodun participated in the exercise at the St. Saviour Anglican Primary, Ikenne \u2013 the venue of the congress in the Ikenne Local Government Area.\n\nBut the chairman of the APC local government congress committee in the state, Wale Ohu, insisted that there was no parallel congress in the state.\n\nOhu said the ward congress results of Abiodun\u2019s faction were upheld and used as the basis for the local government congress.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe exercise in the state is excellent and perfect. We visited the 20 Local Government Areas in the state and we observed orderliness.\u201d\n\nPro-Tinubu group boycotts congress in Ekiti\n\nThe congress held across the 16 council areas of Ekiti State on Saturday witnessed a large turnout of party members.\n\nBut members of South-West Agenda for Asiwaju 2023, a group within the APC rooting for the presidential bid of a former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, said they did not participate in the congress since they had approached the Federal High Court to challenge the ward congress.\n\nSWAGA Secretary in the state, Femi Adeleye, said, \u201cIn our petition, we protested the ward congress which did not hold in Ekiti State, but it seems the national leadership of the APC is not ready to listen to the issues raised.\n\n\u201cWithout properly constituted ward executives, there cannot be valid LG congress. So, what they claimed they did today (Saturday) is illegal and that is the position of law.\u201d\n\nBut the Congress Committee Secretary, Femi Akindele, said SWAGA members\u2019 decision to challenge the ward congress neither affected the LG congress nor invalidated its outcome.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe appeal to our people to exhaust internal mechanisms before resorting to court. The process is still ongoing and the party has not received any court order stopping us from doing what the party is constitutionally empowered to do.\u201d\n\nConsensus executives emerge in Ondo, Yobe, Sokoto, others\n\nMeanwhile, there were unanimous decisions in the election of party officials during the local government congress in Ondo, Yobe, Sokoto, Benue and Gombe states as well as the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\nOne of our correspondents, who monitored the exercise in some of the LGAs of Ondo State, observed that members of the executive were chosen through consensus. There are 18 LGAs in the state.\n\nThe acting Chairman of the party in the state, Mr Ade Adetimehin, commended the party members for playing the game according to the rules, adding that \u201cthe congress went on peacefully.\u201d\n\nThe Sokoto State chapter of the APC also adopted consensus method for its congress across the 23 LGAs, APC Chairman in the state, Alhaji Sadiq Achida, told NAN.\n\nAchida said, \u201cThe decision was taken unanimously after several meetings of stakeholders in the state, following the directive from the national headquarters on the adoption of consensus candidates. We have chosen the consensus option in order to sustain our unity in Sokoto to maintain our popularity as a party.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Yobe State Deputy Governor, Alhaji Idi Gubana, said the party agreed to adopt consensus during its local government congress on Saturday.\n\nGubana, in a statement by his Press Secretary, Alhaji Hussaini Mai-Sule, said the decision to adopt consensus was reached at a stakeholders\u2019 meeting he presided in Damaturu, the state capital.\n\nSunday PUNCH also gathered that the party opted for consensus to elect party officials in Benue State.\n\nOne of our correspondents, however, learnt that the lingering crisis in the Gboko Local Government Area of the state where there were reports of suspension and counter-suspension of members during the party registration exercise a few months ago played out on Saturday.\n\nAlso, APC supporters in five out of the six area councils that make up the FCT on Saturday elected local government party officials by consensus. The council areas are Bwari, Abaji, Gwawalada, Kuje and Kwali.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Adeola Badru, Ibadan\n\nThe Chairman of the Congress Committee of the All Progressives Party, APC, Hillary Amodu, has appealed to all gladiators within the party to eschew bitterness and work together to enhance unity and harmony among themselves for the success of the party at the next general election.\n\nAmodu gave this admonition in his address at a stakeholders\u2019 meeting of the party in the state, held on Friday evening at the party\u2019s new state secretariat, Oke-Ado, Ibadan.\n\nThe meeting was in preparation for the congress expected to produce the next set of party executive committee members in the 33 local government areas of the state.\n\nHis words: \u201cMy committee is not oblivious of the fact that our great party is currently in opposition in the state and this necessitates the need for all genuine stakeholders to work together with a view to helping APC to reclaim power in 2023. This goal cannot be realised on a platter of gold as we must all bury our differences and unite for this noble cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a team of party faithful from outside the state who would like to be part of history by facilitating the process of returning the APC to power, we shall do everything possible to discharge our duties with all sense of responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are determined to conduct free, fair and credible local government Congress across the state as we believe that this would form a threshold for a stronger, more united and formidable party capable of winning future elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsequently, we solicit the cooperation and support of every stakeholder in this meeting to achieve the best results tomorrow (Saturday) and in subsequent exercises. As party leaders, you owe party faithful a duty of showing good examples by encouraging peace and harmony regardless of our individual interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe appeal to you all to toe the path of harmonization with a viewing to produce consensus executive committee lists for the 33 local government areas,\u201d Amodu stated.\n\nIn his remarks, the Caretaker Chairman of Oyo APC, Chief Akin Oke, commended all the stakeholders of the party who, according to him, had done so much to assist the party in the rebuilding process embarked upon by his caretaker committee team following the loss of the gubernatorial election in 2019.\n\n\u201cThe whole world knows we are Progressives and going by the current situation of things in our dear state, APC is being awaited to come back to power in 2023. The leadership of the party under my watch has remained resolute in the resolve to rebuild and reposition the party and many discerning people can attest to this fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cI therefore urge you to go back to your respective local government areas and be part of a peaceful process aimed at producing executive committee members who would help facilitate the dream of a stronger and more cohesive APC in the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have always been fair and just in my dealings as your chairman since I came on board and it is my desire that our Progressive party is returned to power in 2023,\u201d Oke submitted.\n\nParty leaders and stalwarts who were present at the meeting include; Chief Iyiola Oladokun, Sen.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Bashir Bello, KANO\n\nDespite the consensus arrangement adopted by the leadership of the ruling party All Progressive Congress, APC in Kano, some party supporters have snubbed the arrangement and went ahead to conduct congresses in some local government areas of the state.\n\nOur correspondent gathered that congresses were held in Local Governments such as Kano Municipal, Dawakin Tofa, Rimingado and Tofa among others.\n\nThe party had earlier adopted a consensus arrangement during its stakeholder\u2019s meeting in the state.\n\nAddressing newsmen at Tofa Local Government after the conduct of the congress, the member representing Dawakin Tofa and Rimingado Federal Constituency, Tijjani Abdulkadir Jobe kicked against the consensus arrangement and opted for the conduct of Congress which he described as \u201cdemocratic election\u201d.\n\nJobe said, \u201cAPC local Government Congress was conducted peacefully in Tofa local Government, that\u2019s my constituent, I voted amidst party members and We thank God it was peaceful, Mahbu Liman as chairman, and Mukhtar Abdullahi tofa as secretary and other 25 party leaders\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t hold party election in your room or in government-owned building (Govt House). You have to go back to the people, let them decide what they want. Every member of the party has to be part of the system. Once you ask people not to participate, that means we do not have democracy. And what we have been championing is the course of democracy.\n\n\u201cSo what we are doing is to let the people decide for themselves and not what we want. So what we have done is to allow the people to decide for all of us and with that we know we are on sound footing.\n\n\u201cWhat we did was not an affirmation but the election,\u201d Jobe said.\n\nAlso reacting, the member representing Kano Municipal Federal Constituency, Sha\u2019aban Sharada said a similar election took place across all the 44 local government areas.\n\n\u201cI am happy with the fact that the people came out en masse to exercise their rights because he was sure that the election took place in all the 44 LGAs. Because party members under the Buhari Support Organization, BSO led by Alhaji Shehu Dalhatu purchase the forms and were allowed to exercise their rights.\n\n\u201cWe would not succumb to situation where few clique of people would now decide for the majority of the party members,\u201d Sha\u2019aban said.\n\nWhen contacted, the Secretary of the party in the state, Zakari Sarina said there was no election in the state.\n\nHe said \u201cit was agreed by the stakeholders last week presided over by the Governor to adopt consensus arrangement.\n\n\u201cAs far as the party (caretaker committee) is concerned, no local government held an election. Even the representatives from the National headquarters said they went to Tofa, Municipal, Sumaila and about seven local governments and they witnessed that (affirmation).\n\n\u201cNobody held any gathering in the name of election. If there is anyone, we will know,\u201d Sarina however stated.",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Bashir Bello, KANO\n\nGovernor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State on Saturday disclosed plans by the state government to engage expatriates to manage the newly established Aliko Dangote Utral Modern Skills acquisition centre in the state.\n\nGanduje disclosed this when he led the Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo and his entourage to inspect the centre and other developmental projects across the state.\n\nThe Governor who hinted that the expatriates would be employed from Europe said he doesn\u2019t care about what critics would say about the decision.\n\nHe further gave reasons to engage the services of the expatriates to ensure the sustainability of the centre noting that it would not be business as usual.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cA situation where such centres are built and few years after it becomes moribund. That would not be the case here. We have considered the sustainability of the centre because we want to prevent damages to facilities after some years. That is why we are engaging trusted foreign experts to manage the place. I know some people will criticise me for bringing experts from Europe when we have many Nigerians that can do the job. I don\u2019t care because all I want is a solid foundation.\n\n\u201cThe genesis of the centre was borne out of a passion to reduce growing unemployment in Kano. By the virtue of our population, there is every likelihood of building a liability population. so the centre was established to create a resourceful and asset-based population.\n\n\u201cHence, the establishment is born out of calculated research and not by error. We carefully identified three special skills where our youth can easily connect and build self-reliance,\u201d Ganduje stated.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chief of Naval Staff Vice, Admiral Awwal Gambo expressed optimism that the centre will bridge the gap of lack of technical training and capacity building.\n\nHe added that the centre will create job opportunities and self-reliance for the growing population of Kano State\n\nThe Naval Chief also used the occasion to disclose plans by the Navy to establish Naval Logistics College as part of their operational base in Kano State.\n\n\u201cI made bold to say that this school of acquisition centre has addressed one of my dreams. I know while we are growing up here we used to have a skill acquisition centre. I don\u2019t know where is it now but I know it\u2019s dead. That is why I say this Dangote centre will address that challenge of self-employment considering the population of Kano state.\n\n\u201cThe government has technically also addressed the challenge of security because the youth will be kept busy here and acquire skills for self-employment.\n\n\u201cThe Navy is already on the ground in Kano and Insha Allah we are going to establish logistic college here. I have asked the staff officer logistic command to take full cognisance because there is a lot we can learn and a lot the centre can learn from us,\u201d Vice Admiral Gambo stated.",

The primary aim of the academy is to raise highly productive youth that will be employable in any sector of the economy.\u201d\n\nBemoaning the rate of unemployment in the country, Akintayo revealed that the situation can be addressed through adequate training of job seekers.\n\n\u201cWe need to give our graduates the necessary training that will position them to be either self-employed or meet the expectations of the modern-day job market. Nigeria is in a complex situation where we are experiencing hybrid challenges. We have graduates who are not actually well prepared for the emerging labour market demands.\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting further, he reiterated that no society can grow with low productivity. \u201cMost curriculum operated by higher institutions have not helped in solving the current problems.\n\nThose curricula are not in tandem with the real-life issues we need to solve as a nation, so our graduates will need to go through another process of unlearning what they have learned\u201d he concluded.\n\nAt the event, Faith Adebisi Adedoyin of Doyenne Apparel was presented with a cheque of one million naira for winning the Stephen Akintayo Challenge, a social media competition aimed at supporting young entrepreneurs.",

He tells me the road to ply in Lagos so that I can bypass hold up, most of you here know how terrible Lagos traffic is. Fortunately for me, I don\u2019t experience it because God knows a better route.\n\n\u201cHowever, something happened that made him stop communicating with me. I used to be an interpreter to the general overseer or general superintendent like we call it those days. My father in the Lord then just took a special interest in my interpretation. When other pastors in the church then realised that the general overseer liked my interpretation, they stopped calling me to interpret for them and left me alone for the general overseer.\n\n\u201cI became full of myself and started bouncing around as interpreter to the general overseer but an incident happened one day. We had a program and we invited a guest minister to preach. He made a mistake that day, you may be surprised at my definition of a mistake. The mistake was that he asked me to interpret for himself. I was really angry in my spirit but I couldn\u2019t object because it was too late.\n\n\u201cI stood up and interpreted for him but in my heart, I was murmuring, I said \u2018How could you call me a whole interpreter to the general overseer to interpret for you\u2019. Only if he knew what was in my mind, he would have called another person to interpret that very day.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the programme, I was on my way home and God spoke, he said \u2018Son, you are now too big to interpret to a man of God other than the general overseer?\u201d. After the conversation, God stopped speaking to me, I didn\u2019t hear His voice again.\n\n\u201cI suffered, that whole period was like hell, I became a victim of the traffic in Lagos.\u201d",
          "summary": "The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, says he had his first Baptism of fire when he stopped hearing the voice of his creator.\nAdeboye recounted how he allowed his ego and pride made God avoid talking to him shortly after he got born again.\nHe tells me the road to ply in Lagos so that I can bypass hold up, most of you here know how terrible Lagos traffic is.\nI used to be an interpreter to the general overseer or general superintendent like we call it those days.\nAfter the conversation, God stopped speaking to me, I didn\u2019t hear His voice again.",

Unfortunately, the unarmed, peaceful and defenseless locals are now at the receiving end.\n\n\u201cBy a reliable records, no fewer than fifteen people have gruesomely been murdered by the marauding criminals.

          "text": "By Philip Nwosu\n\nThe Consul General of Brazil to Nigeria, Ambassador Francisco Carlos Soares Luz, has called for more cooperation between the Nigerian Navy and his country\u2019s navy to enable both countries give a bite to the fight against piracy.\n\nAccording to Ambassador Luz, fighting piracy in the Gulf of Guinea is important, as the success in the fight will improve the economy of both coastal states and land lock countries.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the end, the activities of piracy will raise the cost of products for everyone, especially the landlocked countries. They will have to pay more for those things. Brazil and Nigeria share the Atlantic Ocean as a border. So having our border safe is important for everyone and I think no cost is too expensive to keep the Atlantic Ocean safe.\u201d\n\nAmbassador Luz, who spoke during the visit of the crew of the Brazilian Navy Ship (BNS) Independencia to the Western Naval Command in Lagos, said: \u201cThis kind of operations is what we should do often. It will bring our countries together and our relationship has shown the reality in Nigeria and Brazil navies that we have so much in common and we must ensure we make the relationship the same.\u201d\n\nAlso the Flag Officer Commanding (FOC), Western Naval Command, Rear Admiral. Jason Gbassa said that a recent report of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) indicates skeletal activities in the operations of pirates within the Gulf of Guinea, expressing the readiness of the Nigerian Navy to contain them.\n\nAdmiral Gbassa, who was represented by the Chief Staff Officer of the Command, Rear Admiral Habila Zakaria, said the force had engaged pirates in the Gulf of Guinea that the achievement of the navy in that area was possible because of Nigerian Navy\u2019s collaboration with other foreign navies in conducting sea exercises that ultimately improved security at the area.\n\nAccording to the FOC, the Brazilian Naval Ship (BNS) Independencia also visited the country for a maritime interdiction mission code named \u2018GUNEX\u2019 in the Gulf of Guinea. He added: \u201cBy and large, the Nigerian Navy has done much to ensure that the maritime environment is deprived of any form of illegalities.\n\nGbassa said that Nigeria and Brazil had come a long way and that both countries had a lot of bilateral agreements, one of which was in defence.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "Anti-open grazing law: Miyetti Allah mocks southern govs",
          "text": "By Vincent Kalu, Lukman Olabiyi, Lagos; Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu; George Onyejiuwa, Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri; Judex Okoro, Calabar; Paul Osuyi, Asaba; Lateef Dada, Osogbo; Tony Osauzo, Benin, Obinna Odogwu, Awka and Joe Effiong, Uyo\n\nThe Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore has mocked the17 Southern Governors for their failure to meet the September 1 deadline they set for themselves to enact and begin to implement the anti-open grazing laws throughout Southern Nigeria. Speaking to Saturday Sun on the issue, the National President the group, Abdullahi Bodejo said that his members knew that the Southern governors would not come together to speak with one voice on the matter when it comes to implemenatiaton. Bodejo who accused them of coming together for ulterior motive, 2023 politics and an agenda to take over Fulani cattle-rearing business, threatened to drag the states that have enacted such laws to court.\n\nBut insisting that their collective will to do so is still on course, aides and spokesmen of some of the 17 Southern governors that took the collective decision at their Asaba meeting to enact a law banning open grazing of cattle across the states that fall under the zone, have opened up on why the states couldn\u2019t meet the September 1, 2021 deadline set for the implementation.\n\nOf the 17, only six, namely, Abia, Ogun, Oyo, Ekiti, Ebonyi, Imo, and Enugu have in place an anti-open grazing law. In fact, Enugu just passed its own on September 2, less than 24 hours after the expiration of the deadline. Though no official statement was issued as to why the state missed the deadline, a privileged source from the State Assembly attributed the delay to the magnitude of harm open grazing had caused the state. The House, he said, was careful to make extensive consultations with all stakeholders to ensure that the bill meet the required goal for the good of all. The source noted that what was important \u201cis that the bill has been passed and I know Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi will not waste time in signing it into law.\u201d\n\nFive states, namely Rivers, Delta, Osun, Ondo, Bayelsa and Akwa Ibom are in the process of complying. But some of the states like Anambra, Lagos, Imo, Edo, and Cross River who were reported earlier as ignoring the agreement has come out to deny the report.\n\nIn Imo, the State Commissioner for Justice and Attorney-General, Mr Cyprain Akaolise insisted that there was no need to come up with another anti-open grazing law as the state already has one banning open grazing of cattle in restricted areas of the state, including the state capital. This, he explained, is much better than the kind being proposed by the southern governors.\n\nAccording to him, Imo State Law No. 9 of 2006 signed by Chief Achike Udenwa, former Governor of Imo State on 19th January 2007 did not call for total ban but prohibition of cattle grazing in restricted areas of the state. \u201cA cattle herder cannot take his cattle into cultivated land within Imo State,\u201d he said. \u201cSo but the herdsmen could do their grazing in the forest. The other states should copy our own law.\u201d\n\nLike Imo, Cross Rivers State too claims to have passed its own law in 2017, four years before the Southern Governors Forum came up with the resolution at the Asaba meeting. Speaking on the matter, the former Speaker of Cross River House of Assembly, Rt Hon William Jonah Eteng, disclosed that the state was one of the earliest to pass law against open grazing.\n\nGaul, Speaker between 2015 and 2019, however noted that the law was not, and has not been assented to by Governor Ben Ayade. According to him, the lawmakers went for the traditional ranching because they don\u2019t have empty land neither does their culture permit movement of cattle from one place to another because the people engage in arable cropping of vassals, yams, cocoyam and maize.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe don\u2019t support open grazing in our state. But if it is the culture in the North to move cattle around, no problem. The President under our present constitution does not have land to give anybody because with the 1975 Land Use Act, the lands are under the management of state governors.\n\nIn Akwa Ibom, the Executive is yet to send the bill to the State House of Assembly.\n\nChief Whip of Osun State House of Assembly, Hon. Lekan Olatunji, also claimed that the legislators have passed the bill but added that the Governor Adegboyega Oyetola is yet to sign it. \u201cWe recently passed a bill to regulate animal grazing and establishment of cattle ranches in the state,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just awaiting the Governor\u2019s consent and I\u2019m sure that will be done very soon.\u201d\n\nHowever, it was gathered that the bill was not forwarded to the office of the governor till he travelled out recently. But speaking on the matter, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor, Ismail Omipidan assured that the governor would surely sign the bill if it is on his table. He added that the governor just returned to the state on Wednesday, September 1.\n\nIn Lagos, the State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso, assured that very soon, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu will sign into law the Anti-open grazing Bill which he said, was already before the state House of Assembly for consideration.\n\nNoting that the executive arm of government had deliberated on the bill and deemed it worthy before passing it to the State House of Assembly to do the needful, he added that the moment the House of Assembly passed the bill, the governor would append his signature to make it law in the state.\n\nBut investigation by Saturday Sun shows that the bill is being worked on in both Edo and Delta States. The Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, Hon. Marcus Onobun, who spoke on the matter, attributed the delay to the recess embarked upon by the members while assuring that the bill will soon be passed as it is being worked on. On their own part, the Delta State Commissioner for Information, Charles Aniagwu, assured that the Governor Ifeanyi Okowa-led administration would ensure that the bill is implemented as a step towards promoting healthy and harmonious living among farmers and herders.\n\n\u201cNo state can even start implementation immediately because after passing the bill and assenting to it, you need to give people time to adjust. You need to give the herders time to either return their cattle or build ranches,\u201d he said. \u201cFor now in Delta, we are still going to be seeing cattle on the streets because the law has not been enacted and we have not started implementation.\u201d\n\nHe attributed the delay in passing the law to the dissolution of the State Executive Council shortly after the decision to ban open grazing was taken by the southern governors. But then he insisted that the September 1, 2021 deadline was not for the implementation of the ban but for the passage of the bill and enactment of the law.\n\nOf the lot, Anambra may end up as one of the states that will not implement the decision, as there is no indication to that effect. The State Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment in the state, C. Don Adinuba, when contacted, simply told Saturday Sun that he did not participate in the Asaba meeting; and that his principal, Governor Willie Obiano, has not briefed him on his position on the matter.\n\nA member of the state House of Assembly representing Nnewi North Constituency, Nonso Okafor, who claimed to have been planning to move a motion in that regard, however, noted that the plan did not materialise before they went on their annual recess.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "By John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nKaduna state governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, lost his polling unit to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Saturday\u2019s Local government elections .\n\nAnnouncing the results for the El-Rufai\u2019s Angwan Sarki 001 polling unit, the Presiding Officer, Mohammed Sani said, in the Chairmanship election, the PDP scored 86 votes while the APC got 62 votes.\n\nSani said in the councillorship election, the PDP scored 100 votes while the APC recorded 53 votes.\n\nThe governor had earlier in an interview after casting his vote, expressed disappointment about the low turnout of voters in the council polls.\n\n\u201cWhat worries me is that I noticed that people didn\u2019t turn out much,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor said there were challenges in some polling units as wrong machines were given.\n\n\u201cI know that in many polling units, there were challenges with the Electronic Voting Machines.\n\n\u201cSome machines were taken to the wrong polling units, so they had to be changed. So people who came out early to vote, thought that the voting had not started,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on the use of Electronic Voting Machines for the elections, El-Rufai said \u201ctechnology is the key to minimising cheating in elections and unless we remove cheating in elections, we will never have credible leaders, we will never have accountable leaders and this is why we are committed to this.\u201d\n\nHe said there has been a significant improvement on the machines compared to the ones used in the 2018 LG polls.\n\nEl-Rufai said, the improved voting machine being used for the elections makes it nearly impossible to do multiple voting which, according to him, \u201chappened a lot in 2018.\u201d\n\nHe said the voting machine was activated with voting card, explaining that, \u201conce you come and you are accredited that this is your polling unit, you go to the voting machine, you place your voter\u2019s card, it opens the machine for you, you vote.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe whole process takes less than 15 seconds. So it is very quick, very efficient and you see your ballot paper being printed so that the ballot papers can be counted\u2026\n\n\u201cSo we are very happy with the improvement and we are pleased that this time it will be extremely difficult for anyone to rig these elections.\n\nHe explained further that, \u201cthe machines also transmit the results at the end of voting to a server as well as a back up at a USB as well as print copies for all parties and all the security agencies, so it is very difficult to alter anything.\u201d\n\nThe governor said his administration was committed to free and fair elections in Kaduna.\n\n\u201cAs I said several times, we are not going to behave like other parties or other state governments where the ruling parties win everything. \u201cWe will allow the people of Kaduna state to elect who they want, we do not have to win everywhere.\n\n\u201cWe know that we have work for the people of Kaduna state, we know that they can see the food print of the government and local government everywhere, the APC government and we are confident that all reasonable minded and fair minded people will vote for our party and our candidates because they know that we are committed the welfare of the people.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe in cheating, we don\u2019t believe in rigging elections, but we also do not believe that others should cheat us.\n\n\u201cThis is why we encourage SIECOM to come up with a very improved, full proof system and I am happy that they have done that.\n\n\u201cWhat we have shown in Kaduna is that it is possible to do this across Nigeria and I think INEC is looking at the experiment in Kaduna very closely.\n\n\u201cThey were observers in 2018 and they had sent a team to look at what we are doing in 2021.\n\nOur correspondence who visited some polling units in Kaduna South and Kaduna North LGAs, noted the general apathy among residents.\n\nIn Gidan Hakimi, Kakuri polling unit, Kaduna South LGA, both the agents of the APC and the PDP, confirmed that people did not come out to vote.\n\n\u201cI think that people didn\u2019t come out to vote because of the general hardship in the country\u201d, one of the party agents said.\n\nAlso at the Abubakar Kigo LEA Primary School polling unit, Kaduna North LGA, election officials were idle as people did not turn out.\n\nMeanwhile the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has raised the alarm over the conduct of the elections, alleging that the voting machines were programmed to accept and prints votes for the APC only.\n\nAddressing newsmen at the NUJ Press Centre on Saturday in Kaduna, spokesman of the state chapter of the party, Abraham Catoh, alleged that machines in some polling units were only printing results for the APC.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Gbasam of the Degema Judicial Division vacation court, Rivers State had, few days back, granted an interim injunction restraining Secondus from parading himself as chairman and member of the PDP, sequel to the consideration of an ex parte application filed by two members of the party against Secondus and the PDP.\n\nBut last Thursday, Justice Nusirat Umar of the Kebbi State High Court ordered Secondus to return to his position, saying she was satisfied after reading the affidavit of the respondents that an interim order should be granted on the purported suspension of Secondus pending the determination of the case.\n\nBased on the favourable court ruling, Secondus resumed on August 27, only for another court in Calabar, Cross River State, to restrain him from parading himself as the National Chairman of the party.\n\nKwankwaso, who spoke on the PDP crisis yesterday in an interview with BBC Hausa, said the crisis \u201cis heightened by those who are after leadership of the party.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cNow, the strength of the party has reduced, and in the end, what will happen is that it will tear us apart.\n\n\u201cYou see, the result will not help us, since we do not have a president and we do not have many governors.\n\n\u201cPeople like me have nothing to do with the crisis. I\u2019m after what will bring development to people; every good leader should focus on that.\n\n\u201cThe party chairman has only one month left. I think it\u2019s better to wait so that we can emerge stronger.\n\n\u201cBut the crisis is heightened by those who are after leadership. They are not doing it for the betterment of their people.\u201d\n\nThe opposition party has lost several key members to the All Progressives Congress (APC) as a result of its internal crisis.\n\nUche Secondus, the embattled National Chairman of the PDP, has been under increased pressure to resign from office.\n\nFollowing the court ruling in Calabar restraining him from parading himself as the national chairman of the party PDP\u2019s national working committee (NWC) named Akinwonmi, the National Deputy Chairman (South), as the acting chairman.\n\n\u2018God Brought Ganduje and I Together\u2019\n\nKwankwaso also spoke of his recent encounter with his successor in Kano State, Abdullahi Ganduje, at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja.\n\nThe former governor said he had spent hours in the departure hall when he received information that Ganduje was also on his way to the airport.\n\n\u201cI said it\u2019s okay, God has brought us all together. The place is like a park or station. Nobody can ask someone to come or not to. So he came and we greeted each other.\n\n\u201cWe boarded the same plane and landed at the Kano Airport. I sat on the front seat, so I came out first.

          "text": "Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nWith the dusts raised by the legal challenges to the status of Mai Mala Buni as the interim Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) yet to settle, coupled with the ward congresses of the party that ended in crisis in some states still generating controversy, the APC is today going ahead with local government congresses.\n\nA High Court sitting in Asaba had restrained Buni and other members of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee from acting or parading themselves as such until the determination of a substantive suit before the court.\n\nThe trial court by Justice Onome Marshal Umukoro, also put on hold the local government congress scheduled for Saturday, September 4, 2021 in Delta State.\n\nBut Buni, in a statement issued by his Director General of Press, Mamman Mohammed, on Thursday insisted that he was never restrained by the High Court order in Delta State.\n\nHe added that the restriction of the forthcoming local government congresses was limited to Delta State and did not affect other states.\n\nBuni, Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC, noted that some mischief makers, who never wished the party well, had continued to misrepresent the facts without having access to the court ruling.\n\nThe crisis generated by the judgement of the Supreme Court in the Ondo governorship election petition, has also left the APC in tatters.\n\nThe split judgment of four against three by the seven member Supreme Court justices, which sat on the Ondo governorship election petition, had contended that the reason it did not sack Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of the state, was because the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its governorship candidate in the October 10, 2020 election, Eyitayo Jegede, failed to join Mai Mala Buni, even when the issues revolved around him.\n\nMany stakeholders of the APC argue that all congresses be suspended, because holding such under the leadership of Buni, portend serious problem for the party, by the time the consequences begin to manifest before and after the 2023 polls.\n\nThe Supreme Court judgement apparently questioned Buni\u2019s continued stay, both as national chairman of the party and governor of Yobe State.\n\nSection 183 of the 1999 constitution unequivocally forbids a sitting governor from combining his office with any other job, both as executive positions, same as Article 17 (iv) of the APC constitution.\n\nNotwithstanding objections to the continuation of the APC congresses because of the status of Buni, the Buni-led interim leadership of the party insisted that today\u2019s congresses in the local governments should go ahead as planned.\n\nBuni, in a statement yesterday, called on the officials handling the local government congresses across the country to just and fair to all aspirants.\n\nBuni in the statement issued by his Director General of Press and Media, Mr. Mamman Mohammed also urged members of the party to conduct themselves peacefully.\n\nHe said the Congress \u201cis a family affair that should be executed without rancour in the interest of the party. We should all abide by the rules governing the election to remain a role model to other political parties.\u201d\n\nBuni added: \u201cThe leadership of the party has substantially complied with the dictates of the party constitution to promote internal democracy for the success of the congresses.\u201d\n\nThe chairman charged the aspirants to respect the rule of the game and embrace the spirit of sportsmanship in the outcome of the Congress.\n\nHe commended the enthusiasm demonstrated by members of the party to elect leaders at the local government level.\n\nThe Chairman assured that the party would address all anomalies that were employed to manipulate the election results.\n\nHe called on aggrieved members to channel their complaints through the constituted channels to seek redress.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "With Awabah, Tunji Andrews wants to make pensions as popular as banking",
          "text": "Between November and December 2020, Tunji Andrews co-piloted a project to help informal workers save for the future. Those efforts culminated in the January rollout of Awabah, a digital platform that provides micro pension access to self-employed Nigerians and informal workers.\n\n\u201cMany people in Nigeria and Africa do day-to-day financial transactions in markets but don\u2019t have access to the benefits that the formal financial system offers,\u201d Andrews told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cSo when I wanted to get into the fintech space, it had to be something that would drive financial inclusion on a very strong basis.\u201d\n\nA flexible, \u20a6500 plan\n\nCo-founded with Tina Ajishebiyawo and Gboyega Olatunde, Awabah Nigeria automates micro-pensions and target-savings for self-employed Nigerians and workers in the informal economy. An understanding of the unique characteristics of its target market has been key to Awabah\u2019s operations and ensuring last-mile delivery.\n\nLower-income members of the informal economy can be difficult to capture and most engage in local cooperatives and market associations. Awabah has leaned heavily on town hall meetings to reach these people in large numbers, introducing its product via group presentations and one-on-one sessions.\n\nAfter onboarding them, the company uses either its web platform or a network of local banking agents to continue taking collections from, educating, and further engaging with contributors.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIncome levels vary in the informal sector. Thus, Andrews explains that contributors with as little as \u20a6500 can start a micro-pensions account. Subsequent amounts contributed are based on an individual\u2019s capacity.\n\nContributions are also flexible. Taking into account the irregular cash flow of informal workers, they can be made daily, weekly, monthly, or even quarterly, similar to local savings groups (popularly known as Ajo or Esusu).\n\nDue to the constant need for cash flow in the informal sector, users have the option of withdrawing up to 40% of their savings at any point after the initial 3 months of contributions. Whenever someone deposits \u20a61,000, for instance, \u20a6600 is locked in the retirement account while the rest goes into the customer\u2019s mobile wallet as contingent savings.\n\n\u201cThey always come and ask for their 40% after the first three months as a way of testing the product, and we make sure that they get it as quickly as possible,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cOnce they get their money back and see alerts every time they put in their \u20a6500, they\u2019re able to test the system.\u201d\n\nAwabah has achieved impressive results within months of operation, having onboarded more than 5,000 customers so far. It makes money primarily by earning a commission on every contribution made.\n\nAwabah Nigeria Co-founder, Tunji Andrews.\n\nExtending pensions to the informal economy\n\nIn Nigeria, a good number of elderly parents are financially dependent on their children \u2013 partly because societal norms deem it necessary for children to care for aging parents; and also because there is an evident lack of working systems for retirement savings.\n\nEven where pension schemes are available, they often only cover people who are formally employed. Nigeria has a large informal workforce and about 88% of the entire labour force without pensions is from the informal economy. The result? A large group of citizens becomes financially vulnerable as they get older.\n\nWorse still is that relatively young Nigerians currently dominate the labour force and the lack of retirement savings means they are susceptible to living below the poverty line in their old age.\n\nNigeria\u2019s National Pension Commission (PenCom) has a target of growing the country\u2019s pension coverage to 30% of the entire labour force \u2013 formal and informal \u2013 by 2024. As of the first quarter of this year, the figure stood at 12%.\n\nA provision in the Pension Reform Act of 2014 ushered in a new micro-pension plan, effectively opening the door for the informal economy to participate in the national Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). Awabah\u2019s operation is backed by this provision.\n\nThe micro pension scheme was formally introduced in 2019 but is yet to gain traction. Thus, Andrews has made it his and Awabah\u2019s mission to make the services available to those in the informal sector and whose employers are not legally required to deduct and remit pension.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard about the new micro pension scheme two years ago, I was excited as I had been thinking about pensions. But there weren\u2019t a lot of conversations and awareness about it. So for me, it was a no-brainer,\u201d he said.\n\nExpanding Awabah\n\nAwabah is less than a year old and has had to deal with manpower and logistics challenges. Still, Andrews has big ambitions.\n\nGoing forward, the startup plans to leverage the penetration of mobile phones in Nigeria to reach even a wider audience, starting with the planned launch of a USSD option.\n\nThrough a shortcode, existing and potential customers will be able to learn about and sign up to Awabah, as well as get financial literacy lessons in local languages. For those who have smartphones, Awabah will engage them via WhatsApp.\n\nThe Awabah team.\n\nThe startup raised $200,000 from early-stage angel investors ODBA and Co Ventures and Correlation Capital in July, which helped it expand into Ibadan. Awabah also recently gained acceptance into the Techstars London accelerator programme, where it will get some funding.\n\nAndrews reveals that a new fundraising round is in the works, which will help fund a larger expansion. Over the next few months, the startup has plans to enter into five more Nigerian cities. It is also mulling an expansion into Ghana.\n\n\u201cThe bigger goal is to create a larger awareness of micro pensions in Africa,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cWe want pensions to be popular as banking and insurance are.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Awabah has partnerships with three Pension Fund Administrators, including Leadway Pensure, which holds the PenCom license under which it operates; a microfinance bank via which it provides mobile wallets; as well as two agent banking networks.\n\nAndrews aims to expand the list of partner organisations and, in the long term, plans to push conversations with Nigeria\u2019s pensions regulator on the possibility of issuing micro pension licenses for small players like Awabah.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we have a one-size-fits-all pension license, unlike Ghana where there\u2019s a three-tier system,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThe lack of micro pension licenses can be a drawback as we believe we are best positioned to drive the product. But it\u2019s still very early days.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "Nigerian banks sit on an inventory of consumer data that fintech startups in the country can only dream of.\n\nWith more than 70 million active bank customers in Nigeria, banks possess valuable big data, consisting of demographic, personal, and professional information of clients as well as transaction history, consumption patterns, and movements.\n\nThere\u2019s so much that can be done with this data. For instance, lenders can segment their client base to offer personalised savings or loan offers. The data can also be deployed in targeting Nigeria\u2019s huge unbanked population with customised services, based on similar profiles to existing clients.\n\nBut very few, if any, legacy banks in Nigeria actually go out of their traditional ways to innovate using the rich data reserves. However, banks can share the data with third parties that have better capabilities to use them, and that\u2019s the premise of Open Banking.\n\nWhat is Open Banking?\n\nOpen Banking is an emerging global practice of data sharing between banks and other stakeholders in the ecosystem; including third-party financial services providers (TPPs), fintechs, and other institutions.\n\nBy sharing one another\u2019s datasets, the companies can better understand their target markets, acquire more customers, and build out new customer-centric products and services or improve on existing ones.\n\nIfeoluwa Orioke, the Chief Commercial Officer at Flutterwave, explains to TechCabal that one of the ways customers can benefit from open banking is by accessing loans tailored to their needs.\n\n\u201cA lender can understand your credit score from your transaction history and tailor specific credit facilities to you. Or for instance, interest repayments for a farmer whose income is in seasons, and not months, can be structured around the harvest season.\u201d\n\nWhile these are viable use cases, Open Banking is more effective for driving financial inclusion in Nigeria. As of the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult Nigerian population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBanks don\u2019t have incentives to target rural areas, where most of the unbanked population resides. In their place, fintech firms are extending access to financial services in these areas through agent networks and mobile money wallets.\n\nHowever, fintechs need to integrate data with banks before they launch agent locations. A common standard for both parties to share information is needed to help speed up integration.\n\nOpen Banking introduces this common standard, via uniform Application Programme Interface (API), which banks and fintechs all have access to. It aids the latter\u2019s efforts to reach the financially excluded or underserved.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking is a major step forward in solving restricted access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d said Orioke. \u201cThose who do not have bank accounts can participate in the financial ecosystem via Fintechs. Fintechs can provide improved solutions and personalised services to these people by processing data from banks.\u201d\n\nOpen Banking Nigeria, a private initiative building a common standard for Open Banking APIs in Nigeria, has, to an impressive extent, helped standardise API access, thereby easing the process of integration between fintechs and banks.\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank also recently launched draft regulations for Open Banking, which establishes principles for data sharing across the banking and payments ecosystem.\n\nWin-win for all\n\nAccording to Orioke, the Open Banking idea is a win-win for all parties involved in the ecosystem; banks, fintechs, TPPs, the banked, and the unbanked populations.\n\nWith vast and detailed consumer data gathered over the years, Open Banking provides value creation opportunities for innovation-friendly banks.\n\nFintech companies, with access to bank data, could better serve existing customers and even acquire new users in the process.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking equally creates more options for existing customers and could bring in more people into the banking system, simply by tailoring solutions to their needs,\u201d notes Orioke. \u201cWith more customer personalisation comes improved trust in the financial services industry.\n\nOutside financial services, Open Banking has the potential to impact all aspects of the customer\u2019s life, seeing as every activity is connected to finance; whether hospitality, healthcare, or insurance.\n\n\u201cIt can also increase the profitability of all participating parties (including the banks), reduce cost and improve customer experience. Open Banking could be the ultimate solution to all current difficulties with access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d Orioke said.\n\nConsidering its numerous benefits and rapid adoption, Open Banking could potentially revolutionise the financial services ecosystem in Nigeria and go down as one of the most important innovations in the financial inclusion drive.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "title": "Insecurity, shortage of drivers drive Uber fares up 92%",
          "text": "Data from Rakuten Intelligence has shown that the cost of Uber rides between January 2018 and July 2021 has increased, 92 percent.\n\nMany riders (customers) have also complained about increased wait times for rides. The major reason for the delays in \u2018ride arrivals\u2019 is the recent shortage of drivers.\n\nIn early July 2021, Uber drivers were about 40 percent below capacity. Uber drivers in Abuja have complained and lamented over the continued threat to their lives by carjackers, kidnappers, ritual killers and armed robbers.\n\nAccording to their recent count, over 10 drivers had been killed and their cars are stolen, while many others were injured by the hoodlums.\n\nThe Online Hackney Practitioners Association of Nigeria (OHPAN) called on the government to compel the ride-hailing companies to profile users of their services to check the spate of killing of drivers and use of fake names by criminals.\n\nRead also: Moove secures $23m investment to expand vehicle ownership in Africa\n\n\u201cYou want to pick a rider and you see funny names like Ghost, Snake, Juju, Scorpion, Grave Death, Death, and yet they will use Uber platforms to request a ride and the companies are not doing anything to stop the killings. You write to them and they will tell you, \u2018we will let the authorities know,\u2019 and that\u2019s it,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe company has however taken notice and is investing millions worth of bonuses and base rates to convince drivers to return. But to turn things around, these ride-sharing companies might need to do even more to convince drivers to return.\n\n\u201cThe company does not see us as human beings, they just consider us as profit,\u201d said Stanley, an Uber driver and volunteer coordinator for the group.\n\nPieces of information on Uber\u2019s website show that drivers make anywhere between N9,000 per hour in cities like Abuja, to N15,000 an hour in cities like Lagos. But for those who are still relying on ride-sharing platforms to make a living, the companies are not offering enough.\n\nIn fact, many drivers have currently switched to food delivery services or dispatch services because of the current conditions the company currently offers.\n\nUchenna Anagor, a former Uber driver stated that he converted his resources to that of dispatch services after he weighed the risk-reward ratio behind the Uber business and discovered that there was a vast disparity between both measurement ratios.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t risk losing my life and leaving my family just to receive peanuts at the end of the day. It\u2019s not really worth the risk\u201d, Anagor stated.\n\nSeveral protests and letters to relevant authorities, including the police, on the menace, had not brought anything positive.\n\n\u201cThis year alone, over 10 of our drivers were killed and their cars taken away and many were injured; some sustained permanent disabilities because of these carjackers,\u201d Emeka Emerole chairman of OHPAN said in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cPeople like Ezekiel Akinyele, Matthew Okafor, Akin Awojabi and many other drivers were killed and their bodies dumped on the streets of Abuja. Thankfully, one of us, Moses, is alive today to tell the story himself after battling for his life at the National Hospital Abuja, but he lost his eyes permanently. Yet, the most annoying thing is that Uber is not doing anything serious about the situation\u201d, he added.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is annoying that a rider will pick a SIM card, slot it into a phone, request a ride and take the driver to an unknown destination, kill the driver and take his car. It is also untraceable because Uber does not know him, but when it comes to the drivers, the companies have our BVNs, NINs, driving licences, addresses, pictures and many other things just to make sure that users of their services are protected.\n\n\u201cBut to do the same in the case of riders, no, because they don\u2019t see us as important. We are calling on the government to come to our rescue.\u201d\n\nIt was a bit like a gold rush for drivers who were not able to deliver passengers during the pandemic; while Uber\u2019s ride-sharing revenue decreased 43 percent between 2019 and 2020, its delivery revenue increased 179 percent, according to its 2020 annual earnings report.\n\nThe driver shortage calls into question whether the ride-sharing business model is sustainable. The company has not shown sustained profits, but instead have shown staggering losses compared with most other publicly traded companies. Uber lost $6.77 billion last year, and $8.51 billion in 2019, the last full year before the pandemic.\n\nProfitability was a problem for the company even before the pandemic, when Uber was rapidly growing. Back then, the company was subsidizing the price of rides with promotions, discounts, and even just lowering the cost of rides to bring in new customers. So the capital raised by these companies, in part, went to make rides more affordable and making sure drivers were happy with their compensation. Now that Uber is a public company, they have to worry more about making a profit.\n\nTo turn things around, Uber has launched a $250 million driver stimulus and has invested in more driver bonuses and incentives.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve added thousands of drivers to the platform and expect rider wait times and prices to improve moving forward\u201d, the group stated.",

          "title": "An interview with Etop Ikpe, CEO of Autocheck",
          "text": "Technology presents an opportunity to truly drive this transformational agenda across millions of lives- an interview with Etop Ikpe, CEO of Autocheck\n\nYou have an impressive track record across a number of tech businesses. What made you decide to merge this background with the automotive sector?\n\nDespite being a $45bn industry, Africa\u2019s automotive market only has a 5% financing penetration rate (compared to 80% in China, 75% in Indonesia and 70% in India respectively), meaning millions of Africans cannot access car loans from traditional lenders and must spend years building their savings to own a car outright.\n\nEqually, due to the fragmentation in the market largely driven by pre-owned vehicles, lenders have struggled to scale their auto lending portfolio and this can be attributed to the multiple challenges associated with vehicle valuation, condition analysis, and an efficient secondary disposal channel.\n\nHowever, technology offers a huge opportunity to transform this. For example, through the platform we\u2019ve built at Autochek and our established links with auto dealerships, we\u2019re able to analyze and provide information on the condition and valuation of vehicles, providing lenders with the much-needed trust and transparency to make informed credit decisions for customers applying for auto loans. We\u2019ve also developed algorithms that reduce the loan application process from 40 \u2013 45 days to 24 hours.\n\nEntrepreneurs such as yourself are often always focused on their next goal but what are the milestones Autochek has achieved over the last year that you are most proud of? Since the launch, we have expanded beyond Nigeria into West Africa and East Africa, and have onboarded over 70 financial partners across these multiple markets. These include leading regional players such as Access Bank [Nigeria] and Ecobank [Ghana]. Additionally, we have over 1000 auto dealers actively using our dealer management solution to manage their operations and over 100 repair workshops using the integrated Garage management solution to service customers. Our platform has grown from 10 loan applications processed at launch to over 20,000 applications till date. Despite the traction we have gained so far, we are very aware that we are just at the beginning of our journey and we recognize that the earlier stages in a business can be the most difficult so as we scale, we must remain focused on the customer and meeting their needs all along the automotive value chain.\n\nRead also: Shell\u2019s reincarnation gathers more steam, to Install 50,000 Electric Chargers in UK by 2025\n\nAs you\u2019re aware, being a founder is not always as glamorous as it seems. What sacrifices have you had to make to be successful? I believe success is relative and my personal opinion is that true success is finding satisfaction in whatever you do and ensuring that there\u2019s a transformational impact that positively impacts your immediate environment which creates a multiplier effect that reaches millions more. I am just at the beginning of this journey and I am grateful for the team at Autochek who are working with me to make this possible.\n\nI have been fortunate to be involved in things that I truly enjoy and I don\u2019t perceive my journey has denied me of anything that I would have liked. However, the demanding environments I have been involved in have placed a limitation on one of the things that are most important to me which is spending time with my family. But I have been blessed with a support group that understands my journey and I am looking forward to spending more time with them.\n\nThere are a lot of up-and-coming African entrepreneurs looking to emulate your success. What advice would you give them?\n\nAfrica is perceived as a continent with a myriad of challenges but these challenges truly represent opportunities for future growth. The biggest challenge in Africa is ensuring that we create more jobs and move millions of the large youth population out of poverty. Every African entrepreneur must focus on how they impact job creation and moving more people out of poverty. Technology presents an opportunity to truly drive this transformational agenda across millions of lives. My personal opinion is that if you focus on this as your core goal, you will achieve success.\n\nWhere do you see yourself and Autochek in the next 10 years?\n\nAt Autochek, our main focus over the next ten years is to improve institutional credit access to automotive transactions from the current average of 2% to 50% across Africa. In doing this, we would need to ensure that we have partnerships across the majority of the financial institutions, dealers, workshops across Africa and we should have grown to serve a customer base of over a hundred million customers across Africa. Looking forward, we have an exciting journey ahead of us and in the process of achieving this, I believe that we will develop as a company and I am personally looking forward to the growth and learnings that come with this journey.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has commended the performance of Ehizogie Jeffrey Aidelogie, who emerged as the best candidate in the state in the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), organised by the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB).\n\nAidelogie also ranks among the first ten highest scorers in the 2021 UTME which held across the country.\n\nObaseki commended Aidelogie when he received him in his office at the Government House, Benin City, the Edo State Capital.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cLet me congratulate you and the management of Saint Michael College in Ikhueniro in Benin here for this great achievement. As a government, anything education is our priority. We are encouraged by what you are doing. We will continue to support your efforts. We are investing at the very foundational stage of education with the Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EdoBEST) programme. We are scaling EDOBEST to junior, senior secondary schools as well as technical schools.\n\n\u201cWe are training the teachers and giving them the appropriate tools to impact knowledge in these young children.

Gbenga Elegbeleye for a job well done.\n\nHe said what should be paramount in the heart of every member of the party now is how to re-elect governor Adegboyega Oyetola for the good work to continue.\n\nOyebamiji urged the newly sworn in local government executives to work round the clock in ensuring unity within the party, saying that unity will remain the only bedrock for the success of the party in 2022 election.\n\nHe, however, implored all the aggrieved members of the party to embrace peace and work hamoniously with the newly sworn in executives for the betterment of all.\n\nIn his remarks after the conclusion of the exercise, Hon Arimiyau Owoade, who returned as party chairman in the local government, thanked the leaders and members of the party on behalf of other members of Exco, for the confidence reposed in them.\n\nCommittee Express Satisfaction\n\nSimilarly, members of the National Committee on Local Government Congress of the party expressed satisfaction over the peaceful conduct of the party\u2019s members in the State.\n\nThe Committee affirmed that there was no parallel congress anywhere in the State except on Facebook and other social media platforms.\n\nIt also expressed delight wuth the way and manner the party\u2019s supporters and loyalists trooped out en masse to exercise their right of electing new officers of the party across the Local Governments of the State.\n\nRecall that the national leadership of the ruling party under the leadership of Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee had earlier resolved and directed the conduct of the Local Government Congresses across the 774 Councils in the country.\n\nThe members of the party\u2019s national delegation for the Local Government Congress to Osun had on Friday, held a stakeholders\u2019 meeting at the party\u2019s secretariat, where they charged members to exhibit the Omoluabi ethos for which Osun is known for and promised to conduct a hitch-free and credible exercise.\n\nBy Saturday morning, they visited some of the Councils where they monitored, supervised and observed the conduct of the Congress.\n\nAmong the Councils visited as at the time of filing the report were Osogbo Local Government, Boripe Local Government and Boluwaduro Local Government.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the members of the Committee, the Committee\u2019s Chairman, Hon. Gbenga Elegbeleye, lauded the peaceful conduct of the party loyalists, describing it as commendable and worthwhile.\n\nElegbeleye who commended the consensus model adopted by the leadership of the party, said there was no parallel congress anywhere as against the insinuations making the rounds.\n\nAccording to him, nothing like parallel congress was either seen or observed by the Committee in any of the visited places or being reported by the Committee members observing and supervising the election process in any of the Councils in the State.\n\n\u201cWe have been to several places. We have been to Osogbo, Boripe, Boluwaduro among others, and we met very large crowd where consensus was adopted as model to which the new officers were elected by the party\u2019s members,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThings were very perfect; the atmosphere was peaceful and we were very impressed by the way and manner which the people conducted and comported themselves peacefully without any rancour whatsoever.\n\n\u201cAs we all know, consensus is what the party has always subscribed to and this is what was largely adopted in the State, and with what we have seen so far, there is nothing like parallel anywhere except on Facebook.\n\n\u201cWe are very glad to witness this Congress in a peaceful atmosphere as this is in line with the principles of our party.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks during the visit of the members of the Committee to his Council in Iragbiji, Boripe Local Government, Governor Oyetola applauded the members of the party across the State for allowing peace to reign.\n\nHe attributed the atmosphere of peace to the existing show of love and the spirit of togetherness reigning in the party, saying it was a reflection of the fact that the party members were united and formidable.\n\n\u201cI thank the members of the party for the sense of duty, love and peace that have been observed so far. This is to show that our party is united absolutely.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to the members of the Committee for being very fair and efficient in discharging their responsibility. We are very proud of you. I congratulate the newly elected executives. This is a call to service.\n\n\u201cYou must serve with the fear of God. As you all know, the party\u2019s members have reposed confidence in you and you must justify this and you must not disappoint them,\u201d Oyetola added.",

Sixty-four per cent of individuals arrested are involved in romance scams, followed closely by \u2018MiddleMan Scam\u2019 and \u2018Picking,\u2019 which account for eight and seven per cent, respectively, of those arrested.\n\n\u201cThe 64 per cent involved in the dating scam benefitted to the tune of N8, 310,000; $349,290; \u00a3 900; \u20ac10 and Cryptocurrency 0.17513.\u201d\n\nOther types of fraud identified include forgery, possession of fraudulent documents, spamming, credit card fraud, impersonation, rental scam, loan fraud, Business Email Compromise, hacking, stealing, cheque scam, phishing, and money laundering.\n\nThe data also reveals gift cards, at 39 per cent, as the prevalent method employed by the suspects to access their illicit funds, followed by bank transfers at 27 per cent and Cryptocurrency at 21 per cent.\n\n\u201cA total of $12,512.49 was recovered from the e-wallet accounts of four suspects within the period,\u201d Uwujaren said",

The position of the national leadership of our party regarding the modalities for this congress was too clear and devoid of any ambiguity.\n\n\u201cThe Wale Ohu-led Congress Committee conducted the congress and the exercise was very open and peaceful all over the 20 Local Government Areas and was supervised by officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the Police as well as operatives of the Department of the State Security Service (DSS)\u201d.\n\n\u201cI must also add that the committee never split itself into two for the purpose of conducting any \u201cparallel\u201dcongress in Ogun. So, all those claiming to have had any \u201cparallel congress\u201d elsewhere were only celebrating charades\u201d.\n\n\u201cLet me quickly remind you that these set of people also did the same thing in the build up to the year 2019 general elections in the state and you will recall that the outcome of their actions were nothing but effort in futility. That action was even one of the reasons that fetched the former governor of the state, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, a suspension from the party\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion however, I want to say that what they did was a \u201cdead on arrival\u201d exercise,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Oyo State governor, \u2018Seyi Makinde, on Saturday, declared that his administration will turn Ibadan to a 21st century city through the provision of developmental projects across the city.\n\nThe governor stated this at the inauguration ceremony of 2021/2023 Executive Council of the Central Council of Ibadan Indigenes (CCII), led by its President General, Prince Oluyemisi Adeaga, at an event held at Ibadan House, Oke-Aremo, Ibadan.\n\nThe governor explained that the Central Council of Ibadan Indigenes is an influential association in the whole of Oyo state, saying that he believes in the ideals of the association.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA statement by the Chief Press Secratary to the governor, Mr.Taiwo Adisa, qouted the governor as saying that most of the projects embarked upon by his administration in Ibadan will transform the city to a 21st Century city.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe all know where CCII started and know where it is today. We all know the influence CCII exerts not only on Ibadan issues. If one can solve the issues in Ibadan, that means one can solve issues in the whole of Oyo State. And for me, I personally believe 101 per cent in the ideals of CCII.\n\n\u201cThe position of CCII on most germane issues concerning our state has always turned out to be the right one because our best, be it intellectual, be it spiritual, or social, are in CCII. So, I want to beg you, if you have any idea and you want us to provide access on it, come and tell us. We will do it.\n\n\u201cWe have roughly two years to re-image Ibadan and we are already on that path. Few of the projects we are doing in Ibadan are projects that can lead Ibadan to a city of 21th century.\n\n\u201cWe have commissioned the remodeled Lekan Salami Stadium when majority of states in Nigeria are talking about insecurity, kidnapping, banditry and insurgency; we were still at Adamasingba at 10 p.m. A foreign club was with us and we were not afraid.\n\n\u201cIn terms of infrastructure, the Circular Road is one project that would change the landmark in Ibadan. It is 110kms but before our tenure ends in 2023, 75kms of it will be delivered.\n\n\u201cIf we can vividly reflect, there used to be bus terminal in Ogunpa in those days. So, we also want to recreate the same with the bus terminals we are putting up at Challenge, Iwo Road and Ojoo. Many people have said they like the light up project we have done already.\n\n\u201cThe ones we have done in Ibadanland alone is not up to 30 per cent of what we planned to do. We are actually supposed to light up 156kms of road in Ibadan. And all they have done is less than 50kms.\n\n\u201cFinally, before I became the governor, I have been contributing my own quota to the growth of CCII. I want to assure you that we will fix the road that leads to this place. Another thing that would be done is, I will donate a bus for CCII.\u201d\n\nThe governor also told the gathering that the government and CCII members needed to be involved in the concerns of Olubadan of Ibadanland, adding that he would dust up the files and do something about the issues before the end of the tenure of the current government.\n\nHe added: \u201cI do give Ibadan Indigenes scholarship and I want to contribute 10million Naira for that again.\u201d",

          "title": "Ndume to FG: Surrendered insurgents with blood on their hands must be prosecuted",
          "text": "Chairman, Senate Committee on Army, Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume. has insisted that members of the Boko Haram Islamic sect that have surrendered should not be profiled, interrogated and those with blood in their hands must be prosecuted.\n\nSenator Ndume, who represents Borno South Senatorial District in the senate stated this at the weekend while speaking with State House correspondents after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, at the State House, Abuja.\n\nThe former Senate Leader said that the former insurgents especially those that have blood in their hands cannot be let go just because they have surrendered.\n\nHe said even though there may be innocent persons among them, some of who may have been used as slaves and human shields, they must all be processed according to national and international laws.\n\nHe maintained that since they have surrendered, they cannot be summarily executed just as no one has the right to let them go without following due process of the law.\n\nAsked about his position on reintegrating the former insurgents into the Borno society, Ndume said: \u201cMy stance on this has not changed, only that maybe people interpret it the way they want. There is a national law that should guide all these and there\u2019s international law that guides this because this is not the first time we\u2019re having this sort of challenge in various countries.\n\n\u201cNormally, when you get to war level, you are expected to either defeat the enemy or the enemy surrenders. Once the enemy surrenders, you lose the right to summarily execute him because he is an enemy.\n\n\u201cYou also don\u2019t have the right to summarily declare him innocent and say, Oh, you have sinned, go and sin no more.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying initially, and I still maintain this position, in as much as we welcome the surrendering of the Boko Haram, it is very important that we follow the due process, according to the law of the land and the international law.\n\n\u201cThat is to say, take them in, profile them, process them, investigate them, interrogate them and then those that are innocent, should be let go, and those that have blood in their hands, they should be appropriately prosecuted.\n\n\u201cOnce the person surrenders, now, he has an advantage. Once you surrender, you cannot just be summarily convicted, you will be given the right to go to court and declare your innocence or otherwise. That is what I\u2019m asking for.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also saying that as long as the war is continuing, it is now time to apply the carrot and stick approach. While we are prosecuting the war vigorously, in order to bring it to an end, a window is there available to tell those that are willing to surrender, that you can surrender and then you will be processed accordingly.\n\n\u201cAfter that defeat or after the war has come to an end and the window is there for them to surrender as they are surrendering in droves now, they should be processed, they should be investigated.\n\n\u201cWe have sat down in Borno State last week, as stakeholders, to look at what are the suggestions or what are the ways that these people can, after surrendering, be managed according to the law.\u201d\n\nSenator Ndume pointed out that following the resolutions reached by the Borno state stakeholders meeting, the federal government will soon come out with a definite position of the best way to manage the issue of the surrendered insurgents.\n\nHe advised that those who still want to surrender should be given a window of opportunity to do so.\n\nOn whether information can be extracted from those who have surrendered to end the war, he said:\n\n\u201cThat is why I say when they are processed, if somebody surrenders, most of them are very bold to own up. Most of them will disclose those who were their sources or their sponsors if any, and where are they getting the equipment or the arms and ammunition they have been using and they will be useful in providing information to our security agencies in order to finish the business at hand and that is winning the war.\n\n\u201cI think we are getting there because they themselves, had the number, the number coming up to surrender is always increasing. I know in Cameroun, over 1000 of them surrendered and most of them are Nigerians. The Borno State Government is making arrangements.\n\n\u201cAs I said, the governor is on top of the situation, the people are carried along, even the victims are being carried along. For example, I\u2019m a victim and my people are victims. It varies, the degree of the effect of the insurgency on us, but we as Nigerians, we as humans, we have sympathy, or we have the heart to easily forgive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the forgiving that is the problem, it is the issue of if you forgive somebody that has done something so horrendous like that, and you are not sure that he\u2019s not coming back or see repentance and all that. Besides, as I said, if somebody has blood in his hand, and it\u2019s not your blood, do you have the right to say, \u2018go, you are forgiven?\u2019\n\n\u201cIn all these, there must be procedure and fortunately, there is an international law and the national law that should guide this and that\u2019s why at the summit, I said that we as National Assembly members are lawmakers and whatever is required by law, in order to address this thing that is strange in our hand, then we\u2019ll support the government to do that.\u201d\n\nNdume further explained that the Nigerian intelligence services are capable of obtaining the necessary information from those on custody.\n\nHe added: \u201cThat is what the intelligence agencies are trained to do. We have well-trained intelligence personnel in various armed forces and security agencies. In Nigeria, we have good intelligence officers that if they are given the chance and they are given the time, they will go deep into it to find out and that\u2019s why I say as they surrender, they are taken in and be processed and attention should be on the victims.\n\n\u201cWe have thousands of our people scattered all over Nigeria that are victims of this insurgency. Once they surrender, we take them in, process them, then more attention should be given to the victims before coming to the perpetrators.\n\n\u201cThe priorities should be in my own position; one, end the war. Two, resettle the victims, then process, interrogate and investigate or prosecute. Or if those that are innocent, because, among those that surrendered, there are victims also because I know even in my place, in my local government, there are people that are trapped by Boko Haram and for all these years, they\u2019re not part of the Boko Haram, but the Boko Haram used them as shield.\n\n\u201cIn fact, some of them were converted to what they call slaves because they are victims. Those that have surrendered to them are converted to slaves; they farmed for them, they do their manual works for them. So, if such people, in the process of surrender, if they come in, you have to find out whether he is actually Boko Haram or a victim of Boko Haram in the hands of Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cThis is what we are saying that there should be no hurry in it. Once they are taken in, they should be kept somewhere and in fact, we are suggesting that they should be somewhere they will be housed so that it will give a place for interrogation and investigation.\u201d Vanguard\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "title": "Ndume to FG: Surrendered insurgents with blood on their hands must be prosecuted",
          "text": "Chairman, Senate Committee on Army, Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume. has insisted that members of the Boko Haram Islamic sect that have surrendered should not be profiled, interrogated and those with blood in their hands must be prosecuted.\n\nSenator Ndume, who represents Borno South Senatorial District in the senate stated this at the weekend while speaking with State House correspondents after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, at the State House, Abuja.\n\nThe former Senate Leader said that the former insurgents especially those that have blood in their hands cannot be let go just because they have surrendered.\n\nHe said even though there may be innocent persons among them, some of who may have been used as slaves and human shields, they must all be processed according to national and international laws.\n\nHe maintained that since they have surrendered, they cannot be summarily executed just as no one has the right to let them go without following due process of the law.\n\nAsked about his position on reintegrating the former insurgents into the Borno society, Ndume said: \u201cMy stance on this has not changed, only that maybe people interpret it the way they want. There is a national law that should guide all these and there\u2019s international law that guides this because this is not the first time we\u2019re having this sort of challenge in various countries.\n\n\u201cNormally, when you get to war level, you are expected to either defeat the enemy or the enemy surrenders. Once the enemy surrenders, you lose the right to summarily execute him because he is an enemy.\n\n\u201cYou also don\u2019t have the right to summarily declare him innocent and say, Oh, you have sinned, go and sin no more.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying initially, and I still maintain this position, in as much as we welcome the surrendering of the Boko Haram, it is very important that we follow the due process, according to the law of the land and the international law.\n\n\u201cThat is to say, take them in, profile them, process them, investigate them, interrogate them and then those that are innocent, should be let go, and those that have blood in their hands, they should be appropriately prosecuted.\n\n\u201cOnce the person surrenders, now, he has an advantage. Once you surrender, you cannot just be summarily convicted, you will be given the right to go to court and declare your innocence or otherwise. That is what I\u2019m asking for.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also saying that as long as the war is continuing, it is now time to apply the carrot and stick approach. While we are prosecuting the war vigorously, in order to bring it to an end, a window is there available to tell those that are willing to surrender, that you can surrender and then you will be processed accordingly.\n\n\u201cAfter that defeat or after the war has come to an end and the window is there for them to surrender as they are surrendering in droves now, they should be processed, they should be investigated.\n\n\u201cWe have sat down in Borno State last week, as stakeholders, to look at what are the suggestions or what are the ways that these people can, after surrendering, be managed according to the law.\u201d\n\nSenator Ndume pointed out that following the resolutions reached by the Borno state stakeholders meeting, the federal government will soon come out with a definite position of the best way to manage the issue of the surrendered insurgents.\n\nHe advised that those who still want to surrender should be given a window of opportunity to do so.\n\nOn whether information can be extracted from those who have surrendered to end the war, he said:\n\n\u201cThat is why I say when they are processed, if somebody surrenders, most of them are very bold to own up. Most of them will disclose those who were their sources or their sponsors if any, and where are they getting the equipment or the arms and ammunition they have been using and they will be useful in providing information to our security agencies in order to finish the business at hand and that is winning the war.\n\n\u201cI think we are getting there because they themselves, had the number, the number coming up to surrender is always increasing. I know in Cameroun, over 1000 of them surrendered and most of them are Nigerians. The Borno State Government is making arrangements.\n\n\u201cAs I said, the governor is on top of the situation, the people are carried along, even the victims are being carried along. For example, I\u2019m a victim and my people are victims. It varies, the degree of the effect of the insurgency on us, but we as Nigerians, we as humans, we have sympathy, or we have the heart to easily forgive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the forgiving that is the problem, it is the issue of if you forgive somebody that has done something so horrendous like that, and you are not sure that he\u2019s not coming back or see repentance and all that. Besides, as I said, if somebody has blood in his hand, and it\u2019s not your blood, do you have the right to say, \u2018go, you are forgiven?\u2019\n\n\u201cIn all these, there must be procedure and fortunately, there is an international law and the national law that should guide this and that\u2019s why at the summit, I said that we as National Assembly members are lawmakers and whatever is required by law, in order to address this thing that is strange in our hand, then we\u2019ll support the government to do that.\u201d\n\nNdume further explained that the Nigerian intelligence services are capable of obtaining the necessary information from those on custody.\n\nHe added: \u201cThat is what the intelligence agencies are trained to do. We have well-trained intelligence personnel in various armed forces and security agencies. In Nigeria, we have good intelligence officers that if they are given the chance and they are given the time, they will go deep into it to find out and that\u2019s why I say as they surrender, they are taken in and be processed and attention should be on the victims.\n\n\u201cWe have thousands of our people scattered all over Nigeria that are victims of this insurgency. Once they surrender, we take them in, process them, then more attention should be given to the victims before coming to the perpetrators.\n\n\u201cThe priorities should be in my own position; one, end the war. Two, resettle the victims, then process, interrogate and investigate or prosecute. Or if those that are innocent, because, among those that surrendered, there are victims also because I know even in my place, in my local government, there are people that are trapped by Boko Haram and for all these years, they\u2019re not part of the Boko Haram, but the Boko Haram used them as shield.\n\n\u201cIn fact, some of them were converted to what they call slaves because they are victims. Those that have surrendered to them are converted to slaves; they farmed for them, they do their manual works for them. So, if such people, in the process of surrender, if they come in, you have to find out whether he is actually Boko Haram or a victim of Boko Haram in the hands of Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cThis is what we are saying that there should be no hurry in it. Once they are taken in, they should be kept somewhere and in fact, we are suggesting that they should be somewhere they will be housed so that it will give a place for interrogation and investigation.\u201d Vanguard\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has said it will withdraw\n\n2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination , UTME, results of one master Chinedu Ifesinachi John who altered his score.\n\nThe 19 year old candidate who claimed that JAMB has been altering his results since 2019 was also handed over to Nigeria Police for investigation.\n\nJohn had claimed he scored 380 in the examination conducted in June this year and was surprised to receive 265 from the board after the results were released.\n\nAfter several enquiries, 265 kept appearing as his score against the 380 scores.\n\nFollowing the alleged \u201calteration\u201d of the UTME score, his father, John Ifenkpam approached an Enugu \u2013 based lawyer, Ikeazor Akaiwe who wrote to JAMB for another opportunity for the boy to retake the examination and demanded N1 billion as damages.\n\nThe lawyer said the N1 billion was to cover for the physical and emotional trauma the boy had being through from being offered \u201ctwo separate scores.\n\nMaster John claimed that his UTME scores from 2019 till 2021 had been \u201caltered\u201d by the board, thereby denying him the opportunity to study his desired course \u2013 medicine.\n\nOn Friday, the candidate, his father and lawyers traveled down to Abuja from Enugu state following an invitation from the management of the board led by the Registrar of JAMB, Prof Is \u2013 haq Oloyede.\n\nInitially, the boy was given few minutes to \u201ccome clean\u201d in a closed session with his father and lawyers about the results he was parading but insisted that his original score from the examination was 380.\n\nAfter going back and forth, the board tendered evidence to counter the claim by John and his legal representatives. At the Friday meeting, documentary evidence tendered by the board showed that John actually scored 265, not the 380 he had claimed.\n\nOloyede accused the candidate of result tempering, adding that he will be handed over to the police for investigation and subsequently prosecuted.\n\nThe registrar said John was among 11 eleven other candidates who allegedly forged their results that the board would prosecute.\n\nHe said the original result issued to john would be withdrawn pending the end of the investigation.\n\nThe registrar said: \u201cWe have 11 of them who tampered with their results. Two of them are already being prosecuted. The remaining ones we are going to withdraw their results and prosecute them. The main purpose is to sanitise the system, including our own staff.\n\n\u201cThere was never any communication of 380 with this boy. Because this boy has accused JAMB, we are going to withhold his result until the investigation is concluded. We are going to request that our interactions with him be subjected to the public.\u201d\n\nHis lawyer, Ikeazor, appealed to the board to instead give room for further infestation.\n\nHe said: I will not stand against the investigation. Let there be an investigation but what I will not agree to is to prejudge him.\n\nEarlier, John had said: The result I have been receiving is not the result I am entitled to. I wrote the first jamb in 2019. The first time they sent 328 later I saw 278 score when I checked it. I printed it. I couldn\u2019t meet up for admission that year. I wanted to study medicine and surgery at the University of Ibadan.\n\n\u201cIn 2020 the same thing happened. I scored 343 by the time I went to the portal to print I saw 306. I used the 306 and it gave me admission in UI. But because I didn\u2019t have further mathematics I had to forfeit it.\n\n\u201cI decided to leave medicine and surgery for them in 2021, so I picked petroleum engineering. In 2021, JAMB issued me two results. I saw 380 the first time I checked, then the second I saw 265.\u201d\n\nHowever, the candidate later confessed after the Board discovered that he saved his sister\u2019s number on his phone as 55019 and used the phone to send the fake result to his phone.\n\nWhen he send such results they come as 55019.\n\nHe pleaded for mercy that he had to do that when the result he got was not up to what could give him his desired programmme.\n\nNigPilot, Daily Nigerian Newspaper, Nigerian News Update, Nigerian News Headlines, Nigerian Pilot Newspaper Online,",

          "title": "Osaka Considers Another Break from Tennis after US Open Loss",
          "text": "Naomi Osaka looked over at her agent and said she wanted to tell the world what the two of them had discussed privately in an Arthur Ashe Stadium hallway after her U.S. Open title defence ended with a racket-tossing, composure-missing, lead-evaporating defeat in the third round.\n\nHis reply: \u201cSure.\u201d\n\nAnd then Osaka, pausing every so often as her voice got caught on her words and her eyes filled with tears, said Friday night she is thinking about taking another break from tennis \u201cfor a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like for me, recently, when I win, I don\u2019t feel happy, I feel more like a relief. And then when I lose, I feel very sad,\u201d Osaka said at her news conference following a 5-7, 7-6 (2), 6-4 loss at Flushing Meadows to Leylah Fernandez, an 18-year-old from Canada who is ranked 73rd and never had been this far in Grand Slam competition. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s normal.\u201d\n\nThe moderator in charge of the session with reporters attempted to cut things off, but Osaka said she wanted to continue.\n\n\u201cThis is very hard to articulate,\u201d she said, resting her left cheek in her hand. \u201cBasically, I feel like I\u2019m kind of at this point where I\u2019m trying to figure out what I want to do, and I honestly don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to play my next tennis match.\u201d\n\nCrying, she lowered her black visor over her eyes and offered an apology, then patted her palms on both cheeks.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Osaka added as she rose to leave, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to take a break from playing for a while.\u201d\n\nThis was the first Slam tournament for the 23-year-old Osaka since she pulled out of the French Open before the second round to take a mental health break after having announced she would not participate in news conferences in Paris.\n\nShe also sat out Wimbledon, before participating in the Tokyo Olympics, where she lit the cauldron as one of Japan\u2019s most famous athletes.\n\nOsaka owns four Grand Slam titles, including at the U.S. Open in 2018 \u2014 beating Serena Williams in a chaotic final \u2014 and a year ago, plus two more on the hard courts of the Australian Open. When she took a hiatus after Roland Garros, she revealed that she endures waves of anxiety before meeting with the media and has dealt with depression for three years.\n\nOver the last week, Osaka has written on social media and spoken about her thoughts on the importance of self-belief and how she wants to ignore others\u2019 expectations.\n\nThe first sign Friday that things were not entirely OK with Osaka came when she smacked her racket against the court after dropping one point. Moments later, Osaka chucked her equipment, sending it bouncing and skidding halfway to the net. Then came a full-on spike near the baseline.\n\nAfterward, she compared that behaviour to acting \u201ckind of like a little kid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was telling myself to be calm, but I feel like maybe there was a boiling point,\u201d Osaka said. \u201cLike, normally, I feel like I like challenges. But recently I feel very anxious when things don\u2019t go my way, and I feel like you can feel that.\u201d\n\nHer game was off. Her game face was gone. By the end, the crowd was booing her for turning her back to the court and taking too much time between points.\n\nSoon enough, the No. 3-seeded Osaka was out of the bracket.\n\nThis day had that sort of vibe: Earlier in Ashe, another 18-year-old new to this territory surprisingly eliminated a No. 3 seed when Carlos Alcaraz of Spain edged French Open runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 (2), 0-6, 7-6 (5) to become the youngest man into the fourth round at Flushing Meadows since Michael Chang and Pete Sampras in 1989.\n\nOsaka came in with a 16-match winning streak at majors. Still, Fernandez declared: \u201cRight before the match, I knew I was able to win.\u201d\n\nFor Osaka, maybe the time away from high-level competition was an issue.\n\nAnother possible factor in her failure to close things out while serving for the victory against the left-hander Fernandez at 6-5 in the second set: Osaka hadn\u2019t played a match since Monday. The usual day-on, day-off rhythm at Slams was disrupted because the woman Osaka was supposed to meet in the second round, Olga Danilovic, withdrew with an illness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a walkover in a Grand Slam, so that was definitely a really weird feeling,\u201d Osaka said.\n\nOn Friday, Osaka was quite good down the stretch in the opening set. She grabbed 12 of 13 points, including the last nine, with a break at love to go up 6-5, and a hold at love with the help of a pair of aces at 112 mph and 114 mph to end it.\n\nSeemed on track for a similar conclusion in the second set, leading 6-5 and serving. But when Osaka sailed a forehand wide, Fernandez had her first break of the match to make it 6-all.\n\n\u201cFinally, I found a pattern to her serve,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cI just trusted my gut and hit the ball.\u201d\n\nAnd so began Osaka\u2019s downward spiral. She fell behind 5-0 in the ensuing tiebreaker, missing shots and displaying her frustration as she occasionally has done in the past \u2014 by flinging her racket.\n\nChair umpire Alison Hughes did not sanction Osaka then, although later a warning was issued for hitting a ball into the stands.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t really focused on Naomi,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cI was only focused on myself, my game, what I needed to do.\u201d\n\nMore to the point, Osaka was not at her best. She left the court with a white towel draped over her head after the second set, then sat in her changeover chair in that same block-out-the-world manner.\n\nFernandez, smiling and holding her right fist overhead after the biggest of points, certainly had something to do with the outcome.\n\nShe won 18 of 19 first-serve points \u2014 and never faced a break point \u2014 in the third set.\n\nFernandez\u2019s knee-to-the-ground, quick-redirect style at the baseline is reminiscent of another lefty, Angelique Kerber, a three-time Grand Slam champion who won the 2016 U.S. Open.\n\nAnd who just so happens to be the next opponent for Fernandez.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to put on a show like I did tonight,\u201d Fernandez said, \u201cand we\u2019re going to see how it goes.\u201d",
