          "text": "Spanish investigators on Thursday probed the death of John McAfee who was found in his prison cell after an apparent suicide following a court decision approving his extradition to the US on tax evasion charges.\n\nThe body of the 75-year-old founder of the anti-virus McAfee software was discovered at around 7:00 pm on Wednesday in his cell in the Brians 2 penitentiary near Barcelona in what a prison service spokeswoman said was a death \u201capparently from suicide\u201d.\n\nCatalan legal officials confirmed it was McAfee, who had been held at the facility since his arrest in early October as he was about to board a flight to Istanbul.\n\nHis body was taken away by judicial officials who opened an investigation to determine the cause of death, a spokeswoman for Catalonia\u2019s justice ministry told AFP on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThere was a death which suggested suicide but confirmation must come through the autopsy,\u201d she told AFP, saying it could be a matter of days before a postmortem would be carried out.\n\nAccording to an indictment filed in a US court, McAfee was alleged to have deliberately failed to file tax returns between 2014 and 2018, despite earning millions from consulting work, cryptocurrencies and selling the rights to his life story.\n\nIf convicted, he could have faced up to 30 years in prison.\n\n\u201cGuards and medical staff intervened immediately to perform resuscitation measures but doctors eventually certified his death,\u201d the Catalan justice department said in a statement.\n\nMcAfee was found dead just hours after a Spanish court said it had approved his extradition to the United States in a decision which could have been appealed.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Want him to die in prison\u2019 \u2013\n\nAccording to the US extradition request filed in November and quoted in the ruling, McAfee earned more than 10 million euros ($12 million) in 2014-18, but never filed a tax return.\n\n\u201cTo conceal his income and assets from the Internal Revenue Service\u2026 the defendant ordered part of his income to be paid to straw men and placed property in their names,\u201d it said.\n\nSince making a fortune in the 1980s with the antivirus software that still bears his name, McAfee had become a self-styled cryptocurrency guru, claiming to make $2,000 a day.\n\nMcAfee in 1987 founded the computer security software company and ran it for seven years before resigning.\n\nHis life after that became a headline-grabbing mix of controversies involving drugs, weapons and even murder.\n\nMcAfee had more than one million followers on Twitter, where he described himself as a \u201clover of women, adventure and mystery\u201d.\n\nIn a tweet on June 16, he said the US authorities believed he had \u201chidden crypto\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wish I did,\u201d he added. \u201cMy remaining assets are all seized. My friends evaporated through fear of association. I have nothing. Yet, I regret nothing.\u201d\n\nSince his arrest, his wife Janice has complained that he was \u201cnot doing well\u201d in jail and had faced delays in getting \u201cproper medical care\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe US authorities are determined to have John die in prison,\u201d she tweeted on Sunday, adding: \u201cThere is no hope for him ever having a fair trial in America.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Unsolved murder \u2013\n\nMcAfee moved to Belize in Central America and made headlines when his next-door neighbour was mysteriously murdered in 2012. The crime was never solved.\n\nMcAfee claimed he was nowhere near the victim at the time, but local police have wanted to interview him as a person of interest in the case.\n\nAfter the police found him living with a 17-year-old girl and discovered a large arsenal of weapons in his home, McAfee disappeared.\n\n\u201cI am not a madman,\u201d said the British-born former NASA programmer whose anti-virus company was bought by Intel in 2010.\n\n\u201cI am eccentric, gracious, attentive, kind, humorous. We humans are funny creatures.\u201d\n\nThe dead neighbour\u2019s family later filed a wrongful death suit against McAfee and in 2019 a Florida court ordered him to pay them more than $25 million.\n\nA documentary titled \u201cGringo: The Dangerous Life of John McAfee\u201d released in 2016 focused on his life in Belize.\n\nIn 2015, McAfee was arrested in the United States for driving under the influence and a year later, made an unsuccessful run for president.\n\nFrom a political perspective, he advocated for ramping up defences against cyberattacks from China and Russia, and ending the war on drugs.\n\n(AFP)",

          "text": "\u2026Senior journalists, Reps kick against moves to gag the press\n\n\u2026Court can\u2019t stop us from passing bill \u2013 Odebunmi\n\n\u2026Sponsor of draconian NPC, NBC bills, Odebunmi, has no media background, knowledge\n\n\u2026AGF studying court ruling on Twitter \u2014 Presidency\n\nBy Soni Daniel, Northern Region Editor, Clifford Ndujihe, Johnbosco Agbakwuru & Tordue Salem\n\nTHE Presidency has denied having hands in the anti-media bills before the National Assembly, which some senior journalists and members of the House of Representatives kicked against, yesterday.\n\nOne of the bills is the Nigeria Press Council, NPC, Amendment Bill seeking control of the Nigerian media by the Federal Ministry of Information.\n\nThe piece of legislation, currently before the House of Representatives, sponsored by chairman, House Committee on Information, Segun Odebunmi (PDP, Oyo State), has also generated a lot of opposition from civil society.\n\nWe\u2019ve no hand in anti-media bills \u2013 Presidency\n\nThe Presidency said it has no hand in the proposed anti-media legislation.\n\nBriefing State House correspondents at the end of the Federal Executive Council, FEC, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the First Lady\u2019s Conference Room, Presidential Villa, Abuja, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Chief Femi Adesina, said the initiative is a government thing that only the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, could address.\n\nAsked to comment on the issue, he said: \u201cThat is not strictly a Presidency thing because the President has nothing to do with that. It\u2019s a government thing and it\u2019s the Minister that can talk about it.\u201d\n\nThe Presidential spokesman also said that the Attorney-General of the Federation is studying the ruling of the ECOWAS Court to the effect that Twitter users cannot be arrested or prosecuted, following suspension of the activities of the micro-blogging site in the country.\n\nHe said the AGF will advise the Federal Government on the next steps to take.\n\nAdesina affirmed that the committee made up of ministers to engage with Twitter had begun to meet.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe Attorney-General of the Federation is going to study that report and then he\u2019ll advise government on the way forward. The committee set up by the President to engage with Twitter is actually holding a meeting about now, or it will hold a meeting this afternoon (Wednesday) towards engaging with Twitter.\u201d\n\nOutrage against anti-media bills\n\nIn separate interviews with Vanguard, former President of the Nigerian Guild of Editors, Mr. Gbenga Adefaye; members of the House of Representatives, Abiante Awaji-Inombek (PDP, Rivers) and Nicholas Ossai (PDP, Delta), opposed the NPC amendment bill, describing it as a punitive and oppressive act that stifles free speech and press freedom.\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Leadership Newspapers, Mr. Azu Ishiekwene, also kicked against the NPC amendment bill as well as the National Broadcasting Commission, NBC, amendment bill, warning that \u201cmuzzling the media under any guise is playing with fire.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Guild of Editors, NGE, had on Tuesday, described the bills as draconian and anti- free press, and also warned that the media, which serve as the oxygen of democracy, will be strangulated if the bills were passed into law.\n\nThe outrage came as The Presidency said it has no hand in the ongoing attempts at the National Assembly to amend the NPC and NBC Acts.\n\nAnti-media proposals in proposed NPC bill\n\nThe NPC amendment bill seeks to amend Section 3 of the principal act to empower the council to regulate the print media and related media houses; ensure truthful, genuine and quality services by print media houses and media practitioners; and with the approval of the Minister in charge of Information, establish and disseminate a national Press Code and standards to guide conduct of print media, related media houses and media practitioners.\n\nOther amendments include empowering the NPC to approve penalties and fines against violations of the Press Code by print media houses and media practitioners, including revocation of licence; receive, process and consider applications for the establishment, ownership and operation of print media and other related media houses; with the approval of the Minister, grant print media and other related licenses to any application considered worthy of such; monitor activities of the press, media and other related houses to ensure compliance with the National Press Code for professional and ethical conduct, including the Nigerian Union of Journalists.\n\nNPC bill authoritarian \u2013 Ossai\n\n\u201cThe Press Council Amendment Bill is authoritarian in nature, and not acceptable in a democracy. The Press cannot be gagged by anybody. They should be allowed to operate freely. That is my take on it,\u201d Ossai said.\n\nAwaji-Inombek also aligned with his colleague, vowing to tear the down the proposal when presented before the House for consideration on resumption.\n\n\u201cI want to reserve my views on the bill till they bring it to the floor for debate. But obviously, I am against the bill. I cannot be in support of a bill that intends to gag the press,\u201d he submitted.\n\nIt\u2019s injurious to press freedom, journalism, democracy \u2014Adefaye\n\nSpeaking on the NPC amendment bill, Adefaye said: \u201cThe Nigerian Press Council Act is a law that is being challenged in the court by the Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria, NPAN. The case is at the Supreme Court. NPAN stated its stand clearly that the law is injurious to the business of journalism; it is injurious to free speech and press freedom.\n\n\u201cNewspapers are registered under the Companies and Allied Matters Act, CAMA. So they operate like other businesses. Now, the act prescribed special laws beyond the CAMA in operation of newspaper business. That\u2019s double jeopardy.\n\n\u201cThe act still has to register businesses that have been registered under CAMA; the act set out to register journalists and prescribe qualification. The act has nothing to do with us because it is a professional calling and the journalists have to do that. It is a punitive and an oppressive act. It stifles free speech, and press freedom because the act empowers the minister of information who may not necessarily understand the way media businesses run.\n\n\u201cOur experience in Nigeria, even during the military era and till now is that our ministers of information are always obsessed to control the way we think. They define responsibility within regime success than the survival of the country.\n\n\u201cThey appropriate to themselves the authority to interprete who is patriotic or not. It has been revealed that in most cases, they are the least patriotic. The current attempt and amendment is worse than what we have had. It strives to create a monster of a minister. So if the minister doesn\u2019t like your face, he can destroy your business. He can de-list you, he can cause you to be sent to jail. Not withstanding that we have laws of defamation, we have libel, and lots of ugly anti-press laws that are in the books that should be removed in a democracy. But because we are dealing with people with bunker mentality, that is why we are where we are!\n\n\u201cI have been saying it to people that we should call out Lai Mohammed. We can see voice of Jacob and the hands of Esau. We should call him out; that free-press is an important element of democracy.\n\nThey already have the broadcast media in their grip, they want to choke them with NBC code.\n\n\u201cWhen press freedom is defined in Nigeria, generally, it is defined within the ambit of the private print press. That is what they want to seize and destroy. They want to take us back to what is called the \u201cChina model\u201d in the military regime.\n\n\u201cIt is evil, it is reprehensible and should be fought, we should call them out individually and let them know that this country is greater than them and that they should just back-off.\u201d\n\nMedia collaboration\n\nAdefaye urged the media and civil society to come together and work as a team against \u201cthis evil\u201d because \u201cthese people are trying to do damage to media business, to free speech, and free press. Many of them were bystanders in the struggle to have democracy in this country.\n\n\u201cSo, the media should not go to sleep, they should shout and let them know that if they should go about committing this evil, they will face civil disobedience because nobody will respect that law.\u201d\n\nNPO wants consideration of bill suspended\n\nIndeed, the Nigeria Press Organisation, NPO, had last week, asked the House of Representatives Committee on Information, National Orientation, Ethics and Values to step down the bill seeking amendment to the Nigeria Press Council (NPC) establishment Act over a pending court litigation.\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Leadership Newspapers, and representative of the organisation, Mr. Azu Ishiekwene, while speaking before the committee last Thursday, recalled that in 2010, the NPO got a court ruling that 17 of 39 clauses in the Press Freedom Bill are unconstitutional, a decision the Federal Government appealed and got a ruling in its favour in December 2015, but noted that the said ruling was again appealed by NPO and is still pending in the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThe matter that is under consideration now is before the Supreme Court. In 2010, the NPO which is the umbrella organisation for the Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria, NPAN, the Nigerian Guild of Editors, NGE, and the Nigerian Union of Journalists, NUJ \u2014 these are the constituents part of the NPO.\n\n\u201cIt is a matter that has been pending in court since 1999 but the first decisive ruling in the matter came in 2010 when the high court ruled that 17 out of the 39 clauses in the bill are unconstitutional. The Federal Government appealed and got a ruling in December 2010. That ruling was again appealed by the NPO and it is pending in the Supreme Court,\u201d he noted, saying for that reason, the bill should be stepped down.\n\nCourt can\u2019t stop us from passing bill \u2014Odebunmi\n\nResponding, chairman of the committee, Rep Odebunmi, said: \u201cNo court will stop us from passing the bill. We have the mandate of the National Assembly and the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nIn its submissions, the Nigerian Press Council, through its Executive Secretary, Mr. Francis Nwosu, admitted that there had been an existing litigation over certain provisions in the law. He opined that certain proposals in the amendment bill will ensure quality control.\n\nOn the preparation of code of ethics for practitioners, the NPC said there is need for stakeholders to be involved and fully carried along to ensure wide acceptability. \u201cThe power to appoint should be bequeathed to the Council,\u201d Nwosu stated.\n\nThe NPC said its existence is not only desirable as it serves as an efficient and inexpensive forum for hearing complaints, and in addition, \u201cas alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanism that helps in reducing the barrage of litigation that otherwise would clog the courts.\u201d\n\nSponsor of draconian NPC, NBC bills has no media background, knowledge\n\nMeanwhile, as Nigerians rise against the amendments being proposed to the NPC and NBC Acts, it has emerged that the sponsor of the two draconian bills, Olusegun Odebunmi, has neither media knowledge nor industry experience.\n\nOdebunmi has never gone to any journalism school or practiced as a media person, according to his profile sighted by Vanguard.\n\nThe profile indicates that Odebunmi, who is popularly known as Bunvic, studied Secretarial Administration at the Federal Polytechnic, Ede, Osun State and came out with an Ordinary Diploma before enrolling at the University of Ado-Ekiti for a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Education.\n\nHe had his primary education at Baptist Day School, Oko, Oyo State, between 1974 and 1980 after which he enrolled at Baptist Secondary Grammar School, Oko, Oyo State, where he passed his West African School Certificate Examinations.\n\nBefore delving into politics, Odebunmi, who was born to the family of Pa & Late Madam Odebunmi of Olokose\u2019s Compound, Isale Ejigbo in Oko, Surulere Local Government, Oyo State, was into distribution and marketing of petroleum products and farming.\n\nHe first won election into the House of Representatives in 2011 and was re-elected in 2015, 2019 and has continued to wax strong in the political affairs of his state, turning his attention rather curiously from his secretarial administration and teaching to the regulation of the Nigerian media, an area he has zero experience or competence in.\n\nOdebunmi served as three-time chairman of Surulere Local Government, Oyo State, Commissioner, Oyo State Local Government Service Commission. At other times, he had served as the Treasurer, Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, IPMAN, Ibadan Depot and as Treasurer, of the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria, ALGON, Secretary of Petroleum\n\nDealers and Marketers Association, Ogbomoso Branch, Patron, Christian Association Of Nigeria, CAN.\n\nBunvic is responsible for the series of amendments sought to change the NPO and NBC bills, which media operatives and editors have slammed as being anti-media and meant to stifle them.\n\nA peep into the bills showed that the sponsors surrendered the little independence being enjoyed at the moment to the government, which he wants to decide what constitutes \u2018the truth\u2019 in newspaper publication and punish those who deviate from the norm set by the Act.\n\nSimilarly, Odebunmi wants the government to exert stricter control on the broadcast industry by making the President and the Information Minister the determinants of who is appointed into the board of the NBC to ensure more efficiency, something the Nigerian Guild of Editors, describes as capable of killing the industry.",

          "text": "The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB, yesterday released results of the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME, which started last Saturday.\n\nJAMB Registrar, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, who disclosed this at a briefing in Enugu, said he had no reason whatsoever to withhold the results of the UTME.\n\n\u201cThe result ought to be out by now, but because I am not at the headquarters and I do not want to approve it while on the field.\n\n\u201cBut as soon as I get to Abuja today (yesterday), all the examinations, up to the one being taken today (yesterday), will be approved and released because we have no reason to continue to hold on to it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe registrar said his team was in the Southeast to assess what was going on with the conduct of the examinations as well as visit new University in Ebonyi.\n\nHe noted that JAMB registered 1,415,501 candidates in the UTME 2021 and 1,122, 095 had taken the examinations so far while 66,111 had yet to take.\n\nAccording to him, the board has some 650 examination centres across the country, out of which 30 centres have been delisted for performing below standard.\n\n\u201c53 centres are currently under watch, while 600 of them performed excellently. It is our wish and desire that the board will continue to ensure that such non-performing centres with ulterior motive will not be allowed to participate in the exercise,\u201d he said.\n\nOloyede explained that the use of National Identity Number, NIN, as directed by the federal government helped to reduce malpractice during the examinations.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe were talking about the bogus 2.2 million candidates, but it has become clearer that more than 500,000 of such number are fake and duplication. And we were able to detect this through NIN and now we have realistic number of JAMB candidates.\u2019\n\nThe JAMB boss frowned on the activities of some elements to sabotage the exercise, but noted that they were all caught due to the system put in place for the examinations.\n\nHe added that those students who visited a particular centre but could not write the examination would be given a new date.\n\n\u201cApart from registration fee, we did not collect any other money from candidates, but some pay as much as N25,000 to some elements to help them.\n\n\u201cEven some parents were paying N1,000 to somebody who did not finish primary six to help their children, but they will surely pay for it because we will delist them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe registrar noted that the security situation in the Southeast was not as bad as the mainstream media and social media projected it.\n\n\u201cI came here myself with four directors and nothing has happened to us. I want to commend the media for their criticism and support which made the 2021 UTME successful,\u201d Oloyede said.",

          "text": "\u2026Insist only negotiation by govt, not use of force, can stop it\n\n\u2026Asks govs to stop \u2018political amnesty\u2019, back it with actions\n\n\u2026Urges Buhari to invite IPOB for negotiations\n\n\u2026Army dismisses Gumi\u2019s allegation, says troops not colluding with bandits\n\nBy Kingsley Omonobi\n\nRenown Islamic scholar, Ahmad Gumi, claimed yesterday that bandits operating in Nigeria were doing so in connivance with some security agents in the country.\n\nHe also described the banditry going on in Nigeria as a tribal war between herders and other tribes in the country, attributing this to the killings in the South West and South East.\n\nGumi, who spoke in an interview on Arise TV, said: \u2018\u2019These bandits are operating with a lot of people in the security system. This is business, otherwise, how can these big weapons they use cross the borders into the country if money is not exchanging hands.\u2019\u2019\n\nExplaining that the banditry in Nigeria was more of tribal war between herders and other tribes, Gumi said it was further compounded by the partiality of the government.\n\nAccording to him, government which is supposed to be neutral is taking sides against the bandits, sending security agents after them.\n\n\u2018\u2019We over-simplify a very complex issue and this breeds confusion. Nigeria is fighting a tribal war and government is supposed to be neutral but it is not. This is what I saw in Zamfara; this is what I saw in Niger.\n\n\u201cWhen you say these bandits are committing atrocities, yes, agreed, they are committing crimes \u2013 they are killing people, they are kidnapping, they are raping, they are doing all sorts of atrocities. But, have you for once gone to their sides and see all sorts of atrocities that are also committed against them?\n\n\u201cSo that rather than wielding the big stick and relying on military action, the Federal Government will do well in restoring normalcy by engaging the bandits in negotiation and using willing volunteers among them to win the battle.\n\n\u2018\u2019Boko Haram leader, Shekau, had been causing havoc in the country for more than 10 years and the military could not kill him but ISWAP, a splinter group from Boko Haram was able to eliminate him. So is the case with the herdsmen. We can use them to suppress the criminals among them.\n\n\u201cAs we all know, at a point, the Boko Haram were ready for dialogue and at a point, they even recommended the current President (Buhari) to negotiate for them. Former President Olusegun Obasanjo even tried to broker peace with Boko Haram.\n\n\u2018\u2019People should be neutral in this tribal war. The children of herders who are now bandits are also being killed in different parts of the country. Look at what happened in Oyo area of the South West where herders and their children were killed.\n\n\u2018\u2019I don\u2019t speak for bandits committing atrocities; I also don\u2019t speak for those committing atrocities against the bandits, I\u2019m only trying to be neutral.\n\n\u2018\u2019People do not understand when I say it is ethnic war going on. You see Fulani fighting Yoruba in the South West, Igbo in the South East and other tribes in the north. I wonder why government should be taking sides with other tribes against herders. Bandits are ready to stop banditry if the military is ready to cooperate with them,\u2019\u2019 Gumi said.\n\nHe described the amnesty granted bandits in some states of the north as mere \u2018\u2019political amnesty\u2019\u2019, alleging it was not really backed up with actions in the form of building of schools, hospitals etc for the bandits and their children.\n\n\u2018\u2019What Masari granted in Katsina initially was a political amnesty, granted in front of the media for the bandits to surrender their guns. Amnesty should be in the form of providing hospitals, schools and other facilities.\n\n\u2018\u2019But now, there is relative peace in Katsina because the government now appears to be implementing real amnesty. We can understand why Zamfara cannot implement amnesty for bandits. It is because of financial constraints. We can take examples from the Niger Delta where government even gave militants the job of protecting oil pipelines in the region.\n\n\u2018\u2019The same can be done for bandits who have promised to guard the forests to enable farmers return to their farms and release hundreds of captives held by them. The bandits are ready to sit down with the government to discuss issues but I don\u2019t know why government is not forthcoming on this,\u2019\u2019 Gumi said.\n\nOn why he has not visited Ibarapa in Oyo State, and other parts of the south where there had been frequent killing of farmers by killer herders, the Islamic cleric said he had concluded arrangements to visit the South West this week, adding that the essence of the visit was to talk to the killer herders out of criminality and re-orientate them on how to behave well in their host communities.\n\nGumi said he also had plans to visit the South East for the same purpose, disclosing that the peace initiative he started with former President Olusegun Obasanjo was stalled by the death of a Fulani leader who was the intermediary between them and the bandits.\n\nOn the release of Tegina pupils kidnapped in Niger State, Gumi said the political atmosphere there was not encouraging peace, adding that the governor\u2019s formation of a vigilante group to go after bandits in the state had further compounded the situation.\n\nHe, however, said the bandits agreed to release all their captives in the forest, if the government cooperated with them and release their own colleagues in detention.\n\nHe, however, advised the federal government to also invite to the negotiation table the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, IPOB, to ask them why they had decided to take arms against the state.\n\n\u201cGovernment doesn\u2019t want to recognize that there are agitations. Even with the IPOB. If I were the government, I will go and sit down with them and ask what the problem is.\n\n\u201cWhy are you carrying weapons against your own country? So is the case with the herdsmen. They are ready to negotiate.\u201d\n\nReacting to Gumi\u2019s allegation yesterday, the Nigerian Army dismissed it in strong terms, saying troops would never collude with bandits and herdsmen perpetrating kidnapping and other atrocities against citizens.\n\nBrig Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, Director Army Public Relations, said in a statement, titled \u2018\u2019Nigerian Army not colluding with bandits\u2019\u2019: \u201cThe Nigerian Army wishes to state that contrary to Sheik Gumi\u2019s claims, the NA remains a bonafide symbol of national unity that has conducted its constitutional responsibilities in the most professional manner, in line with global best practices of adherence to the rules of engagement and protection of the fundamental human rights of the citizenry.\n\n\u2018The sweeping allegation peddled by the scholar is not only sad and unfortunate, but also a calculated attempt to denigrate the military and undermine the sacrifices of our patriotic troops who are working tirelessly to restore peace and stability across the country.\n\n\u201cIt is essential to remind ourselves that these same military being accused of connivance, are the ones who recently put their lives on the line to rescue abductees of Government Secondary School, Birnin Yauri, from kidnappers.\n\n\u201cWhile the NA will not attempt to excuse the possibility of black sheep among its fold, it must be stated unambiguously that it will not condone any form of sabotage or aiding and assisting the enemy by any personnel, as provisions for dealing decisively with such acts are crystallised in Section 45 (1) of the Armed Forces Act CAP A 20 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004.\n\n\u201cIt must also be pointed out, that while the military is very much receptive to constructive criticism, it should not be perceived as a gateway for derogatory comments that have the potential to embolden criminals.\n\n\u201cIt is also necessary to reiterate that patriotism must be taken to a trajectory where subversive conversations on the state are brought to the barest minimum.\n\n\u201cOpinion leaders are enjoined to demonstrate patriotism in building the peace, rather than being agents of distabilization, thereby aggravating the current security challenges facing the nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe NA wishes to reassure law abiding citizens, that troops will continue to conduct themselves professionally in consonance with the code of conduct guiding our operations in all combat engagements, in line with the provisions of the Nigerian constitution and global best practice.\n\n\u201cCitizens are enjoined to continue to support military operations by providing useful information to defence and security agencies and together, we shall rid our society of these criminal elements.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

There is no iota of truth in such mischievous and fallacious claims.\n\nSheikh Gumi\u2019s link with bandits should be investigated \u2013 Nigerians tell Buhari\u2019s govt\n\n\u201cIn case the self-acclaimed Islamic cleric has forgotten, may we remind him that neither IPOB nor ESN is a terrorist organization or killers like his bandit clients and allies. Spilling of blood is never part of our mandate.\n\n\u201cESN is a child of necessity created for the defense of our ancestral land against terrorists and killer herdsmen wrecking havoc across our communities. ESN is only defending our hapless mothers and sisters who have been raped, maimed and attacked without any justification by Fulani herdsmen.\n\n\u201cSince December 2020 when ESN was set up by our leader, these vampires have been on the run because of the heat from our gallant operatives across Biafran forests. For Sheikh Gumi who never gave a hoot while killer herdsmen rampaged our communities to try to twist the fact now is not only mischief but an act of terror itself.\n\n\u201cNo Northerner in any part of Biafra land can prove that he/she has at any time been attacked by IPOB or ESN. We are only chasing terrorists and bandits behind killings and kidnapping for ransom in our land.\n\n\u201cGumi should be ashamed that an Islamic cleric as he claims has suddenly become a mouthpiece for bandits and terrorists. Why does Gumi have special interest in bandits and terrorists is an indication that he is a terrorist but has never shown any empathy to their victims or other Nigerians? Why is Gumi always advocating for terrorists and negotiating with them but never advancing the cause of victims of terror? What does Sheikh Gunmi have in common with bandits and terrorists?\n\n\u201cGumi only wants to blackmail IPOB and ESN with his fabricated propaganda that we are attacking Northerners so as to provide more justification for his Fulani terrorists security agencies in Nigeria uniforms to come after innocent people as they are currently doing. This terror sympathizer wants to lessen the heat on his boys by instigating the security agencies against us. Can you see why Sheikh Gunmi should be arrested for investigations and interrogations?\n\n\u201cWe want to put the world on notice that Sheikh Gumi is the main sponsor banditary and terrorism in Nigeria. He should be made to face the consequences of his actions. For holding talks with terrorists and championing their cause, he has a case to answer in the atrocities\n\n\u201cBut we promise Gumi and his likes that no amount of distraction will make us back down on our resolve to restore Biafra, and defend our ancestral land against invasion by Fulani jihadists. We are formidable and we won\u2019t give up on this mandate. ESN will not allow any person to occupy our forests again.\u201d\n\nIPOB vs bandits: Sheikh Gumi will set Nigeria on fire \u2013 Omokri",

It\u2019s a government thing and it\u2019s the Minister that can talk about it. So, thank you,\u201dhe clarified when he spoke to State House Correspondents after the weekly meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC).\n\nAsked to react to ECOWAS Court ruling against Nigeria for suspending the micro-blogging platform, Twitter, Adesina said the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, was studying the ruling that Twitter users cannot be arrested or prosecuted and would advise the federal government on the next step to take.\n\nAdesina affirmed that the committee made up of ministers to engage with Twitter has begun to meet.\n\nAdesina said that President Muhammadu Buhari has approved that the Second Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report should be done.\n\n\u201cThe only thing of interest I would like to talk about is the second Peer Review Country\u2019s Self-assessment Report.\n\n\u201cNigeria is ready for the second Peer Review Country Self -assessment Report to be done by AUDA-NEPAD. I think the last self-assessment report was done 10 years ago in Nigeria. Now, Nigeria is ready for the second review self-assessment report.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been discussed at the Council and the President has granted the approval that that peer review report can be conducted on Nigeria.\n\n\u201cActually, if you have an insight into the report that was presented, which the woman in charge of NEPAD, Mrs. Akobundu, can give you, Nigeria has made progress in several areas and on several fronts.\n\n\u201cWhile 10 years ago, petroleum contributed more than 70%, even up to 90%, to GDP, you will find that today, petroleum contributes just about 45% and non-oil products contribute about 55% to the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cSo, if Nigeria had been talking of diversification for 40, 50, 60 years, the economy can now be said to be diversified because our GDP, non-oil revenue, contributes about 55% to 45% of oil.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s one of the highlights of the Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report that was presented at the Council meeting today. Details of that can be gotten from the AUDA-NEPAD office.\u201d",

Sabi Abdullahi, during plenary, yesterday.\n\nHe had raised Points of Order 14 and 15 of the Senate Standing Rule in reaction to a report credited to a news medium on \u201croof leakage of the National Assembly complex.\u201d\n\nThe National Assembly, was on Tuesday, thrown into chaos, following a massive leakage in the roof of the building housing the chambers of the Senate and the House of Representatives. It obstructed Senate plenary session\n\nIn his remarks, Lawan said media reports that the money had been approved and siphoned by the leadership of the National Assembly was false.\n\nHe explained how they secured President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s approval to ensure the dilapidated structure was fixed immediately.\n\n\u201cThe fact that there was a leakage, to me it is a clear testimony, confirmation and vindication of the position the National Assembly took initially.\n\n\u201cBy the time we came into office and our endorsement, the Speaker and I found it necessary to go round this Senate and we found out dilapidation and degradation.\n\n\u201cIn fact, anyone who sees what we have here knows that this place is overdue for rehabilitation. It is even worse downstairs.\n\n\u201cSo, we complained to the president that there is the need to rehabilitate and renovate the National Assembly complex after in use for about 20 years and not rehabilitated at all.\n\n\u201cThe president was gracious and he asked us to come back, engage the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) who are the owners of this building and the technical side of the National Assembly and some contractors to come up with what we need to rehabilitate here and the cost.\n\n\u201cIn fact, I fought against the initial submissions because I was to take the document directly to the President.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw what they were bringing, I say there was no way I could take that to Mr President, go and rework until they came up with N37 billion and I took that to the president.\n\n\u201cFor emphasis, when we approved the budget of N37 billion for the rehabilitation of this complex, it was not a National Assembly budget, it was an FCDA budget, we have nothing to do with this,\u2019\u2019 Lawan said.\n\nTwenty four hours after an early morning downpour flooded the lobby of the two chambers of the National Assembly, Acting Executive Secretary of FCDA, Mrs Zalihau Ahmed, said all the necessary paperwork had been concluded, but said the delayed approval by the Federal Executive Council (FEC), was hampering the take off of the work.\n\nMrs Ahmed said a no objection from the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) had already been given, paving the way for the take off of the old structure.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the leakage that happened on Tuesday in the National Assembly. Everything is in the table. The National Assembly approved the N37 billion in the 2020 budget. We have done everything. We have also gotten a no objection from the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP).\n\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t proceed until the Federal Executive Council (FEC) approves the contract. As soon as they approve the contract, full renovation work will commence. As you know, we can\u2019t award a contract of that nature without an approval from FEC.

          "text": "A pan-Arewa group, Northern Youth Elders Forum (NYEF), has endorsed Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, for 2023 presidency.\n\nSpeaking during a meeting in Bauchi, yesterday, National Chairman of the group, Eliot Afiyo, said Mohammed was picked from among 27 prominent Nigerians who were considered as possible presidential candidates for 2023.\n\nHe said the Bauch governor came tops during a shadow election on likely future presidents at the 27th delegates conference of NYEF in Yola, Adamawa State. He said all 48 exco members of the group attended and voted for the governor without any dissension.\n\nThe NYEF chairman said the group took interest in Mohammed when he defeated a sitting Bauchi governor in 2007 to emerge senator. He said Mohammed again proved his popularity in 2019 when he defeated an incumbent to become Governor of Bauchi State.\n\n\u201cThe boldness and overwhelming passion he displayed in the Senate when he promoted the Doctrine of Necessity motion that steadied the ship of state in the wake of late President Umar Yar\u2019Ardua\u2019s illness and brought peace to the country announced Bala Mohammed\u2019s trajectory as a future national leader who would be needed someday. That day has come,\u201d Afiyo said.\n\nHe said Mohmmed\u2019s \u201cgood record of service as FCT minister; his performance showed him as the Moses who, someday, would take the country to the promised land.\u201d\n\nHe said after due consideration of Mohammed\u2019s sterling leadership qualities, NYEF had no doubt in endorsing him to run for the 2023 presidential election on the platform of any party of his choice.\n\nAfiyo said the group, which also endorsed President Olusegun Obasanjo, Umar Yar\u2019Adua, Goodluck Jonathan and Muhammadu Buhari when they vied for president in 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015, will mobilise for Governor Mohammed to emerge victorious in 2023.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency should consider this as a call to duty; you cannot decline,\u201d he said\n\nThe NYEF boss warned that if Mohammed declines to run for president in 2023, his group \u201cwould be compelled to mobilise its 4, 000-strong membership to work against Governor Mohammed, even up to his local government.\u201d\n\nMohammed , in his response, said he had a feeling of fulfilment and accomplishment to note that NYEF, \u201cafter traversing the north canvassing their points and consulting widely, came to the conclusion that he earned their confidence to run for president.\u201d\n\nHe said even if he doesn\u2019t run for president, he considered his nomination and endorsement a great honour not just to him, but to Bauchi and a commendable approach to leadership recruitment.\n\nMohammed expressed gratitude to God for the opportunities to rise to the directorate cadre in the Federal Civil Service, get elected as senator, serve as minister and later elected governor.\n\nThe governor asked the group to give him time to consult with various stakeholder groups and constituencies that make up his political family, including Bauchi people, governors, National Assembly members, former ministers with whom he served, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and more importantly, his primary constituency, the PDP at state and national levels.\n\nHe said the challenges facing the country were enormous and expressed the need for NYEF to build bridges that would rescue the country from the precipice.\n\n\u201cWe need to build a bridge; the country is on a precipice.

          "text": "\u2022Call Mohammed to order, Media leaders urge Buhari\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe presidency has washed its hands off the current attempt by the National Assembly to amend the Nigerian Press Council (NPC) Act and the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Act, a move, media stakeholders and other Nigerians have condemned as an attempt to gag the press.\n\nIn a swift response, the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) and the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) have urged President Muhammadu Buhari to call the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed to order, accusing the minister of being the brain behind the antagonistic amendment bills.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, who spoke yesterday with journalists after the weekly meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), said although it is an initiative of the government, only the Minister of Information and Culture, Mohammed, can address it.\n\nHis words: \u201cThat is not strictly a presidency thing because the president has nothing to do with that. It\u2019s a government thing and it\u2019s the minister that can talk about it. So, thank you.\u201d\n\nHe also informed that there was nothing to report on the FEC meeting as the issues discussed were not meant for public consumption at this stage.\n\nThe spokesman, however, revealed that the president has approved that the Second Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report should be done.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe only thing of interest I would like to talk about is the second Peer Review Country\u2019s Self-assessment Report. Nigeria is ready for the second Peer Review Country Self -assessment Report to be done by AUDA-NEPAD. I think the last self-assessment report was done 10 years ago in Nigeria. Now, Nigeria is ready for the second review self-assessment report. It\u2019s been discussed at the council and the president has granted the approval that that peer review report can be conducted on Nigeria.\n\n\u201cActually, if you have an insight into the report that was presented, which the woman in charge of NEPAD, Mrs. Akobundu, can give you, Nigeria has made progress in several areas and on several fronts.\n\nWhile 10 years ago, petroleum contributed more than 70%, even up to 90%, to GDP, you will find that today, petroleum contributes just about 45% and non-oil products contribute about 55% to the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cSo, if Nigeria had been talking of diversification for 40, 50, 60 years, the economy can now be said to be diversified because our GDP, non-oil revenue, contributes about 55% to 45% of oil. So, it\u2019s one of the highlights of the Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report that was presented at the Council meeting today. Details of that can be gotten from the AUDA-NEPAD office.\u201d\n\nThe Media Adviser also disclosed that the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, is studying the ruling by the ECOWAS Court to the effect that Twitter users cannot be arrested or prosecuted following the suspension of the activities of the microblogging site in the country.\n\nAccording to him, the AGF would advise the federal government on the next step to take.\n\nAdesina confirmed that the committee made up of ministers to engage Twitter over its suspension has commenced work.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney-General of the Federation is going to study that report and then he\u2019ll advise the government on the way forward.\n\n\u201cThe committee set up by the president to engage with Twitter is actually holding a meeting about now, or it will hold a meeting this afternoon (Wednesday) towards engaging with Twitter,\u201d he said.\n\nMedia Leaders Urged Buhari to Call Information Minister to Order\n\nMeanwhile, the NGE and NUJ have urged the president to call the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed to order.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, the General-Secretary of NGE, Mr. Iyobosa Uwugiaren, said the media leaders found it \u201cextremely hard to agree with the Special Adviser (Media) to the President, Mr. Femi Adesina, that the presidency has no hand in the proposed media amendment bills before the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that if the president has no hand in the bill, he should ask Mohammed, who is his employee to hands off the matter also.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe insist that the current attempts to criminalise journalism practice in Nigeria will have terrible, huge consequences on our democracy; because an independent press, which the federal government is trying to crush, is one of the indispensable pillars of democracy.\n\n\u201cThe media is referred to as Fourth branch of government because it also supports the balance of power in the government. Without a vibrant and independent press, the whole idea of a democracy system of government begins to deteriorate and after a short period the democracy will crumble.\u201d\n\nHe argued that the concept of a free press was purposefully and deliberately invented to preserve freedom of the people, adding that when freedom of the press is threatened, it is a threat to growing democracy.\n\nNUJ has also asked the promoters of the bill to suspend the plot especially now that the presidency has denied involvement in the obnoxious bill.\n\nNUJ President, Mr. Chris Isiguzo, spoke while reacting to the denial by the presidency that they had no hand in the plot.\n\nIsiguzo said having denied involvement, the presidency should follow it up by calling the minister of information to order since it is the same government.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe expect the president to quickly call his minister and all those behind these obnoxious bills to order. They should withdraw the bills and ensure that relevant stakeholders are engaged properly before thinking of any amendment.\n\n\u201cOf course, our position is clear. You cannot embark on an amendment that will directly impact us without getting us involved. It\u2019s the same as shaving a man\u2019s head in his absence.\n\n\u201cDenial is not just enough, let the presidency call its officials involved in this anti-people journey to order.\u201d\n\nHe said the media is not afraid of any amendment or regulation but that stakeholders must be allowed to regulate the industry as is the practice in other climes.\n\n\u201cBy the time, we agree on the most appropriate template, we\u2019ll now restart the process. But for now, the entire process should be stepped down,\u201d Isiguzo said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Petrol Smuggling Rises to 42m Litres Daily, NNPC Cries Out",
          "text": "\u2022Says subsidy hits N150bn monthly\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nNigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) yesterday lamented the escalating incidence of petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders, which it puts at a whopping 42 million litres per day.\n\nThe corporation said the unbridled smuggling has increased Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily consumption of 60 million litres to 102 million litres.\n\nWith the menace now gaining more momentum and illegal dealers more daring, the oil company stated that the subsidy that the government pays on petrol every month, in order to keep the pump price of petrol stable at N162 per litre now hovers between N140 billion and N150 billion.\n\nThe development has made the corporation to be unable to contribute to the Federation Account, as the subsidy it pays has kept wiping out the little gains made from rising international oil prices, which has now exceeded $75 per barrel.\n\nNNPC Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, according to a statement yesterday by the corporation\u2019s General Manager, Public Affairs, Dr. Taiye Obateru, said on Tuesday in Abuja when he met with stakeholders, including the leadership of the EFCC, Department of State Services (DSS), Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and chief executives of agencies in the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, that smuggling had gone beyond what the NNPC could handle.\n\nSome other groups present during the stakeholders\u2019 meeting organised by the corporation to halt fuel smuggling included: the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), the National Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO), Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD), Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), Depot and Petroleum Marketers Association (DAPPMA).\n\nAt the meeting, also attended by the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) officials, Kyari said the country was bleeding from fuel smuggling, which is increasing the country\u2019s subsidy payment and exacerbating the foreign exchange crisis.\n\nKyari said the gathering was at the instance of President Muhammadu Buhari who mandated the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, the NNPC, the EFCC and all other security agencies to do everything possible to stop crude oil theft and illicit truck-out of petroleum products, which he described as major economic crimes that have hindered Nigerians from enjoying the benefits of subsidised petroleum products.\n\nHe urged all industry stakeholders to collaborate with the NNPC to ensure that the daily national petroleum products consumption, which shot up to 102 million litres in May, is reduced to about 60 million litres.\n\nHe added that it was obvious that that huge volume of petrol was not consumed by Nigerians alone.\n\nKyari said: \u201cWe all agree that smuggling is not a business that should be condoned because even for deregulated petroleum products, it brings extra cost burden on this country both in terms of safety and security of supply and in securing of foreign exchange. It even constitutes more burden to this country when the product involved is a regulated product like Premium Motor Spirit (PMS).\u201d\n\nAccording to him, with the increasing price of crude oil at the global market and the OPEC+ production cuts, the country cannot afford to shoulder the cost of smuggling.\n\n\u201cWe all know that our daily consumption is not up to 60 million litres. We all know that, and that is why we have to pull it down. We will pull it down by every means necessary,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said NNPC would introduce advanced cargo declaration in line with global best practices to tackle crude oil theft.\n\nKyari stated that going after smugglers is beyond the call of the corporation, adding that with the involvement of the EFCC, the situation will improve considerably.\n\nHe added: \u201cBut we in NNPC, we are not in control of that, we are not in every depot, we don\u2019t keep products in all the depots, but when the volume goes down, it comes down to us. When there is tight supply, it comes back to the NNPC and we solve the problem.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, with the extant directive from the president that smuggling has to be halted, all the stakeholders must now begin to work together to solve the problem, especially with the involvement of the security agencies.\n\nKyari said Buhari had instructed that the menace must be stopped by every means necessary, and called on the stakeholders present to think outside the box since all the layers of controls that had been put in place before now seemed to have failed.\n\nHe stated that with the current exchange rate and considering other price determinants, the pump price of petrol should be N256 per litre.\n\n\u201cWhat we sell today is N162, so the difference is at a cost to the nation,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nKyari stated that with the current high volume of daily consumption, the country can no longer sustain subsidy payment, and if the volume is not regulated, the bleeding will continue.\n\nHe said: \u201cI know that so much work is going on, and then we have to manage the volume that we are exposed to between this price of N162 and N256. The difference comes back to as much as N140 billion to N150 billion cost to the country monthly.\n\n\u201cAnd as long as the volume goes up, that money continues to increase and we have two sets of stress to face, the stress of supply and the stress of foreign exchange for the NNPC.\u201d\n\nMinister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, also decried the increasing rate of smuggling but expressed optimism that with the EFCC\u2019s involvement, the situation would change.\n\n\u201cWe brought in the big hammer, and the big hammer as you can see is the EFCC because it is economic sabotage and I believe with the EFCC in the picture, the system will work even better,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that whatever is being done in the area of deregulation will not make any impact without Nigeria knowing exactly its actual daily consumption of petrol.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came in as minister, I was informed that the daily consumption in the country was around 60 million to 62 million litres a day, which to me sounded a little bit outrageous, considering the number of cars we have on the road,\u201d he said.\n\nChairman of the EFCC, Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa, said since part of the commission\u2019s duty was to ensure the reduction of financial crimes, the EFCC would do all it could to stop smuggling.\n\nBawa assured Nigerians that everything will be done to stop smuggling, ensure that perpetrators are brought to book and justice is served.\n\nHe said smuggling of petroleum products was worrisome, and assured Nigerians that the EFCC was fully committed to the special operation, codenamed \u201cOperation White\u201d designed to check illegal exportation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Kasim Sumaina\n\nThe Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Mr. Olamilekan Adegbite, has applauded the staff of the sector for contributing and setting a new record for mining revenue generation as reported by the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI).\n\nAdegbite also charged the staff of the ministry to improve on their services in order to surpass its 2020 contribution to the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nIn his address at an event to mark the African Public Service Day celebration in Abuja Wednesday, with the theme: \u2018Developing Technology to Sustain Enhanced Service Delivery in the Face of COVID-19 Pandemic Climate\u2019, he disclosed that with the immense inputs of the management, staff and agencies in the realisation of the ministry\u2019s mandate, the solid mineral sector has contributed to the current growth of GDP of the federal government beating its old record.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI was reading the NEITI report that said that our sector has contributed and set a new record, beating our old record anyway. In terms of contribution to the country and I think this is not possible without the effort of all members staff of the sector, not just of the ministry including our parastatals and other agencies that are there. I think it\u2019s well deserved and I say congratulations.\u201d\n\nAdegbite, while speaking further at the event with awards presented to deserving staff of batch 2021 retirees of the ministry, said: \u201cYou see, for every kudos given to service in the ministry, it calls for a higher duty and improvement in what has been achieved,\u201d adding tha the ministry must surpass the goals of 2020, this year.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that we must improve on what we achieved in 2020. Because, this report is actually talking about 2020 and what that means is that, next year, we must surpass the goal of 2020. We are about half way through and what it means is that we must guide our loins and we do our bit. There is no work that is insignificant,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NEITI report had revealed that\n\nrevenue from the solid minerals sector grew by 15 per cent to hit N79.96 billion in 2019.\n\nThe 2019 audit report of the solid minerals sector also stated that revenue from the sector in 2018 was N69.47 billion.\n\nIt disclosed that the 2019 earnings accounted for 16 per cent of the total revenue of N496.28 billion which accrued to the federation from the sector over the period of 13 years (2007 to 2019) and is also the highest since 2007 when it commenced reconciliation of payments in the solid minerals sector.\n\nDespite the increase, the solid minerals sector accounted for just 0.51 per cent of total export in 2019, as the report showed that the sector recorded N124.23 billion of the total government exports of N24.275 trillion.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Dr. Oluwatoyin Akinlade, noted that among other things, the African Public Service Day (APSD) is driven within the agenda 2063, which is the blue print and master plan for transforming Africa into the global power house of the future.\n\nAkinlade tasks the ministry\u2019s workforce to remain focused and committed to efficient delivery of its mandate.\n\nAccording to her, the aim of the APSD agenda of sharing best global practice in information dissemination has been made easier and reforms in the public service of Nigeria presently are technology driven.\n\nShe, therefore, urged the staff to embrace technology and digitalization as inevitable enablers of efficient service delivery in order to avoid being left behind or rendered irrelevant in the emerging digital Federal Civil Service.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) says Islamic cleric Sheikh Ahmad Gumi is not only a spokesman for bandits and terrorists tormenting Nigerians but equally their main sponsor.\n\nThe group said it is obvious because the cleric is fond of defending bandits and also championing their cause.\n\nAccording to a statement released to SaharaReporters by the IPOB\u2019s media and publicity secretary, Emma Powerful on Thursday, the nation\u2019s security agents should arrest and prosecute Gumi.\n\nIPOB, in the statement, also insisted that the Eastern Security Network (ESN), the IPOB\u2019s militia arm was created to defend the people of the South-East from killers and criminals.\n\nIt noted that the bandits Gumi has been defending kidnap people for ransom, and also spill the blood of their victims.\n\nThe group released the statement to react to Gumi\u2019s comparison of IPOB and bandits as groups bearing arms in Nigeria while granting an interview on Arise TV on Wednesday.\n\nGumi said, \u201cIPOB is attacking the police, the army, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and other government institutions; killing our men in service.\n\n\u201cAnd the herdsmen are kidnapping children not to kill them but to get money; so how can you compare somebody who is killing our gallant men directly to somebody who is kidnapping children to make money and not to kill them. Look, we need some fairness in what we are doing.\u201d\n\nReacting, the Biafra separatist group said, \u201cThe attention of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, IPOB, led by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, has been drawn to the latest ranting and ridiculous claims by terrorist apologist, Sheikh Abubakar Gumi, that IPOB, and Eastern Security Network, ESN, were killing Northerners. There is no iota of truth in such a mischievous and fallacious claim.\n\n\u201cIn case the self-acclaimed Islamic cleric has forgotten, may we remind him that neither IPOB nor ESN is a terrorist organisation or killers like his bandit clients and allies. Spilling of blood is never part of our mandate.\n\n\u201cESN is a child of necessity created for the defence of our ancestral land against terrorists and killer herdsmen wreaking havoc across our communities. ESN is only defending our hapless mothers and sisters who have been raped, maimed and attacked without any justification by Fulani herdsmen.\n\n\u201cSince December 2020 when ESN was set up by our leader, these vampires have been on the run because of the heat from our gallant operatives across Biafran forests. For Sheikh Gumi who never gave a hoot while killer herdsmen rampaged our communities to try to twist the fact now is not only mischief but an act of terror itself.\u201d\n\nThe secessionist group also said it had not attacked any Northerners, adding that Gumi was only finding faults to blackmail IPOB.\n\nIt also said nothing would make IPOB abandon its objectives.\n\n\u201cNo Northerner in any part of Biafra land can prove that he/she has at any time been attacked by IPOB or ESN. We are only chasing terrorists and bandits behind killings and kidnapping for ransom in our land.\n\n\u201cGumi should be ashamed that an Islamic cleric as he claims has suddenly become a mouthpiece for bandits and terrorists. Why does Gumi have a special interest in bandits and terrorists is an indication that he is a terrorist but has never shown any empathy to their victims of other Nigerians (sic).\n\n\u201cWhy is Gumi always advocating for terrorists and negotiating with them but never advanced the cause of victims of terror? What does Sheikh Gumi have in common with bandits and terrorists?\n\n\u201cGumi only wants to blackmail IPOB and ESN with his fabricated propaganda he is, that we are attacking Northerners so as to provide more justification for his Fulani terrorist security agencies in Nigeria uniforms to come after innocent people as they are currently doing.\n\n\u201cThis terror sympathiser wants to lessen the heat on his boys by instigating the security agencies against us. Can you see why Sheikh Gumi should be arrested for investigations and interrogations?\n\n\u201cWe want to put the world on notice that Sheikh Gumi is the main sponsor of banditry and terrorism in Nigeria. He should be made to face the consequences of his actions. For holding talks with terrorists and championing their cause, he has a case to answer in the atrocities\n\n\u201cBut we promise Gumi and his likes that no amount of distraction will make us back down on our resolve to restore Biafra, and defend our ancestral land against invasion by Fulani jihadists. We are formidable and we won't give up on this mandate. ESN will not allow any person to occupy our forests again,\u201d the statement added.",

          "title": "Jesse Forrester started an e-mobility company in Kenya after deciding against going to university",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were to look at three different pictures of Jesse Forrester today, you will notice the same unmistakable red cap.\n\n\u201cIt was given to me by a dear friend and for me, it has just come to represent the people that have supported me and I carry them with me wherever I\u2019m going,\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nJesse Forrester and the Mazi Mobility team. Spot his red cap.\n\nHe pointed out how the hat contributes to his very pan-African life.\n\nJesse grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. After high school, he travelled to South Africa where he finished his A-levels at the African Leadership Academy (ALA).\n\nHis journey at ALA exposed him to several things including a wide network of pan-African thinkers.\n\nHis red cap has often gotten him mistaken as Nigerian, something he does not shy away from. But he never fails to remind people that the cap is actually from Tunisia in North Africa.\n\nAfter ALA, Jesse took up a fellowship. It was his first stab at being employed and he quickly found that it was not something that he fancied.\n\nThe idea of going to university didn\u2019t thrill him either. So he did something he\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 he started his own business.\n\nToday, his company Mazi Mobility is backed by global venture builder, Satgana, and is aiming at implementing an electric vehicle ecosystem in Africa. To this end, they recently launched a new fleet of electric bodas or motorcycles.\n\nWhen he speaks of Africa and the possibilities that exist in the space of e-mobility, his excitement is almost palpable.\n\nHe started his company without a university degree and he is now preparing himself to dominate the African e-mobility space.\n\nHis name is Jesse Forrester and this is his life in tech.\n\nIf you look back, you see it\n\nJesse grew up in Huruma flats in the Eastlands. He lived with both his parents but more time was spent with his mother.\n\nAs a child, he wanted to be a pilot but his interests varied. On some days he wanted to just sit by the television and watch a NatGeo documentary on exotic animals in the thick Amazon and on other days his PlayStation 2 was all the entertainment he needed.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t an exact time when he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a pilot anymore. It was just one of those things that\u2019s there one day but slowly faded away with time \u2013 like a puddle drying in the sun.\n\nHis varying interests expanded to include his small businesses in school \u2013 selling lemonade and sweets. He also enjoyed tinkering with things \u2013 pulling them apart and putting them together.\n\nMazi Mobility, Jesse\u2019s startup, is making it easier for boda riders to own and use electric vehicles that help save the planet by reducing CO emissions.\n\nTo pinpoint when in his life he got the inspiration to want a cleaner Africa, you would need to consider two things; a minister who did his job and a matatu\u2019s smoke cloud.\n\nIn 2004, a man named John Michuki was the Minister of Transportation in Kenya. During that time, the state of buses, or matatus, in the country was terrible. These vehicles had no speed governors, seat belts and would often carry more passengers than they were supposed to.\n\nMichuki established the \u2018Michuki Rules\u2019 which served as a game-changer for the transport sector by providing strict guidelines for matatus at the time. But one thing they inadvertently did was inspire a prepubescent Jesse.\n\n\u201cI actually saw a meaningful change that had a huge impact. And according to my mum, I said I wanted to become something in transport like transport minister.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2018 and Jesse was back from studying in South Africa and living in Nairobi again.\n\n\u201cI was walking around the city, just going on my errands, this massive matatu cuts me off and just as it\u2019s leaving and I have a mouth full of swear words, the thing just blows a huge amount of smoke in my face.\u201d\n\nSet 14 years apart, these two events paved the way for the creation of Mazi Mobility but also helped inform the decisions of a young man who really cares about his environment.\n\n\u201cJesse, meet Tech\u201d\n\n\u201cMy foray into tech really happened in secondary school, where I learned a lot about what actually makes up a game and how to actually make it,\u201d Jesse told me over our WhatsApp call.\n\nHis introduction to tech came in the form of MIT\u2019s Scratch Blocks. The program allowed people to develop programming skills by using blocks to code visually.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just explore software, his tinkering came in handy when he got a chance to work with Arduino motherboards which allow people to create complex computer systems from scratch.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a good engineer, that was kind of my path because it would mix hardware and software.\u201d\n\nJesse\u2019s tango with tech did not end in high school. It followed him right into ALA.\n\nIn 2017, when bitcoin was still worth only $2,000, blockchain was primarily known as the technology behind bitcoin and not much else. For Jesse, it became an interesting tool.\n\n\u201cI was part of a blockchain club. I was running for treasurer [in student government], and the decision was to have the elections on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to win the elections and also create a project that would win his school $100,000.\n\nThe journey to Mazi by way of ALA\n\n\u2018Mazi\u2019 was not always \u2018Mazi Mobility\u2019. At one point, in the time before Jesse got into ALA, it was a photography collective \u2013 one of Jesse\u2019s many interests.\n\nBut getting into the Africa Leadership Academy was not the smoothest ride for him.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you must know, it is that Jesse Forrester sets high expectations for himself. He first heard of the Academy when he turned 12 and he knew he wanted to attend but the minimum age was 15 so he decided to wait.\n\nAt 15, he was in the middle of his high school education and decided not to apply until he was done. In his final year of high school, he finally applied.\n\n\u201cThey waitlisted me. So I had a chip on my shoulder where I had to prove that I\u2019ve got the leadership potential to get into the school.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was the creation of Mazi \u2013 a photography collective with a focus on creating discourse around the environment, speaking at a TEDx talk, and getting networking certifications.\n\nAnd what did he do with all these things? He sent ALA an update. They needed to know that he was meant to be there.\n\nThis time they listened. He was accepted and resumed in South Africa for his 2-year course.\n\nAt ALA, Jesse was a part of the team behind \u201cThe Living Machine\u201d a water treatment system that won them the $100,000 Zayed Sustainability Prize in 2019.\n\nAfter his encounter with the smoky matatu in 2018, Jesse decided he wanted to start a company that provided electric matatus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start with putting solar panels on matatus but I quickly realised that was not smart because you need like 60 of them for one matatu.\u201d\n\nWith a few calls, he was able to connect with his co-founder and founding investor Troy Barrie.\n\nWhile they discussed kicking off the business, Jesse had to leave the country briefly to present a report on The Living Machine in Abu Dhabi. During this trip, he also got a chance to interview musician and investor, Akon.\n\nJesse with Akon\n\nWhen he returned and settled down, he quit his job and focused full time on Mazi. They made plans to begin getting investors. This was March 2020.\n\nBuilding Mazi through a pandemic and looking to the future\n\n\u201cSo now we are back to running a hardware business, in Africa, in a pandemic?\u201d Jesse laughed when he said this. It was ridiculous to even think about.\n\nThe potential investors all seemed to say the same things: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on our portfolio companies right now. Let\u2019s touch base in about a year.\u201d\n\nAnd who could blame them, 2020 was a weird year.\n\nBut he needed to raise money and to most people, Jesse just seemed crazy. While Jesse dealt with the anxiety and despair that came with 2020, he also had to get enough money to match his founding investor\u2019s investment.\n\nA $15,000 fund from ALA helped turn things around and in February the electric motorcycles landed in Kenya \u2013 sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing is, when you import something from China, especially these bikes, you have no manuals whatsoever. So we had no way of knowing what to assemble because there was a huge language barrier, so it was incredibly challenging.\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that one of my chief engineers is a really smart guy and a biker.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, the team would spend time figuring out the bikes and how to assemble them. They were working \u201cfrom eight to eight\u201d.\n\nA deadline for a prototype bike was fast approaching and during our call, Jesse reminisced about what it felt like at the time.\n\nThey were just four men in his living room, trying to put an electronic boda together. It was a Saturday when they decided they were going to have to work all night to figure it out. That night, they had ugali and eggs for dinner.\n\nBy 6 am on Sunday, with none of them having slept a wink, they had built their first product, by themselves, in Jesse\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cAnd right now I\u2019m really proud to say that all the bikes we have are fully assembled here in Kenya, by Kenyans. And we have the capacity to assemble \u2013 with a really small team \u2013 over 200 bikes, a month from parts all the way up. Without investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always tell investors, \u2018You guys give us X cash, you can imagine what we can do.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nI asked Jesse Forrester, as I always do with these interviews, to tell me what plans he has for the future.\n\n\u201cThe total estimated addressable market right now stands at about $12 billion in East Africa, for electric motorbikes alone, and I say hey we want to capture a fraction of the market so I want to do over 1000 bodas by the end of next year. I want to get to over 5000 bodas by the end of 2023 with up to 200 tuktuks and 100 matatus.\u201d\n\nFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears, Jesse.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "SEC approves Chaka as first licensed stock trading app in Nigeria",
          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians. In April, SEC sounded a warning that seemed to declare such offerings as being illegal.\n\nOsibodu\u2019s coy response was that Chaka is committed to SEC\u2019s objectives for financial inclusion in Nigeria by, among other things, increasing retail investor participation in the financial markets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\n.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "From Konga to mPharma, logistics for health products is growing in Africa",
          "text": "\u201cPeople order drugs on Jumia?\u201d\n\nThat was the reaction from the most ardent online shopper I know. She buys running shoes, mom jeans and hair products but doesn\u2019t understand why anyone would buy drugs online. It just doesn\u2019t feel right for her to buy ingestible medicines on the same website she shops for underwear.\n\nBut a search under Jumia\u2019s \u2018medications & treatments\u2019 tab reveals syrups, nasal sprays, and pain relief capsules. At the bottom of their healthcare page, a blurb assures visitors that products listed on the website are from \u201cvarious trusted brands that will meet your health needs.\u201d\n\nIndeed, African e-commerce marketplaces are venturing into the delivery of health care products as part of a strategy to broaden their value to customers.\n\nThese platforms are part of a broader crop of innovators at an interesting intersection of healthcare and logistics on the continent. Going by recent data, this sub-sector has grown over two years.\n\nAt least 61 companies are using tech for health distribution across sub-saharan Africa, a growth of over 100% in the number of active players (28) captured in 2018. That\u2019s according to a report by Salient Advisory, an Africa-focused healthcare consultancy.\n\nThese health logistics companies include e-commerce players like Jumia, Copia and Konga, and also core health startups like mPharma, Lifestores Pharmacy, Chekkit and Sproxil. Salient\u2019s report focuses on companies delivering over-the-counter products, hence it does not include LifeBank which specializes in blood and oxygen products.\n\nMost of these companies are in Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda and Kenya with only 6 spotted in the francophone region. 31% of the companies surveyed were founded within the last two years and 62% operate in a single African country.\n\nSnapshot of innovators in the health products distribution space in Africa. Source: Salient Advisory.\n\nSalient categorizes the landscape of companies into three groups by the type of service they deliver: consumer-facing companies, producer-facing companies and product data companies.\n\nThe first group of companies (like Drugstore.ng) deliver over-the-counter and prescription drugs as well as virtual patient care to individuals. Provider-facing ones serve healthcare businesses either by delivering to them, hosting an online marketplace, providing inventory management tools (an example here is Lifestores Pharmacy) and/or offering financing.\n\nThe third group offers data related services like product analytics and drug authenticity verification. An example in this category is Chekkit, a verification technology startup that was recently accepted into Google for Startups accelerator programme for 2021.\n\nTraditional e-commerce platforms like Jumia, Copia and Konga are able to play in the consumer and provider-facing buckets. Because of their presence in multiple African countries, all three companies surpass the combined reach of other direct-to-consumer startups in the health product distribution space.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing can accelerate access to medicines and have an incredible impact on public health,\u201d says Yomi Kazeem, one of the authors of Salient Advisory\u2019s report.\n\nAccording to Konga\u2019s co-CEO Nick Imudia, the e-commerce company\u2019s plan to deliver health products started shortly after they were acquired by the Zinox Group three years ago.\n\n\u201cWe started building warehouses and logistics assets to enable us to reach every local government area in the country,\u201d Imudia says to TechCabal.\n\nKonga.com is a marketplace where pharmaceutical companies can list health products like medicines. Konga delivers orders from those pharmacies to individual consumers.\n\nBut beyond fulfilling orders to individuals, Konga plans to go bigger by working on bulk orders between pharmacies and businesses or government agencies, Imudia says. That will require some investments on infrastructure for cold distribution and ensuring warehouses are of the right temperature.\n\nSalient Advisory\u2019s report notes that \u201cclear and harmonised regulations\u201d could boost this entry of e-commerce players into the health products distribution space.\n\nKonga has two licenses to directly distribute products for drug manufacturers and import drugs from the Pharmaceutical Council of Nigeria, Imudia says. But he clarifies that Konga will not act as a pharmacy by selling drugs directly to consumers \u2013 but will rely on its marketplace platform that allows merchants to sell on Konga.com\n\nHow big can this new business line be for Konga? Imudia declines to share what health products logistics currently contributes to Konga\u2019s overall business. But he believes it will be \u201ca major part\u201d of Konga\u2019s business in the future.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Hero Mode, all Troy wants is to work at Playfield, his mom\u2019s 12-year-old gaming company. But she insists he focus on a dull computer science course at school. The real reason, however, is that she wants him to have a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood away from video games.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Playfield is sinking. Their only potential angel investor bailed because their latest game sucked. A cheap buy offer from a rival is on the table.\n\nBut Troy convinces his mom to let him rebuild the game. He adds a rainbow that talks and a Barack Obama feature. And the rest is\u2026 actually, go watch the rest.\n\nReal life Troy stories are rare in Nigeria but an active gaming community is growing. Platforms like Twitch and Discord are spurring a global gaming economy and a means for financial independence for young Nigerians \u2013 like Olaide and Ying-Yi Akanji.\n\nThey met in 2012 at a GCE exam hall. When they started dating, Olaide introduced Ying-Yi (who is half-Nigerian, half-Taiwanese) to online gaming. Now married, they are an ardent gaming couple.\n\nWhile speaking with them on Tech Republic \u2013 a weekly radio show produced by 88.5 UFM Lagos in collaboration with TechCabal \u2013 I felt nudged to pick a controller and earn some recharge card money, at least. But how does a rusty Millennial get started?\n\nBelow is an excerpt of the chat with the Akanji\u2019s, edited for clarity. Most questions are from Tech Republic hosts Jay and Didi.\n\nJay: What\u2019s the situation with gaming in Nigeria?\n\nOlaide: I have been playing video games since I was a kid. My first Playstation 2 was from my dad. I became very good at gaming but I felt it couldn\u2019t take me anywhere because our 300kbps internet was so bad. Playing online was just impossible.\n\nThen I moved to the UK to study software engineering and everything was better. I dived into e-sports and built a following on Twitch. But I was not comfortable with a foreign audience. Gaming was more fun when I moved back. I could chat and banter on my streams in Pidgin and Yoruba.\n\nBut then came the issues \u2013 internet and electricity. It was demotivating to the point where I almost quit. The main problem was ping \u2013 a measure of how fast you get responses when you click to pass or shoot or any other action.\n\nOur problem here is that when you click on a button for any of those actions, it needs to travel to a server in Europe before it returns to Nigeria. And if you are playing against someone in Europe, their ping is much faster. I may shoot him first but it may not get to him when I do; then he shoots a second later and wins. That\u2019s why you have not seen Nigerians breakthrough internationally.\n\nDidi: Okay, how do I get into gaming? Can I start now even if I didn\u2019t play as a kid?\n\nOlaide: Yes you can! That\u2019s what I love about gaming. When people tell me they don\u2019t like video games, I say you haven\u2019t tried it out. There are so many games out there, it\u2019s impossible for you to hate them all.\n\nA 16-year-old kid won $3million playing Fortnite in 2019 and I actually played in that tournament. I made it into the top 1,000 from the initial 80 million people. The top 100 played in the finals in the US.\n\nBut that prize money shows how this sport has grown. I think the biggest prize money ever won in Nigeria was around \u20a65million.\n\nJay: This is really an untapped market in Nigeria\n\nOlaide: Oh my God, there\u2019s so much potential. I\u2019ve had many conversations with companies that want to get into online gaming but they fear the risks. And it\u2019s understandable because you need 24/7 electricity.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories about NEPA taking power in the middle of a tournament. It\u2019s painful. When we compete against South Africans, they win because their internet is better.\n\nStill, the Nigerian gaming community is growing.\n\nDidi: How many female gamers are in Nigeria?\n\nYing-Yi: We have quite a few, but the gaming scene is saturated with guys. Girls in Nigeria have less time to play video games because they are more likely to do house chores, while guys can keep playing. Women gamers have to put in more effort. That means we are not a lot but we are getting there.\n\nParents also need to understand that gaming helps to improve cognitive reasoning of both boys and girls. Yes it can be sedentary but parents can set the balance between gaming and other activities.\n\nAlexander: So how do you pitch online gaming to people in government, as something good for the digital economy?\n\nOlaide: People are investing in electronic sports (esports) because every competition provides a level playing field for amateur and expert gamers. No connections needed.\n\nAnybody can buy a console, start playing and competing. Gamers like TimTheTatman are terrible at gaming but make millions because they make entertaining gaming videos. That opportunity should be open to all Nigerian youth looking for jobs and alternative income streams.\n\n\u2014\n\nListen to Tech Republic every Thursday at 2pm WAT on 88.5 UFM Lagos.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s human rights record is \u201cvery poor\u201d and is \u201cworse than [the] average in sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d a new report by an international organisation states.\n\nThe Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI) said, in the report, that Nigeria\u2019s score for economic and social rights falls within a \u2018very bad\u2019 range.\n\nThe report, which tracked the human rights performance of most countries, stated that Nigeria\u2019s mismanagement of resources is largely responsible for the country\u2019s unfortunate human rights crises.\n\n\u201cMillions of Nigerians could have better lives,\u201d HRMI said in the report made public on Thursday. \u201cIf Nigeria were to operate at its full potential given its current resources, we would expect an additional 12 million children under five to grow well and not be stunted.\n\n\u201cIf Nigeria were operating at best practice, we would expect an extra 3.6 million additional children to reach their fifth birthday,\u201d HRMI said.\n\nIt also noted that if Nigeria used its resources efficiently, an additional 122 million people could have access to basic sanitation and an extra 143 million people could have access to water on site.\n\nThe HRMI 2021 \u2018Rights Tracker\u201d is the first global report to assess the 13 different human rights contained in United Nations treaties for around 200 countries.\n\nThe report adopted two different methods for appraising a country\u2019s performance; with the first benchmark being \u2018income adjusted.\u2019\n\nUsing the income adjusted benchmark, the report compared countries with other countries of a similar income level, to evaluate how effectively each country is using its available resources.\n\n\u201cThe second benchmark is \u2018global test.\u2019 This benchmark evaluates country performance relative to the best performing countries at any level of resources,\u201d it said.\n\nEach assessment standard uses a set of indicators that are commonly available and most relevant for these countries, HRMI said. \u201cEvery country gets assessed on both standards to the extent the information is available in international databases.\u201d\n\nA careful examination of the report by PREMIUM TIMES conveys a picture at odds with the human rights record Nigeria\u2019s government repeatedly claimed has improved.\n\nOn fundamental issues about harsh economic realities, the report said, \u201cIf Nigeria were operating at its full potential given its current resources, it could lift 118 million people out of absolute poverty.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari in his speech on Democracy day claimed his government has lifted 10.5 million Nigerians out of poverty in the last two years, a statement described by a PREMIUM TIMES fact checker as \u201cgrossly misleading.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe civil and political rights data, and the people\u2019s risk responses were collected in February and March 2021, about events in the year 2020,\u201d HRMI said, an indication the Nigerian government\u2019s clampdown on EndSARS protesters in October 2020 may have counted against the country.\n\n\u201cThe economic and social rights data are based on figures from international databases and provide scores for every year from 2007 \u2013 2018,\u201d HRMI said.\n\nSadly, the report noted, Nigeria\u2019s scores for all four of these \u201ceconomic and social rights\u201d fall within the \u2018very bad\u2019 range.\u201d\n\nNigeria scored 54.6 per cent for right to food; 48.2 per cent for right to health; 31.7 per cent for right to housing and 32.0 per cent for right to work.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor all the four rights, Nigeria performed worse than most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nTaking each country\u2019s income into account, the report said Nigeria is in the bottom fifth in Africa for all four rights.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at raw performance, it does slightly better \u2013 people in Nigeria have a higher standard of living than in some other very poor countries \u2013 but even then it is below average.\u201d\n\nOn the right to health, the report ranked Nigeria 41st out of 42 countries it reviewed in Sub-Saharan Africa; sitting just behind Equatorial Guinea.\n\nOn the right to food, Nigeria ranked 37th, sitting above Sudan, Niger, Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Burundi on the log.",

Ahmed Gulak, that the professional services of his law firm would still be retained by its committee on the review of the 1999 constitution, adding that everything would be done to cushion the effects of Gulak\u2019s death on the family.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nDeputy President of the Senate and chairman of the committee, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, disclosed this on Thursday when he led a delegation of the National Assembly leadership on a condolence visit to Hajia Jemila Gulak, widow of the slain lawyer and All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain in their Abuja residence.\n\nHe described the death as a personal loss going by his deep and close relationship with Gulak spanning several years at both political and professional levels.\n\nOmo-Agege also explained that a successful outcome of the ongoing constitution review by the 9th Assembly would be an unforgettable tribute to the memory of the late Ahmed Gulak, who was killed in Owerri, Imo State while on national assignment.\n\nMembers of the delegation included the Senate Leader, Senator Abdullahi Yahaya; Deputy Senate Leader, Senator Robert Ajayi Boroffice and Senate Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe.\n\nLate Gulak was one of the three consultants that were in Owerri for the South-East zonal public hearing on constitution review organised by the Senate Committee.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nHe said: \u201cBefore the unfortunate incident involving the demise of our friend and brother, we engaged him as a consultant to the committee and he had, on our mandate, gone to Owerri as one of three consultants to assist members of the committee that were sent to Owerri to conduct the zonal hearing. So, he had been there in his capacity as a consultant during this unfortunate incident that occurred. He was on national assignment on behalf of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cWe would have come to condole with you much earlier, but a lot of us here have very personal relationship with Gulak and for me, it was so many years with him and we find it very difficult to confront the fact that we have actually lost him. It is easy for others to condole and just move on but most of us are in denial and that is why we kept away until this time but it is something we must do. We cannot shy away from the fact that we lost him and we thought that as leaders of the committee, it would be proper that we come in today and condole with you.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn the course of his services to us as a committee, he was everything we expected. He wasn\u2019t there because of political relationships but in his capacity as a brilliant lawyer, apart from being the former Speaker of the Adamawa State House of Assembly and Political Adviser to former President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\n\u201cI knew him in terms of those capacities but more importantly that he was a member of my own legal profession where he excelled and finally, it was in that capacity that we engaged him into the committee. So, this is a very deep, personal loss to me, to all of us and frankly to the country.\u201d\n\nThe Delta Central lawmaker said the best tribute the National Assembly can give the deceased is to ensure that the Constitution Review exercise meets the yearnings and aspirations of most Nigerians.\n\n\u201cHe (Gulak) wanted us to have a very thorough, professional constitutional review job and I think that is the least we owe him and we are determined to ensure that his memory will be remembered at the end of the exercise.\n\n\u201cSo, on behalf of the President of the Senate, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the whole family. I want the family to know that we are always here; always feel free to stay close and don\u2019t let his demise be the end of that relationship,\u201d Omo-Agege added.\n\nResponding on behalf of the Gulak family, Senator Abubakar Umar Gada, a personal friend to the deceased, tasked the delegation on the need to assist the family and immortalise his name by ensuring that nothing is done to frustrate the outcome of the amendment of the Constitution.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe cannot use any words to express our appreciation and gratitude for this visit. It shows the importance and caliber of the person the nation has lost and the nation mourns his demise but we are submitting ourselves to the will of Allah.\n\n\u201cThere is not much to say because the leader of the delegation, His Excellency, the Deputy President of the Senate has already spoken.\u201d\n\nWith Gada were Ambassador Umar Damagum, Alhaji Mainasara Sokoto and two children of Gulak, Dr. Mustapha Gulak and Zainab Gulak, Esq.",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",

          "text": "The government of Osun State led by Gboyega Oyetola has debunked rumours making the rounds that it withheld the severance package of some former political office holders in Councils to punish them.\n\nThe Osun government had recently announced the release of a severance package to former elected officers in local government councils, whose tenure ended February 5, 2021.\n\nHowever, rumours emerged following the payment, that the payment of some officers was withheld because of their loyalty to a former governor of the state, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola.\n\nHowever, the Oyetola-led administration has debunked such reports.\n\nA statement signed by the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Prince Adeleke Yekeen Adebayo, described the insinuation as a deliberate conjecture meant to mislead the public on activities of the government.\n\n\u201cIt is correct that the severance packages of some political office holders in councils were withheld until they get clearance from the Ministry of Local Government based on the fact that there were issues they needed to clarify on their spending while they were serving.\n\n\u201cSuch issues vary from council to council and I don\u2019t think that should generate problems, because some officers have shown up and have been cleared. Some were asked to wait until the allegations against them are proven either correct or wrong.\n\n\u201cI believe those who do not have anything to fear or hide should be bold enough to show up and state their cases, rather than attaching political colourations to it.\n\n\u201cSo, the case at hand has nothing to do with Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola or Governor Gboyega Oyetola. It is purely the policies that we have set out in the ministry that must be complied with.

Since then, our intelligence committee led by my humble self decided to give His Excellency a close watch, this you may not know.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency\u2019s boldness and overwhelming passion for truth and justice which came to public notice when you displayed against all odds in the Senate by introducing the doctrine of necessity which brought peace, order and tranquillity in the nation, gives us assurance that one day, a desired and respected president will emerge to take us across the red sea,\u201d Afiyo said.\n\nHe declared that Governor Mohammed\u2019s performances as the FCT Minister and his two years of leadership in Bauchi State were magic wands which convinced them, and indeed many Nigerians, that he (Mohammed) would lead Nigeria to the promised land as its president.\n\nResponding, Governor Mohammed said that the endorsement by the Forum for him to run as a presidential candidate in 2023 general election is not only a great honour to him, people of Bauchi State but also all upcoming politicians in Northern Nigeria.\n\nHe commended the NYLF for its leadership recruitment process, which the governor declared was worthy of emulation.\n\n\u201cI have never induced this group with one kobo and I was hearing it as a tale and I knew some of the politicians that are of high calibre that I have been trying to reach them. I keep asking why they think an absurd politician like me could take such a responsibility because I believe God helped me in everything, rising me from a humble background to becoming a director in the federal civil Service, after an experience in the media and to become a senator representing Bauchi and later Minister of FCT and today, with all the persecution and prosecution, I became a governor in Bauchi State.\n\n\u201cI am a highly fulfilled person. My children are my family, my wife is here, they have suffered enough for me. My well wishers have suffered enough of abuses, lies and destruction of my character and my person because of the perception that I may go somewhere and you are trying to pull me to that level that I will be shot with political mischief and treachery.\n\n\u2018I am not yet ready for that, I am fulfilled and that is why when I came to Bauchi, I came with the fire and the zeal to make sure I perform,\u201d the governor said.\n\nBauchi governor reaffirms commitment to good governance",

          "title": "ACF to Ohaneze, Afenifere: Protect northerners in Southeast, Southwest",
          "text": "The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has urged Ohanaeze Ndigbo and Afenifere to curb acts that could endanger the lives and properties of northerners and other Nigerians in their regions, while assuring of security of other Nigerians in the North.\n\nSpeaking in a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of a National Executive Council meeting Wednesday at its headquarters in Kaduna, ACF National Chairman Audu Ogbeh commended Ohanaeze for disowning the violent agitation for secession by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\nHe said the ACF would soon convene a meeting with the other socio-cultural organisations to address challenges facing all parts of the country.\n\nOgbe said: \u201cThe Forum expressed satisfaction with the recent stand of the Southeast leaders and Governors on the violent agitation for secession from Nigeria by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Eastern Security Network. The Forum expressed satisfaction that the Ibo Elders have finally disowned the agitators and called on the elders to take concrete measures to ensure that such agitations come to an end.\n\n\u201cACF wishes to assure that all Ibos who are living in the North are guaranteed their personal security. We have received reports on a daily basis of Northerners, ordinary citizens who are earning their daily life as nail cutters, suya makers, shoe shiners, onion sellers, being bullied, beaten and even killed. We hope these ordinary Northerners are given the same protection we have given the South easterners in our midst.\n\n\u201cThe Forum hopes to meet with leaders of Ohanaeze Ndi Igbo, Afenifere and South-South leaders to discuss the lingering issues in the country that have tended to pitch ethnic and regional groups against each other. The Forum also praised the gallantry of our fighting forces who against all odds have continued to risk their own lives in the fight against banditry and insurgencies.\n\n\u201cThe Forum commended Governors Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi state and Umara Zulum of Borno state, who have demonstrated unusual courage in their fight against terrorism in their states and urged other governors in the North to demonstrate similar bravery in the fight against insecurity that is ruining everything the North has always stood for.\n\n\u201cACF lauded Federal Government\u2019s infrastructural development, while lamenting that \u201cthe North with over 75% proportion of land and highest number of population\u201d has not benefited a fair share of the infrastructure. The Forum decried high interest rates charged by banks on loans, noting that it has continued to suppress local businesses. \u201cWe call on the government to intervene because the collapse of business has direct links with unemployment and insecurity.\u201d\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 further said: \u201cThe Forum is not happy with the scant attention paid to animal husbandry by states and Federal Government in the country. Animal husbandry alone accounts for 6% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Nigeria spends $1.6 million on importation of milk alone. If animal husbandry is well harnessed it will save Nigeria, this large expenditure.\n\n\u201cNigerians are not aware that those involved in the business of animal husbandry are themselves victims of insecurity their cattle are often rustled and they are kidnapped for ransom too. There is need to encourage alternative means of dispute resolution as those involved in farmers/herdsmen clashes are rural illiterates who sometimes are not comfortable with the police and the modern court system but prefer traditional way of resolving issues.\n\n\u201cThe Forum regretted that Nomadic Education embarked on during the Babangida administration has been abandoned. There is need to revive and expand this laudable programme so that the pastoralists who have been profiled, exploited, abandoned and left behind by the modern society will also acquire skills to live in harmony with their brothers and sisters in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cLocal government is not being allowed to work and the failure is having a devastating effect on the security architecture of the country. They must be allowed to work and ACF calls strongly on the Federal Government and the state government to allow the local government to perform the roles and functions they were constitutionally created to perform.\u201d",

On the contrary, the Board greatly appreciates the partnership with NIMC which has led to the inadvertent benefit of revealing the actual number of candidates registered annually.\n\n\u201cIn essence, I had reiterated that the import of the partnership with NIMC which mandated the use of NIN in the registration process, was that the facility has made it virtually impossible for hired examination takers to register multiple times as they used to do to perpetrate their nefarious activities.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the series of measures the board had put in place to ascertain the veracity of its position that the true candidates\u2019 strength should be about 1.5m had yielded the desired results.\n\nHe however said the introduction of NIN has helped in addressing one of the fundamental channels of perpetrating examination malpractice by way of multiple applications, among others.\n\nBenjamin explained that JAMB is not a revenue generation entity, and as such, not interested in the ever-ballooning number of candidates but rather concerned with how to address those loopholes being used by fraudsters to distort national data in their bid to compromise public examinations.\n\n\u201cAs far as the Board is concerned, having a realistic number of candidates sitting its examination is a major achievement which only the partnership with NMC has made possible. Therefore, the Board affirms its resolve not to ever compromise on the integrity of its processes on account of generating fat operating surpluses,\u201d he said.",

While it is true that an initial appropriation of the above stated sum was made due to the decaying nature of the National Assembly Complex which has not witnessed any major maintenance or overhauling since construction, the said amount was reduced to 9 billion naira after the breakout of COVID-19 pandemic. Even with this reduction, the sum of 9 billion or any amount is yet to be cash backed or released to the National Assembly. None of this amount is even appropriated for the National Assembly bureaucracy or its leadership. It must be reiterated that the National Assembly Complex is a National Monument which falls under the purview of control of the Federal Capital Development Agency. In essence, the FCDA is responsible for its maintenance as well as renovation and not the Leadership of the National Assembly as being falsely bandied about. The leakage witnessed at the foyer of the National Assembly yesterday justifies the apprehension of the leadership of the National Assembly and the FCDA and further underscores the need for an urgent intervention in revamping the dilapidated structures within the complex before it falls into further dilapidation with the attendant huge cost of a possible replacement.\n\nSigned\n\nSenator Surajudeen Ajibola Basiru Ph.D.\n\nSenate Spokesperson\n\nDated this 23rd day of June, 2021",

          "text": "Governor of Oyo State, \u2018Seyi Makinde, has declared that his administration is busy working on the security architecture of the state to ensure a holistic solution to insecurity challenges being faced by the state.\n\nGovernor Makinde, who stated this while declaring close a two-day retreat for Local Government Chairmen, Vice-Chairmen, and Heads of Local Government Administrations (HLAs), in the 33 Local Government Councils of the state, held at the Ilaji Hotel and Sports Complex, Akanran, Ibadan, said that his government has, indeed, been working hard to find a lasting solution to the challenges in the all-important sector.\n\nHe stated that when ongoing efforts to rework the security system are completed, even the Federal Government will copy the state\u2019s template.\n\nA statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, quoted the governor as expressing delight at the well-packaged retreat put together by Forsterfield Consulting in conjunction with the office of the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs and the Special Adviser on Strategy and Political Matters.\n\nWhile addressing the chairmen, Governor Makinde admonished them to step up their game on the issue of security and take responsibility for the security of their domains, saying, though security is the responsibility of everyone in the society, those in government will be held accountable.\n\nMakinde equally charged the chairmen to consider adopting the Security Task Force approach of the state government and to hold regular security meetings and work with the Amotekun, federal security agencies, and the voluntary policing initiative of the state government.\n\nREAD ALSO: Soludo Emerges APGA Governorship Candidate In Anambra\n\nThe governor also asked the council bosses to up the scale of intelligence gathering in their domains.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is a state Security Task Force, you can replicate that at the local government level. Meet once a week and review. I can bet that by the time we are done grinding our security architecture, they will copy it at the national level in this country. So, you should step up to the table and ensure that, at each of your local government areas, you take responsibility.\n\n\u201cYes, it is a collective responsibility. The government alone cannot handle it but somebody will have to hold the rod of accountability and because you are the elected representatives of the people, you have to take responsibility even sometimes for things that are well beyond your control.\n\n\u201cThe Amotekun people are there. There are challenges to get them as an agency to work with federal institutions because there is a rivalry. You guys should see it as the time to put all of them together and we have to thrive. Also, we have voluntary policing. You know some of the youths within your localities, get them into the scheme.\n\n\u201cWhen I went to Igangan, I said we would start funding the hunters and local vigilantes and we made the arrangement. Today, I am glad that the HLAs are here. We are passing through a very challenging period. So, everybody must come together to support that initiative. If we get it right, on a monthly basis, we will ensure that we make provision for them because they are quite important.\n\n\u201cFrom the report I have on Ibarapa, both open and confidential, it would have been a lot worse if not for local hunters and vigilantes. So, we need to strengthen that network.\n\n\u201cMost important is the issue of intelligence. The failure we got at Igangan was that people saw the bandits converging during the day but nobody reported the case. So, you also need to strengthen intelligence gathering in each of your local government areas.\n\n\u201cThe number of the security control room is 615. Call it. When there was an issue at Igangan, I didn\u2019t get the report that anyone called the number. It started at about 11:30 p.m. Call 615 to address any distressing issue. You need to promote the number at the local government level as elected officials. Take it upon yourselves now to ensure that every household is conversant with the 615 number and call it when they are in trouble. Also, encourage your people to say something to you when they see something so you can take the information to appropriate quarters.\u201d\n\nGovernor Makinde, who also charged the local government officials to operate with the fear of God and put the interest of the people first in all their activities at the local councils, maintained that the people of the state expect good governance and dividends of democracy from the councils.\n\nWhile charging the local council officials to consider adopting the four service point agenda or pillars of the state government or work on their own based on the peculiarities of the councils, Makinde stated that the state government will continue to support the councils to achieve the mandate of delivering quality service to the people at the grassroots.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am glad that we are able to organise this retreat. We tried having it when some of you were interim chairmen and chairpersons but the COVID-19 pandemic didn\u2019t give us the opportunity. But today, we thank God that in Oyo State, COVID-19 is taking a back seat. At least, from the reports given to me, there is nobody in the Infectious Disease Centre, which is our isolation centre at Olodo.\n\n\u201cI want to say that the people of Oyo State voted for you and are expecting from you dividends of democracy at the local level. For the state election, most of you joined me to campaign together. So, you have all contributed to putting the government at the state level there.\n\n\u201cThis is a good time for us to interact and for me to share one or two things with you. I am sure a lot of you are familiar with our Roadmap for Accelerated Development (2019-2023). We brought out the document before the election and I am happy to tell you that the author of the document, Professor Musbau Babatunde, is also here today. We spent several days and weeks together, knocking the document and it has served us as the blueprint for this administration. We are not going anywhere to seek knowledge on how to govern the state. Take the document anywhere in the world, it is a standard document.\n\n\u201cAnd for these past two years, it has assisted us. So, at the local government level, my wish is for you to adopt those four pillars. I understand that there could be peculiarities in the local government of some of you. You can add two or more to your own pillars and make it six depending on the peculiarities of your local government area.\u201d\n\nThe governor stated that the agenda of his government to expand the state\u2019s economy through Agribusiness and infrastructure development has been yielding positive results, with a lot of offers coming to the state to assist it.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe think we are getting stability in the areas of agribusiness and infrastructure. We are still continuing but we can add more, and now, we are saying we should add solid minerals development and Tourism.\n\n\u201cSo, for those local governments that are positioned to do things in the tourism and solid minerals sectors, the state will be available to support and partner with you.\u201d\n\nThe Oyo State Governor counselled the new chairmen and vice-chairmen not to be discouraged by challenges, noting that if they handle the current assignments, it could become stepping stones to something higher.\n\n\u201cBut you have to work and it is not something that I am just thinking in my head. I have seen it happen. The governor of Rivers State, Chief Nyesom Wike, started as local government chairman in 1999. From there, he rose to the position of Chief of Staff to the Governor and then a federal minister, and today he is a governor. He can even become the President of this country if he wishes. So, starting from the local government level is actually an advantage and opportunity to showcase the leadership qualities you have.\n\n\u201cSome of the policies that we have, which are working at the state level, replicate them at the local government level. And where you need direction and support, don\u2019t be shy about it because if we get it right at the local government level, it will assist our overall position as a state,\u201d Makinde said.\n\nHe assured them that the state government will always be available to support the council chairmen, saying: \u201cYou know we are here to support you. If you are faced with challenges beyond your control, come to us and we will solve it together.\u201d\n\nHe also admonished the civil servants at the local government levels to support the council chairmen to achieve success, noting that the government will always be ready to listen to them and give necessary support to do their jobs effectively.",
          "summary": "While addressing the chairmen, Governor Makinde admonished them to step up their game on the issue of security and take responsibility for the security of their domains, saying, though security is the responsibility of everyone in the society, those in government will be held accountable.\nHe said: \u201cThere is a state Security Task Force, you can replicate that at the local government level.\nI can bet that by the time we are done grinding our security architecture, they will copy it at the national level in this country.\nSo, you have all contributed to putting the government at the state level there.\n\u201cSome of the policies that we have, which are working at the state level, replicate them at the local government level.",

          "title": "Egypt Seeks New African Allies in Nile Dam Row",
          "text": "Egypt is trying to strengthen its diplomatic and military clout in Africa amid an escalating dispute with Ethiopia over the building of a huge dam on a tributary of the River Nile, writes Egypt analyst Magdi Abdelhadi.\n\nThe Egyptian Geographic Society, established in 1875, houses some valuable manuscripts that reflect Egypt\u2019s long-standing interest in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAmong them is a historic map that shows the southern borders of Egypt at Lake Victoria in East Africa.\n\nThe society was established at the height of Egypt\u2019s short-lived imperial ambition, which had brought Sudan under Egyptian control and sought to conquer Ethiopia in a disastrous military expedition from 1874 to 1876. It ended in a humiliating defeat.\n\nSome 70 years later, Egypt atoned for its imperial misadventures when it became the standard bearer of anti-colonial struggles in Africa and beyond.\n\nBut as it got sucked into the Arab-Israeli wars, its engagement with sub-Saharan Africa dwindled.\n\nThe past few years, however, has seen a dramatic re-engagement, in particular with the Nile Basin countries.\n\nEgypt has signed a string of military and economic agreements with Uganda, Kenya, Burundi, Rwanda and Djibouti in recent months.\n\nCairo already has substantial integration agreements with Sudan, where it recently conducted joint military exercises involving warplanes and special forces.\n\nEgypt has linked its power grid to Sudan\u2019s and plans are under way to connect the railway networks too, with a grand vision to run a train service from Alexandria to Cape Town.\n\nThe keyword behind this foreign policy change is the controversial dam Ethiopia is building on the Blue Nile, known as the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (Gerd).\n\n\u201cEgypt has long relied on diplomacy to solve its differences with Ethiopia over the Gerd. But the track of negotiations seems to have been exhausted, or nearly so,\u201d says Nael Shama, an expert on Egyptian foreign policy.\n\nTanzania is another example, where Egypt is investing heavily in the massive Julius Nyerere hydroelectric dam on the Rufiji River. Cairo clearly wants to highlight the project as an example of its willingness to help development in the Nile Basin countries.\n\nAnd this is precisely the kind of message Egypt \u2013 which has no other major sources of water for drinking and agriculture than the Nile \u2013 has been trying to relay to global opinion.\n\nThis picture taken on January 3, 2021 shows a view of Aswan from the Old Cataract Hotel overlooking the Nile river in Egypt\u2019s southern city of Aswan, some 920 kilometres south of the capital, where British crime fiction writer Dame Agatha Christie is believed to have stayed while writing her 1937 novel \u201cDeath on the Nile\u201d, with the Mausoleum of Aga Khan III seen in the background (top R).\n\nIt is not opposed to the Ethiopian dam per se, but it is extremely wary of its likely impact on the flow of the Nile waters if Ethiopia refuses to sign up to a legally binding agreement on how to manage its operations.\n\nIt is feared the dam could decimate Egyptian agriculture and lay waste to large swathes of its arable land, triggering massive drought and unemployment. Ethiopia, on the other hand, sees the Gerd as vital to its development needs, and the supply of electricity to its population.\n\nEgypt\u2019s change of direction and focus of foreign policy towards sub-Saharan Africa is therefore long overdue, but, some Egyptians say, it is too little too late.\n\n\u201cClout in modern politics is not just guns and cannons,\u201d argues Walaa Bakry, an academic at the UK\u2019s University of Westminster and a business consultant.\n\n\u201cSecurity agreements with some of the Nile Basin countries such as Burundi, Rwanda or Uganda is a good thing, but will not give Egypt the clout it wants,\u201d he writes.\n\nStrong trade links can achieve far more than military muscle, he argues, pointing to the minuscule trade Egypt has with all nine Nile Basin countries.\n\n\u201cNo-one is saying that Egypt should buy anything it doesn\u2019t need from these countries. But for example, the Nile Basin countries produce huge amounts of high-quality coffee \u2013 Egypt imports coffee for well over $95.5m annually, 95% of that is from outside Africa.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the mood in Egypt has grown increasingly bellicose. The Egyptian regime, in fact the president himself, is under enormous pressure to get tough with Ethiopia.\n\nEven supporters of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi have started to mutter the unthinkable \u2013 that failure to protect Egypt\u2019s water rights would mean he would no longer have the right to rule.\n\nEgypt apparently hopes that building a ring of allies around Ethiopia would pay off in some form if a showdown with Ethiopia becomes inevitable.\n\nEgypt and Sudan have taken the dispute over the dam to the UN Security Council, as they consider it could potentially threaten peace and stability in the region.\n\nThe issue has been before the Security Council before, which referred it to the African Union, which failed to resolve it.\n\nBoth Cairo and Khartoum blame Ethiopia for that, while Addis Ababa accuses Egypt of using the negotiations as a ploy to re-assert its effective monopoly of the Nile waters \u2013 a reference to Egypt\u2019s lions\u2019 share of the water.\n\nIf all diplomacy fails, there is little doubt that public opinion in Egypt will back military action if need be\u201d\n\nThe joint military exercise conducted recently in Sudan was clearly intended to send a warning not just to Ethiopia but to the wider world \u2013 that the two countries will not shy away from using their military muscle if need be in a matter of life and death such as water.\n\nEgypt\u2019s agreements of military cooperation with Uganda, Kenya and Burundi appear to reinforce that message, although it is hard to imagine these countries agreeing to be sucked into a regional war where their key national interests are not at stake.\n\nIf all diplomacy fails, there is little doubt that public opinion in Egypt will back military action if need be.\n\nLess so in Sudan, where there is a certain degree of ambivalence, not least because, unlike Egypt, Sudan stands to benefit from the dam, which will reduce destructive flooding and give it cheap electricity.\n\nBut there is broad consensus among observers that, although Egypt and Sudan may have the political will and the military hardware and skill, a strike of some kind targeting the ongoing construction of the dam to set it back by a few years will not solve the problem.\n\nInstead, it will increase mistrust and re-fuel the discourse of ancient grievances, nationalist pride and revenge.",
          "summary": "The past few years, however, has seen a dramatic re-engagement, in particular with the Nile Basin countries.\nThe keyword behind this foreign policy change is the controversial dam Ethiopia is building on the Blue Nile, known as the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (Gerd).\nCairo clearly wants to highlight the project as an example of its willingness to help development in the Nile Basin countries.\n\u201cSecurity agreements with some of the Nile Basin countries such as Burundi, Rwanda or Uganda is a good thing, but will not give Egypt the clout it wants,\u201d he writes.\nStrong trade links can achieve far more than military muscle, he argues, pointing to the minuscule trade Egypt has with all nine Nile Basin countries.",

          "text": "US pop star Britney Spears has spoken out against her conservatorship at a court hearing in Los Angeles.\n\nSpeaking in open court for the first time in the case, she said her father controlled her \u201c100,000%\u201d and she wanted the arrangement to end.\n\n\u201cI am traumatised,\u201d she said, speaking remotely. \u201cI just want my life back.\u201d\n\nJamie Spears was granted control over his daughter\u2019s personal and business affairs in a court-ordered conservatorship in 2008.\n\nThe order was originally granted after the star was put in hospital amid concerns over her mental health.\n\nThere has been speculation for years about how Spears, 39, felt about the arrangement, with fans eagerly combing her social media output for clues.\n\nLos Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny thanked Spears for her \u201ccourageous\u201d words but made no ruling. A long legal process is likely before any decision is made on ending the conservatorship, the Associated Press reports.\n\n\u201cI want to end this conservatorship without being evaluated,\u201d Spears told the court decisively in an emotional 20-minute address, calling the arrangement \u201cabusive\u201d.\n\n\u201cI deserve to have a life, I\u2019ve worked my whole life. I deserve to have a two to three-year break,\u201d she said.\n\nSpears said she wanted to marry her boyfriend and have a baby, but the conservatorship would not allow her to. She accused her conservator of stopping her from having a contraceptive intrauterine device (IUD) removed so she could get pregnant.\n\nShe also said she had been forced to take lithium \u2013 a common medicine for bipolar disorders \u2013 to the point where she felt drunk and unable to converse.\n\n\u201cThis conservatorship is doing me way more harm than good,\u201d she said.\n\nJamie Spears stepped down temporarily as his daughter\u2019s personal conservator in 2019 because of health reasons \u2013 and the pop star has requested for this to be made permanent.\n\nShe is seeking to permanently install Jodi Montgomery, a care professional, into the role instead of reinstating her father.\n\nJamie Spears was troubled by the singer\u2019s allegations in court, according to his lawyer.\n\n\u201cHe is sorry to see his daughter suffering and in so much pain,\u201d the representative said in a statement read out in court. \u201cMr Spears loves his daughter, and he misses her very much.\u201d\n\nJamie Spears\u2019s legal team has previously insisted he has done a good job of managing his daughter\u2019s finances.\n\nDozens of fans from the so-called #FreeBritney movement gathered outside the court, holding signs reading \u201cFree Britney now!\u201d and \u201cGet out of Britney\u2019s life!\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything she said was absolutely heartbreaking and it was actually even worse than I really thought it was,\u201d Megan Radford, one of the movement\u2019s founders, told the BBC.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m so thankful that her truth is out there and it cannot be denied anymore.\u201d\n\nBritney Spears unleashed on a stunned courtroom the equivalent of 13 years of pent-up frustration \u2013 a torrent of accusation, anger and regret, all delivered in such a breathless monologue that at times the judge had to ask her to slow down.\n\nShe came across as isolated, lost and lonely; a superstar that has been relentlessly manipulated. We knew that she had asked to put her case directly to the judge, but few could have predicted such an anguished tirade.\n\nIt amounted to a withering critique of the conservatorship process here, and the motives of many \u2013 members of her family chief among them \u2013 who were supposed to have been caring for her mental anguish.\n\nA conservatorship is granted by a court for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions, like those with dementia or other mental illnesses.\n\nSpears\u2019 conservatorship is split into two parts \u2013 one is for her estate and financial affairs, the other is for her as a person.\n\nUnder this legal agreement, Spears has not controlled her finances since 2008. That\u2019s around the time she began to behave erratically amid her divorce from Kevin Federline and a custody battle over their two children.\n\nThe star made headlines in a series of public incidents, including shaving her head, and she was twice admitted to hospital.\n\nBritney Spears catapulted to the top of global pop charts at 16 with her debut single \u2026Baby One More Time.\n\nMore than 20 years later, her debut album of the same name remains the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist.\n\nCampaigners believe the singer has been forced to stay under the arrangement. They regularly demonstrate outside court hearings.\n\nThey have even asked the White House to end her conservatorship, submitting petitions with tens of thousands of signatures.\n\nAfter Spears abruptly cancelled a Las Vegas residency and checked into a mental health centre in 2019 citing emotional distress from her father\u2019s illness, the campaign gained renewed prominence.\n\nBoth the #FreeBritney movement and the recent release of a New York Times documentary about the singer have renewed public interest.\n\nBut the pop star has not publicly commented much on the conservatorship battle, although members of her own family have spoken out against the order.\n\nCourt records from 2019, the last time she spoke in court, have never been made public. Ms Spears\u2019s online persona has often been very upbeat and she has steered clear of the case.\n\nBut the New York Times this week said it had obtained confidential court documents that showed the singer had opposed the restrictions since 2014.\n\nIn April, the pop star asked to address the court through her court-appointed attorney.\n\nShe has previously indicated through lawyers that she no longer wanted her father to be involved in handling her career and would not perform again if he was.\n\nSince the court appearance, multiple celebrities have posted messages of support.\n\nPop star Justin Timberlake, her boyfriend in the 1990s, posted a thread of tweets calling for people to stand by her: \u201cAfter what we saw today, we should all be supporting Britney at this time. Regardless of our past, good and bad, and no matter how long ago it was\u2026 what\u2019s happening to her is just not right.\u201d\n\nTimberlake made a public apology to Spears earlier this year after the New York Times documentary suggested he had treated her disrespectfully by discussing their sex life on the radio.\n\nSpears\u2019s current boyfriend, personal trainer and actor Sam Asghari, posted a picture on Instagram of himself in Free Britney T-Shirt.\n\nSinger Mariah Carey tweeted: \u201cWe love you Britney!!! Stay strong.\u201d\n\nRose McGowan, the actor and MeToo activist, said on Twitter that Spears had every right to be angry, adding: \u201cHow would you feel if your life was stolen, dissected, mocked? I pray she gets to live your life on her terms. STOP CONTROLLING WOMEN.\u201d",

          "text": "Across Hong Kong, people lined up early Thursday to buy the last print edition of the last remaining pro-democracy newspaper.\n\nBy 8:30 a.m., Apple Daily\u2019s final edition of 1 million copies was sold out across most of the city\u2019s newsstands. The newspaper said it would cease operations after police froze $2.3 million in assets, searched its office and arrested five top editors and executives last week, accusing them of foreign collusion to endanger national security \u2014 another sign Beijing is tightening its grip on the semi-autonomous city.\n\nIn recent years, the newspaper has become increasingly outspoken, criticizing Chinese and Hong Kong authorities for limiting the city\u2019s freedoms not found in mainland China and accusing them of reneging on a promise to protect them for 50 years after the 1997 handover from Britain.\n\nThe pressure on the paper \u2014 and Hong Kong\u2019s civil liberties \u2014 increased after authorities responded to massive protests in 2019 with a sweeping national security law \u2014 used in the arrests of the newspaper employees \u2014 and revamped Hong Kong\u2019s election laws to keep opposition voices out of the legislature.\n\n\u201cThis is our last day, and last edition, does this reflect the reality that Hong Kong has started to lose its press freedom and freedom of speech?\u201d said an Apple Daily graphic designer, Dickson Ng. \u201cWhy does it have to end up like this? Why is there not going to be the Apple (Daily) newspaper any more in Hong Kong?\u201d\n\nTo a big applause, associate publisher Chan Pui-man told staff who gathered around the newsroom Wednesday night: \u201cYou\u2019ve done a great job, everyone!\u201d Apple Daily printed 1 million copies for the final edition, up from the usual 80,000. While pro-democracy media outlets still exist online, it was the only print newspaper of its kind left in the city.\n\nOn Wednesday night, over 100 people stood outside Apple Daily\u2019s office building in the rain to show their support, as employees worked on the final edition, taking photographs and shouting words of encouragement.\n\nIn the early hours of Thursday, residents in the city\u2019s Mong Kok neighborhood in the working-class Kowloon district began lining up hours before the paper hit the stands.\n\nThursday\u2019s edition splashed an image of an Apple Daily employee in the office waving at supporters surrounding the building, with the headline \u201cHong Kongers bid a painful farewell in the rain, \u2018We support Apple Daily.\u2019\u201d\n\nApple Daily\u2019s closure marks a \u201cdark day for press freedom in Hong Kong,\u201d said Thomas Kellogg, executive director of the Georgetown Center for Asian Law.\n\n\u201cWithout Apple Daily, Hong Kong is less free than it was a week ago. Apple Daily was an important voice, and it seems unlikely that any other media outlet will be able to fill its shoes, given growing restrictions on free speech and freedom of the press,\u201d he said.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Twitter that the national security law is being used to curtail freedom and punish dissent.\n\nThe forced closure by Hong Kong authorities \u201cis a chilling demonstration of their campaign to silence all opposition voices,\u201d Raab said.\n\nGerman Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Adebahr called the closure a \u201chard blow against press freedom in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn our view this is another sign that pluralism, freedom of opinion and freedom of the press in Hong Kong are subject to erosion, which can particularly be seen since the National Security Law came into force,\u201d Adebahr said.\n\nIt was the first time the national security law had been used against journalists for something they published.\n\nMore than 100 people, including the city\u2019s most outspoken pro-democracy advocates, have been arrested under the security legislation. They include media tycoon Jimmy Lai, who founded Apple Daily in 1995. Many others have fled abroad.",
