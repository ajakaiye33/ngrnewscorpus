We have confirmed the corpse,\u201d the relative said in an emotional-laden voice.\n\nIt was learnt that her corpse was dropped on Lagos Island by a BRT vehicle and a jeep.\n\nUpon sighting the corpse by the roadside, an unknown man reportedly informed officials of Ebute Ero Police Station on Saturday evening.\n\nThe corpse was later taken to the Mainland Hospital mortuary.\n\n\u201cAn autopsy will be carried out to confirm if any part of her body is missing,\u201d the relative told The PUNCH.\n\nThe PUNCH learnt that Ayanwola got missing while returning to Ota from Ajah on Saturday, February 26 when she boarded a BRT bus with number 240257 going to Oshodi at about 7 p.m. at Chevron Bus-Stop.\n\nIt was gathered that the victim worked as a Fashion Designer at Chevron Estate, Ajah and spent weekends at Ota, Ogun State, with her sister.\n\nSensing danger as the bus did not pick any other passenger at subsequent bus stops, Oluwabamise had engaged a friend using voice notes on her phone.\n\nThe voice notes showed that the bus driver said he liked Oluwabamise and asked for her name and other details.\n\nShe told her friend to pray for her as she became suspicious of the bus driver and in response, the friend told her to alight at Oworonsoki bus stop \u2014 before Oshodi bus stop.\n\nOluwabamise had also sent a video to her friend showing how dark it was in the bus and said, \u201cThere are three men and one woman in the bus.

Ubia, ASP Bawa James, Insp. Simon Agirigba and Insp. John Nuhu.\n\nUmeibe and Ezenwanne are the two alleged drug traffickers that were arrested at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu.Shortly after taking their plea, the NDLEA lawyer, Joseph Sunday, Director, Prosecution and Legal Services, prayed the court for a trial date for the 1st to 5th defendants.\n\nSunday also urged the court to grant a leave to review the charges against Umeibe and Ezenwanne who pleaded guilty for the charges against them. \u201cWe hope to file our prove of evidence latest tomorrow (Tuesday),\u201d he said.\n\nKanu Agabi, SAN, who led a delegation of Senior Advocates of Nigeria that appeared for Kyari and Ubia, however, informed that a bail application had been filed in respect of his clients.\n\nREAD ALSO: Adegoke\u2019s murder: Court denies Rahman Adedoyin, 6 others bail\n\nThe NDLEA\u2019s lawyer, Joseph Sunday, Director, Prosecution and Legal Services, who confirmed being served with the bail application, said a counter affidavit had been filed in its opposition.The NDLEA, in the charge it filed through a team of lawyers, accused Kyari and the four other police officers of conspiracy, obstruction, and dealing in cocaine worth 17.55kg.\n\nIt equally alleged that Kyari and his men, who are currently in its custody, also unlawfully tampered with 21.25kg worth of cocaine.\n\nThe duo of Umeibe and Ezenwanne were accused of conspiring with others at large to import 21.35kg of cocaine into the country.\n\nNAN had, on Thursday, reported that Kyari, formerly head of IRT, and six others would be arraigned before Justice Nwite.NAN, in a related development, reports that the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, had, on Wednesday, filed an application for the commencement of extradition process of Kyari in the FHC.\n\nThe Federal Government, through the Office of the AGF, had filed the application marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/249/2022, under the Extradition Act as part of Nigerian government\u2019s approval of the request by the U.

          "text": "Northern youths under the aegis of Arewa Youth Assembly (AYA), Monday berated the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and some civil society groups for sponsoring baseless conspiracy theories and underhand tactics for political gain and discrediting the leadership of the of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC Ltd), the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), following the discovery of the methanol-blended petrol products.\n\nThe group also commended the NNPC and NMDPRA for demonstrating transparency, promoting accountability and also for their pragmatic response in ensuring that Nigerians have sufficient supply of petrol despite the disruption in some parts of the country.\n\nThe off-spec petrol, according to the NNPC, was imported into the country by four oil marketers through four premium motor spirit cargoes under the NNPC\u2019s Direct Sales Direct Purchase arrangement.\n\nIn a statement signed by the speaker, Mohammed Salihu Danlami, and made available to journalists on Sunday, the group said that while it stands with Nigerians in this trying moment, no group(s) or individual(s) should take advantage of the situation for political gain and personal aggrandizement.\n\nAccording to the group: \u201cAt a time such as this, citizens come together when there are genuine efforts to remedy the situation as has been shown by the federal government to assist in ameliorating the condition and urge the government to be more measured and quick.\n\n\u201cSadly, the reverse seems to be the case in Nigeria when the main opposition political party, PDP, wishes to harvest from the common suffering of Nigerians through baseless conspiracy theories and underhand tactics that the present situation is to force Nigerians to accept a new price hike.\n\n\u201cHaving critically reviewed the situation and received commitment from the federal government, we are persuaded to state that a new price hike for a litre of fuel is out of the table for now.\n\nThe group however noted that the Russian-Ukraine war has spiked oil prices across the world.\n\n\u201cWe all should take cognizance that while the government was moving quickly to redress the imbalance arising from the off-spec imported fuel, the Russian-Ukraine war started and this has led to dire global ramifications.\n\n\u201cSince the Kremlin invasion, oil prices have spiked across the world. For instance, in the United Kingdom, a litre of fuel sells for as high as N841.2k (\u00a31.49). Fuel price tracking outfit, RAC Fuel Watch, notes that petrol price per litre is \u00a31.49, while diesel sells a little higher at \u00a31.53. The simple maths show that to fill a 55-litre petrol car is at N46,000.\n\n\u201cIt bears stating too that given the rise in crude oil prices in the global market, the cost of refined products will naturally go up. It is therefore abracadabra politics for the main opposition party and their hire-for-protest civil society friends to suggest otherwise when market forces interplay are obvious.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we should remember that at the moment, the country\u2019s refineries are undergoing rehabilitation, therefore, we depend solely on imports for PMS supply. So with the high demand of crude and refined products across the world, embargoes against Russia and disruptions in shipping, the expectation that the supply chain would have been fully restored by last week was not achieved as expected,\u201d it added.\n\nWhile commending the Mele Kyari-led NNPC for its resilient efforts in addressing the unnerving situation and restoring normalcy, the group said: \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, it was the NMDPRA that alerted the country of methanol above national specifications in imported petrol, and proceeded to say that efforts were on to remove the contaminated products from circulation on Tuesday, February 8, 2022.\n\n\u201cAlso, the group managing director of the NNPC, Malam Mele Kyari, in subsequent statements and an appearance at the House of Representatives outlined efforts at remedying the situation.\n\n\u201cTo underscore the seriousness of the situation, the NNPC and other relevant agencies have embarked on petrol distribution surveillance (PDS). The aim of the PDS is to ensure the seamless evacuation of products from mother vessels to depots and trucking from depots to other inland depots as well as retail stations.\n\n\u201cInformation available to Arewa Youth Assembly also shows that there is at present, daily monitoring of trucks out from depots to all 36 states of the nation with focus on demand and existing stock available in the retail stations in these states. The task is being complemented by the deployment of personnel of the Department of State Services (DSS) to effectively monitor truck out and prevent any diversion of products along the way. Besides these, there has been engagement with critical stakeholders in the petroleum value-chain like MOMAN, DAPMAN, IPMAN, PTD, NARTO and NUPENG to ensure products are distributed seamlessly and efficiently.\n\n\u201cFor the main opposition and other entities working to cause public disaffection and incite the Nigerian people especially the youths, you shall find none as cannon fodder for your altruistic agenda,\u201d it said.\n\nThe group further called on Nigerians to resist fuel racketeering, panic buying and engaging in acts inimical to economic and security interest.",
          "summary": "The off-spec petrol, according to the NNPC, was imported into the country by four oil marketers through four premium motor spirit cargoes under the NNPC\u2019s Direct Sales Direct Purchase arrangement.\nFor instance, in the United Kingdom, a litre of fuel sells for as high as N841.2k (\u00a31.49).\nFuel price tracking outfit, RAC Fuel Watch, notes that petrol price per litre is \u00a31.49, while diesel sells a little higher at \u00a31.53.\n\u201cTo underscore the seriousness of the situation, the NNPC and other relevant agencies have embarked on petrol distribution surveillance (PDS).\nThe group further called on Nigerians to resist fuel racketeering, panic buying and engaging in acts inimical to economic and security interest.",

          "text": "The Federation of Muslim Women\u2019s Associations in Nigeria (FOMWAN) has said that the newly approved dress code for policewomen will enhance commitment to duty among female officers.\n\nThe body made this disclosure via a statement signed by its National Amirah, Hajia Rafi\u2019ah Idowu Sanni.\n\nSanni was reacting to Friday\u2019s announcement of a new dress code for female police officers in Nigeria by the Inspector General of Police.\n\nDAILY POST reports that the new dress code permits female police officers to wear stud earrings and headscarf under their berets or peak caps while in uniform.\n\nSanni, in the statement made available to DAILY POST on Monday, explained that the approval was a unique development in the history of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nShe appealed to the police authorities across the country to allow implementation of the new policy without any form of harassment, discrimination or victimization of the willing female officers\n\nShe said that the new dress code will enable Muslim women to contribute their quota to nation-building.\n\nShe however enjoined Muslim female police officers willing to adorn the hijab to distinguish themselves.\n\nShe said, \u201cThis is a unique development in the history of the Nigerian Police Force. Kudos to the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba for the approval. With this development, the Nigerian Force has become the first Security Agency in the country to introduce the policy which granted permission to willing female Muslim police officers to wear hijabs with their uniforms.\n\n\u201cI can say without any fear of contradictions that hijabs had long been approved as part of the uniforms of the Police, Army and Naval officers in many developed climes hence we should not see this as another form of extremism or what some religious bigots in Nigeria will term as Islamization agenda. Female Muslims are never comfortable not wearing their hijabs as commanded in the Quran.\n\n\u201cThis new dress code will enable Muslim sisters to fulfil one of the most important commandments of Allah which is to cover their heads. This will enable them to contribute their quota to nation-building.\n\n\u201cFOMWAN is appealing to our Muslimah in the Police Force to be of the best moral standards as exemplified by the holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Hijab is our pride and our identity. It represents modesty, decency and spirituality. It attracts respect hence anyone wearing it must be of good conduct and character all the time. We congratulate the NPF for being the trailblazer in this regard.\u201d",

Ubia, ASP Bawa James, Insp. Simon Agirigba and Insp. John Nuhu.\n\nUmeibe and Ezenwanne are the two alleged drug traffickers that were arrested at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu.\n\nShortly after taking their plea, the NDLEA lawyer, Joseph Sunday, Director, Prosecution and Legal Services, prayed the court for a trial date for the 1st to 5th defendants.\n\nSunday also urged the court to grant a leave to review the charges against\n\nUmeibe and Ezenwanne who pleaded guilty for the charges against them.\n\n\u201cWe hope to file our prove of evidence latest tomorrow (Tuesday),\u201d he said.\n\nKanu Agabi, SAN, who led a delegation of Senior Advocates of Nigeria that appeared for Kyari and Ubia, however informed that a bail application had been filed in respect of his clients.\n\nThe NDLEA\u2019s lawyer, Joseph Sunday, Director, Prosecution and Legal Services, who confirmed being served with the bail application, said a counter affidavit had been filed in its opposition.\n\nThe NDLEA, in the charge it filed through a team of lawyers, accused Kyari and the four other police officers of conspiracy, obstruction, and dealing in cocaine worth 17.55kg.\n\nIt equally alleged that Kyari and his men, who are currently in its custody, also unlawfully tampered with 21.25kg worth of cocaine.\n\nThe duo of Umeibe and Ezenwanne were accused of conspiring with others at large to import 21.35kg of cocaine into the country.\n\nNAN had, on Thursday, reported that Kyari, formerly head of IRT, and six others would be arraigned before Justice Nwite.\n\nNAN, in a related development, reports that the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, had, on Wednesday, filed an application for the commencement of extradition process of Kyari in the FHC.\n\nThe Federal Government, through the Office of the AGF, had filed the application marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/249/2022, under the Extradition Act as part of Nigerian government\u2019s approval of the request by the U. S. for Kyari\u2019s extradition.\n\nNAN reports that Kyari is to stand trial for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering and identity theft.\n\nHe was accused of conspiring with a United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based Nigerian, Ramon Abbas, aka Hushpuppi, to commit the crime, and Kyari had denied the allegations.\n\nA grand jury, on April 29, 2021, had filed an indictment against Kyari with the approval of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, and the court issued a warrant of arrest for him.\n\nHowever, the extradition proceeding is yet to be heard by the FHC as at the time of filing the report.\n\nNAN also reports that Justice Zainab Abubakar of a FHC had, on Feb. 22, gave the NDLEA the go-ahead to detain Kyari and six others in custody for another 14 days to conclude its investigation.\n\nHis application for bail was, on Feb. 28, turned down by a sister court, presided over by Justice Inyang Ekwo, on the grounds that a court of coordinate justification had already granted an order for his further detention.\n\nBut Ekwo, who said that he was inclined to hear Kyari\u2019s fundamental enforcement rights suit with the urgency it deserves after the expiration of the 14-day court order, fixed March 15 to hear Kyari\u2019s application.\n\nNAN reports that Kyari, earlier through his lawyer, had, on Feb. 21, approached the court with an ex-parte motion and originating summons seeking for a bail and asking the court to enforce his fundamental human rights which he alleged had been breached by the unlawful arrest and detention.\n\nHe said that the allegations preferred against him were trump-up and baseless.\n\nKyari, in the main suit, urged the court to make an order directing the NDLEA to pay him N500 million for infringing on his rights.\n\nHe also asked the court to direct the agency to tender a public apology in national dailies.\n\nThe suspended DCP had also challenged the order made on Feb. 22 by Justice Abubakar, empowering the NDLEA to detain him for more days.\n\nIn an application filed by his counsel before Abubakar, Kyari prayed the court to set aside the order for his detention, arguing that the order was issued without him being accorded a fair hearing.\n\nAbubakar had fixed tomorrow (Tuesday) for hearing Kyari\u2019s application.(NAN)www",

          "title": "Togolese inventor builds $12,000 mini tractors for the West African market",
          "text": "First, he received awards for inventing the \u201cFoufoumix\u201d, which brings relief from hours spent pounding foufou. Then, Minsob Logou invented a mini-tractor, tailor-made for local conditions. Now, he wants to sell it across the region.\n\nThis article was contributed to TechCabal by Blame Ekoue of bird story agency.\n\nSeeing imported agricultural machinery \u2013 often paid for by government or donors \u2013 lying discarded due to the unavailability of local servicing or parts was enough for Minsob Logou to invest his time, money, and energy into a local solution for farmers. The result: the Logoutrac mini-tractor. It\u2019s a step out of the kitchen and into the field for this award-winning Togolese inventor.\n\nBetter known in Togo and the region as the \u201cfather of Foufoumix\u201d Logou requires little introduction to those who keep an eye on the world of African invention. As early as 2002, Logou was honoured for his work by the World Intellectual Property Organisation and in 2014, he placed second at the African Innovation Awards. His desire to invent is deep-seated.\n\n\u201cThe story started from a passion that I had from an early age for all things related to technology. Since the benches of the school, I had this thing in me for all that is technological. I have to try to see how they were designed, how we arrive at what we design can respond to a given functionality. This is what gave me all this knowledge today, which far exceeds what I learned on the benches,\u201d Logou explained.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBorn into a large family, his position as an engineer at Togo Telecom, though coveted, was not enough to stop the inventor from resigning to devote himself to finding solutions full time. His first big win came with an invention that allows cooks at home and in restaurants to replace hours of strenuous work \u2013 the Foufoumix. The industrial-looking kitchen unit has been a hit in West Africa to such an extent that knock-offs are now produced in China. Logou tries to provide local solutions to local problems.\n\n\u201cThe basis of my research to be able to create a product is the observation of my community. When I see that they are in need of something, I can create machinery to make it easier for them to obtain a result in order to improve performance and make their lives better,\u201d he said.\n\nThat was the thinking behind his latest invention, launched recently at his small factory located on the outskirts of the Togolese capital, Lom\u00e9. Logou describes his mini-tractor \u2013 which sports the \u201cLogoutrac\u201d brand \u2013 as a \u2018made-in-Togo mini-tractor, a versatile, powerful, and resilient machine\u2019.\n\nThe prototype for the tractor, which retails for the local equivalent of $12,000, was built using salvaged parts, with the idea that doing so would help buyers easily access spare parts. But due to high initial demand, the young Togolese engineer quickly took the next step.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stay in recovery or recycling anymore and I am now manufacturing some of the spare parts of this machinery myself,\u201d he explained.\n\nLogou said that the initial idea for the mini-tractor came from his frustration at seeing the vast amounts of money that are used to purchase foreign agricultural machinery, only for it to be abandoned because spare parts are too difficult to too expensive to purchase locally.\n\n\u201cThe solutions that we import from elsewhere, most of the time, fail to meet our needs. So we end up with problems in agricultural mechanisation. Big tractors don\u2019t last long in the field before they break down. And when they stall, first, the expertise to detect the breakdown is a problem and the same spare part must be ordered from the parent company, which is quite complicated,\u201d he lamented.\n\nThe $12,000-mini tractors built by Minsob Logou. Image credit: bird story agency.\n\nSelling at 7 million FCFA (the equivalent of around $12,000), the mini-tractors are built for a regional market as well as a local one. That is why Lougou is looking carefully at the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) to which Togo is a signatory \u2013 and which should help him sell his inventions across Africa. Currently, there are trade barriers in place which prevent significant exports.\n\n\u201cPeople are showing interest but so far, there has been no international export. We should do it but the problem is free trade between African countries,\u201d fumed Logou.\n\nCurrently, Logoutrac equipment is sold by agricultural groups and the Togolese Ministry of Agriculture. A lower-cost option is already in the works.\n\n\u201cSince the cost is not within the reach of all farmers, we are working on a tiller for those who cannot afford it,\u201d Lougou explained.\n\nLogou\u2019s other pet project is finding solutions to a far wider problem: counterfeiting. While counterfeiting is estimated at 10% worldwide, it reaches 30 to 80% of products sold in Africa, depending on the sector. He has good reason to want to bring an end to counterfeits, especially of his Foufoumix product.\n\n\u201cThere are Chinese choppers that our compatriots import to sell and announce that it is foufoumix, but the latter is a registered trademark which has a patent\u2026 Having had trials in this direction, the conclusion that I have drawn is that our justices in West Africa are not strong enough in the field of intellectual property. There is still a lot to be done,\u201d he says, adding that he has brought counterfeiters to justice but nothing has come out of it.\n\nTo deal with this problem, he prefers to focus instead on the quality of his products.\n\n\u201cThe struggle is to have quality products,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Jimi Daodu has always been entrepreneurial. Back at Babcock University, he had established an entertainment business that organised parties in the school. After Daodu completed his master\u2019s programme in Advanced Computing at the University of Bristol, he wanted to stay back in the UK for a couple of years to work and earn back his master\u2019s fees. At the time, Daodu recalled, the British government allowed international students to apply for a post-work-study visa, which grants one a two-year stay in the UK. Daodu got the post-work-study visa, but things started to look grim when, for months, he couldn\u2019t get a job. Frustrated from his job search, Daodu contemplated booking a return ticket to Nigeria and returning to his shoe selling business.\n\nHe eventually got a job that sustained him until he got yet another which secured a visa for him and got him to stay. In the past decade, Daodu has worked in project management, hospitality, financial services, and the telecommunications industries all in the UK.\n\nDaodu was born in Lagos, Nigeria, and lived most of his years in the bustling city. He had studied Computer Science at Babcock University before going to the UK for a master\u2019s degree in Advanced Computing at the University of Bristol.\n\nIn 2017, Daodu got into the crypto space, Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin (BTC) were buzzy, so, he bought a couple. He then stumbled on virtual lands and saw them as an opportunity to diversify his digital assets and, as a Nigerian accustomed to the notion that land is the best investment, he bought some, even though he knew nothing about virtual lands. He got 8 plots of land in virtual spaces: 2 plots in Decentraland and 6 in Somnium Space for $200 each.\n\nThe idea for what would become a blockchain-based metaverse company, Vault Hill, started to form last February when he got an email stating that there was an offer on his land. He accepted the offer and sold a plot of land in Somnium Space for $10,000. He was stunned because he hadn\u2019t gotten such a high return from the stocks and shares he had purchased.\n\nHe realised that the only reason the buyer paid that much was because of the value associated with the virtual land, so, he realised that there was a market there. When he shared his idea with his friends, they said, \u201dJimi, you have come with your ideas again!\u201d But Daodu assured them: \u201cThis is the one.\u201d\n\nFounder and CEO of Vault Hill, Jimi Daodu\n\nIn May 2021, Daodu started bootstrapping Vault Hill by selling a few investments as well as plots of land in Somnium Space, for amounts ranging from $9,000 to $12,000. To differentiate itself from other virtual spaces and metaverse, Vault Hill City (Vault Hill\u2019s Metaverse) has four different islands and each island has 7 human-themed districts: Play, Romance, Curiosity, Community, Idealism, Vitality, and Imagination. \u201cEach district is human-themed to ensure the metaverse is open to everybody. This space is infinite; it is hard to choose a target audience, so we want to build an ecosystem where anyone can come in.\u201d Currently, the cost of a plot of land in a district in Vault Hill City range between $2,000 and $2,600.\n\nDaodu describing a metaverse, said, \u201cMetaverse is a shared virtual space. It\u2019s like Twitter, but in a gamified perspective\u2014the use of augmented reality and virtual reality. In a metaverse, you have to create a digital representation of yourself called an avatar, which allows you to navigate the digital world since you can\u2019t go into the digital world with your physical body.\u201d Daodu\u2019s definition of a metaverse involves a connection to the blockchain, decentralised finance, and freedom from control by the government, or even private individuals.\n\nIt is in respect to this vision that Vault Hill is building through 3 phases and at the end of the third phase, Vault Hill is handed over to a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO)\u2014the community of token and landowners\u2014which will be responsible for decision making on its metaverse.\n\nVault Hill is building a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace to allow NFT artists to list their art on the metaverse and display it to potential buyers through a gamified experience. Vault Hill is also encouraging companies to build edifices in their metaverse. The two plots of land Daodu bought on Decentraland were merged together to build Vault Hill\u2019s sales office.\n\nVault Hill is also partnering with Ready Player Me to build out avatars and incorporate digital wearables and limited-edition accessories. It is also partnering with Nigerian brands including Crivel Watches and Looks Like a Good Man for corporate and traditional wear. \u201cAdditionally, we are currently working to have interoperability of avatars. That is, using one avatar across multiple metaverses instead of having to create one for Vault Hill, and another for Decentraland,\u201d Vault Hill said. Vault Hill Part is also partnering with Lingua54 to use machine learning to translate the speeches of avatars across different languages in real time.\n\nAs funding was a constant headache for the team, Vault Hills started talking to traditional venture capitalists to raise funds, but a lot of them didn\u2019t understand what they were building. A senior colleague, at the time, had said \u201cIf you\u2019re talking to VCs, and they don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re building, you\u2019re doing something right.\u201d\n\nTo meet its funding needs, Vault Hill created a token called VHC token\u2014which is currently going for $0.003697 on Coin Market Cap, as of the time of writing. With it, Vault Hill raised $2.1 million in pre-pre-seed and private equity rounds, selling 25% of its total supply of tokens of 340 million. The majority of the fund will go into product development and hiring, Daodu said.\n\nMajority holders of the VHC token or majority landowners in the Vault Hill City will have voting power in the DAO. The VHC token will serve as a medium of a transaction within the metaverse, give majority token holders voting power in Vault Hill\u2019s proposed DAO and reward content creators when they get to sell or get traction for their artworks and content.\n\nDaodu speaks about the challenges of building a metaverse company: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a book on how to build a metaverse, so there isn\u2019t anything like what a good one looks like.\u201d But one challenge stands out: getting talent. \u201cYou need a host of developers\u2014extended reality developers, a mix of augmented and virtual reality developers, blockchain developers, full-stack developers, etc, but because it is an emerging technology and these skills are not taught in most traditional schools yet, they can be difficult to find.\u201d\n\nBut Daodu is optimistic, especially about the increase in VR adoption in recent years, which he said is both the cost and effect of the cost of the tech. \u201cAs adoption grows, the cost of technology always drops. The Oculus quest is retailing for $300, would that get to $50- $100 at some point in time? Absolutely. People are already spending $1,000 on an iPhone every year.\u201d\n\nDaodu noted that Vault Hill is not building an escapism platform, but intentionally thinking about how humans do things in the real world and then creating a way to augment it virtually\u2014with an ultimate aim of fostering human interaction. For example, in its Vitality district, it will collaborate with physiotherapists to help people with mental health challenges and create an augmented reality (AR) consultation service for London Bridge sports medicine, which will allow patients that can\u2019t come in physically for consultation in the hospital to get consultation services through augmented reality.\n\nThe first glance of Vault Hill City will be up by Q2 2022 and by the end of the year, it will be fully running. \u201cUsers will be able to design their own unique experiences, explore their fantasies, and also enjoy activities they do in the physical world such as interacting with other users, attending events, playing games, curating arts, exercising, host shows, visiting a library, build a music studio, and so much more,\u201d Vault Hill said. \u201cUsers will be able to access the metaverse using a virtual reality headset for a fully immersive experience. But they will also be able to explore the metaverse through laptops.\u201d\n\n\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Two years and 3 million rides later, can SafeBoda keep its lead in Nigeria?",
          "text": "On Wednesday, Ibadan-based Ugandan bike hailing startup SafeBoda clocked two years of operating in the Nigerian market.\n\nSafeBoda launched in Nigeria in December 2019 but started operations in January 2020. The startup had initially set to launch in May 2019 but months of deliberations\u2014including that of the best city market entry\u2014delayed its launch.\n\nThen, finally, in a surprising move which immediately created an outlier reputation for the company, SafeBoda skipped Lagos, the Nigerian commercial hub, to launch in Ibadan, a decision that continues to pay off\u2014especially considering that the Lagos government shutdown bike hailing businesses a month after it launched.\n\nSafeBoda\u2019s growth since its launch has been groundbreaking. In June 2020, about 6 months after its operation started, it reached a milestone of 100,000 rides. Also, in August 2020, it grew 150% and recorded 250,000 rides. And by the end of the year, while it was pausing its Kenyan operation, it celebrated half a million rides in Nigeria.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, its defining growth started when in April 2021, the startup reached the 1 million rides milestone; that\u2019s a 150% growth in a month. Prior to that, it had done the same rate quarterly, and since then to date, it\u2019s been bumping up the numbers.\n\nAs anyone would expect, an increase in the number of rides must have been the result of an increase in other proportional metrics. By June 2021, 100,000 passengers had signed up on the platform, and 3 months after that, its 8,000th rider was onboarded. And in November it was doing 20,000 rides daily.\n\nFast forward to today, SafeBoda claims to have recorded over 3 million rides, more than 10,000 riders, over 100,000 users, and completed 50,000 deliveries.\n\nThe startup currently offers 3 services in Nigeria: rides, deliveries, and airtime purchase. The payment vertical which has already launched in Uganda, will launch in Nigeria soon.\n\nThe end and the beginning of an era\n\nSafeBoda is endearing to people for many reasons. One of them is its first Nigeria Country Director Babajide Duroshola, who led the startup from launching till June last year when he exited for another East African startup that had just expanded into Nigeria.\n\nSafeBoda Nigeria\u2019s new Country Director Olaoluwa Arokoyu\n\nChanging leadership always comes with challenges and SafeBoda faced its fair share. But it quickly made an internal replacement when it appointed its Head of Operation Olaoluwa Arokoyu as CEO. Arokoyu had previously worked in operations with Opay and Jumia and joined SafeBoda 5 months prior to Duroshola\u2019s exit.\n\nEver since his appointment, Arokoyu has achieved some laudable milestones including taking the company from 2 million rides to over 3 million rides, optimising the app for address verification during the onboarding process to reduce fraudulent activities, and improving how riders are being paid to increase brand loyalty among riders.\n\nCreating a better experience for all\n\nSafeBoda says it\u2019s as compassionate with its riders the same way it is with passengers. It says in a statement that it\u2019s constantly looking for a better way to increase the earning power of its riders while giving passengers a good experience. \u201cAs a result of this increased earning power, SafeBoda riders and their families have access to a more quality lifestyle.\u201d\n\n\u201cSafeBoda\u2019s primary mission is to provide a better standard of living for drivers and customers. Everything we do is aligned with this goal,\u201d Arokoyu told TechCabal.\n\nSafeBoda\u2019s riders in Ibadan\n\nFor SafeBoda riders like Ghazali Saheed, who\u2019s the 5964th rider that joined the bike-hailing startup, the best thing about SafeBoda is the respect they [the riders] get from customers that other riders don\u2019t get. \u201cSafeBoda also makes it easy to set targets and reach them. It\u2019s easy for us to know where to get a lot of orders so that we can easily reach our targets,\u201d he said.\n\nLike many bike-hailing startups, SafeBoda is also destigmatising bike [okada] riding in Ibadan and Nigeria as a whole. The way it looks, it\u2019s like these bike-hailing companies are formalising a sector that\u2019s been informal for a long time.\n\n\u201cThe okada or boda business isn\u2019t categorised to be prestigious within African communities. But with a touch of orange, the story is different. SafeBoda riders are highly regarded and respected, not just because of the colour but because of their conduct,\u201d said Clement Obaro, Growth Manager at SafeBoda.\n\nCompetition is stronger than ever\n\nDue to SafeBoda\u2019s success in Ibadan, it has become apparent that the city is the new juicy spot for the bike-hailing market and, as a result of that, it has also become a battleground. Everybody wants a piece of the pie. Uber last month launched its bike-hailing arm in Ibadan and joined the host of others like MaxNG, ORide, and Gokada to snag more market share from SafeBoda.\n\n\u201cWe have been expecting this to happen and now that it has, we are not worried. Our focus is to keep giving the best experience to our customers and keeping our riders happy and willing to complete more rides daily,\u201d said Arokoyu. \u201cThe sky is wide enough for all birds to fly; healthy competition is always good for business.\u201d\n\nSafeBoda is one of the most active bike-hailing companies in sub-Saharan Africa as it holds more than 80% market share in Uganda and Nigeria. Uber and Bolt had first launched their bike-hailing product in Uganda but couldn\u2019t beat SafeBoda.\n\nIf combining the popularity and capital war chest of Uber and Bolt, the two most powerful mobility startups in the world, couldn\u2019t beat SafeBoda in Uganda, there\u2019s no saying that only Uber can pull it off in Nigeria. But it\u2019s a different market, however, with the level of loyalty SafeBoda has built among riders and customers, it won\u2019t be an easy call to dominate over it in Ibadan.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Facebook content moderators in Kenya will receive a 30-50% pay rise. This announcement comes two weeks after an investigation report by TIME revealed that content moderators in Nairobi were subject to poor pay and working conditions by Sama, a company responsible for Facebook\u2019s sub-Saharan Africa content moderation since 2019.\n\nEvery content moderator will receive an extra 20,000 Kenyan shillings ($176) per month, Sama told employees in a meeting on Tuesday, sources revealed to TIME.\n\n\u201cThe raise means that the lowest-paid Facebook content moderators at Sama will now take home around 50,000 Kenyan shillings ($439) each month after-tax, or around $2.20 per hour for a 9-hour working day. This is up from around $1.50 per hour previously.\u201d\n\nAll content moderators were also promised yearly bonuses worth one month of their salary, as an incentive to remain at the company, according to the sources.\n\nDespite the obvious correlation, Habel Kamau, a human resources director at Sama\u2019s Nairobi office, said that the salary increase wasn\u2019t a result of the release of the investigation by TIME. He claimed that the conversations about a salary increase had been ongoing for a while now, adding that the pay raise was made possible due to budget cuts from other places and not as a result of Sama receiving additional money from Facebook.\n\nAlthough the pay raise is welcomed by many of the content moderators, some still say it\u2019s not enough. Sama employees remain some of Facebook\u2019s lowest-paid workers anywhere in the world. While the lowest starting salary of a Facebook content moderator at Sama is $2.20 per hour, outsourced content moderators for Facebook in the U.S. are paid a typical starting salary of $18 per hour.\n\nSouth African Daniel Motaung, a former employee of Sama who was fired after trying to lead a union, noted that in 2019 employees had requested for their pay to be doubled. \u201cThis increase will make a difference but it won\u2019t change their lives,\u201d Motaung said in the statement. \u201cThey still won\u2019t be able to buy a house or feed their families in line with the \u2018lifting the poor out of poverty\u2019 narrative that Sama continuously boasts about.\u201d\n\nSama didn\u2019t comment on allegations that its managers suppressed a unionization effort in 2019, which led to Motaung losing his Job. Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company also declined to comment on the announcement of the pay raise.\n\nThe announcement of the pay raise is seen as a win for the content moderators and validation of the power in employees speaking up.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week was business as usual on the African tech funding scene, with Kenya-based fintech, M-KOPA announcing the largest raise of the week \u2013 $75 million. But it wasn\u2019t all a bed of roses; San Francisco-based digital bank for startups, Mercury, blocked the accounts of some African startups linked to it.\n\nElsewhere, the barrage of sanctions and restrictions \u2013 cough cough cancel culture \u2013 continued against Russia as the Ukraine-Russia tensions enter its third week on March 10, 2022. If you ask me, all of that changes nothing. But then, nobody asked me.\n\nMeanwhile, here\u2019s what we are discussing today:\n\nTech Hive Advisory\u2019s State of Tech Policy in Nigeria 2022 report, and\n\nThe clause you\u2019ve not been paying attention to in your employee contract\n\nA snail-paced legislature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed the Nigeria tech scene for long enough, you\u2019d have noticed one fact: policies and regulations are often received with varying reactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSometimes, these reactions are pretty negative, as we saw when the Lagos State government banned Okadas or when the Central Bank of Nigeria ordered banks to close accounts of people trading in cryptocurrencies and stop facilitating such transactions.\n\nHowever, some of these policies have created some ripple effects like this and this.\n\nIn 2021, we also saw microblogging platform, Twitter banned, ushering in a VPN-filled period and speculation on whether the heavily criticised Social Media Bill would get reintroduced. Although the ban was eventually lifted, as a Twitter poll conducted by Techpoint Africa suggests, Nigerians consider a similar occurrence highly likely.\n\nSometimes, these policies receive flack where there might be no need, as we saw with CBN\u2019s new licensing requirements for Payment Service Providers in May 2021.\n\nOne thing is sure; there\u2019s quite a lot to unpack in the governance and policy aisle of the Nigeria tech scene.\n\nLast week, technology policy and advisory and research firm, Tech Hive Advisory, in partnership with Ikigai innovation Initiative, a tech policy-focused NGO, released the State of Tech Policy in Nigeria 2022.\n\nThe report covers events from the first quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2021, focusing on cybersecurity, data protection, consumer protection, among others, including predictions, recommendations, and stakeholder insights.\n\nInterestingly, the report reveals that about 54% of bills mentioned are yet to pass the First Reading before the legislature, a testament to the notoriously slow legislative process of the National Assembly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor context, the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation was released in 2019, and a Data Protection Bill was proposed in 2020. Nothing much has been heard since a stakeholder session held in September 2020.\n\nAlthough an argument could be made that good laws require meticulous attention to detail, the delay the process causes might not always be a good trade-off.\n\nDid you read your employee contract?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know that signing job contracts \u2013 or any agreement, really \u2013 where the dispute resolution clause only creates room for arbitration is a bad idea? Well, it is; you might want to look at the agreements you signed for your current job. This is not a drill!\n\nUnfortunately, if you\u2019ve already put pen to paper and signed on the dotted line \u2013 well, we all sign these days virtually \u2013 then there might not be so much hope for you. But don\u2019t take my word for it; please, consult a lawyer.\n\nThis and many more were some of the nuggets dropped during Techpoint\u2019s Twitter Spaces, titled, \u201cOptimising for employee safety in the era of remote work\u201d, held on Friday, March 4, 2022.\n\nWe had talent acquisition expert, Samuel Akinlotan; Founder, Vazi Legal, Modupe Odele; Cowrywise Lead, People and Culture, Emmanuel Faith; and Tech and Startup Lawyer, Zikora Okwor-Wewan, lead an insightful discussion on the different aspects of employee safety.\n\nIf you couldn\u2019t attend, we have recordings \u2013 thanks to Internet connectivity issues \u2013 of the discussion here and here.\n\nYou can also watch out for future Twitter Spaces in the coming weeks.

They also grew their combined revenue to a record N4.1 trillion, a 23.5 percent jump from N3.3 trillion in 2020.\n\nThe firms\u2019 performance in 2021 is made more special by the fact that it is only a year after the brutal COVID-19 pandemic that still has some businesses reeling.\n\nDespite the performance of the five companies, if an investor put money in all of them at the beginning of 2021, the value of his/her holdings will be down 8.9 percent.\n\nThat\u2019s because the 12 percent decline in the share price of BUA Cement and the 10.6 percent decline in Nestle\u2019s will be enough to wipe out the marginal gains in the others. Dangote Cement is up only six percent so far this year while MTN and Zenith have gained a paltry three percent and 4.5 percent as of Friday.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the sluggish pace of reforms by the government, especially with FX, these companies would have done much better,\u201d said Muda Yusuf, an economist and former director-general of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a private sector advocacy group.\n\n\u201cThe reforms investors have yearned for in the economy are still pending, with exception to the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act, which many say came even too late,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s foreign exchange management system, which has left several foreign investors unable to access dollars, has spooked many away from the market and blocked new inflows.\n\nForeign investors used to be the most active traders of Nigerian stocks but that has changed since 2019, with domestic investors now in the driving seat.\n\nRead also: NGX tasks investors on diversification of portfolios\n\nLast year, foreign investors only traded N434 billion worth of Nigerian stocks, the lowest since 2011 and less than half of a peak of N1.5 trillion attained in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe market is in dire need of triggers that can sway investor sentiment, particularly that of foreign investors who have deserted the market,\u201d Ayodeji Ebo, head of retail investment at Chapel Hill Denham, said.\n\n\u201cThe share performance of these companies is a reflection of a much deeper problem with the Nigerian economy,\u201d he added.\n\nOf the five firms, Dangote Cement posted the largest revenue (N364.4 billion) as cement sales in Nigeria jumped to a record high.\n\nMTN Nigeria, which is enjoying a surge in data revenues, recorded the second-largest profit with N298.6 billion while Zenith Bank, which grew loans and advances by 20.7 percent in 2021, had the third-largest profit with N244.6 billion.\n\nBUA Cement and Nestle Nigeria recorded profits of N91.9 billion and N40 billion respectively.\n\nWith revenues of N1.65 trillion in the review period, MTN led the revenue chart, closely followed by Dangote Cement, whose revenue stood at N1.38 trillion. Both companies are the only trillion-naira revenue companies in the country.\n\nZenith Bank, Nestle and BUA posted N427.6 billion, N351.8 billion and N257.3 billion in revenues respectively.\n\nWhile the majority are posting profits that stand at the highest since 2015, Nestle Nigeria has not fully recovered from the pandemic, with profit still lagging the numbers posted in 2019 and 2018.\n\nCompared to the N40 billion profit made in 2021, a mere two percent growth from 2020, Nestle posted profits of N45.6 billion in 2019 and N43 billion in 2018. Nestle, like other fast-moving consumer goods companies, is reeling from lower consumer purchasing power and high inflation.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economy may have grown by the most since 2015, when President Muhammadu Buhari was first voted into office, but the size of the economy has grown smaller since then and Nigerians are worse off.\n\nThe shrinking size of the economy means there is a smaller pie to share among Nigeria\u2019s 200 million people, a painful squeeze for a country that is home to the world\u2019s largest number of poor people.\n\nThe economy grew by 3.4 percent in 2021, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), marking the fastest growth rate in seven years. But the economy is valued at only $436.29 billion, 20 percent less than it was worth in 2014 ($546.67 billion), according to World Bank data.\n\nThe country\u2019s economic performance in 2021, not significantly improved from the chaotic years since the recession in 2016, is made to look impressive by the impact of the ravaging pandemic in 2020 when the economy shrank by the most in over two decades.",

I respectfully urge you, your royal majesty to take this on too as a major task because, just as it has been mentioned, our country depends a great deal on oil production,\u201d he pleaded.\n\nOsinbajo emphasized that, the nation\u2019s desire was to see that security challenges in Delta State were brought to an end in most of the oil-producing communities.\n\n\u201cWe recognize, especially with security that very few administrations had been confronted with this plethora of security challenges that we have been confronted with.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the share number and range of those security challenges, it\u2019s evident that it is necessary to have a leader such as Muhammadu Buhari to be able to take on those challenges, but the role of traditional rulership is critical, absolutely critical now,\u201d he added.\n\nAt the palace of the Ovie of Uvwie Kingdom, Osinbajo lauded the monarch for his role in sustaining the peace in Uvwie kingdom.\n\nHe reiterated that in view of the fact that traditional rulers were more in touch with the grassroots, there was the need for the National Assembly to incorporate and apportion them constitutional roles.\n\nHe prayed that with the level of politics gathering momentum, the National Assembly would be able to finish its constitutional duty and amend the constitution as expected.\n\nEarlier in a welcome address, the Ovie of Uvwie Kingdom had expressed surprise that despite their presentations to the National Assembly, the Committee on Constitutional Review paid no attention to the need for a constitutional role for traditional rulers.\n\nHe appealed to the executive to intervene and commended the Federal Government for the continuous support for the traditional institutions.\n\nAlso responding in his palace earlier, the Olu of Warri, Ogiame Atuwatse 111 commended the Federal Government for all its efforts in repositioning the country.\n\nHe pledged the support of the traditional institutions in supporting the government towards returning peace to the country.\n\nThe royal father particularly commended the Vice President for the supportive roles to the President adding \u201d thank you for the good works you have been doing, supporting Mr. President and putting Nigeria first.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Delta State governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, who was represented by his deputy, Otuaro, harped on the need for a constitutional role for traditional rulers.\n\nHe assured that the state administration would leave good legacies behind at the expiration of the tenure in 2023, just as he commended the Olu of Warri for his fatherly support to the administration in the state.\n\nThe Vice President was in Delta State for the Thanksgiving ceremony of late Chief Patrick Ideh, aged 95, a nationalist lawyer since 1961.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

I will not decamp from the PDP; we will always win any election. PDP won in the last election and we will continue to win all elections in the state and country; nothing will stop us as a party,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor noted that the forthcoming local government election in the state will set the template for next year\u2019s national and legislative elections, urging party members to reflect on the elections and work in unity to ensure victory in the polls.\n\nHe noted, \u201cThere is no division in Edo PDP. Let the party be open to accommodate others. PDP is democratic. The hallmark of democracy is ensuring that the majority has their way, as the minority can\u2019t dictate to the people.\n\n\u201cI heard that Chief Dan Orbih went around, saying there is no harmonization in Edo PDP. This is really irresponsible to say and an insult to members of the party, as the party has truly harmonised in the state.\n\n\u201cPDP in Edo State is harmonised because before we made any appointments in any ward, we made sure the party at that level was harmonised. We are gathered here now as election timetable is out; harmonisation has been done, appointments made and we are ready to win any election before us.\u201d\n\nObaseki disclosed that the PDP National Chairman Iyorchia Ayu will visit the state on Thursday 10th of March 2022, urging party leaders to bring along five percent of newly registered members to welcome the party chair.\n\n\u201cPolitics is not about fighting but dialogue and discussion. I urge us to collaborate and unite to move the party and state forward,\u201d he charged.\n\nNoting that over 539,000 members have been registered in the ongoing e-registration exercise, Obaseki said, \u201cThese numbers are not fabricated as we have the data, pictures, emails and phone numbers of members of the party we have registered so far. You have broken records as this is the bastion of PDP in Nigeria. We have changed the face of politics in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI didn\u2019t give leaders any resources to mobilize them but rather they challenged themselves and achieved the goal to register more members in the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people went around saying people should not join our party. No true party man will do that. Those that engaged in that are not true members of the party and don\u2019t belong to Edo PDP. If not, they will not push people away from the party.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur focus now is on how to engage our members, making them participate in the policy-making process of the party. We don\u2019t need to wait for an election before we act.\u201d\n\nCharging detractors sponsoring disunity in the state to stop forthwith, the governor stated, \u201cEdo is Edo, leave Edo State alone. They have tried us in battle, and have been made to know that we are battle-ready. We have been tested and trusted. We must always win elections; we must always win as a party.\n\nThe Chairman PDP Edo State, Anthony Aziegbemi, noted that \u201cEdo State is the only state in the nation that has surpassed the 500,000 thresholds for e-registration of the party.\u201d\n\nOthers at the meeting include the Deputy Governor of Edo State, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu; Speaker of Edo State House of Assembly (EDHA), Hon. Marcus Onobun; Senator Matthew Urhoghide; Senator Clifford Odia; Chief Tom Ikimi; Hon.

Edo is special and we know that the British troop that invaded the Benin Empire stayed back and developed the golf section about 76 years ago.\n\n\u201cThis is an inheritance that must be treasured and as a government, we are focusing and emphasizing the cleaning and greening of the golf section. We will be working with you in planting trees as many of the trees planted have fallen.

Ubia, ASP Bawa James, Insp. Simon Agirigba and Insp.

          "title": "Constitution review dashes hope for restructuring",
          "text": "By ADEBAYO OBAJEMU\n\nSince 1999 when democracy returned to the country the most topical issue has been the nature and structure of the constitution bequeathed to the new republic by the military, which many people regard as unitary and unsuitable for a multi- ethnic and religious federal system. The first attempt by former president Obasanjo was scuttle by his third term agenda.\n\nSince then every government has conducted political conference and also constitutional amendment review but it has largely been unsuccessful as the key areas of concern such as fiscal federalism, state police, devolution of power etc remained untouched.\n\nWith ethnic and separatist agitations rising many people had pinned their hope on the current exercise by the 9th National Assembly to address such issues, the outcome has been an anticlimax as not only are most restructuring advocates disappointed, women who had canvassed for inclusion and affirmative policy in accordance with the Beijing protocol, had their hopes also dashed.\n\nMore important, however, is the fact that Nigerians, across board, are convinced that not even the National Assemblys best effort will be good enough for Nigeria they yearn for. This fact was captured in a very expansive statement by the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) late last year when it declared in a statement that has since been echoed by many other Pan \u2014 ethnic organisations in the country: \u201cNigerias future\u201d, it said, \u201crests largely on its willingness to address major constraints to equity and justice, a functional structure, consistent good governance, security for all citizens, a credible electoral process, growing understanding between, and among all groups, and an economy that grows and narrows inequalities between classes and regions.\u201d\n\nThe statement further added that : national goals cannot be achieved by a process that makes wasteful expenditure around false hopes a routine. The legislature and executive branches of government have large quantities of reviews, recommendations and reports from past attempts at amending the constitutions and these represent enough resources for a review if the legislature is serious about this vital national priority.\n\nSpecifically, it said: A Nigerian Peoples Conference on Review of the Constitution will benefit from past work in this direction in addition to contemporary challenges, which the country needs to address in a context that allows free and productive engagements without pre-determined ends.\n\nLast November, elder statesman, Edwin Clark, alleged that the National Assembly spends about N1 billion annually on the effort to review the nations constitution without making any headway. He then advised President Muhammadu Buhari to convoke a meeting of representatives of Nigeria to deliberate on the report submitted by the Governor Nasir el-Rufai committee set up by the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) on restructuring.\n\nHe then ominously warned that unless the injustice perceived by parts of the country is addressed, the issue of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and other agitators will be a childs play.\n\nMany who spoke to BusinessHallmark like Professor Hassan Jameel, a political scientist, said, \u201cNigerians have come to the knowledge that the successive National Assemblies, including the current one have always been interested in the money to fund the various review committees, and not the fundamental of getting through the review to achieve result. The exercise is nothing more than a sink hole, another way for legislators to further add to their humongous emoluments which rank among the highest in the world.\u201d\n\nFor years, Nigerians have yearned for a new constitution to no avail, and in the absence of this, there have been clamour for constitution review to address germane issues such as resource control, financial autonomy for state legislatures and local governments among others, including fundamental restructuring of the polity.\n\nJust two weeks ago, the National Assembly passed five bills, as part of the 68 proposed by the joint committee of the National Assembly on constitution reviews. The bills seek to give states control of some sectors by removing them from the Executive list to the Concurrent list.\n\nThe bill for an Act to Alter Part I of the Second Schedule to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 to include Value Added Tax on the Exclusive Legislative List, was borne from the feud between the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, in 2021, over rights to collect Value Added Tax. It was rejected.\n\nThe former had made moves to legally own the rights. It also approached the National Assembly and asked that it include the collection of VAT in the exclusive legislative list \u2014 an amendment to the Constitution. During the voting process at plenary, the bill recorded a low number of votes \u2014 below the required number needed for it to pass.\n\nAt the Senate, 41 lawmakers voted in favour of the legislation while 44 voted against. And at the House of Representatives, 209 members voted against and it only 91 voted in favour of the legislation.\n\nSome of the legislations on devolution of powers that were passed at the National Assembly include a bill to move airports from exclusive legislative list to concurrent legislative list. At the Senate, the bill had 84 senators vote in favour of it and only two voted against it. At the House of Representatives, 283 voted for it while 30 voted against.\n\nAnother bill passed is the bill to move fingerprints, identification and criminal records from the exclusive legislative list to the concurrent legislative list.\n\nWhile 86 senators voted for the bill, three voted against it. The legislation was also passed at the House.\n\nAnother bill to delete prisons in the Exclusive legislative list and re-designate it as Correctional Services in the Concurrent Legislative list received overwhelming votes from the lawmaker.\n\nThe bill that sought to move the Railway from the Exclusive Legislative List to Concurrent Legislative List also scaled through at the Senate. A total of 90 lawmakers at the Senate voted in favour of the legislation; there was no opposition. Their counterparts at the House voted in favour of the legislation as well.\n\nThe federal lawmakers also passed the bill that seeks to allow states to generate, transmit and distribute electricity in areas covered by the national grid.\n\nThe amendment, according to Professor Adeagbo Moritiwon, another political scientist ,\u201dis about one of the most significant endeavours to be undertaken by the ninth assembly as previous assemblies tried amending the constitution with varying levels of success. But i can tell you that this effort is like scratching the surface, because it failed fundamentally to address the concerns of those advocating for restructuring of the country for equity.\u201d\n\nIn all, the lawmakers voted electronically on 68 Constitution Amendment bills during plenary accepting some and rejecting others.\n\nIn one of the very first votes, the lawmakers granted financial and administrative autonomy to all the local governments across Nigeria.\n\nThey voted for Independent candidacy in elections and separated the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation from that of the Minister of Justice.\n\nHowever, lawmakers voted against pension for presiding officers of the National Assembly and rejected virtually all provisions designed to improve women\u2019s inclusion in Nigerian politics and society.\n\n\u201cLet me be frank with you, any legislature that fails to address the need to deepens the inclusion of women in politics has failed\u201d, Dr. T\u00f3mi Ohiare, a sociologist at Kogi State University told BusinessHallmark.\n\nSome of the other bills passed last Tuesday included financial independence of State Houses of Assembly and State Judiciary, moving of airports from the exclusive legislative list to the concurrent legislative list and allowing states to generate, transmit and distribute electricity in areas not covered by the national grid.\n\nOthers include a bill that sets a timeframe for the submission of names of ministerial and commissioner-nominees, another that sets a timeframe for the conduct of census, and one that enshrines free and compulsory basic education as a fundamental human right. Some of the bills which were thrown out by the lawmakers bordered on the termination of tenure on account of political party defection, diaspora voting, procedure for overriding the Presidents veto for constitution alteration, virtual court hearing.\n\nThe lawmakers voted against a bill seeking to provide special seats for women in the National and State Houses of Assembly. The bill was defeated in the Senate with 58 votes out of 91.\n\nDr. Ariyo Obatomi, an historian in a chat with BusinessHallmark said that the National Assembly failed to address the issue of restructuring and the fundamental defects in the 1999 Constitution.\n\nHe said even \u201cPresident Yar Adua condemned the election that catapulted him to power as defective and needed a review same way Obasanjo later admitted that the election that also brought him to power was not perfect. Yet, the National Assembly refused to do the needful.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmad Lawan had, on February 6, 2020, set up a 56- member committee for the purpose of constitution review, with all the principal officers as members in addition to one senator from each state, and two others, selected to represent each geo-political zone.\n\nIn a report by Premium Times sometimes in 2015, the online medium said huge sums of money were sunk into this review without actually addressing the restructuring needs of Nigerians.\n\nIn an investigation lasting months, this newspaper found that between 2011 and 2015, the 53-member House of Representatives Ad-hoc Constitution Review Committee and its 49-member counterpart in the Senate in the 7th National Assembly withdrew N3,250,000,000.00 and N4,500,000,000.00 respectively to purportedly execute the fourth alteration of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cIt is not immediately clear how the lawmakers spent the outrageous funds but insiders say a huge chunk of it was pocketed by members of the committees in what one source described as unprecedented naira bazaar, by a committee of the National Assembly.\n\nHowever, it is not known how much the current National Assembly have spent in the review.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "By OKEY ONYEWEAKU\n\nAmidst continuing headwinds in the economic arena, Zenith Bank, United Bank for Africa (UBA) and GT Holding company have delivered strong and superior performances for the year end December 31, 2021, Business Hallmark has learnt.\n\nAccording to the results which have begun trickling in, while UBA recorded a whooping increase of 20 per cent in profit before tax showing, Zenith Bank also delivered an equally impressive 10 percent growth in profit at the end of business year 2021. On the flip side while GT Holding company also showcased strong profits, it however declined marginally by 6.97 per cent. These results show that the tier 1 banks are stoic and moved against the head and tail winds to create value and wealth for their owners.\n\nZenith Bank\n\nZenith Bank Plc announced an impressive result for the year ended December 31, 2021, recording a double-digit growth of 10% in gross earnings which rose to N765.6 billion from N696.5 billion reported in the previous year. This is despite a challenging macroeconomic environment aggravated by the Corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nAccording to the bank\u2019s audited financial results for the 2021 financial year presented to the Nigeria Exchange Group (NGX), the Group achieved year-on-year (YoY) growth in gross earnings of 10% from NGN696.5 billion reported in the previous year to N765.6billion.\n\nThis was on the back of 23% YoY growth in non-interest income from N251.7billion to N309billion and a 2% YoY growth in interest income from N420.8billion to NGN427.6billion.\n\nProfit before tax also grew by 10% from NGN255.9 billion to NGN280.4 billion in the current year. The increase was due to growth in the top-line and very strong management of the treasury portfolio that increased efficiency, resulting in a drop in interest expense by 12% from NGN121.1 billion in 2020 to NGN106.8 billion in the current year. This further led to a 7% increase in net interest income of NGN320.8 billion in 2021 from NGN299.7 billion in 2020.\n\nCustomer deposits increased by 21%, growing from NGN5.34 trillion in the previous year to NGN6.47 trillion in the current year. The growth in customer deposits came from both corporate and retail customers. Retail deposits grew by NGN146 billion from NGN1.72 trillion in 2020 to NGN1.87 trillion in 2021. The Group\u2019s continuous drive for retail deposits combined with the strategic rebalancing of its funding base helped to reduce the cost of funding from 2.1% to 1.5% in the current year. Although operating expenses grew by 13% YoY, growth remains below the inflation rate, and the Group improved its Earnings per Share (EPS) which grew by 6% from NGN7.34 to NGN7.78.\n\nTotal assets increased by 11%, growing from NGN8.48 trillion in 2020 to NGN9.45 trillion in 2021, mainly driven by growth in customer deposits. With the steady recovery in economic activities, the Group prudently grew its gross loans by 20%, from NGN2.9 trillion in 2020 to NGN3.5 trillion in 2021, with moderated NPL ratio from 4.29% to 4.19% YoY. The Group recorded impressive liquidity and capital adequacy ratios of 71.6% and 21.0%, which remained above regulatory thresholds of 30% and 15%, respectively.\n\nSources say that in 2022, the Group intends to consolidate on the gains achieved in the previous year in all business segments and combine leadership in the industry, innovation and technology to drive improved performance and deliver enhanced returns to all stakeholders.\n\nAs a testament to its commitment to its shareholders, the bank has presently announced a proposed final dividend payout of N2.80 per share, bringing the total dividend to N3.10 per share.\n\nZenith Bank has continued to distinguish itself in the Nigerian financial services industry through superior service offerings, unique customer experience and sound financial indices. The bank remains a clear leader in the digital space with several firsts in deploying innovative products, solutions and an assortment of alternative channels that ensure convenience, speed and safety of transactions.\n\nIn recognition of its track record of excellent performance, Zenith Bank was voted as Best Commercial Bank in Nigeria in the World Finance Banking Awards 2021, Best Bank in Nigeria in the Global Finance World\u2019s Best Banks Awards 2020 and 2021, Bank of the Year (Nigeria) in The Banker\u2019s Bank of the Year Awards 2020, and Best in Corporate Governance \u2018Financial Services\u2019 Africa 2020 and 2021 by the Ethical Boardroom.\n\nAlso, the bank emerged as the Most Valuable Banking Brand in Nigeria in the Banker Magazine Top 500 Banking Brands 2020 and 2021, Number One Bank in Nigeria by Tier-1 Capital in the \u201c2021 Top 1000 World Banks\u201d Ranking by The Banker Magazine and the Retail Bank of the year at the BusinessDay Banks and Other Financial Institutions (BOFI) Awards 2020 and 2021.\n\nSimilarly, Zenith Bank was honoured as Bank of the Decade (People\u2019s Choice) at the ThisDay Awards 2020 and emerged winner in four categories at the Sustainability, Enterprise, and Responsibility (SERAS) Awards 2021, carting home the awards for \u201cBest Company in Reporting and Transparency\u201d, \u201cBest Company in Infrastructure Development\u201d, \u201cBest Company in Gender Equality and Women Empowerment\u201d, and the coveted \u201cMost Responsible Organisation in Africa.\n\nUBA\n\nUBA has surpassed industry expectations with its 2021 financial results demonstrating solid vigour for the year ended December 31. The result which was released on March 4, 2022 showed that gross earnings rose significantly to N660.2 billion representing an increase of 7 percent compared to N616.8 billion recorded at the end of the 2020 financial year.\n\nTotal assets grew by 11 percent to an unprecedented N8.5 trillion in the year under review, up from N7.7 trillion in 2020, thus marking the first time the Banks assets will cross the N8 trillion mark.\n\nDespite the huge challenging business and slow economic recovery in most of its countries of operations, UBAs Profit Before Tax was impressive with a 20.3 percent growth to N153.1 billion, compared to N127.3 billion at the end of the 2020 financial year; while Profit After Tax rose grew by 8.7 percent to N118.7 billion in 2021, compared to N109.2 billion recorded the previous year.\n\nSimilarly, net loans grew by 7.7 percent to N2.8 trillion, whilst customer deposits rose by 12.2 percent to N6.4 trillion, compared to N5.7 trillion in the corresponding period of 2020, reflecting increased customer confidence, enhanced customer experience, successes from the ongoing business transformation programme and the deepening of its retail banking franchise.\n\nIn the year under consideration, the banks operating income rose by 10% to N443 billion compared to N403 billion in the prior year, whereas operating expenses closed the period at N279 billion.\n\nIn its usual tradition of rewarding shareholders, the Bank proposed a final dividend of 80 kobo for every ordinary share of 50 kobo for the financial year ended December 31, 2021. The final dividend which is subject to the affirmation of the shareholders at its Annual General Meeting will bring the total dividend for the year to N1 as the Bank had paid an interim dividend of 20kobo earlier in the year.\n\nCommenting on the result, the Group Managing Director/CEO, Kennedy Uzoka, said that notwithstanding the tight and challenging operating environment, UBA continues to deliver significant performance:\n\nThe year 2021 can best be described as a year of global recovery; economies around the world began to witness early-stage recoveries, as supply chains recover from the devastating disruptions suffered in 2020.\n\nConsequently, UBA recorded remarkable 7% growth in top line to N660 billion (USD1.56bn), and profit before tax (PBT) of N153.1 billion, up 20.3% from the prior year. Net Loans and advances grew by 7.7% to N2.8 trillion with exposure mostly to resilient economic sectors including oil & gas, agriculture and manufacturing. Deposit from customers grew 12.2%, crossing the N6 trillion mark, to N6.4trillion.\n\nThe GMD also explained that the quality of UBAs portfolio as well as the strength of the banks credit risk management frameworks and policies remain the bedrock of the positive results that the bank has been recording over the years, adding that the current performance highlights UBAs relentless customer focus, and leverage on its key strategic levers \u2014 People, Process and Technology.\n\nLooking forward, I am particularly excited about our ongoing Enterprise Transformation Program which is designed to enhance the banks process agility, service delivery and customer experience. We are also making sizeable investments in cutting-edge technology and cyber security, to keep our innovative digital banking offerings above the curve, as we tool and re-tool our human resources to compete and win in a rapidly changing and evolving landscape. This will ensure the bank continues to achieve respectable top and bottom-line growth through the medium to long term, the GMD stated.\n\nUBAs Group Chief Financial Official, Ugo Nwaghodoh, who corroborated the GMDs comments, said, once again, the bank has shown resilience. It achieved sizeable growth and strengthened its balance sheet despite the slow pace of economic recovery that characterised the year 2021.\n\nThrough active and diligent assets and liabilities management, the bank was able to protect its net interest margin and achieved a downward moderation of Cost of funds (CoF) by 70 basis points to 2.2% from 2.9% in the prior year.\n\nAccording to him, the groups capital adequacy ratio at 24.9% was well above the required regulatory minimum and reflects a strong capacity for business growth. The Groups non-performing loan ratio improved further to 3.6% from 4.7% at the end of 2020. This testifies to the quality of UBAs loan portfolio even as the bank remains relentless in its resolve to drive down the Cost-to-Income ratio, which stood at 63.0% at the end of the year.\n\nNwaghodoh added that the bank achieved further strides in growing its business and gaining market share across its pan-African operations, with the region accounting for 63.2% of the Groups profitability, compared to 55.4% in 2020; Loans and advances as well as Deposit in the region were also up 14.5% and 27.3% respectively from a year earlier.\n\nIn his concluding remarks, the CFO stated We recognise the changing competitive landscape and are proactively positioning to consistently deliver on our strategic objectives and commitment to shareholders.\n\nUnited Bank for Africa Plc is Africas global bank, offering banking services to more than twenty-five million customers, across over 1,000 business offices and customer touch points in 20 African countries. With a presence in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and France and more recently the United Arab Emirates, UBA is connecting people and businesses across Africa through retail; commercial and corporate banking; innovative cross-border payments and remittances; trade finance and ancillary banking services.\n\nGTCO\n\nGTCO has posted gross earnings of N447.810billion in 2021, representing a marginal decline by 1.62% against the N455.229billion posted in year 2020.\n\nAccording to the banks audited results for the year ended December 31, 2021, its income tax expense rose by 27.2% from N36.6bn in 2020 to N46.6bn in 2021, while its profit before tax declined 6.97% from N238.09billion in 2020 to N221.49billion in 2021\n\nWhile the holding company paid a dividend of N3.00 for the year 2021, its earnings per share declined 13.6% from 711 kobo in 2020 to 614k in 2021.\n\nAfter listing at the stock exchange in 1996, it was the first Nigerian financial institution to undertake a US$350million $ Eurobond issue and a US$750million Global Depository Receipts (GDR) offer. The listing of the GDRs on the London Stock Exchange in July 2007 made the bank the first Nigerian Company and African Bank to attain such a landmark achievement.\n\nG T Bank is one of the blue-chip companies on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Many have earned a living by investing in the banks shares. The bank has been generous to its loyal shareholders with impressive dividends payouts.\n\nIt paid 28kobo in 2001; 75kobo in 2002; 95kobo in 2003; 70kobo in 2004; 45kobo in 2005; 70kobo in 2006; 75kobo in 2007; 70kobo in 2008; 100kobo in 2009 and 75kobo in 2010 in addition to a bonus of 1 for 4. The bank also paid 125 kobo in 2011, 155kobo in 2012, 170 kobo in 2013, 175 kobo in 2014, 177 kobo in 2015, 177 kobo in 2016, 205 kobo in 2017, 270 kobo in 2018, 275 kobo in 2019 and 280 kobo in 2020 and 300kobo in 2021.\n\nBut the banks continuous profit decline in the three quarters of 2021and the loss of its leadership position in the price of stock to Zenith bank may be raising some eyebrows. Financial sector watchers appear to be asking questions regarding the development. In fact, after the wonderful performance of the years leading to 2020, GT Bank though still making good profit, is seemingly now on the decline as evidenced in the outcome of its numbers in almost all the quarters of 2021.\n\nAnalysts believe the banks have posted impressive results amid the difficult operating environment which has particularly been affected by negative headwinds like the Covid-19 pandemic and widespread insecurity that posed some form of setback for businesses in the last two years.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "title": "BREAKING: Buhari Sacks Buni As APC Chairman, Appoints Governor Bello As \u2018Sole Administrator\u2019",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has allegedly approved the removal of Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni as Chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the appointment of his Niger State counterpart, Abubakar Sani Bello, in his place, in what appears to be a major step toward containing the crisis plaguing the party\u2019s leadership.\n\nA group of APC governors is said to have complained bitterly to President Buhari that Buni was not inclined to hold the rescheduled convention because no arrangements had been made on the ground.\n\nThe president was claimed to have been enraged by what he was informed and ordered Buni\u2019s removal and replacement right away.\n\nBuni was unable to defend himself because he is currently in Dubai for medical reasons. When they learned of the development, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha; and another top Villa player are said to have intervened on Buni\u2019s behalf, advising the president to exercise caution.\n\nThey allegedly reminded Buhari that only the Party\u2019s NEC could gather and dismiss Buni, and that he must have been given seven days notice of his removal. They argued, however, that anything done outside of the established procedures might be challenged in court, thus delaying the rescheduled March 26 Convention date.\n\nHowever, it was unclear whether the intervention had swayed the President\u2019s decision. However, some insiders who spoke about the situation this morning expressed displeasure that some governors went out of their way to ambush the president just before he left the country without their knowledge, creating a completely false narrative that Buni did not want the convention to take place.\n\n\u201cThey are creating unnecessary crisis in the party, because of their selfish interests. How can they claim there are no preparations to hold the convention, when various convention sub-committees have been announced; the zonal committee is announcing the zoning formula on Monday (today).\n\n\u201cCommittees will be inaugurated in a few days. These people are not sincere. Some governors have been scheming to take over the functions of CECPC to further their own interests.\n\n\u201cThe immediate way out of this is; if Buni voluntarily resigns, which he had two weeks ago threatened to during the APC governors meeting in Abuja,\u201d they claimed.\n\nHowever, a source who confirmed the alleged Buni\u2019s removal said last night that the president did not previously hint at the news when leaving the country because, as a process person, he wanted the decision to be tidied up without causing any more grievances, hence the meeting to be held today at the party\u2019s National Secretariat.\n\nReiterating that Buni had already left and that the decision had already been made, the insider claimed that the relieved caretaker chairman was aware of the situation, which was why he was compelled to leave on medical reasons, and that the party sorely needed to move on.\n\nBello has called a meeting of the Caretaker Committee for today to do this.\n\nHe (Bello) will chair the meeting, which will begin at 10 a.m. at the party\u2019s national secretariat, with members of the caretaker committee expected to attend.\n\nAbubakar Badaru of Jigawa, Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi, Simon Lalong of Plateau, Dr. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, and Bello, all members of the APC, gathered in the Niger governor\u2019s lodge in Asokoro, Abuja, yesterday.\n\nThe meeting was said to be a continuation of the governors\u2019 meeting conducted on Saturday in Abuja.\n\nHowever, it appeared that the committee\u2019s Secretary, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, had learned of the scheme and was already prepared to close the secretariat tomorrow, despite the president\u2019s orders.\n\n\u201cThe resolution is that the members of the CECPC will meet at the party secretariat on Monday by 10a.m. The meeting will be chaired by the Niger State governor, because Buni is out of town. But the secretary is planning to shut down the secretariat tomorrow,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe party source also informed THISDAY that though Bello had called a meeting of Caretaker committee members, he however foresee confusion.\n\n\u201cThere will be confusion tomorrow. They may not have access to the venue of the meeting. They may be locked out, because there is a problem on ground.\n\n\u201cThe Niger governor had called a meeting, but he has also been double crossed, because he won\u2019t have access to the venue of the meeting. So, it is likely that the meeting will not,\u201d he said.\n\nBut a former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Yekini Nabena, has warned Bello to stay away from a venture he clearly lacked the powers to undertake.\n\nNabena insisted that Bello lacked the power to call a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting without the authorisation of the Caretaker Committee Chairman and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nNabena, in a statement last night, said Bello was just an ordinary member of the Caretaker Committee and not the Chairman or Secretary.\n\nHis words: \u201cI am using this medium to call on our leaders across the states to caution Governor Sani Bello of Niger State. The presidency should also call him to order to immediately drop the plan to convey a NEC meeting without the knowledge of Governor Mai Mala Buni and the Secretary of the CECPC.\n\n\u201cThe likes of Governor Bello are the political vultures working against our party and to cause anarchy in the ruling APC,\u201d stressing that the plot by Bello to destabilise the ruling party, has been on for a while because of his vice presidential ambition in 2023, hence his plan to convey a NEC meeting.\n\n\u201cGovernor Sani Bello is neither the Chairman nor Secretary of the National Caretaker Committee. So, where did he get the power to convey such meeting? Governor Bello should not destroy the ruling APC, because of his personal political ambition of becoming Vice President or whatever in 2023,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Some stakeholders have slammed the Federal Government\u2019s claim that it lacks the financial resources to meet the demands of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, or ASUU.\n\nRemember how the Minister of Labour, Chris Ngige, said that the government lacked the financial means to meet some of ASUU\u2019s demands?\n\nOn February 14, ASUU began a one-month warning strike.\n\nThe union stated that the decision was made owing to the Federal Government\u2019s failure to fulfill their agreement, which covers topics such as salary, the university revitalization fund, and the use of the University Transparency Accountability Solution (UTAS) payroll software.\n\nHowever, the minister emphasized that the N1.3 trillion revitalization fund was a commitment given to ASUU by former President Goodluck Jonathan when the country\u2019s finances were stable.\n\nDr. Edor J. Edor, the UNICAL branch\u2019s ASUU chairman, called Ngige\u2019s remark \u201ca lie from the bottom of hell.\u201d\n\nEdor told DAILY POST that the ASUU strike would continue until the government complied with the union\u2019s demands.\n\nAccording to Edor: \u201cThe Federal Government is known for insincerity, unresponsiveness when it comes to the matter of education. It is a categorical falsehood and a lie from the pit of hell for a government official to say in good conscience that the Federal Government had no money to attend to issues that pertain to education as being demanded by our union.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lie and even the government official knows that it\u2019s a lie. Elections are coming up, whatever INEC would demand to conduct such elections, the Federal Government would have the money, and that is because it concerns them, and it\u2019s because that is the medium and platform they would use to go back to their various offices to feast on the resources of this country.\n\n\u201cBut when it comes to education, they begin to dilly-dally, to trump up sentiments and tell Nigerians lies that the Federal Government has no money to attend to the demands of ASUU.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lie from the pit of hell, but we too will wait for them until they have the money to attend to our demands. We will wait until they get the money to revitalize public institutions, improve our salaries, pay our EAA, pay our promotion arrears, implement the EUTA, pay our withheld salaries, then we will go back to the classroom.\n\n\u201cFor as long as they latch unto that falsehood that there is no money, then for so long shall we remain on strike.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a lecturer with UNICAL accused the Federal Government of being pretentious over the issues of ASUU.\n\nThe lecturer, who wished to be anonymous because he has no authority to speak over the issue, said the Federal Government has no value for education.\n\nAccusing the government of ignoring the education sector, the lecturer wondered why those at the helm of the country\u2019s affairs would not borrow money to meet ASUU\u2019s demands.\n\nHe also reiterated that the industrial action embarked upon by the body would continue until their demands were met.\n\nHe told DAILY POST: \u201cWhere there is a will, there is a way, so the Federal Government is living in pretense and does not value education.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, they will borrow or do anything to raise money that they would reloot and share among the cabals.\n\n\u201cBut when it comes to education, especially ASUU, there will be no money; so, in clear terms, the Federal Government is ignoring education.\n\n\u201cThe only option is continued industrial action until everything is sorted out. In fact, the industrial action should be sustained until all the issues raised by ASUU are completely resolved so that strikes will not become recurrent or yearly; it\u2019s all for the country\u2019s good.\n\n\u201cLook at this Russia-Ukraine issue, you will see the kind of weapons they are bringing out, which is a result of research. Now imagine that we are faced with that kind of war, where do we run to? Look at the Boko Haram issue, within the time Americans refused to sell some weapons to us, and after Jonathan, how did we come up with those inventions, is it not from the education sector?\n\n\u201cCareful research and inventions, so we will exercise patience and wait for what the government will do. See what they voted for INEC. Is it the issue of earned academic allowance being mainstreamed? The 2021 tranche was paid in the latter part of last year by the Federal Government, so what stops them from mainstreaming into January salary to be captured in the 2022 budget? \u201d\n\nHowever, when our correspondent reached out to ASUU National President Emmanuel Osodeke, he said ASUU NEC would meet this week to decide on what next.\n\n\u201cThe body will meet to decide the way forward,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Amidst the dark cloud hovering over the national convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), President Muhammadu Buhari has assured that the party would surprise Nigerians at the major event of the party.\n\nThe assurance came as the Kwara state Governor AbduRahman AbdulRazaq-led zoning committee won\u2019t submit its report today (Monday) to the APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) as scheduled.\n\nThe party\u2019s national convention, earlier slated for February 26, 2022 was postponed, with the party announcing March 12 for zonal congresses and March 26 for its national convention.\n\nThe development has generated some confusion as some stakeholders called for further change in date to allow the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led committee conduct the convention that would produce both the National Working Committee(NWC) and the APC presidential flag bearer in the 2023 election.\n\nThis, the proponents of such position argued, followed the delayed presidential assent to the Electoral Bill recently signed into law by the president.\n\nPre-convention activities\n\nAlthough the governors had at a meeting with President Buhari expressed their firm belief in the sanctity of the March 26 date, certain activities that should precede the national convention were yet to be in place.\n\nAt different times, the ruling party postponed its national convention.\n\nThe Buni committee, was upon inauguration June 2020, tasked with the responsibility of organising a national convention December 2020.\n\nFor reasons bordering on specific assignments to be accomplished, the committee sought an extension which was approved by President Buhari.\n\nIt\u2019s on record that the committee was in communication with INEC July 11, 2011, intimating it of its plan have the convention same, but rescheduled it.\n\nAgain, the December 2021 which the party planned to hold the convention could not materialise and a new date\u2013February 26, 2022 was announced, and later the March 26 date recently announced.\n\nThe CCEPC, had while announcing the new date, said it had written INEC of plan to have its zonal congress March 26, 2022.\n\nThe APC further informed the commission that this fresh letter would supersede its earlier communication to INEC wherein it informed the commission that its national convention would hold on February 26.\n\nDated February 21, 2022 and marked APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/22/21, the letter said the party had to hold a zonal congress first in compliance with its constitution.\n\nTitled, \u2018Notice for the Conduct of Zonal Congress,\u2019 the letter read in part: \u201cThis notice supersedes our earlier notice for a national convention referenced APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/22/14. This is predicated on the evaluation of our party constitution.\u201d\n\nBut at the end of a meeting with some select party leaders, the committee secretary, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, told newsmen that the zonal congresses would now hold March 12 followed by the zonal congresses appeal March 14.\n\nThe zonal committees, he said, would be announced February 24, while a meeting of zonal stakeholders holds February 26.\n\nWhile sales of forms for zonal offices commences Monday, February 28 to Thursday, March 3, zonal applicants will be screened March 5, 2022; with the screening appeal holding the next day, while the adoption of the screening report would be done March 8.\n\nThe committee\u2019s scribe also announced the prices of nomination forms, putting that of the zonal chairmanship aspirant at N5 million, while those seeking the secretary, legal adviser, organizing secretary, publicity secretary and youth leader would pay N500, 000 each.\n\nThose eyeing the offices of zonal women leader and persons with disabilities are to pay N250, 000 for the forms.\n\nNational convention\n\nAnd for the national convention, Akpanudoedehe said the pre-convention activities begin March 24 while the convention proper holds March 26.\n\n\u201cAfter deliberation and agreement with the CECPC, we have agreed and approved that the activities of the national convention will commence from March 24 and terminate on March 26.\n\n\u201cThe convention activities commence on February 24, and it will terminate at Eagles Square on March 26. In between the convention, we have agreed to have zonal congresses.\u201d\n\nBy the party\u2019s arrangement, the sale of forms would run from Wednesday March 9, to Friday March 11, even as no aspirant has picked any form as at the time of this report.\n\nThe time table further showed that spirants would be screened from March 15 \u2013 17, while screening appeals hold March 19, 2022, while March 21 was slated for the adoption of the appeal report, just as the accreditation of participants to the Convention holds from March 24 \u2013 25.\n\nAnd finally, three days after the convention, now slated for Saturday, March 26, 2022, there would be a convention appeal March 29, and the appeal report adopted March 30.\n\nThe climax of this is the inauguration of the new team March 31.\n\nZoning report\n\nMeanwhile, the expectations of party members and aspirants for various positions to know which zone gets what may have been dashed as the party won\u2019t be submitting the report as earlier slated.\n\nThe submission of the report would have put to rest the various conflicting zoning arrangements currently in circulation by various groups designed to suit different political interests and groups within the party.\n\nBy the schedule of activities released last week by the CECPC, the 8-man zoning committee constituted by the caretaker committee is expected to submit the report Monday March 7, 2022.\n\nThe committee has Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege as deputy chairman.\n\nOther members of the committee include Prof. Etim Nyong, Dr MB Shehu, former National Vice Chairman (North-East), Comrade Mustapha Salihu, Sen. Teslim Folarin and Alhaji Sadeeq Sule-Iko Sami while the deputy governor of Anambra State, Nkem Okeke serves as Secretary.\n\nA reliable source, however told Blueprint Sunday night that the committee would not submit its report as expected due to various interest and opposition to its decisions on the zoning arrangement.\n\nThe APC chieftain said: \u201cI can tell you that the Zoning Committee has not done its work not to talk of submitting any reports to the CECPC. The issue is currently characterized with confusion and various interests are out to outsmart each other.\u201d\n\n\u2018No plan for zonal convention\u2019\n\nBlueprint also gathered last night that there were no plans on ground regarding the zonal congresses of the ruling party.\n\nHowever, none of these plans have been followed, fuelling speculation that the zonal congresses may not hold.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is plan to hold zonal convention this weekend because all the scheduled preparations toward the exercise have been defaulted. So, tell me how it will hold,\u201d said a top party source.\n\nBuhari assures\n\nBut in the midst of the seeming uncertainties, President Buhari has assured the APC has the capacity to conduct its national convention March 26, saying the party would surprise its critics.",

The annual awards program, taking place in June, will witness new judges, reviewing nominations from 24 categories.\n\nThis year\u2019s GAGE Awards, which has the theme \u201cCo-Create 2022\u201d, will have a 2-day Tech Exhibition slated to take place at the Landmark Event Centre in Victoria Island, Lagos on the 9th and 10th of June and on the 3rd day, the event will celebrate innovations with the 3rd edition of the annual GAGE Awards, schedule for the 11th of June, 2022.\n\nOn the 27th of February 2022, The GAGE Awards Nigeria officially drew a curtain on public nominations of candidates to be considered for the prestigious honor of joining the ranks of past winners, including the likes of Paystack, Multichoice Nigeria, RedTV, GTBank etc. This was immediately followed by the unveiling of the panel of judges who will officially make up the academy responsible for selecting the most innovative tech brands in Nigeria in the past one year.\n\nNominations for the 2022 Gage awards had been open since the 24th of January, and were slated to end on the 20th of February. However, due to the volume of requests and the competitive nature of the process, the window was extended by an extra week which ended on the 27th of February.\n\nAccording to the organisers, the highly eminent roster of the Panel of Judges comprises the following personalities:\n\nChizor Malize : Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer \u2013 Financial Institutions Training Centre (FITC)\n\nColette Otusheso: Head, Access Bank AccelerateTV, Dr. Adebola Akindele: Group Managing Director, Courteville Business Solutions plc\n\nJason Cumming: Director of Africa, M&C Saatchi Worldwide\n\nUzoma Dozie: CEO/ Founder Sparkle\n\nRolake Rosiji: CEO Jobberman\n\nPat Utomi: Founder/ CEO at Centre for Values in Leadership (CVL)\n\nSteve Omojafor: Former Chairman of Zenith Bank and STB-Mcann\n\nFiona Weeks: MD of PulseNG\n\nRichard Johnson: MD of FMCG\n\nAdenike Adebola.

You know the exciting innovations and global interest we are currently experiencing in the Nigerian tech space is a testament of the youthful vibrancy and ingenuity of Nigerians. And with an exciting group like this overseeing and helping us to select the best of the best, then you are sure Nigeria won\u2019t be disconnected from the future of innovations.\u201d\n\nIt would be recalled that the GAGE Awards has been a resounding success, the last edition was almost entirely virtual due to health concerns occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic that characterized the years 2020/ 2021. From execution to impact, the initiative is designed to recognize, extol and reward strides within the digital ecosystem in Nigeria and ultimately, in Africa.\n\nThe GAGE Awards is a comprehensive celebration of founders, ideas, products, and more. It will be held at Eko Hotels on the 11th of June 2022. With a focus on Nigerian and African inclusion, these awards will cut across several facets of social and economic interactivity with tech through 24 distinct and relevant categories.",

Corridors from Mariupol and Sumy will lead both to other Ukrainian cities and to Russia.\n\nThose who want to leave Kyiv will also be able to be airlifted to Russia, the ministry said, adding it would use drones to monitor the evacuation.\n\n\u201cAttempts by the Ukrainian side to deceive Russia and the whole civilised world \u2026 are useless this time,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion has been condemned around the world, sent more than 1.5 million Ukrainians fleeing abroad, and triggered sweeping Western-led sanctions aimed at crippling the Russian economy.\n\nRussia calls the campaign it launched on Feb. 24 a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d. It has repeatedly denied attacking civilian areas and says it has no plans to occupy Ukraine.\n\nOil prices soared to their highest levels since 2008 in Asian trade after the Biden administration said it was exploring banning imports of Russian oil. Russia provides 7% of global supply.\n\nJapan, which counts Russia as its fifth-biggest supplier of crude oil, is also in discussion with the United States and European countries about possibly banning Russian oil imports, Kyodo News reported on Monday.\n\nEurope relies on Russia for crude oil and natural gas but has become more open to the idea of banning Russian products, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters.\n\nThe general staff of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces said Russian forces were \u201cbeginning to accumulate resources for the storming of Kyiv\u201d, a city of 3 million, after days of slow progress in their main advance south from Belarus.\n\nAbout 200,000 people remained trapped in the besieged Black Sea port of Mariupol, most sleeping underground to escape more than six days of shelling by Russian forces that has cut off food, water, power and heating, according to the Ukrainian authorities.\n\nAbout half of the 400,000 people in the city were due to be evacuated on Sunday but that effort was aborted for a second day when a ceasefire plan collapsed as the sides accused each other of failing to stop shooting and shelling.\n\nUkrainian authorities said on Monday the southern city of Mykolayiv was being shelled.\n\n\u2018ARC OF AUTOCRACY\u2019\n\nThe civilian death toll from hostilities across Ukraine since Russia launched the invasion was 364, including more than 20 children, the United Nations said on Sunday, adding that hundreds were wounded\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States had seen credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians and it was documenting them to support a potential war crimes investigation.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned Russians who committed atrocities against civilians they would face punishment.\n\n\u201cFor you there will be no peaceful place on this earth, except for the grave,\u201d he said in a televised evening address.\n\nAs anti-war protests took place around the world, Ukraine renewed its appeal to the West to toughen sanctions and also requested more weapons, including Russian-made planes.\n\nBlinken said the United States was considering how it could backfill aircraft for Poland if it decided to supply its warplanes to Ukraine.\n\nPutin says he wants a \u201cdemilitarised\u201d, \u201cdenazified\u201d and neutral Ukraine, and on Saturday likened Western sanctions \u201cto a declaration of war\u201d.\n\nNew Zealand became the latest country on Monday to announce it will impose sanctions on Russia, including a plan to stop super yachts, ships and aircraft from entering its waters or airspace.\n\nSouth Korea toughened its financial sanctions against Russia by banning transactions with Russia\u2019s central bank.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison urged China to act on its declarations of promoting world peace and join the effort to stop Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, warning that the world was in danger of being reshaped by an \u201carc of autocracy\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo country will have a bigger impact on concluding this terrible war in Ukraine than China,\u201d Morrison said in response to a question after a speech at the Lowy Institute think tank.\n\nWestern sanctions have pushed many companies to exit investments in Russia, while some Russian banks have been shut out of a global financial payment systems, driving down the rouble and forcing Moscow to jack up interest rates.\n\nOn Sunday, more companies cut ties with Russia: American Express Co (AXP.N), Netflix Inc. , accounting giants KPMG and PwC, and video sharing app TikTok.\n\nBut Chinese firms are staying put.",
