          "title": "Twitter ban: Ozekhome asks JUSUN to call off strike",
          "text": "Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mike Ozekhome, on Sunday called on members of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria to call off their ongoing strike over what he described as a conspiracy by the Nigerian elite working in collaboration with the unsuspecting leadership of the union.\n\nOzekhome made this call in a press statement titled \u2018The Twitter ban, prosecution, more prisons and the link with the JUSUN strike.\u2019\n\nHe said although he had supported the strike action by JUSUN from the beginning, the unyielding stance of the government seems to be encouraging the strike.\n\nHe said, \u201cFrom day one, I had whole-heartedly supported the JUSUN strike by Judicial workers. I had believed (and still believe) that Judicial autonomy must never be compromised.\n\n\u201cThen Twitter suspended Buhari\u2019s account and pulled down his offensive threats against his own electors and citizens he governs. Then, Lai Mohammed reacted by saying the FG has banned Twitter operations in Nigeria. And, now, Malami has directed the Department of Public Prosecution to prosecute any Nigerian who flaunts this ban by using Virtual Private Network to bypass it.\n\n\u201cIn all these, the agitated citizens are eager to go to court (section 6 of the Constitution), to challenge these outrageous infractions of their rights. Then, they suddenly realise that the doors to the courts are firmly shut, and put under lock and key by JUSUN workers. So, they lick their oozing wounds.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the same courts being protected, are busy every day, delivering judgments (physical and virtual), on matters already pending before the JUSUN strike commenced.\n\n\u201cSo, who are these workers that prepare the files, take them to Judges and create the enabling environment for such sittings, including fixing the zoom meetings? How and where do they gain access to the courts\u2019 strong rooms, filing cabinets and court processes, to aid the Judges? Just how? I cannot understand. Or, can you?\u201d\n\nThe lawyer said the Presidency and state governors appeared not only comfortable with the existing impasse, which has literally suspended the third arm of Government, as during vile military juntas, but are also happy with it.\n\n\u201cTheir unyielding stance is encouraging the strike. These got me thinking. I, therefore, decided to give a second look at the unfolding scenario. It points to one fact: Nigeria appears to have been scammed by some smart elite alecs, working in collaboration and tandem with probably the unsuspecting JUSUN leadership.\n\n\u201cMy response to this new development? JUSUN, call off the ongoing strike immediately,\u201d he said.\n\nOzekhome explained that his new position on the JUSUN strike was due to the events that have unfolded in the last two weeks.\n\nHe said, \u201cI have now changed my views and stance. My new stance is now occasioned by the frequency of series of curious events (some quite frightening), emanating from the government and its operatives in the last two weeks.\n\n\u201cFirst, the Attorney-General, Malami, condemned Southern Governors\u2019 ban on open grazing by cattle. He curiously likened the murderous acts of non-taxpaying nomadic cattle rearers to innocent shop-owning, spare-parts-selling Igbos who carry out their businesses legitimately and peacefully in their rented premises, paying their tax, tenement rate, water and wastage disposal bills. Freedom of movement by human beings in section 41 of the Constitution was now being mistaken for freedom of movement for cows, sheep and goats. The life of a cow was being elevated, valued and priced beyond that of slaughtered and raped human beings.\n\n\u201cSecond, there sprang out an alleged secret memo attributed to the Attorney-General (but which he has firmly denied and denounced), in which he purportedly advised President Buhari to declare a state of emergency and suspend provisions of the 1999 Constitution that deal with the people\u2019s fundamental rights. I believed his denial because that would have been unthinkable, having regard to his sacred position and duties as espoused in sections 150 and 174 of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cLet us not continue to be used by fifth columnists as pawns in a game of musical chairs. This government will very shortly likely crack down on the opposition, rights activists, dissenters, plural voices and perceived enemies. There will be no courts to run to with a view to obtaining any remedy.\u201d",

It is always heart-breaking. Grief can wreak havoc on our overall well-being. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to stay rooted to the Almighty. Only He can lessen our heartache and comfort us in these times. Seek refuge in him.\u201d\n\nFollowers and lovers of the late preacher flooded her comment section to sympathise with her.\n\nA Twitter user, @Edsonphiri35, said, \u201cMy deepest condolences, mama. May you find solace in our lord and saviour Jesus Christ. The passing on of this gallant man of God came as a surprise to us, but we find comfort knowing that he has found eternal rest in Yahweh. We are with you in spirit mama as we mourn with you.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, @NNonvo, said, \u201cMa\u2019am, condolences to you and your family. You supported the man of God, your husband, all your life. Wherever he went, you went and gave love and hope to the downtrodden of this world. May God give you strength and comfort in these trying times.\u201d\n\nAbout a week ago, Evelyn had taken to her Twitter page to write, \u201cFaith is trusting and believing that the Almighty has your back no matter what you\u2019re going through. Even when you can\u2019t comprehend what\u2019s going on, you trust Him. You know He will get you out of unfavourable situations. Best motto to live by; do your best, leave the rest to Him!\u201d\n\nMany have described Evelyn as \u201cthe pillar\u201d of the late preacher\u2019s life and ministry and said it would be a serious hit on the family.",

          "text": "The Niger State government has directed mosques and churches to conduct special prayers for God\u2019s Devine intervention in the fight against insecurity in the state.\n\nThe state in recent times has grappled with the rising cases of banditry, kidnapping, other forms of crimes and criminal elements.\n\nGovernor Sani Bello, represented by his Deputy, Ahmed Mohammed Ketso at the Muslim special prayers at the Minna Central Mosque enjoined the people to return to God for the carnage will come to an end,\n\n\u201cThe state government is collaborating with the security agencies, working round the clock to ensure that they protect lives and property even as the security challenges are surmountable.\u201d\n\nPrayers will help end banditry \u2013 RCCG\u2019s Pastor Adeboye\n\nThe Chief Imam of Minna Central Mosque, Ibrahim Isah Fari led a group of Ulamas in the Muslim prayer.\n\nAlso, Chairman, Christian Association of Nigerian (CAN), Rev. Mathias Echioda, Senior Pastor of Occupy Ministries in a special Christian prayer held at Micheal\u2019s Catholic cathedral, Minna prayed for peace in the state and the country, while commending the government for believing that God can salvage the country from its present predicament.\n\n\u201cThe admission of government to say that our salvation, our deliverance, our help comes from God to me means so much, it means that God has a heart towards God and therefore a heart towards the people.\u201d\n\nThe state CAN chairman appreciated the courage of the government to call for the prayers, saying they have always been praying for an end to banditry.\n\n\u201cThe security forces are doing a great job which only God can reward them, and we are urging those saddled with the responsibility of taking care of them to give them their dues. They deserve prayers and support of all.\u201d\n\nRev. Echioda also appealed to the bandits to have a second thought, lay down their arms and dialogue with the government to make their grievances known and discuss so that they are integrated into the society.\n\nThe special prayer is expected to be replicated in all the eight Emirates of the state.",

Their sense of judgment and equity is distorted and to them, an Igbo life does not matter\u201d.\n\nThe Assembly warned the army to end its siege in the southeast, saying the area was the most peaceful in the country before the military started killing and radicalizing IPOB and pro-Biafran agitators.\n\nIt, however, called on ndigbo all over the country to protect themselves since the Nigerian state has allegedly marked them for destruction.",

          "text": "By Christy Anyawu\n\nMaryanne Ahneeka Iwuchukwu is a lady of many parts. She\u2019s a model, engineer, television presenter and entrepreneur.\n\nThree years ago, Ahneeka came to limelight when she took part in the Big Brother Naija reality show. In this chat, she talked about her growing up, love life and new TV programme, Jollof Show. Enjoy it.\n\nTell us briefly about yourself?\n\nI am Maryanne Ahneeka Iwuchukwu. I hail from Oraifite, Anambra State. I am a Chemical Engineer and also an entrepreneur. I am pursuing a degree in Education at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka. Three yeas ago, I was on the Big Brother Naija reality show, the Double Wahala edition. Now, I have moved on from there to TV presenting.\n\nTell us about your growing up?\n\nMy mum is an academic, an educator. It\u2019s from her I got my flair for education. My dad is an entrepreneur, but he is retired now. They are very instrumental in terms of discipline and values I portray as a lady. I\u2019m very proud of my discipline, I mean in terms of values, they were very keen in support of me. This venture of going into Big Brother after graduation as an engineer was very offline. They didn\u2019t understand it, but they understood the daughter they raised, they trusted their handwork. I made the point not to disappoint them and I\u2019m working so hard to let them know I\u2019m not practicing as an engineer, but I\u2019m making as much in bank as engineers will.\n\nWhat\u2019s your new TV programme all about?\n\nI am the host of Jollof TV show produced by Zikel Cosmetics. Zikel birthed the idea and they approached me to be a part of it. The show has started airing on WAPTV, DSTV, GOTV, StarTimes and some terrestrial stations from the first Friday in May. Basically, Jollof Show is about having interactions with your favourite celebrities. The show is not just about coming to have fun; we also get to learn a few things about lifestyle, fitness, grooming, working-out, and use of slimming teas. So, it\u2019s just about coming together and having a beautiful blend of spices like we have in jollof rice. The show has something for everyone. The context of what jollof means is what we are applying on the show.\n\nWhen you are not hosting a show, what else do you do?\n\nI\u2019m a spice of everything, just like jollof rice. I\u2019m a chemical engineer, an entrepreneur; I try my hands on different business ventures. You will be hearing new things about me soon.\n\nHow do you take time off to relax?\n\nThere\u2019s no relaxation on empty bank account. I believe now is the time to work. I am young, I am still energetic and I have this opportunity now, so why don\u2019t I work? Relaxation will come when I\u2019m sitting on my billion.\n\nHow did you cope with the lockdown?\n\nI was praying for Nigeria. I was praying not to catch Coronavirus. The world was standing still and I was part of the world standing still. I was learning new things online, taking few courses, and getting my post-graduate online.\n\nTell us about your romantic side, do you have any man in your life yet?\n\nI\u2019m not in a rush. Whoever comes I will just go with the flow. No pressure right now, if he comes, he comes; if he doesn\u2019t come, he doesn\u2019t come, bye! As much as everyone is telling me how old I am (for marriage), my thought is telling me how broke I am. No pressure to do anything.\n\nWhat is your kind of man?\n\nHe must have two legs; have two hands, but must have sense. That is the most important part I can\u2019t compromise. He can have one leg, but must have sense. That is very key to me. I\u2019m not looking for anything in particular; I will just know if my spirit can go with this person. I don\u2019t have a checklist.\n\nWhat advice do you have for young people?\n\nDo not wait on anything to be handed to you. As much as the government and other people owe you things, don\u2019t bank on that. The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, so go there and take it by force. Be ready to face disappointments. Don\u2019t get away by the things on social media. As a young person, half of what you see on social media is fake. So, do not compare your chapter one to another person\u2019s chapter 16. Nobody posts his or her failures on Instagram. Be patient with yourself, work as hard as you can. If you are a person of faith, don\u2019t forget that and when you get there, don\u2019t forget that faith too. Just be a good human being.",

          "text": "\u2022US, UK, EU, Canada, Ireland, Norway condemn ban\n\n\u2022FG: Microblogging site is synonymous with fake news, misinformation\n\n\u2022Telcos deactivate access to twitter handles in Nigeria\n\n\u2022AGF threatens to prosecute offenders\n\n\u2022Twitter promises Nigerians access to new platform, belatedly deletes Kanu\u2019s vile tweets\n\nTobi Soniyi, Deji Elumoye, Emma Okonji in Lagos, Chuks Okocha, Olawale Ajimotokan, Alex Enumah, Michael Olugbode and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nOutraged by Nigeria\u2019s suspension of the microblogging and social media giant, Twitter, for deleting a recent tweet found offensive posted by President Muhammadu Buhari, the world yesterday condemned the decision by the federal government and concluded it was a violation of the rights and freedom of the Nigerian people to communication.\n\nSome of the diplomatic missions that expressed their displeasure against the Twitter ban included Canada, the European Union (Delegation to Nigeria), the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom,the United States of America and Norway.\n\nBut the federal government, yesterday, justified Twitter\u2019s suspension, saying the outfit had become synonymous with the spread of fake news and misinformation in the country.\n\nThis is as the Telecoms Operators (Telcos) have carried out the instruction of the industry regulator, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to suspend access to all Twitter handles in Nigeria, saying they acted in line with the instruction given to them, in the best interest and integrity of the country.\n\nTo that extent, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) has said the federal government would prosecute anyone, who violates the administrative ban on the use of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nCondemning the federal government\u2019s decision, the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has declared as unconstitutional, illegal, null and completely of no moment a recent directive by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration to arrest and prosecute any Nigerian using Twitter.\n\nSimilarly, the Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN), in its reaction, condemned the suspension of Twitter in the country by the federal government and described it as \u201cwrong and an overreaction\u201d.\n\nAlso, the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), on its part, urged the federal government to tread with caution and immediately reconsider the suspension of the operation of Twitter in Nigeria and instead, seek other legitimate means of resolving its dispute with the company.\n\nSharing this view, the International Press Institute (IPI), while expressing concern over the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria, described the action as detrimental to the free press in Nigeria,which it said uses twitter as a major platform.\n\nIn the same breath, the Oyo State Governor, \u2018Seyi Makinde, has counseled the federal government of Nigeria not to hamper the operations of thousands of businesses and services with its recent suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria.\n\nOn the contrary, the All Progressives Congress (APC) has called on Nigerians to defend the country\u2019s sovereignty by supporting the federal government\u2019s Twitter suspension, saying it was in national interest.\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter, yesterday promised to restore access on its new platform to all Nigerians as parts of the choices open to it in the current circumstances, even as it belatedly deleted some bile tweets by Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nResponding to the backlash from the move against Twitter, the presidency though described Twitter\u2019s removal of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweets as disappointing, it however, said the social media outfit\u2019s suspension has nothing to do with the removal of the President\u2019s tweet.\n\nPresidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, in a release, attributed the suspension of Twitter to a lot of problems associated with the media platform including misinformation and fake news, which have had telling effect on Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe temporary suspension of Twitter is not just a response to the removal of the President\u2019s post. There has been a litany of problems with the social media platform in Nigeria, where misinformation and fake news spread through it have had real world violent consequences. All the while, the company has escaped accountability.\n\nNevertheless, the removal of President Buhari\u2019s tweet was disappointing. The censoring seemed based on a misunderstanding of the challenges Nigeria faces today.\n\nHe quoted the President as saying in his address at the United Nations General Assembly, UNGA in 2019 that, \u201cThe world was shocked and startled by the massacre in New Zealand by a lone gunman taking the lives of 50 worshippers.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, this and similar crimes, which have been fueled by social media networks risk seeping into the fabric of an emerging digital culture.\n\nHe emphasised that major tech companies must be alive to their responsibilities and that \u201cthey cannot be allowed to continue to facilitate the spread of religious, racist, xenophobic and false messages capable of inciting whole communities against each other, leading to loss of many lives\u201d.\n\nThis, according to him, could tear some countries apart.\n\nHe stressed that President Buhari has therefore been warning against social media\u2019s disruptive and divisive influences and the government\u2019s action is not a knee-jerk reaction to Twitter\u2019s preposterous deletion of his tweets, which should have been read in full.\n\nThe release stated: \u201cThe tweet was not a threat, but a statement of fact. A terrorist organisation (IPOB) poses a significant threat to the safety and security of Nigerian citizens. When the President said that they will be treated \u2018in a language they understand\u2019, he merely reiterated that their force shall be met with force. It is a basic principle of security services response world over.\n\n\u201cThis is not promotion of hate, but a pledge to uphold citizens\u2019 right to freedom from harm. The government cannot be expected to capitulate to terrorists. IPOB is proscribed under Nigerian law. Its members murder innocent Nigerians. They kill policemen and set government property on fire.\n\n\u201cNow, they have amassed a substantial stockpile of weapons and bombs across the country. Twitter does not seem to appreciate the national trauma of our country\u2019s civil war. This government shall not allow a recurrence of that tragedy.\u201d\n\nBut some diplomatic missions in the country have condemned the ban of twitter, insisting that free expression and access to information were the pillars of democracy.\n\nA statement jointly issued yesterday by the the diplomatic missions of Canada, the European Union (Delegation to Nigeria), the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Norway, conveyed their disappointment over Nigeria\u2019s announcement, suspending #Twitter and proposing registration requirements for other social media.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cWe strongly support the fundamental human right of free expression and access to information as a pillar of democracy in Nigeria as around the world and these rights apply online as well as offline.\n\n\u201cBanning systems of expression is not the answer. These measures inhibit access to information and commerce at precisely the moment, when Nigeria needs to foster inclusive dialogue and expression of opinions, as well as share vital information in this time of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe diplomatic missions, however, added that, \u201cThe path to a more secure Nigeria lies in more, not less, communication to accompany the concerted efforts of Nigeria\u2019s citizens in fulsome dialogue toward unity, peace and prosperity. As Nigeria\u2019s partners, we stand ready to assist in achieving these goals.\u201d\n\nIn yet a separate reaction, the United States, in a statement by its Embassy in Nigeria said: \u201cNigeria\u2019s constitution provides for freedom of expression. The Government\u2019s recent #Twitterban undermines Nigerians\u2019 ability to exercise this fundamental freedom and sends a poor message to its citizens, investors and businesses.\u201d\n\nThe statement added: \u201cBanning social media and curbing every citizen\u2019s ability to seek, receive, and impart information undermines fundamental freedoms. As President Biden has stated, our need for individual expression, open public conversation, and accountability has never been greater.\n\n\u201cThe path to a more secure Nigeria lies in more, not less communication, alongside concerted efforts toward unity, peace, and prosperity. #KeepitOn\u201d\n\nHowever, on the deactivation of access, the Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), the umbrella body of all licensed telecoms operators in Nigeria, in a statement jointly signed by its chairman, Mr. Gbenga Adebayo and its Executive Secretary, Mr. Gbolahan Awonuga, yesterday, confirmed that NCC directed them to suspend access to Twitter.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cWe, the Association of Licensed Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) wish to confirm that our members have received formal instructions from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the industry regulator to suspend access to Twitter. ALTON has conducted a robust assessment of the request in accordance with internationally accepted principles.\n\n\u201cBased on national interest provisions in the Nigerian Communications \u2018Act 2003\u2019, and within the licence terms under which the industry operates; our members have acted in compliance with the directives of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) the industry regulator. We will continue to engage all the relevant authorities and stakeholders and will act as may be further directed by the NCC. We remain committed to supporting the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and upholding the rights of citizens.\n\n\u201cAs an industry, we endorse the position of the United Nations that the rights held by people offline must also be protected online. This includes respecting and protecting the rights of all people to communicate, to share information freely and responsibly, and to enjoy privacy and security regarding their data and their use of digital communications.\u201d\n\nGiving the implications of the action of the federal government on Twitter, the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), in a statement released yesterday, said ATCON was working closely with relevant stakeholders to ensure there is a speedy resolution of the current suspension of Twitter activities in Nigeria.\n\nIn its official statement on the development, which has seen the telecoms regulator issue a directive to the service providers to deny access to the services of Twitter in Nigeria, the President of ATCON, Mr. Ikechukwu Nnamani stated that while the Association and its member companies understand the position of the federal government, the reasons for the directive, and have complied with the directive, it is pertinent that the issue is resolved soon in the interest of all.\n\nNnamani emphasised that the Over The Top (OTT) platforms of which Twitter is one, is an integral part of the digital economy that the federal government is promoting, adding, so when an unfortunate disagreement arises with respect to the user policies, it is good it is resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOther industry stakeholders, who frowned at the action of the federal government, warned against the implications, which they said may affect Nigeria most negatively.\n\nIndustry sources, however, said government seemed not to be concerned about the revenue and job losses that would come with the suspension order.\n\nAlthough they projected huge revenue losses to government and the telecoms operators in terms of revenue generation and payment of taxes, they however said revenue generation appeared not to be more important to government than protecting its authority.\n\nAGF Threatens to Prosecute Offenders\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation and Minister for Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), yesterday,said the federal government would prosecute anyone that violates the administrative ban on the use of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nConsequently, Malami, in a statement issued by his Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, Dr. Umar Jibrilu Gwandu, said he had directed the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation to begin immediate prosecution of those, who violate the federal government order suspending Twitter operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cAttorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, has directed the immediate prosecution of offenders of the federal government ban on Twitter operations in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMalami directed the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation at the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, to swing into action and commence in earnest the process of prosecution of violators of the Federal Government De-activation of operations of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMalami directed the DPPF to liaise with the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy, National Communication Commission, NCC and other relevant government agencies to ensure the speedy prosecution of offenders without any further delay.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the ban, a former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, a former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, Senator Shehu Sani and others have continued to tweet.\n\n\u201cThis won\u2019t be my last tweet\u201d, Atiku said while criticising the ban.\n\nFormer Senator Sani while mocking the ban said: \u201cI\u2019m sure Baba will be asking about the \u2018meaning\u2019 of that VPN. Those of you from the North, if you want to tweet, take a train to Maradi in Niger Republic, tweet and return home. If you live in Lagos and want to tweet, just go to Cotonou, tweet and come back. Those of you from the South-south, who want to tweet, take a boat through your Creeks to Cameroun, tweet and come back.\u201d\n\nFani-Kayode, in a tweet on Saturday morning stated thus: \u201cThe suspension of Twitter by the FG has proved to the civilised world that they are weak, unstable, paranoid, insensitive, vindictive & delusional. It is a grave abuse of power & a perfidious, insidious & brazen attempt to deny the Nigerian people of their right to free speech.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction to the threat to prosecute offenders, a former Chairman of the Governing Council of the National Human Rights Commission, Prof. Chidi Odinkalu, wondered how the government would prosecute citizens for violating an administrative ban.\n\nHe asked: \u201cUnder what law please? The ban is an administrative directive. Lai Mohammed is not a legislature and cannot create a crime.\u201d\n\nMalami\u2019s Prosecution Order Is Illegal, Null and Void, Says PDP\n\nThe leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has declared as unconstitutional, illegal, null and completely of no moment a recent directive by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration to arrest and prosecute any Nigerian using Twitter.\n\nThe PDP asserted that the directive by the APC through the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, was not only downright ludicrous, but showed the frenzied desperation by the Buhari Presidency to muzzle, victimize, clamp down on innocent Nigerians and foist a totalitarian system on our country.\n\nThe PDP stated, in statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, stated that nothing in the extant laws, not even the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, constitutionally criminalised the use of Twitter by Nigerians or empowers the federal governments to arrest and prosecute any Nigerians for using Twitter.\n\nAccording to the PDP, \u201cFor Malami\u2019s information, section 36 (12) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) provides that, \u2018a person shall not be convicted of a criminal offence unless that offence is defined and the penalty therefore is prescribed in a written law, and in this subsection, a written law refers to an Act of the National Assembly or a law of a state, any subsidiary legislation or instrument under the provisions of the law.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari and his APC are informed that there is no extant law that defined the use of Twitter as a criminal offence and there is no penalty prescribed in a written law for the use of Twitter by any Nigerians,\u201d the PDP explained.\n\nThe opposition stated that the APC-led federal government should also realise that the suspension of Twitter, in addition to its unconstitutionality, only suspended Twitter operations and not the use of Twitter by Nigerians.\n\nThe PDP, therefore, contended that the directive by the Attorney General to arrest and prosecute any Nigerians found using Twitter, does not have the backing of any law enacted by the National Assembly or any state legislative house, describing Malami\u2019s declaration as completely of no legal consequence.\n\n\u201cMalami\u2019s directive to arrest and prosecute Nigerians using Twitter is therefore an attempt to suspend the 1999 Constitution (as amended), a development which bears the imprints of the leaked memo in which Mr. President was reportedly advised to suspend the constitution and strip Nigerians of their rights and freedom\u201d, the main opposition party said.\n\nTwitter Suspension Is an Overreaction, Says NPAN\n\nThe Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN) has condemned the suspension of the operation of microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in the country, describing it as \u201cwrong and an overreaction\u201d.\n\nNPAN, which took the position on Saturday in a statement by its President, Kabiru A. Yusuf, warned that the action by the federal government after Twitter deleted the tweets by President Muhammadu Buhari to the South-east insurrectionists, who have been vandalizing the symbols of state authority would not win Nigeria friends.\n\nIt, however, noted that the closure of public space would constitute a limit to public discourse and democratic advancement, further describing the ban as a futile exercise, because other platforms were more likely to suspect Nigeria\u2019s intentions towards democratic tenets and act adversarially towards the country.\n\n\u201cTwitter is a global platform for public communication that has expanded the frontiers of Free Speech and Press Freedom. It is a platform for business that has brought relief to Nigeria\u2019s youthful population, who have prospered by its operation. The NPAN believes Twitter as a business is not infallible and can be influenced through high level engagement, to be a more responsive, liberal platform of public good and not a cynical champion of suspicious causes.\n\n\u201cThere should be a compromise: Nigeria needs friends and not enemies at this critical juncture of her existence. She should not play into the hands of the enemies, who are relentless in seeking to destroy and ostracise her. Banning Twitter is regressive and should be rescinded in favour of dialogue.\u201d NPAN warned.\n\nThe newspaper proprietors also noted that it was the threat of maximum state reprisal by President Buhari that Twitter found objectionable, in line with its corporate policy, leading to sanction on the President through deletion of his tweets.\n\nIt noted that it was not the first time Twitter would sanction world leaders for infractions against its stated policy as it did so to former US President Donald Trump, to global acclaim, when the latter used the social media to spread hate and instigate insurrection by a mob, which stormed the Capitol.\n\nAlthough it faulted the federal government, the association also challenged Twitter to correct itself as its sincerity is questionable to the extent that it may have been hasty in sanctioning President Buhari while showing an uneven application of its rules against the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) separatist leader, Nnamdi Kanu..\n\nAccording to NPAN, while Nigeria has retaliated with the cudgel against Twitter for alleged double standard in a hasty sanctioning of the President, the micro bloggers appeared to be pampering an unrestrained Kanu for using the same Twitter platform not just for serial hate speeches but for actually provoking and justifying violence in his separatist agitations.\n\nEditors Urge FG to Seek Legitimate Means\n\nThe Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) has urged the federal government to tread with caution and immediately reconsider the suspension of the operation of Twitter in Nigeria by seeking other legitimate means of resolving its dispute with the company.\n\nIn a statement by Mustapha Isah (President) and Iyobosa Uwugiaren (General Secretary) respectively, the NGE said the federal government\u2019s action has the unintended consequence of jeopardising the economic interests of many Nigerians, who rely on the social media platform for vital information to make informed business decisions daily.\n\nAdvising the federal government to desist from any action that would project the Nigerian government as a dictatorship, the Nigerian editors said the action was an infringement on Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution and violated the right of Nigerians to interact freely on this platform.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the suspension is a grave breach of Nigeria\u2019s international obligations under article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, and article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n\u201cThe Guild sees the federal government\u2019s action as an overreaction to Twitter\u2019s decision to delete President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet early this week. If the federal government finds Twitter\u2019s action against the President objectionable, Nigerians should not be made to suffer the collateral damage of denying them their right to freely discourse on Twitter\u201d, the Guild added.\n\nThe Guild noted that the federal government had in an initial reaction by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, condemned the deletion of President Buhari\u2019s view as an unacceptable tab on the president\u2019s right, saying that ought to have been a sufficient response.\n\n\u201cHowever, the ban at the weekend, of Twitter\u2019s operation in Nigeria, is an overkill that gives wind to the sail of critics, who daily accuse the Buhari administration of intolerance of opposing views.\n\n\u201cCertainly, the federal government has the responsibility to safeguard the unity, peace and stability of Nigeria and any person or group that threatens this must draw its ire. In expressing its anger, the federal government, however, ought to exercise restraints to avoid giving the impression that it is intolerant of opposing views and expression of opinion by individual and corporate citizens,\u201d the Guild stated.\n\nStressing its concern over the growing insecurity in the country, the Guild advised social media leaders, which provide micro-messaging services, to also beam their searchlight on the activities of those, who want to use their platforms to cause divisions and spread hatred in the country and the global community as well.\n\nNoting the socio-political and economic benefits of the social media platforms, the NGE explained that strong democracies rely on both civic and political participation by citizens, saying, Twitter, has over the years, aided citizens\u2019 participation in the nation\u2019s democratic process.\n\n\u201cThe Guild is aware of the democratising influence of social media platforms, including Twitter, in helping to check dictatorship and promote democracy worldwide.\n\n\u201cTwitter also builds a market research prospect for businesses to see what customers are chit-chatting about, their feeling and what is important to them about products and services\u201d, the Guild said, calling on the federal government to immediately rescind its decision in order not to deny millions of Nigerians, who rely on Twitter to provide services and earn a living.\n\nThe International Press Institute (IPI), while expressing concern over the suspension of Twitter\u2019soperations in Nigeria, described the action as detrimental to the free press in Nigeria, which it said uses twitter as a major platform.\n\nIPI, in a statement by its President and Secretary, Kabir Yusuf and Raheem Adedoyin, however, notedthe concern of the government on the use of twitter and other social media platforms to promote hate speech and disinformation.\n\n\u201cWe urge twitter and other social media outfits to pay greater attention to the content they promote on their platforms, which violate their own rules. IPI implores the government to reverse the suspension of twitter operations in Nigeria and engage in meanigful dialogue with the social media outfit on issues of concern to the government,\u201d it stated.\n\nDon\u2019t Hamper Businesses and Services, Makinde Counsels FG\n\nOyo State Governor, \u2018Seyi Makinde, has counseled the federal government against hampering the operations of thousands of businesses and services with its recent suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria.\n\nHe contended that the action by the Buhari administration was capable of affecting investors\u2019 confidence in the country.\n\nIn a statement he personally signed, Makinde called for due consideration from the government on the implications of its action, saying, \u201cTwitter has become the platform for young people and indeed all Nigerians to exercise their fundamental right to express and publish an opinion.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who has a strong presence on Twitter, said, it became imperative for him to make the statement as the country debated the ban.\n\nHe, however, warned that the decision, apart from having grave implications for the image of the country, could hamper thousands of businesses and services, which Nigerian youths promote and influence on the platform.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt has become imperative for me to release a statement regarding the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria by the federal government. As leaders, we should go beyond emotional reactions to issues and think about how our actions will affect the people we lead and our international ratings socially and economically.\n\n\u201cTwitter has become the platform for young people and indeed all Nigerians to exercise their fundamental right to express and publish an opinion. They use the platform to complain, argue and give feedback to government and its agencies who in turn, use these to improve policies. This is a fundamental point that should be kept in mind as we debate the necessity of this suspension.\n\n\u201cWe should also remember that Twitter has gone beyond a source of communication for many of our hardworking youths in Nigeria. It has become a source of livelihood for many, irrespective of their political affiliations or religious leanings. Nigerian youths and digital communications organisations earn a living from being able to use the platform to post communications on behalf of their clients.\n\n\u201cOthers who may not have physical stores also rely on Twitter to give visibility to their products and services. Furthermore, I believe the federal government should be actively interested in how certain policies and actions will affect investor confidence. I, therefore, use this medium to appeal to the federal government to reverse this suspension for the greater good of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a Challenge to Develop Own App, APC Tells Nigerians\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC), last night, called on Nigerians to defend the country\u2019s sovereignty by supporting the federal government\u2019s Twitter suspension, saying apart from the fact that the decision was in national interest, it was a challenge to the Nigerian youths to develop another app.\n\nNational Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, in a statement Saturday, said, \u201cAPC urges Nigerians talented in the development of social media/software applications to seize the opportunity of the suspension of Twitter operations in the country to develop homegrown applications that could rival existing social media platforms and meet the need of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cRussia has VKontakte (VK), China has Weibo, among several homegrown social media platforms. The APC believes that the country has the potentials and talents that can develop alternative and competitive applications to existing platforms in the world. Twitter\u2019s suspension will undoubtedly serve as a positive trigger to unleash the creative potentials of Nigerians in the global digital space.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe claimed it was a challenge to the vibrant youths with such talents, adding that they would get support in the exercise from relevant federal government agencies as well as the numerous Information and Communication Technology (ICT) training and research establishments in the country.\n\nHe recalled that the APC had earlier released a statement asking Twitter and other operators of social media pages to use their platforms to check divisive and inciting rhetoric, particularly in Nigeria.\n\nThe ruling party said it tasked them on the important responsibilities to curb fake news, disinformation and hate speech, among others, adding that evidently, \u201cTwitter failed to do this and even allowed their platform to be used by arsonists, insurrectionists and separatists in the country.\u201d\n\nTwitter Promises Nigerians Access to New Platform, Belatedly Deletes Kanu\u2019s Bile Tweets\n\nAmerican microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, has promised to restore access to its new platform to all Nigerians.\n\nA tweet by Twitter\u2019s Public Policy yesterday said open internet was an essential human right and would help Nigerians, who relied on its platform to connect with the world.\n\nTwitter made the vow in reaction to the indefinite suspension slammed on it by the Nigerian Government.\n\nMeanwhile, less than 24 hours after the federal government banned Twitter, the global microblogging platform has deleted \u2018inciting\u2019 tweets from the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, a separatist group agitating for the Republic of Biafra.\n\nIn the controversial tweet, the IPOB leader vowed to unleash terror on Nigerian soldiers deployed to the South-east. He also used derogatory words to describe some government officials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for the living to respond to the dead but given the lack of reasoning prevalent in the #Zoo Nigeria, I wish to assure @GarShehu (Garba Shehu), the Jihadi midget @elrufai (Nasir El-Rufai) & that Fulani lapdog Femi Adesina that any army they send to #Biafraland will die there.

          "text": "\u2022Already proposes June 12\n\n\u2022Sacks all commissioners to accommodate APC in new cabinet\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nWith the 2023 political permutations in focus, Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State might have concluded plans to leave the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the All Progressives Congress (APC), but there are far more serious grounds why his defection might be impossible for now.\n\nThe reason is that the Supreme Court decision, which ceded the Zamfara governorship to the PDP immediately after the 2019 elections, did not consider any individual in arriving at the decision but the party, a situation which makes the opposition party the owner and sole beneficiary of the governorship and not Matawalle.\n\nAlready, arrangements are said to have been perfected for the governor to defect to the APC on June 12, where he is expected to be received by the ruling party\u2019s National Caretaker Committee Chairmanand Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nAlso, as a prelude to the defection, Matawalle had on Monday, May 31, sacked his entire cabinet, including the commissioners, special advisers, the Secretary to the State Government, Chief of Staff and the Deputy Chief of Staff in other to be able to accommodate some members of the APC in the new calculations.\n\nTHISDAY gleaned that the cabinet sack was to prevent some commissioners from refusing to defect with him and avoid the kind of backslash experienced in Ebonyi and Cross River States, where some commissioners and aides refused to go to the APC with their former principals.\n\nCuriously, however, the National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP has yet to officially speak on the developing story, but an informed party source hinted that having given all the political structures in the state to the governor, the PDP was at a loss as to why Matawalle wanted to leave the party.\n\nBut the source was confident that the governor would not gamble with the idea, knowing that the seat is the party\u2019s and not his, the reason the deputy governor is said to have declined being part of the defection plan, since he would be the sole beneficiary of Matawalle\u2019s false move if he eventually dared the consequences.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the governor\u2019s planned defection was due to the politics of 2023. The governor, it was learnt, has been promised a return ticket for 2023. He is currently serving his first term in office.\n\nIn 2019, the APC won all the state and national elections in Zamfara State, the PDP came second but due to the Supreme Court judgement, the PDP inherited the victory across the board.\n\nThe state was considered an APC state and it was therefore to ensure his reelection in 2023 that Matawelle was being poached to defect to the APC.\n\nAnother party source also hinted that, \u201cThere is no free ticket for him in the APC by 2023, as the former governor of the state, Abdulazizi Yari and Senator Kabir Marafa have reconciled and will surely give him a fight \u201d\n\nBut a PDP source said the APC in Zamfara State was like a shark infected water, waiting to consume the governor, if he made the mistake of defecting to the APC.\n\nIn February this year, the political feud between the two warring camps in the state chapter of the APC \u2013 Yari and Marafa \u2013 were reconciled, by the national caretaker committee of the party as part of the 2023 scheming.\n\nThe source said it was not certain whether all PDP senators and members of the House of Representatives that benefited from the Supreme Court judgement would be willing to defect with himtoo.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cIf the governor defects what will happen to the governorship ambition of Senator Marafa? Will he subdue his ambition that caused his initial political feud with former governor Yari or will he go back to the senate? If he decides to go to the Senate, what will happen to the current senator that is from the PDP?\u201d, the PDP source stated.\n\nYari, Zamfara\u2019s immediate past governor is plotting to become the national chairman of the APC, and has been at daggers-drawn with Matawalle, who became an unexpected beneficiary of the APC crisis in the 2019 primaries in the state.\n\nThe source that spoke to newsmen said Mattawlle was expected to join the APC on June 12 as ademocracy dividend to the state.\n\nSo far, two PDP governors have joined the APC. The first to dump the PDP was the Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi and he was recently followed by the Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade, with Matawelle already in view, if he defected as being planned.\n\nHowever, Yari is said not to be not living any thing to chance as he still holds the ace in the state.\n\nBut a source claimed that to weaken Yari, all the states structures of the APC in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory would be dissolved soon.\n\n\u201cThis is part of the reasons APC is delaying their convocation of the national convention of the APC. By the delay, all the interests would be accommodated, including all that are defecting, so that everyone will be equal and own the structures at all levels of the party,\u201d the source explained.\n\nBut, the former governor, the source noted, would not go down without a fight, because if Mattawelle joined, the APC, he might be finished politically, as state structures are naturally in the hands of the governors.\n\nWhen THISDAY contacted PDP\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, he said, \u201cI will see the National Chairman and thereafter contact you \u201c, but he did not eventually get, even though sources claimed the opposition party was waiting for Matawalle to make the biggest mistake of his life.\n\nA PDP source said the party was in possession of intelligence report that the Zamfara governor had gone as far as seeking the opinions of some Supreme Court justices, who had told him leaving the PDP would definitely cost him the seat, based on the Supreme Court judgment of 2019.\n\nBut the governor was said to have contacted some highly placed persons in the government and party, who had allegedly assured him that they would circumvent the law for his sake and ensure he did not lose the seat.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says constitution review will not achieve anything\n\nNseobong Okon-Ekong\n\nOyo State Governor, Mr. \u2018Seyi Makinde, has said his government would not comply with a recent Supreme Court ruling on the local government administration, because contrary to the constitutionally recognised 33 local governments, there are additional 35 local council development areas, making it 68, a number he claimed he couldn\u2019t work with.\n\nHe, therefore, said the former council chairpersons might have to approach the apex court again to determine which of them should be paid.\n\nHowever, in a related development, the governor has doubted the possibility of the ongoing amendment to the constitution, saying any amendment to the 1999 constitution without restructuring would be nothing, but a waste of time and as such, an exercise in futility.\n\nThe Supreme Court, last month, overturned Makinde\u2019s sack of the council chairpersons in the state. Removal of the 68 council chairpersons, who were elected in 2018, was one of the early decisions of the governor as soon as he was sworn in, in May 2019.\n\nThe officials, drawn from the 33 local government areas (LGAs) and 35 local council development areas (LCDAs) and their councillors, were members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe court also decided that the replacement of the sacked officials with caretaker committees was illegal and therefore fined Mr. Makinde\u2019s administration N20 million.\n\nBut the court appeared to favour Makinde by noting that the tenures of the sacked council chairmen and councilors had expired. It, however, ordered that all their outstanding salaries and allowances must be paid with immediate effect.\n\nSpeaking to THISDAY at the Government House, Ibadan, Makinde said, \u201cThe Constitution of Nigeria recognises 33 local government areas and 351 wards in Oyo State. The previous administration created local development areas and increased the number to 68. We couldn\u2019t work with that, so, we scrapped it and put in place caretaker committees before proper elections were held in the 33 constitutionally recognised local government areas.\u201d\n\nMakinde, who further broke down his understanding of the court judgment, posited that, \u201cWhat the Supreme Court invariably said is that it is its policy that governors should not dissolve local government administrations. They expected me to approach the court to argue the unconstitutionality of the 35 LCDAs.\n\n\u201cIf I had gone to court, it would have taken this length of time for them to reach a decision by which time they would have served out their tenure. They have to go back to court to determine, who among them should be paid. And I doubt if that matter can be decided during my tenure. I may be out of here by that time,\u201d he added.\n\nDefending himself and his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), against alleged manipulation in the recent local government elections in the state, in which the PDP won all the 32 local government areas, where elections were held, said it was by choice that he resisted pressure to manipulate the elections.\n\n\u201cI deliberately appointed a Senior Advocate of Nigeria as Chairman of the Oyo State Independent Electoral Commission, because I know he will be independent-minded. I have not even spoken to him after the election. I did not know him before the appointment. People told me it was the first time they are taking part in local government election. Even my own people told me it is not done that way. They wanted us to write figures and announce results. I refused to do that,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his position that the constitution review would be an exercise in futility, he said he was ready to stake his future political career on the prediction that nothing fruitful would come out of the exercise,which he described \u201cas an annual jamboree to waste money.\u201d\n\nHis words: \u201cIf this constitution amendment succeeds, that will be the end of my political career. That is how strongly I feel about the waste of time and one that is going on. Former President Goodluck Jonathan supervised the production of a document, which many Nigerians agreed is the best document for our civil relations, he did not sign it into law, because he thought he was going to return as President. That document is there and this administration has refused to do something about it.\u201d\n\nHe explained that true federalism goes beyond resource control, adding: \u201cIt is the fundamental of how we develop as a people. We should not say because these people are backward, then, you bring everybody to the same starting line. A country must allow its people to develop at their pace.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Yusuf.\n\nThe statement warned that the action by the federal government after Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari to separatist agitators, would not win Nigeria friends. It noted that the closure of public space would constitute a limit to public discourse and democratic advancement.\n\nNPAN described the ban as a futile exercise, saying other platforms were more likely to suspect Nigeria\u2019s intentions towards democratic tenets and act adversarially towards the country.\n\n\u201cTwitter is a global platform for public communication that has expanded the frontiers of Free Speech and Press Freedom. It is a platform for business that has brought relief to Nigeria\u2019s youthful population who have prospered by its operation. The NPAN believes Twitter as a business is not infallible and can be influenced through high level engagement, to be a more responsive, liberal platform of public good and not a cynical champion of suspicious causes.\n\n\u201cThere should be a compromise: Nigeria needs friends and not enemies at this critical juncture of her existence. She should not play into the hands of the enemies who are relentless in seeking to destroy and ostracise her. Banning Twitter is regressive and should be rescinded in favour of dialogue.\u201d NPAN warned.\n\nThe newspaper proprietors noted that it was the threat of maximum state reprisal by President Buhari that Twitter found objectionable, in line with its corporate policy, leading to sanction on the President through deletion of his tweet.\n\nIt noted that it was not the first time Twitter would sanction world leaders for infractions against its stated policy as it did so to former US President Donald Trump, to global acclaim when the latter used the social media to spread hate and instigate insurrection by a mob which stormed the Capitol.\n\nAlthough it faulted the federal government, the association also challenged Twitter to correct itself as its sincerity was questionable to the extent that it may have been hasty in sanctioning President Buhari while showing an uneven application of its rules against the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) separatist leader, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nAccording to NPAN, while Nigeria has retaliated with the cudgel against Twitter for alleged double standard in a hasty sanctioning of the President, the micro bloggers appeared to be pampering an unrestrained Kanu for using the same Twitter platform not just for serial hate speeches but for actually provoking and justifying violence in his separatist agitations.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We urge you to please join us nationwide/worldwide to engage in massive street action on June 12, 2021. #June12Protest #BuhariMustGo #Revolutionnow,\u201d he said on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian State has declared war against her citizens and we must rise in millions with every resistance available. #June12Protest is an historical duty to save what is left of this country,\u201d another Nigerian said.\n\nWith the recent ban of Twitter by the Nigerian government, it is expected that many more youths would feel motivated to join the protest to demand respect for the rights of Nigerians to air their views.\n\nNigeria\u2019s June 12 Democracy Day is a public holiday set aside to commemorate the restoration of democracy in the country.\n\n\n\nMay 29 was initially the democracy day in Nigeria, until it was changed in 2018 by the Federal Government.\n\n\n\nThis is special in Nigeria\u2019s history and is used to commemorate the democratic election of Chief MKO Abiola on June 12, 1993, in what has been adjudged to be Nigeria's freest and fairest elections.\n\n\n\nIt was, however, cancelled by the Ibrahim Babangida military junta, and Abiola was thrown into prison, leading ultimately to his untimely death in 1998.",

          "title": "OBITUARY: TB Joshua, the controversial pastor adored by many presidents and politicians",
          "text": "To many, Temitope Balogun Joshua, popularly known as TB Joshua, was a prophet who could reveal events of the future to the world \u2014but the prophet, it seems, did not see his own death coming, or did he? On Saturday, the founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) kissed the world goodbye \u2014 just days before his 58th birthday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a recent video, Joshua was seen explaining that it would not be easy for him to celebrate his coming birthday owing to the pandemic. He asked that his birthday be instead, celebrated with prayer and fasting.\n\n\u201cAs things stand, you may have realised it will not be easy for me to celebrate my birthday under the present circumstances. Some of the people who want to come are troubled by the situation all over the world. We see their fear and their worry. I feel their pain, I feel their worry,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cTherefore, let us dedicate this day to prayer and fasting. Don\u2019t forget the needy. By the grave of God, more birthdays are ahead. God bless you Emmanuel. Happy birthday.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlas! What many did not know was that the prophet himself would not be alive to \u2018pray and fast\u2019 on the anniversary of his birth. The charismatic preacher drew his last breath on Saturday after one of his evening services. Although the cause of his death is yet unknown, TheCable understands he had suffered stroke two months ago was flown by air ambulance to Turkey for treatment.\n\nBORN IN \u2018UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES\u2019\n\nJoshua wrote in his official biography that the circumstances surrounding his birth were unusual. As he put it, on June 12, 1963, in the small village of Arigidi in Akoko, Ondo state, \u201dBaby Joshua\u201d breathe air for the first time after 15 months in his mother\u2019s womb \u2014 almost double the usual gestation period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeven days after, he narrowly escaped death after a quarry explosion near the family house sent rocks rolling through the roof. It is also said his birth was prophesied 100 years ago.\n\nHe had an interesting childhood, earning the name \u201csmall pastor\u201d in primary school because of how much he loved the Bible. That was at St. Stephen\u2019s Anglican Primary School in Arigifu Akoko, between 1971 and 1977.\n\nHis secondary education in the following years was cut short as he had to take up casual jobs for survival. He kept in touch with the Bible nonetheless; organised Bible study classes for children in his community, and attended evening classes as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGROWING HIS CHURCH FROM EIGHT MEMBERS TO GLOBAL PHENOMENON\n\nThe SCOAN was supposedly founded with just eight members in 1987. According to the church, it now attracts 50,000 worshippers each week, with many travelling from far-off countries just to see the preacher in the flesh and perhaps, touch the hem of his garment.\n\nDuring his usually televised church programmes on Emmanuel TV, hundreds of thousands tune in from across the world, especially on special occasions such as crusades.\n\nMiracles were also a key part of Joshua\u2019s ministry, little wonder many continued to flock the church \u2014 even on Sunday morning when the news of his death broke.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe church website is littered with videos of testimonies from church members concerning all kinds of healings, from the casting out of demons to financial prosperity and to healing from incurable diseases.\n\nA number of those testifying claimed to have been healed by the prophet\u2019s \u2018anointing water\u2019. He made headlines when he claimed that the anointing water could cure Ebola and even sent bottles of the water to Sierra Leone which was battling an outbreak of the disease.\n\nHIS PROPHESIES THAT CAME TO PASS \u2014 AND THOSE THAT NEVER DID\n\nJoshua was known to have prophesied the occurrence of a number world events, among which are reported to include the death of Michael Jackson, the shooting down of MH17 in Russian airspace, the November 2015 attacks in Paris and the outcome of two African Cup of Nations (AFCON) final matches, which were won by Zambia and Nigeria respectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis prophecy about the impending death of an unnamed African president also made waves in the media \u2014 it turned out to be Former Malawian President Bingu wa Mutharika, who died in 2012.\n\nIn 2015, the late pastor also said he told former President Goodluck Jonathan that the March 28 presidential election would not end in his favour and that he had advised him to accept defeat. Jonathan was eventually defeated by Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nBut it was not a smooth ride all through as some of Joshua\u2019s prophecies never came to pass. One of such instances was the US presidential election of 2016 which he had predicted that Hillary Clinton would win.\n\nHe had said: \u201c10 days ago, I saw the new president of America with a narrow win. The new president will be facing several challenges over many issues, including: passing bills, attempts to possibly pass a vote of no confidence on the new president. The boat of the new president will be rocked. By the way, in order not to keep you in suspense, what I frankly saw is a woman.\u201d\n\nThe results turned out to be the exact opposite as Donald Trump was declared winner of the election.\n\nJoshua later explained that he meant Clinton was going to win by \u2018popular vote\u2019. He also accused his critics of not understanding the things of God and later said Clinton lost because a lot of Americans prayed against it.\n\nIn 2020, during a church sermon, he revealed that the pandemic will be over by the end of March.\n\n\u201cThis month, 27th, it will be over, by the end of this month, whether we like it or not, no matter the medicine they have produced to cure whatever, it will go the way it came,\u201d he had said.\n\nHours to the day Joshua predicted that the pandemic would be over, Nigerians on social media platforms began a countdown to mock the failed prophecy.\n\nHOW HE RESISTED A PROBE INTO HIS CHURCH BUILDING COLLAPSE\n\nIn 2014, a building within the headquarters of his church collapsed, killing at least 115 people \u2014 mostly foreigners.\n\nAmid criticisms, the late pastor claimed the incident was a terrorist attack targeted at him, and vowed that those behind the attack would be exposed.\n\nThe Lagos state government set up an inquest over the incident, but Joshua refused to make an appearance during the proceedings \u2014 a move that was seen as an affront to the panel.\n\nAttempts to make him testify did not yield any positive result \u2014 not even an ultimatum from Oyetade Komolafe, the coroner, made him change his mind. He later asked the court to determine whether the witness summons served on him to appear before the coroner did not constitute an infringement on his rights to fair hearing.\n\nIn yet another unfortunate incident two years later, three worshippers lost their lives in a stampede at the church as they struggled with a crowd to see Joshua during a special healing service.\n\nMORE AND MORE CONTROVERSIES\n\nWith Joshua\u2019s popularity came controversies. In 2019, Bisola Johnson, an activist, alleged that she was raped by the pastor. Johnson claimed she was trapped in Joshua\u2019s church for 14 years before \u201cthe Lord set me free\u201d. However, he never reacted publicly to the accusation.\n\nIn clips posted via his Twitter handle in late 2020, the pastor was seen sweating profusely on a mountain where he said he was praying for God to heal the world of COVID-19. Many took a jab at him for seeking divine help for a pandemic he had prophesied would end months earlier.\n\nThe Emmmanuel TV youtube channel with over 1.8 million subscribers and 600 million views belonging to Joshua, was recently suspended for allegedly propagating hate speech.\n\nThe church had published a video titled \u2018The spirit of man is tormenting you\u2019. It contained the pastor\u2019s prophecy about Chetanna Nwabuwa, a Nigerian in Ghana who was allegedly possessed by a strange spirit.\n\nDefending his church\u2019s sermons, Joshua had said: \u201cOur mission is to share the love of God with everyone \u2013 irrespective of race or religion \u2013 and we strongly oppose all forms of hate speech!\n\n\u201cWe have had a long and fruitful relationship with YouTube and believe the decision was made in haste.\u201d\n\nHELPER OF THE HELPLESS\n\nThe popular preacher was not just all about prophesies and controversies. A Forbes blogger estimated that Joshua spent $20 million on education, healthcare and rehabilitation programmes for former Niger Delta militants.\n\nThe SCOAN also reportedly has a scholarship programme which caters for the academic needs of \u2018thousands\u2019 of students from primary to tertiary education. In 2009, Joshua started a football club, My people FC, as part of efforts to help the youth.\n\nAlso, in his philanthropic manner, after the Haiti earthquake of 2010, Joshua was said to have sent a team of medical personnel and humanitarian workers to the affected area and established a field hospital called Clinique Emmanuel.\n\nHe has also been recognised for his humanitarian activities. In 2008, he was awarded a national honor by the Nigerian government and has also received a letter of appreciation from many countries. He was recognised with an \u2018award of excellence\u2019 by ZAKA, Israel\u2019s primary rescue and recovery voluntary service.\n\nOn Sunday morning, hundreds of his worshippers thronged his church and cried over the news of his death. Some recounted how he fed and clothed them, others spoke about how they made a living with the help of the church\u2019s activities.\n\nHe was adored by many presidents and politicians.\n\nHe will be sorely missed by all, but most importantly, by Evelyn, his wife, and three children.",

          "title": "Twitter ban rewinds Nigeria to pre-internet darkness and reign of fear",
          "text": "A Nigerian government that is overseeing the headquarters of global poverty, sky-high unemployment, rampant extrajudicial killings and an unabating insurgency has decided that its worst problem is its citizens\u2019 use of Twitter, and all media enabled by the internet.\n\nThat government, headed by a former military dictator, has rewinded Nigeria to the dark days of press crackdowns and a reign of fear that the world thought the country had moved on from.\n\nIn 1984, Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s military government proclaimed Decree 4 to shutter newspapers, radio and television stations. It was a response to open criticism of government officials. It applied retroactively to journalists and citizens, punishable by jail time.\n\nUnder the same retired major general\u2019s supposedly democratic reawakening a generation later, the biggest independent platform for citizens to bond over grievances, where they come together to pool medical, legal and educational aid, has come under his hammer.\n\nAn infamous ban\n\nAs of the morning of Saturday June 5, most people living in Nigeria could no longer access Twitter.\n\nTelecommunications providers like MTN, Airtel and 9Mobile have cut off access to the social media app and website. Some users say they still have access from some internet service providers, but VPNs have become the primary medium to stay on Twitter for most people.\n\nThe Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), a trade body for telcos in Nigeria, confirmed that they have implemented the Twitter ban:\n\n\u201cWe wish to confirm that our members have received formal instructions from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the industry regulator, to suspend access to Twitter.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on the national interest provision in the Nigerian Communications Act, 2003, and within the license terms under which the industry operates; our members have acted in compliance with the directives of the Nigerian Communications Commission\u2026\u201d\n\nThe rest of ALTON\u2019s statement tries to have it both ways: \u201c\u2026we endorse the position of the United Nations that the rights held by people offline must also be protected online. This includes respecting and protecting the rights of all people to communicate, to share information freely and responsibly\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat does that matter? Actions speak louder than endorsements.\n\nALTON confirms telcos have shut down Twitter in Nigeria\n\nBut of course the whole responsibility for Nigeria\u2019s Twitter darkness lies at the top.\n\nBuhari was disciplined on Twitter because his tweet breached sensible rules on threatening violence. In a response that smacks of a thin skin, he has summoned his ostensibly constitutional command of violence.\n\nHis ruse of protecting Nigeria from \u201cactivities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d rings hollow to everyone who has followed his government\u2019s faltering attempts at keeping Nigerians safe for six years.\n\nBut he did it because, in two elections, Nigerians decided he should. And if he can do this, what more is on the table?\n\nPrepare for the worst\n\nAnother look at yesterday\u2019s announcement should raise an ominous feeling.\n\n\u201cThe Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn effect, suspending Twitter is just the beginning, a taste of a very unpleasant menu that could be served soon.\n\nOver-the-top platforms include instant messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Netflix, Shomax and other streaming platforms. Basically, any media and communication service that uses data provided by internet service providers.\n\nBecause they are available over the internet, OTT platforms do not need cable or satellite infrastructure to be available to end users. The Nigerian Broadcasting Commission oversees TV and radio because TV and radio stations rely on national infrastructure and as such need licenses from regulators.\n\nNow, Nigeria wants to license OTTs indirectly through the ISPs that enable them.\n\nIt is not yet clear how this will be done. Messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram are end-to-end encrypted. Will the government demand access to users\u2019 chats as part of licensing agreements?\n\nDon\u2019t say it is beyond the scope of imagination. By suspending Twitter, Nigeria has stepped into the internet control realm currently championed by China, Iran and India, a fellow country under democracy. Under this protocol, all is fair in love and war against government criticism.\n\nWill Nigeria step up censorship of Netflix by demanding more local content (like South Africa wants to do), or query Showmax for the behaviour of contestants when Big Brother Nigeria returns in a few months?\n\nAgain, nothing is off the table. If anything is off the table with this Twitter ban, it is the alternative means of livelihood with which many Nigerians put food on their tables.\n\nDown with the informal economy\n\n\u201cSocial media has been at the forefront of income generation for digital marketers,\u201d Wale Adetona, an influencer with 176,000 Twitter followers tells TechCabal.\n\nHe believes the Twitter ban will have a \u201cconsequential effect on brand communication.\u201d\n\nGenerally, we can expect brands to be fine. They will find other ways to reach audiences. But thousands of informal economy workers \u2013 food vendors, event planners, etc \u2013 who rely on finding customers on their timeline will feel the brunt. They can migrate to Instagram but generating viral marketing content isn\u2019t as easy as it is on Twitter.\n\nIf Abuja factored these people in the decision to ban Twitter, it was ultimately decided that the informal part of the digital economy is necessary collateral damage. It was decided that they are dispensable. Maybe they will be referred to join TraderMoni or N-power, as palliatives.\n\nFor now, everyone has been marched through the barricades without distinction. As one suppressed people, united by a history of trauma in the Giant of Africa. One nation under Buhari\u2019s democratically reformed gun.",

          "text": "Twitter has reacted to the indefinite suspension of the social media site by the Nigerian government, expressing concern.\n\nA statement by a Twitter spokesperson to TechCabal said:\n\n\u201cThe announcement made by the Nigerian Government that they have suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria is deeply concerning. We\u2019re investigating and will provide updates when we know more.\u201d\n\nWhile Twitter does not have physical offices in Nigeria, the platform is freely available in the country and has up to 2 million users, according to some estimates. The government\u2019s suspension as announced by Lai Mohammed, the Minister for Information and Culture, has been interpreted as a potential directive to Internet Service Providers to cut off users\u2019 access to the social media platform\n\nAs we have reported, the suspension is a culmination of a three-day drama. It started when Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari for violating its rules.\n\nA few hours after Twitter\u2019s action, Mohammed, the Information Minister, held a press conference in which he denounced the US social media company for having a suspicious agenda in Nigeria. He accused Twitter of enabling violence during #EndSARS protests in October 2020.\n\nIn the end, he justified his suspension of Twitter on the grounds of \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe suspension brings Twitter squarely into the heat of the debate about the intersection of democracy and internet freedom in Africa.\n\nWhen they announced that Ghana will be the location of their first Africa office, Twitter said it was because Ghana is \u201ca champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet, of which Twitter is also an advocate.\u201d\n\nTwitter remains available in Nigeria at the time of publishing this \u2013 two and half hours after the announcement was posted on the Information Ministry\u2019s verified Twitter account. It remains to be seen when the suspension takes effect and what actions Twitter takes.\n\nUpdate: Twitter has now been shutdown in Nigeria.",

          "text": "On behalf of the ownership of Farmsponsor Nig Ltd, we want to thank our sponsors for their unwavering support and trusting us as we work to improve the Agricultural sector in Nigeria.\n\nWe deeply share in your displeasure with the upset that the company has had in paying out its sponsors.\n\nThe past few days has been quite a challenge as the company has been facing some difficulties which has destabilized our crowd funding operations.\n\nThese challenge stems from the recent SEC cease announcement on all crowdfunding platforms by June 30, 2021. This has made it impractical for Farm-sponsor to continue its crowding operation as the notice came upon us abruptly, by the first week of June.\n\nWe are taking appropriate measures to see that all funds collected from every sponsor will be paid back accordingly.\n\n\n\nAn overview of Farmsponsor facilities and operational layout\n\nPlease bear with us as payments will likely be staggered. We are working to make payout as fast as possible but to be honest, it may take up to 18 \u2013 24 months to finish. Paying everyone at once will eat too deep into our operational cash flow. Let us continue to work to pay you.\n\nThe stated timeline is only but the very least. We are already working hard to see everyone is paid in the shortest of time, nevertheless we wouldn\u2019t want to disappoint twice so we have to settle for the stated projected timeframe.\n\nIt is also worthy of note that over the last two years, Farm-sponsor have accomplished a great deal, and we owe it to all your sponsorship.\n\nIn the time that we have been doing business together along with the funds you have trusted us with, we have been able to establish the following:\n\n\u2022 A 360,000-broiler Pen (biggest in South-South Nigeria).\n\n\u2022 60,000 capacity breeders pen (with over 10,000 laying breeder birds).\n\n\u2022 10 tons per hour feed mill.\n\n\u2022 24,000 per day fully automated chicken processing plant (recently installed and commissioned).\n\n\u2022 128,000 birds per week state of the art hatchery.\n\n\u2022 823 Hectares of land in Oyo State (valued above $3m).\n\n\u2022 A veterinary clinic and two retail supermarket outlets in the heart of Port Harcourt, amongst many other great features that we have achieved together.\n\nWe are just stating to make certain, perhaps you\u2019re in doubt that you have invested wisely.\n\nPart of our short term strategies is through overdraft or a term loan from some of our financial institutions. Our mid term strategy is through equity investment from institutional investors and we are willing to relinquish 30-50% of directors shares in the company. Our long term strategy would be direct revenue from the business, hence the 18-24 months.\n\nOur entire workforce is working tirelessly to ensure that we regain the trust you\u2019ve always had with Farmsponsor.\n\nIt\u2019s uneasy on our part that we are writing this letter instead of payment slips.\n\nWe apologize for any undue hardship or inconveniences that this might cause you.\n\nWe really appreciate your understanding, and support as well as believing in us as we walk this journey of emerging a stronger Farm-sponsor.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAkpa Chike\n\nCo-founder, Globetrot Farmsponsor Nig Ltd.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "On Friday, June 4, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, announced the indefinite suspension of Twitter in the country.\n\nHe also disclosed the government\u2019s directive to the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to start licensing all over-the-top (OTT) and social media operations.\n\nThe move has understandably drawn outrage from Nigerians who see it as yet another attack on free speech by the government. However, free speech is not the only thing affected.\n\nThe Twitter ban could also affect the country\u2019s economy. Consequently, investor confidence would weaken, and there\u2019d be a negative impact on development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 2016 World Bank study found a correlation between increased broadband penetration and an increase in per capita GDP.\n\nIn addition, Internet or social media shutdowns cost sub-Saharan countries $237.4 million in 2020.\n\nWe examine how this ban could affect Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nInfluencers\n\nOver the past few years, the influencer marketing space in Nigeria has grown so much that almost anyone with dedicated followers could snag deals with organisations looking to extend their reach.\n\nThough some influencers \u2014 mostly lifestyle \u2014 use Instagram more, Twitter is the primary platform for most of them.\n\nWhile the organisations that work with them can easily use other channels for their marketing activities, it could be harder for them to do the same.\n\nAlso, while they may be able to afford VPN services, their followers who keep them in business may be unable or reluctant to do so. Either way, this does not end well for these influencers.\n\nFreelancers\n\nThe increase in Internet penetration has increased the number of people making a living off the Internet, specifically social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom social media managers to content creators and product photographers, thousands of Nigerians have created careers off these platforms. This ban puts their sources of livelihood at risk.\n\nIn a previous article, we examined how Nigerians are now using Twitter to get jobs, investors, and fill vacancies. These are all activities that a social media ban would hinder.\n\nStartups\n\nNigeria\u2019s startup scene has experienced tremendous growth in a short time, with $3,77.4 million raised in 2019, although that figure fell to $120.6 million in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThis has resulted in jobs for a significant number of people and revenue in the form of taxes for the government.\n\nHowever, this ban puts all of that at risk. For most startups, their businesses depend, in some part, on social media.\n\nWithout access to social media to run marketing campaigns or build relationships with their customers, business would take a hit. Applications that are built using Twitter APIs are also affected.\n\nWhat did these humans do fgs? Block twitter and thereby blocking every other domain that has twitters apis embedded in it? React native elements, UI kitten, my components libraries are not working. I can\u2019t do my work. Wth is wrong with this country! \u2014 Mazi Juls (@AAjulibe) June 5, 2021\n\nWhile these businesses would find ways to innovate around the ban, their users may not.\n\nYou now have to add \u201chow would navigate a government ban\u201d to the type of questions you might have to answer when fundraising. \u2014 Oluyomi Ojo (@OluyomiOjo) June 4, 2021\n\nPolitical stability is one of the factors that investors consider while making investment decisions. By banning Twitter and directing the NBC to start licensing OTT services in the country, investors are not likely to jump at the opportunity of investing in Nigerian startups depriving the country of much-needed investments.\n\nMerchants\n\nSmall and medium enterprises are vital to the growth of any economy, frequently providing as much as 60-70% of the economy with jobs. Numbering about 117.4 million, SMEs in Nigeria contribute 48% of national GDP, account for 96% of businesses, and 84% of employment.\n\nMany SMEs have leveraged the Internet, especially social media, for business activities such as marketing and customer service. The number of vendors on Twitter and Instagram is a testament to this.\n\nWhile these businesses could move to other platforms, their posts might not gain as much engagement as Twitter provides. What\u2019s more? There are no assurances that a ban on other social media platforms would not follow.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Federal Government has announced that it will be indefinitely blocking access to microblogging and social media platform, Twitter, in Nigeria.\n\nOn Friday, June 4, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Ministry of Information and Culture made this move known on its Twitter and Facebook handles.\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\n\n\nFG Suspends @Twitter Operations in Nigeria pic.twitter.com/7z5BQ0Mi3U \u2014 Fed Min of Info & Cu (@FMICNigeria) June 4, 2021\n\nPer the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, the government made this suspension due to the \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis move comes just a few days after Twitter deleted a controversial tweet made by Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari. That action had since been criticised by some government officials, and decisive action appears to have been taken.\n\nInterestingly, Facebook has also deleted the President\u2019s message on its platform. Could the hands of Nigerian law also fall heavily?\n\nOver the years, Twitter has become an important social media platform for Nigerians. Several humanitarian causes and protests have moved from hashtags to reality. #OccupyNigeria and #BringBackOurGirls are some notable ones.\n\nNigeria\u2019s latest suspension means that it could order telecom companies to block access to Twitter if this move is not fought against.\n\nRecall that there were fears of a possible Internet shutdown, or, at least of social media after Twitter aided in the #EndSARS campaign \u2014 a nationwide protest against police brutality. That led us to curate an informative piece on how to bypass an Internet shutdown in Nigeria.\n\nIt is then interesting that all it took this time was a deleted tweet, for the Nigerian government to take such drastic action.\n\nThe Ministry of Information and Culture has also ordered the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to start licensing other over-the-top (OTT) and social media platforms going forward.\n\nIt is probably safe to state that this suspension might not end with Twitter if the NBC implements the full provisions of its broadcast code. In 2019, Nigerian lawmakers passed a Social Media Bill through a second hearing in record time, and it took several human rights bodies to pause proceedings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, all signs point to the fact that the Social Media Bill could be very much alive.\n\nSadly, Nigeria has finally joined the ranks of African countries that have implemented some form of Internet censorship.\n\nTwitter\u2019s decision to open its first African office in Ghana, while advertising job roles meant for Nigeria might now be deemed a masterstroke.",

Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, says it\u2019s been a real struggle getting the app to function properly across devices.\n\nAccording to WABetaInfo, on June 3, 2021, Zuckerberg said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a big technical challenge to get all your messages and content to sync properly across devices even when your phone battery dies, but we\u2019ve solved this and we\u2019re looking forward to getting it out soon!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not all that\u2019s coming to the app. The CEO also revealed a \u2018view once\u2019 feature which will let users send pictures and videos that disappear after they have been viewed.\n\nWhen are these features coming? Though there is no launch date for these features, Zuckerberg hints at some time within the next two months.\n\nTesla for Africa might be getting closer\n\nBe it self-driving or battery-powered, bringing an electric vehicle to African roads is a challenge for obvious reasons: the state of the roads and a lack of electricity.

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nNigeria\u2019s Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, has said that it would take 50 years for Nigeria to recover from another civil war.\n\nAregbesola warned Nigerians to desist from from any act capable of threatening Nigeria\u2019s unity, describing those calling for the separation of the country as ignorant.\n\nThe Minister stated this on Saturday in Ilesa during his 64th birthday celebration and presentation of a book titled \u201cThe Rauf I Know,\u201d written by a journalist, Mr Dayo Olanipekun.\n\nMr Olanipekun covered him as state house correspondent for the Broadcasting Corporation of Osun State (OSBC) during his two terms as governor.\n\nOgbeni Aregbesola said: \u201cThose calling for Nigeria\u2019s break-up are ignorant. Every Nigerian should work for Nigeria\u2019s unity and development.\n\n\u201cIt will take Nigeria 50 years to recover from civil war. Whoever likes women and children should not support, but rather condemn any call of separation and conduct capable of threatening Nigeria\u2019s unity.\n\n\u201cNigeria is a country created by God for us and for the black race.\n\n\u201cI am not saying everything that is happening in Nigeria is good. We should treat the problems and challenges facing Nigerians, not calling for her break-up. Decapitation is not the antidote for headache.\u201d\n\nAregbesola also declared support for a new caucus of the All Progressives Congress (APC), The Osun Progressives (TOP), saying that he is in support of any move to consolidate progressives legacies in the State of Osun, strengthen the party from the polling units, wards and local government levels and strengthen internal democracy in the party, which are clearly stated in the objectives and mission of TOP.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola stated that Osun as a state is proud of Aregbesola, noting that the former governor of the state performed very well while ruling the state and still performing as the Minister Of Interior.\n\nOyetola who was represented at the event the Commissioner for Political Affairs and Inter-governmental Relations, Mr Taiwo Akeju, said: \u201cYou performed very well in the State of Osun and you are performing well as the minister of Interior. We are very proud of you.\u201d\n\nIn his address, the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, said that Aregbesola\u2019s legacy in the development of the State will forever linger in the sands of time.\n\nThe Ooni of Ife who spoke via Zoom noted that the State of Osun and its people cannot forget Aregbesola as his achievements are beyond what anyone can rubbish.\n\n\u201cWe will forever remember him. Your work will never cease to reflect in the sands of time. It is during his tenure that landmark achievements occurred in Osun which we cannot forget,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe can never forget you. Your achievements are beyond what anyone can rubbish. We are proud of you and what you represent.\u201d\n\nThe Registrar of the Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB), Prof Ishaq Oloyede, who delivered a lecture titled \u201cPower is responsibility\u201d at the event, urged Nigerian political leaders to be responsible with power.\n\nOloyede who was represented by Dr Wahab Oyedokun, tasked politicians to operate with ideology that address people\u2019s yearnings.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Chief Mrs Tokunbo-Awolowo Dosumu, daughter of the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, said Aregbesola is among the few Nigerian politicians that identify with and promote Awolowo\u2019s legacy.\n\nAccording to Dosumu, Aregbesola has always been committed to all the activities of Awolowo Foundation, describing him as an exemplary leader.\n\nPoliticians, traditional rulers, trade union groups and people from all walks of life from the state and across the country graced the occasion, while others spoke via zoom.",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe federal government of Nigeria has warned against deforestation in the country, saying it contributes to food insecurity in the country.\n\nThe federal government through the Minister of Environment, Dr Mohammad Mahmood, who gave the warning, expressed concern over the level of deforestation in the country.\n\nAccording to the Minister, the situation is not only alarming but unacceptable. He urged stakeholders to cooperate with government to stem the trend.\n\nDr Mahmood spoke at the 2021 World Environment Day with the theme \u201cEcosystem Restoration-Resource Relation with Nature\u201d, organised by the Federal Ministry of Environment in conjunction with the Osun State Ministry of Environment and Sanitation held at De-distinguish Event Centre, Osogbo.\n\nThe minister who expressed his worry over the situation, said he embarked on nature-based programmes and projects to control the trend.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government, being conscious of the alarming rate of deforestation standing at between 3.7 \u2013 4.0%, has continued to engage locally and internationally, in addition to the formulation of enabling policies and legislations aimed to bring the situation under control.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has also commenced execution of nature-based programmes and projects to address the challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss in view of their multiple benefits which include among others, climate amelioration, improved ecosystem services, enhanced water security, enhanced food security (especially through Agroforestry, improved soil organic carbon and water retention, improved productivity and resilience), disaster risk reduction, and improved nature-based jobs and livelihoods\u201d, Dr Mahmood stated.\n\nHe added that the human interaction with the environment coupled with impacts of climate change have further enhance exerted pressure on the environment, including the marine ecosystem.\n\n\u201cMan\u2019s interaction with nature, coupled with the challenges and impacts of Climate Change, have grossly exacerbated the deleterious state of the environment.\n\n\u201cEven, the terrestrial and marine ecosystems are not spared. It is instructive that the world population especially Africa, has continued to increase geometrically, leading to an unprecedented competition for the available meagre resources for survival.\n\n\u201cOther endemic factors such as poverty, food shortage, high unemployment rate, and recently COVID-19 pandemic have significantly worsened the ecosystem, resulting in weak resilience and adaptation and thereby denying us of its invaluable services\u201d, he said.\n\nThe federal government, according to the Minister is working to ensure that the environment is efficiently protected for the sake of humanity.\n\n\u201cWe are redressing the various anomalies through the On-going National afforestation programme across all the ecological zones of the country including the establishment of Great Green Wall across the frontline States with other associated programmes such as sensitization and awareness creation, promotion of dryland agricultural technology, provision of water for irrigation and domestic uses, development of grazing resources, promotion of alternative and sustainable sources of energy, promotion of alternative means of livelihoods as well as creation of enabling environment for the development of agro-based industries\u201d, he added.\n\nSpeaking, Governor of Osun State, Mr Gboyega Oyetola, lauded the FG for the bold step towards preserving the economy and ensuring proper relationship between human and the habitat.\n\nOyetola said, \u201cIt is sad that wanton destruction of our ecosystem is often done without consideration for the immediate and remote importance of the various biological diversities in such ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe seem to have completely forgotten as a people that each species of plants and animals on our planet plays a complementary role in the healthy functioning of the natural ecosystems on which human survival depends. We must not forget that our health relies entirely on the vitality of our fellow species on earth and that the ecosystem is the warehouse for the biological diversity of plants and animals.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the foundation that supports all lives on land and below the waters, the foods we eat, the air we breathe, the water we drink and the climate that makes our planet habitable all come from the natural ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt is heartening that the world comes together annually to build capacity and weave workable strategy around recapturing our traumatised environment for the comfort and benefit of humanity.\u201d",

          "text": "Renowned educationist and Proprietress of Standard Bearers School, Lekki, Lagos, Mrs. Modupe Adeyinka-Oni has said that the need to bridge the yawning educational standards gap within the society is the principal reason behind why she is promoting the I-Africa Cloud School Project alongside her partners.\n\nOni, who has been engaged in the Nigerian educational sector in a hands-on capacity for 38 years affirmed that the aim of the social impact scheme is to ensure that presently underserved communities where parents and guardians of the children do not have the means to access and pay for A-grade quality education as is available to other more upscale communities would be helped to get the top-grade education they require \u2018so that they would not be left behind.\u2019\n\nFor the recipient of the 2021 African DOers awards, it is most important that those who can should reach out to those who do not have and it is for this reason that she has set out at the moment to ensure that well-heeled professionals like herself should rise up to the challenge and help to give back in such a way that the burden of unequal educational access and its negative side effects can be minimised and more creatively managed.\n\nAs she explained, the big idea behind the project is to tap from within one pool to benefit the other pool.\n\nModupe Adeyinka-Oni is a teacher of teachers. A former long-time player within the prestigious Corona Schools team, she is one who is generally always in search of value. Getting value, adding value and sharing value is first nature for her. That is essentially how she is wired.\n\n24 years ago, when she saw a need to focus more intently on the specific needs of individual readers, she pulled out of the Corona Schools System to start Standard Bearers School, Lekki, Lagos.\n\nNow her sights are set on improving overall capacity in the educational system. And she is working with two principal points of focus: building greater teacher capacity and using technology more powerfully.\n\nPart of her motivation comes from a desire to give back to a system that has been quite generous to and served her through the years. But there is also a strand of her inspiration that comes from her appreciation of the basic reality that Nigeria as a nation and Africa as a continent would only be building a castle of sand if plans are not made to ensure the best educational possibilities for the many in our midst that are deprived and disadvantaged.\n\nThis is what has engaged her for almost a decade now, working with other like-minded professionals in helping to raise teacher standard in the less affluent private schools in the Lagos area; those whose children pay fees of about N20-25,000.00 (40 to 50 dollars) a term.\n\nSome of the communities whose schools have benefited from these engagements are in the Ijesha and Ogudu suburbs of Africa\u2019s most populous megacity. And the results have indeed been quite notable, including a paradoxical feedback call from one benefiting school owner who reported that her teachers had become so resourced and empowered that they had indeed become the beautiful bride in their own neighbourhood!\n\nCurrently, she is engaged in using ground-breaking but available technology to reach out to even more communities across Nigeria, and at this time also, to directly engage and teach the students themselves.\n\nOf special interest for her at this time too are children from poor communities and the rising bands of IDP children who are victims of the many conflicts that have broken out across the country in more recent years. A pilot project was undertaken in the Federal Capital Territory a few days ago and all systems are presently being fine-tuned to ensure full deployment in the next few weeks.\n\nAdeyinka-Oni is grateful for the help and support of her many partners, sponsors and associates who are collaborating with her on the field. Appreciating that the task at hand is indeed very daunting, she however believes that because it has to be done, she would not be deterred. \u2018We will keep going on. It will all be well.\u2019 Such single minded devotion. Such exemplary demonstration of resolve. Commendable.",

Every election year, we set up canopies and flag it off until Buhari came and it stopped.\n\n\u201cActual construction started. Today, we are being told of the hand over day of first quarter of 2022. You can go there and and see what is happening.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, Enugu-Onitsha road is being addressed. Enugu-Portharcourt is being addressed. A new contract has been awarded between Umahia and Ikot-Ekpene. Same thing ABA-Ikot-Ekpene.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the economy. Yes, we have not gotten to where the government woul\u010f like to be. The truth is that, we must not forget that by the time President Muhammadu Buhari took over the leadership of this country, oil was as low as twenty something dollars to a barrel.\n\n\u201cYou and I know that oil is the mainstay of this economy. Sights should not be lost of the fact that, we have a situation where a lot has to be done, but the resources available are limited. This resource is such that Nigeria is not in control of the market. It is a situation where, whatever happens in the international community influences the situation on ground.\n\nThat challenge is there. So whatever happens affects us.\n\nOn diversification of the economy, the one time National Auditor of yhe APC emphasized that; \u201cI don\u2019t speak for government, but for myself.\n\n\u201cGovernment realizing this challenges, started laying emphasis on diversifying the economy. Today we are talking about agriculture. Prior to this time, we were importing rice but I am sure nobody is talking about importation of rice now.\n\n\u201cWe are almost approaching self-sufficiency in rice production. So we have that challenge. The government is doing well in trying to diversify the economy. If you look at it again, government is doing well in investment infrastructure and development because we have had an infrastructural decay for quite a long while.\n\n\u201cWhy wont they support us,\u201d he queried, \u201cwhen people keep saying APC is not popular in Anambra, in 2017, election we came second.\n\n\u201cWe beat PDP in that election. So what happened? Is it demons that voted for us? The same Anambra people are there. When you marry two husbands, ask women, they will tell you. You will be in a position to compare which one is better. Like I keep saying.\n\n\u201cAnambra people have married two husbands, and the third one is waiting which is APC. We are asking them to marry us this time so that they will be in a position to compare the first, second and this husband that is coming; because we are coming with commitment, determination to change the narratives.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Residents flee as Gunmen attack Oyo community, kill 10\n\nEarlier, while recievingthe aspirants forms, Acting Secretary of the Party, James Akpanudoedehe said that the party will ensure a level playing ground is provided for all the aspirants at the forth coming party primary.\n\n\u201cWe have no anointed candidate. The party will work with who ever emerges at the primary.\n\n\u201cIn line with Gov Mai Mala Buni led Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee, we are committed to working with all.\n\n\u201cThat is why we need all to join hands with the party by ensuring that Anambra State join the Progressives, come Nov. 6, at the forth coming state Governorship election.\u201d",

He said he had returned home for the weekend yesterday( Saturday) evening and only informed the Oraifite Area Commander (ACP Afolabi) and few others that he was around.\n\nThe Media and Publicity Secretary of IPOB, Emma Powerful, confirmed the incident.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt was around 2.30am that they surrounded his country home. Is it an offense for someone to defend IPOB? Barr Ejiofor is doing his job as a lawyer. Where in the world is a legal practitioner harassed because he represents an organization?\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army invaded and burnt his house on 2nd December 2019 and killed more than 10 people. Since then, they have been trailing and harassing him. The whole world must hear this because the Nigerian government must get what they are looking for from IPOB.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law, Emeka Umeagbalasi, who condemned the invasion, said, \u201cWe call on the Nigerian Government to stop this madness and crudity.\n\nHe added, \u201cBy these crudities, the Nigerian Government is setting the country on fire the more.\n\n\u201cUnder Nigeria\u2019s extant laws, applicable globally, Barr Ifeanyi Ejiofor and other licensed legal practitioners have the right and duty to represent and defend any citizen or citizens or national or nationals irrespective of the gravity of crime(s) alleged to have been committed. The security forces of Nigeria are hereby called upon to withdraw and discontinue their siege and follow due process.\n\n\u201cIf Barr Ifeanyi Ejiofor is legitimately wanted for any crime, due processes must be followed to the letter. This is more so when he called and informed the chief police officer in the area (ACP Afolabi) of his being around for weekend rest.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted on the telephone, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Ikenga Tochukwu, said he had no details of the incident.

Salami Amusa, a close friend of Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua, founder of Synagogue Church of All Nations has revealed the humble beginning of the pastor and the establishment of the church in 1987.\n\nAccording to Amusa, he was one of the closest friends of the clergyman, and that he personally advised him to start taking some children for evening classes with other menial jobs.\n\n\u201cWe were close friends, I, Adewale Bakare, Otutu and Baba Saki and Best Water.\n\n\u201cWhen Temitope wanted to start a business, I personally told him to go somewhere to do a lesson for people there.\n\n\u201cOne day we were going out, I cannot remember the year, and Tope wanted to drink water, so we branched at Cele Way in Agodo, and we saw Baba, that pastor, Goodday Preyen. He waved at Tope to come, and we went to him, he told us to kneel down, and he prayed for us, he told Tope, \u2018you are a leader, you will be rich if you do this\u2019. When we were leaving, Tope asked me if I believed the pastor and I said yes, he is a great pastor.\n\n\u201cWhen Tope started, we both came together to buy this place where this church is built from the Baale of Adekunjo and late Alhaji Abanise, the Olori Ebi of Egbeland.\n\n\u201cWhen we started this place, Tope said: \u2018No person I trust among my friends that I can leave my daughter for, except me.\u2019 When we wanted to come to the Church site, I was selling paint at Awolabi at that time.\n\n\u201cTope will hand over her daughter, Sarah to me to stay with my secretary then,\u201d he narrated.\n\nAmusa further described Joshua\u2019s death as \u201cshocking and unbelievable\u201d, adding that he rushed to the church to confirmed the news.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard the news today that Temitope died, it was really surprising, I could not believe it, I said no, I had to rush down here. I was last here about four months ago to see him,\u201d he added.\n\nTalking about his philanthropist acts, Amusa listed so many things that the pastor had done for the benefit of the people in the community.\n\n\u201cEvery year, Tope will give all streets in Agodo rice, he knew all the nooks and crannies of the place because that was where he started, we went to rent the apartment he was staying at the time together.\n\n\u201cHe had helped me so many times, he was a good man.\n\n\u201cI remembered about two years ago when he saw me with some of our old friends around, he told us to come in, I knew how much was in the envelope Temitope gave me and Alhaji Seyi and Adewale Bakare,\u201d he added.\n\nSCOAN leadership announced the death of T.B. Joshua early Sunday. He passed away on Saturday June 5, 2021 at 57 but the actual cause of death is yet to be made known\n\nHe would have clocked 58 on June 12.",

          "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\n\nLagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu and his counterpart, Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State on Sunday made surprise visit at the Deeper Life Bible Church headquarters, Gbagada to honour the General Superintendent of the church, Pastor William Kumuyi as he clocks 80 years.\n\nThe visiting governors, who listened with rapt attention as the General Superintendent preached, expressed the optimism that Nigeria would come out of her prevailing challenges.\n\nIn their individual remarks, the governors appreciated Kumuyi and all members of the church for the opportunity given them to worship with the church.\n\nSpeaking, Sanwo-Olu expressed gratitude to God for the strength and continued grace He has granted Pastor Kumuyi, as he reached the age of 80.\n\nThe governor said Kumuyi had over the years remained steadfast in \u201cstanding in the gap\u201d not only for the church but for the nation, in general.\n\nSanwo-Olu said: \u201cBloodshed will not continue in our country. The Lord will help us to surmount all our problems as a nation. And because we are serving the God that is supreme, He will see us through as a nation.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Emmanuel expressed hope of a turn-around for Nigeria.\n\nHe said that it was the fervent prayer of the likes of Pastor Kumuyi that had so sustained Nigeria that all the counsels of the enemy to destroy the country have always come to naught.\n\n\u201cGod is on the throne; we shall come out stronger as a nation,\u201d Emmanuel said, adding that \u201cThe only hope for this nation is the church. God is interested in the affairs of this country.\u201d\n\nIn his sermon, Kumuyi said that what matters in life was the fulfillment of God\u2019s purpose for every individual, and not the number of years spent on earth.\n\n\u201cIt is not the number of years but the appointment of God\u201d that matters,\u201d he said.\n\nKumuyi, who noted that people are usually interested in how long a person lives, said emphasis should rather be on whether or not such an individual lived in line with the plan of God.\n\nPastor Kumuyi, was speaking in his sermon entitled: \u201cOur glowing privileges from glory to glory,\u201d challenged all to strive to live out the purpose of God for their lives.\n\nTaking his text from the Book of Psalms 90 and 91, the cleric said although it was the promise of God to grant long live to every creature, it was also God\u2019s prerogative to determine the end of every one of his saints.\n\nHe, therefore, urged believers to serve God and humanity, irrespective of their age, while they still have the opportunity.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cMoses started ministry at the age of 80 years of age and went on to 120 years. It was not only him; think of Caleb, beyond the age of 85 he was still strong and he said, give me this mountain. Think about Joshua; when he was quite an age, nearing 100 years, he said there was still much land to be conquered. Think about John the beloved, at the age of 95 or 96, he was still given the revelation to go and reveal to the nations.\n\n\u201cThat is why we do not question that so and so died at 57 or at 72; that\u2019s the appointed time. Yet, the promise of a fulfilled life is for everyone in Jesus name.\u201d\n\nKumuyi emphasised that believers had the privilege of living a beautiful and radiating life despite the present challenges.\n\nHe urged saints to continue to abide under the shadow of the Almighty, noting that there is absolute security in the shelter of the Almighty God.\n\nHe stressed the need for a transparent life in Christ which, he noted, guaranteed divine protection and preservation.\n\nThe cleric, however, warned against presumptuous sin, saying such lifestyle and indulgences did not guarantee divine protection but detract from the original promise for man, noting that \u201cIf you are incorruptible, you will be a wonder. God will be a strong refuge. He will keep you from evil.\u201d",

          "text": "More than 20 people have been allegedly killed in Igangan, one of the towns in Ibarapa North local government, as gunmen opened fire last night.\n\nThe Palace of the Asigangan as well as a popular petroleum station were not spared. They were razed by the suspected bandits numbering 50, who were said to have invaded the town around 11 pm in more than 20 motorcycles.\n\nThis is coming few days after the chairman Oyo State Security Network codenamed Amotekun Corps, General Kunle Togun (rtd) alleged that foreign Fulanis have encamped the entire Southwest region and may strike if nothing is done urgently.\n\nA former caretaker chairman of the council, Tunji Omolewu, who confirmed last night\u2019s incident said he had to rush down around 5 am this morning.\n\n\u201dPeople had barely retired to bed when they said they sighted motorcycles entering the town. Before our people could know what was going on, they had started killing people. I got the call around 11 pm. We were on our way from Ekiti where we had gone to do the Yoruba nation rally. I got to Ibadan around 12 am and when the calls did not stop coming, I decided to come home. I have counted more than 20 dead bodies. The palace of our monarch was torched. Adolak filling station too was burnt. We are assembled here\u2026\u201d he said, almost breaking down in tears.\n\nA former caretaker chairman of neighbouring Ibarapa Central, Yemi Akinlabi, who is holidaying in the United States, said his phone was bombarded with calls.\n\n\u201dIt is so sad. Only few days ago, our people got intelligence report and forwarded it to the appropriate quarters for actions but here we are today. Are we going to continue to live in fear in our land? I have spoken to General Toogun about last night\u2019s incident and we would want him and his team to do something. Our people must not be allowed to resort to self-help,\u201d he added.\n\nOnly last Wednesday, during the tour of project to mark his two years in office, Governor Seyi Makinde had disclosed that insecurity in Ibarapaland has been the most challenging and that his government has put in place several measures, including the creation of a Base for Operation Burst in the area and deployment of more Amotekun corps, among others.\n\nHe said that these measures have yielded positive results in the last few months.\n\nA statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, quoted Makinde as saying that in order to tackle the security challenge, the government is about to recruit more Amotekun corps, adding that it would also take a decision on what to do with the uncompleted 60-bed health facility in Igangan, which has become a hideout for criminals.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe issue of insecurity brought me here the last time and I remember that I made a comment that we needed to tackle those challenges because it is the only way it can affect our economic prosperity. Farmers in Ibarapa could not freely go to their farms because cows are invading their farms.\n\n\u201cIt is a problem that has been existing even before we came into government, and one of the promises I made then was to tackle security challenges. And the question to take home is \u2013 can anybody here imagine Oyo State without Amotekun? It is one of the initiatives we brought forward. Before we came, there was nothing like that. Yes, there may still be few areas we need to improve on but we all should work together with Amotekun.\n\n\u201cWell, since the last time we came here and now, we have taken various steps to ensure that the people of Ibarapaland and, indeed, the whole of Oyo State sleep with their two eyes closed.\n\n\u201cIbarapaland is the most challenging zone as far as security is concerned. Since the last time I came here and now, there has been relative progress but we will do more. We will strengthen security. Between the last time I came and now, we have set up Operation Burst base and we are in the process of recruiting more Amotekun personnel.\n\n\u201cBut I want to appeal to you not to leave the government alone to face the issue of insecurity, as we all need to join hands to make things work. That is the only way; we have to keep moving together, because the government alone cannot do it. We expect you to work with us and the security agencies.\u201d\n\nIgangan, a-177 kilometer town away from Ibadan, the state capital, had come to limelight, though for bad reason, following last December\u2019s murder of politician and large-scale farmer, Dr. Fatai Aborode, a large-scale farmer, by persons whom his farm manager told PREMIUM TIMES he could identify as Fulani.\n\nIt took the intervention of Sunday Adeyemo, before normalcy could return to the town. But that was after he issued eviction notice to the head of the Fulani community, the Sarkin Fulani, Abdulkadir Salihu, and his kinsmen.",

          "text": "Prominent contender in the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State, Chief George Moghalu, has expressed confidence he\u2019ll emerge as the preferred All Progressives Congress, APC, candidate should the party go for consensus.\n\nSpeaking with journalists at the national secretariat of APC after submitting his nomination and expression of interest forms, Moghalu noted that winning the Anambra State Governorship election would require consensus of the political elites across party lines, adding that for APC to win the election \u201cwe have to generate this consensus and we have to do that only with a candidate that is generally acceptable.\u201d\n\nThe party chieftain said, \u201cIf I must be honest with you, I will wish there is consensus and that consensus will be me but the truth about it is that, I know a good number has collected forms and I know a good number has returned their forms but that is not to say that there is still no room for discussion.\u201d\n\nThe constitution of the ruling APC allows for direct primary, indirect primary and consensus as the three options for conducting primary election to produce its candidate.\n\nThere is presently no sign of the party adopting the consensus option but Moghalu remains upbeat there is possibility of discussion in that direction.\n\n\u201cIn politics, 24 hours is a long time. I\u2019m sure that consultations will still take place. People will look at the possibility of working together but the important thing here is that, as I always said, every person is qualified to be governor. So I respect that belief as we go along.\n\n\u201cSince Consensus is not the only option, it is either direct primary, indirect primary or consensus. Since it is part of the option available to us, I don\u2019t see why we cannot exploit it because the important thing is that we remain united as a political party, that we remain together because if we are together, the likelihood of being stronger is there. So that door is not shut. I\u2019m sure that we could still exploit that option.\n\nWhile emphasizing that the election of November 6 will not be a tea party, but rather a strong contest as every party will come to the election with their best with the desire to win, the party chieftain expressed confidence that he has got enough experience to match the demands of the election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming to the business with experience, with knowledge, with capacity, with integrity, with courage and determination to win the election. So I want to once again say thank you to all of you who accepted to be with me at this time,\u201d Moghalu said.\n\nSpeaking earlier while receiving the submitted forms from the aspirant, secretary to the national caretaker committee, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe, assured that the party will ensure that a level playing ground is provided for all the aspirants at the forth coming party primary.\n\nUdoedehe maintained that the party has no anointed candidate and it is ready to work with who ever emerge at the primary.",

          "text": "Digital Rights Advocay Group under the aegis of Paradigm Initiative has said that the Federal Government\u2019s (FG), s uspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria violates the rights of citizens.\n\nIt explained that the directive by the Nigerian government is at its core, an abuse of the rights of Nigerians not just to freedom of expression, but many other rights guaranteed in the Nigerian 1999 Constitution (as amended), the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Righ ts.\n\nThe group in a statement said that the suspension, which is a reaction of the Nigerian government to the company\u2019s enforcement of its platform rules, is aimed at insulating the government from criticism, especially by Nigeria\u2019s youth who are over 70% of the country\u2019s population.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThe Federal Government of Nigeria announced its suspension of Twitter operations, that the application can be used as a platform for activities capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\n\u201cMany Nigerians read the announcement of the ban on Twitter as a reflection of the importance of the platform and other digital (social media) platforms to Nigerians in accessing information and disseminating the same.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that Nigeria\u2019s President has notably been insulated from every form of public accountability. He is perhaps the only president since the country\u2019s return to democracy in 1999 who never grants live interviews or holds media chats. This move is therefore aimed at making him unaccountable to the people of Nigeria who constantly take to social media platforms to share their views on the actions and policies of the government.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that shutting down Twitter is illegal and illegitimate policies such as this are unacceptable!\n\n\u201cA 2016 United Nations resolution affirms that the rights that citizens have offline must apply online. Coincidentally, this resolution was co-sponsored by Nigeria with others. We urge the Nigerian authorities to respect and enforce citizens\u2019 fundamental rights as provided for by the Nigerian constitution and International human rights treaties that Nigeria is a party to\u201d.\n\nThe group added that it will further contact the Ministry of Information to get exact details of the announcement, and the legal framework that supports such undemocratic pronouncement.\n\nThe group, however, advised all users of Twitter and other social media platforms in Nigeria to download virtual private networks (VPNs) to enable them to continue to use the platforms for their economic survival and social and political engagements while they all push back on this draconian order by the Nigerian government.",

Accuses Opposition, Aggrieved APC Members\n\nTension has heightened in Imo State in recent months following a series of attacks on police stations and offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nSeveral security officers have been killed in the crisis that engulfed the southeast state. A former chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Ahmed Gulak was last Sunday killed by gunmen in the state, becoming the latest high-profile casualty of incessant assaults in the southeast region.\n\nMembers of the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) have been accused of masterminding the attacks. The group has, however, denied the allegations.\n\nIrked by the wave of attacks on the state, Governor Hope Uzodinma on Thursday issued a stern warning to those who want to make the state \u201cungovernable,\u201d and accused the opposition and aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) of being behind the violence.\n\n\u201cThe opposition party and some aggrieved members of our party who are hiring boys from neigbouring states to come in here, allow me, I will deal with them. I can assure you, leave that for me,\u201d he said when he inaugurated a security council at the grassroots level to proffer solutions to the state\u2019s security challenges.\n\n\u201cSo, the people who threatened me that they will make Imo ungovernable before Imo becomes ungovernable, they will be ungovernable themselves.\u201d",

This is coming at a period when APC leaders availed members of the Nigerian progressive family the opportunity to relaunch the party more surefootedly as Nigeria\u2019s best vehicle to save Nigeria from the nagging socio-political uncertainties.\n\n\u201cThe book contains submissions that speak directly to the existential challenges the APC is facing; it illustrates the collective desire for enduring and firmly rooted democratic practices anchored on the overarching requirement for unity of all party leaders; it examines the hurdles that the APC is facing in its nascent democratic journey and cut open the underbelly of the numerous drawbacks in the leadership that it currently offers the nation through the political instruments it is deploying as a party.\n\n\u201cThis book is an essential intervention at this critical turn as APC leaders and members embark on the important task of putting in place new leadership structures at all levels and in underlying what the future bodes for the party in terms of laying a solid foundation for healthy contestations among varying interests and political players.\n\n\u201cAPC\u2019s Litmus Tests is, therefore, more than just a book. It is more of a workbook, standing at the intersection between the difficult past and the promising future.

          "text": "At least 20 people have been allegedly killed in Igangan, one of the towns in Ibarapa North local government area of Oyo State, southwest Nigeria, as unknown gunmen Saturday night opened fire on the community.\n\nIt was learnt that the palace of the the royal father Asigangan as well as a popular petroleum station were not spared as they were razed by the suspected bandits numbering 50, who were said to have invaded the town around 11 pm in more than 20 motorcycles.\n\nThis is coming few days after the Chairman of Oyo State Security Network codenamed, Amotekun Corps, General Kunle Togun (rtd), alleged that foreign Fulanis have encamped the entire Southwest region and may strike if nothing is done urgently.\n\nWhile confirming the attack, a former caretaker chairman of the council, Tunji Omolewu, said he had to rush down around 5 am (Sunday).\n\nAccording to him, \u201dPeople had barely retired to bed when they said they sighted motorcycles entering the town. Before our people could know what was going on, they had started killing people. I got the call around 11 pm. We were on our way from Ekiti where we had gone to do the Yoruba nation rally.\n\n\u201cI got to Ibadan around 12 am and when the calls did not stop coming, I decided to come home. I have counted more than 20 dead bodies.\n\n\u201cThe palace of our monarch was torched. Adolak filling station too was burnt. We are assembled here\u201d he said, almost breaking down in tears.\n\nAlso a former caretaker Chairman of neighbouring Ibarapa Central, Yemi Akinlabi, who is holidaying in the United States of America, said his phone was bombarded with calls.\n\n\u201dIt is so sad. Only few days ago, our people got intelligence report and forwarded it to the appropriate quarters for action but here we are today. Are we going to continue to live in fear in our land?\n\n\u201cI have spoken to General Toogun about last night\u2019s incident and we would want him and his team to do something. Our people must not be allowed to resort to self-help,\u201d he added.\n\nIt could be recalled that last Wednesday, during the tour of projects to mark his two years in office, Governor Seyi Makinde had disclosed that insecurity in Ibarapaland has been the most challenging and that his government has put in place several measures, including the creation of a Base for Operation Burst in the area and deployment of more Amotekun corps, among others.\n\nHe added that these measures have yielded positive results in the last few months.\n\nThe governor has however confirmed the latest attack,stating that security operatives are already on the spot for thorough investigation.\n\nA brief remark posted on his official Facebook timeline quoted Makinde as saying that he received the news of the attack on resident of Igangan in the early hours of the morning.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have received the shocking news of the attacks on residents of Igangan, Ibarapaland, in the early hours of this morning.\n\n\u201cI am currently being briefed on the incidents. I urge residents to remain calm as security operatives are now in control of the situation.\u201d\n\nKemi Olaitan in Ibadan",

Five hoodlums were killed in action (KIA)including Joseph Uka Nnachi alias King of Dragons,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cOne suspect Stanley Osinachi, 30 years old of Achi/Mberi , Mbaitoli Local Government Area of Imo State was arrested and presently aiding investigation.\n\n\u201cHe confirmed that Dragon is the leader of the gang in Imo State reporting to their supreme leader Nnamdi Kanu. He stated that, they belong to the proscribed IPOB and ESN.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mr Elkana, four AK 47 rifles were recovered and appeared to be the same police rifles stolen by the hoodlums.\n\n\u201cFour AK 47 Rifles with 2000 rounds of live ammunition and large number of explosives were recovered from the scene. The Rifles breech numbers were crossed checked and found to be the same Police Rifles that were stolen by the hoodlums from our Police station at Omuma on 31st May, 2021 which claimed the lives of four Policemen.\u201d\n\nThe Commissioner of Police Imo State Command, Abutu Yaro, commended the effort of the security forces in repelling the attack. He also appreciated the synergy amongst the security forces especially the Armed Forces and the DSS whom he said constantly feeds the joint operation with credible intelligence while the Military has consistently provided defence and outer cover to the Police.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
