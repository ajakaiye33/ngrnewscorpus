          "text": "Oluwatobiloba Jaiyeola\n\nPublic health experts have urged governments at all levels in Nigeria to prioritise health security, noting that it is essential to achieving human security.\n\nThe experts, New Voices Fellow at the Aspen Institute, Dr. Ifeanyi Nsofor; United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund Representative in Nigeria, Peter Hawkins and the Managing Director of the Nigerian Health watch, Vivianne Ihekweazu stressed that health security must be seen as a national issue.\n\nThe experts spoke on Thursday at a virtual Policy Dialogue on Health security, organised by the Nigerian Health Watch.\n\nSpeaking during the virtual session, Dr. Ifeanyi Nsofor, stated that it has become imperative for governments at all levels to prioritise health security to protect the health of the nation, stressing that leaders at federal, states and local levels need to take on a more active role in securing the health of Nigerians.\n\nThe public expert noted that the health of Nigerians depends on all the tiers of government, adding that citizens must begin to ask the right questions and hold their government representatives accountable for the state of public health facilities and outcomes in their environment.\n\nHe said, \u201cNigerians must know that our health depends on all the levels of governance and must begin to ask the right questions and hold their governments accountable for their health outcomes.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of success on the national level with the COVID-19 response, but we want to see these gains used to strengthen our health security in Nigeria at the subnational level to protect all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking at the dialogue, Peter Hawkins, stressed the importance of surveillance in response to disease outbreaks.\n\nHawkins said health security is all about surveillance, noting that it is good that health surveillance in Nigeria is strong.\n\nHe, however, stated that Nigeria\u2019s health surveillance has started to drop as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed.\n\n\u201cOne of the major challenges that Nigeria faced during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic was getting state governments to respond effectively to address the outbreak. The states are important because proper responses from the state level were crucial to fighting the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the UNICEF representative, to make reasonable progress, the Nigerian govt needs to make improvements in certain areas.\n\nHe said, \u201cThree areas we need to improve so we can do better going forward are governance, data, and decentralised financing.\n\n\u201cGovernance is saddled with the accountability of the human resources & the top priority should be getting the human resources right.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhysical responsibility and physical decentralisation are a problem in Nigeria. Every state should take responsibility for their contributory funding for their health security, and all this starts from annual planning,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, Vivianne Ihekweazu said, \u201cHealth security is a national issue that must be prioritised by all levels of government in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\n*Denounce APC\u2019s Muslim Muslim ticket\n\nBy Joseph Erunke, ABUJA\n\nAHEAD of the 2023 presidential election,some North East elders have endorsed the candidacy of Mr Peter Obi of the Labour Party, describing his choice as the best for modern Nigeria.\n\nThe elders denounced the All Progressives Congress (APC)\u2019s Muslim Muslim presidential ticket, saying the action of the party would not enjoy their blessings as a\u00e7cording to them,it did not promote equity and fairness in a diverse Nigeria.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday,the elders who described APC\u2019s action as highest level of madness and an evil agenda in Nigeria,reminded the promoters of the same faith ticket to go memory lane to see if their action was in line with what founders of Nigeria\u2019s democracy preached and practiced.\n\nNoting that Nigeria was a secular country that no religion should be elevated against others,the elders tasked APC to reflect on its action given that Nigeria of today had shifted from 1993 where such was promoted without any opposition.\n\nThe North East elders, operating under the aegis of Coalition of North East Elders for Peace and Development (CNEEPD),told APC not to be comfortable with their action, saying the rigging which it was relying upon as party in government will fail them woefully as a\u00e7cording to them,Nigerians would vote and safeguard their votes without fear or intimidations from APC\u2019s hired agents.\n\nIn the statement by its National Coordinator,Engr. Zana Goni,the group insisted that contrary to APC\u2019s expectation,it would lose the presidential poll before 12 noon, adding that \u201cindications across the country were not in favour of the party that had put Nigeria in its present bad situation.\u201d\n\nThe North East elders,also flayed the attacks being carried out on the facilities of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the South East, attributing the developments to some sponsored terrorists outside the zone with the aim to deplete the South East voting strength.\n\nThe statement read in part:\u201dAs the 2023 general elections draws near,we the Coalition of North East Elders for Peace and Development have noted with concerns some actions and statements by some political parties and actors in our democratic process. The latest being the impunity orchestrated by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in settling for a same faith ticket in a multi-religious,multi-ethnic and above all,multi-cultural country like Nigeria and the party\u2019s defence of the absurd action in the face of widespread opposition to the abnormalities.\n\n\u201cAs leaders who have not only monitored but also actively contributed to political developments in Nigeria for decades,we wish to categorically denounce the APC\u2019s action which we view as inimical to the progress and growth of Nigeria.\n\nWithout mincing words,we describe the party\u2019s decision in fielding Muslim Muslim ticket in the 2023 presidential election as the highest level of madness, insensitivity, and an evil agenda against our dear country which we have laboured for years to build. This decision which threatens the unity of the country does not have our blessings and must be resisted by all Nigerians of good conscience. Anything contrary will\n\nthreaten the fragile unity and peace of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe elders added:\u201d We wonder why a sane man and sane political party will contemplate and even go ahead to pick a Muslim as running mate to a Muslim candidate in a presidential election in secular country as Nigeria at this modern age.\u201d\n\nA\u00e7cording to the group,\u201dTo make the matter worse, they picked Alhajji Kashim Shetima, a man whose alleged link with terrorism is still a subject of debate in public domain.\u201d\n\nNoting that,\u201dThis is a costly mistake that must be resisted at poll by all Nigerians, irrespective of religion,tribe or ethnic backgrounds in the interest of peace\u201d, the group said:\u201d If this madness is allowed to see the light of the day, the unity and peace of Nigeria will be threatened forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can someone tries this in Nigeria? As it stands together Christians and Muslims have started supporting candidates based on religious lines, in mosques and churches across the country. This is not what we need now.\n\n\u201cThe peace in Nigeria is too fragile to contemplate this kind of madness as exhibited by the ruling APC. The party has actually made more Nigerians to believe that they have an Islamization agenda as widely speculated,\u201dit said.\n\nThe group alleged that attacks on INEC facilitaties in the South East are orchestrated by some political interest groups to reduce the voting strength of the region.\n\n\u201d Given the carefully coordinated attacks launched in recent times on both INEC personnel and facilitaties,we will not be wrong to believe that the actions are carefully calculated, planned, and executed by suspected Boko Haram terrorists with aim to disenfranchised the people of South East and also put them in the bad light.\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies must clamp down on these evil people and bring them to book immediately,\u201dit said.\n\n\u201cWe also urge all the South East communities to constitute a special task force to protect INEC facilities and officials across the zone,\u201dit tasked the region.\n\n\u201cWe call on all Nigeria\u2019s to resist this evil and selfish agenda of Muslim Muslim ticket with every legal means. The current level of hunger and terrorism in the North today does not respect the Muslim or any religion hence Muslims must look beyond the lies APC is selling to us. We must vote credible leaders with capacity and programme for our dear country,\u201dthe elder advised.",

Also with the increasing volatility in naira value, people now struggle to survive.\n\n\u201cEmphasis will be placed more on food, health, and shelter and there will be less interest in protecting the environment.\n\n\u201cThe locals are already resorting to the use of firewood and this sets us back from all the campaign and sensitisation that many of us have conducted to encourage transition to the use of natural gas as a cleaner energy alternative.\u201d\n\nThe don regretted that before now, most Nigerians had subscribed to the use of clean energy and enjoying its benefits; but now \u201cwe are having a reverse\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think there is a loss of trust in the system. Many people that bought into the campaign to use cooking gas invested in cylinders and stoves.\n\n\u201cThey feel disappointed and have equally abandoned and packed up those units.\n\n\u201cWe can get them back but we need to rebuild their confidence and assure them of stable cooking gas (and kerosene) prices,\u201d Madu added.\n\nNAN reports that a litre of kerosene sells between N750 and N800 in fuel stations; while a kilogramme of cooking gas sells between N850 and N900 in cooking gas stations in most parts of the country.\n\n(NAN)",

Both Oyetola and Adeleke contested for the Osun governorship position in 2018, which Oyetola won after a rerun.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has assured the people of a free and fair poll and spent most of yesterday moving sensitive voting materials to the 332 registration areas across the 30 local government areas of the state.\n\nThe election umpire restated its readiness to announce the result in less than 12 hours after the poll.\n\nThe two leading political parties are desperate to win today\u2019s contest to signpost readiness to dominate the 2023 elections.\n\nTo underpin the importance of the poll, the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Tinubu led a final campaign for Oyetola last Tuesday. He was accompanied by party chieftains like the party\u2019s National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, vice presidential candidate, Kashim Shettima and several APC governors.\n\nThe PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar also led a powerful campaign team to the state on Thursday assuring the people that Adeleke is sure of victory in the poll, and that \u201can end has come to the reign of the ruling APC\u201d in the country.\n\nAtiku was accompanied by the National Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu; Vice-presidential candidate of the party and Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki and some governors of the PDP.\n\nFor most of yesterday, tension remained very high across Osun State, with voters bitterly divided among the two leading candidates.\n\nFear of violence was palpable, considering the rancorous campaigns before the poll.\n\nThe allegations by the PDP that the APC was working to rig the poll dominated discussion across the state.\n\nPolice Deploy 21,000 Operatives\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba has assured Nigerians that today\u2019s poll would be violence-free.\n\nBaba, who spoke last Tuesday, said to accomplish the task, no fewer than 21,000 operatives would be deployed across the state.\n\nBaba warned that the police would not allow any person or group of persons, no matter how highly and lowly placed in the society to derail the electoral process, and vowed that \u201cvote-buying or any form of inducement would not be allowed as they remained serious offences.\u201d\n\nThe IG adds: \u201cThe police will be deployed to protect the facilities of INEC and its personnel. This deployment is not meant to intimidate any law-abiding citizens; rather it is to deter misguided elements that may threaten the conduct of the election and violate the electoral act. It also serves as a strong warning that government is determined to protect the citizens.\u201d\n\nThe IG has also deployed the Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of the Force Criminal Investigation Department, DIG Johnson Kokumo, for the governorship election.\n\nAlso deployed to the state are four Assistant Inspectors-General of Police, four Commissioners of Police, 15 Deputy Commissioners of Police, and 30 Assistant Commissioners of Police.\n\nBaba also moved the Osun State Commissioner of Police, Olawale Olokode (temporarily) to the Force Headquarters until the conclusion of the election.\n\nNSCDC deploys 11,226\n\nSimilarly, the Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Dr. Ahmed Audi, has deployed 11,226 officers and men to cover the 3,763 polling units, collation centres, flash points, as well as critical national assets and infrastructure during today\u2019s poll.\n\nThe deployed personnel were drawn from the national headquarters and nine state commands; Osun, Ondo, Ekiti, Oyo, Ogun, Lagos, Kwara, Kogi and Edo to supply manpower for the election.\n\nThe NSCDC said the objectives of the corps in the election were to create a secured environment for its successful conduct and enhance the general security in the state before, during and after the election.\n\nOyetola and Adeleke\n\nThe leading candidates for today\u2019s poll remain Oyetola and Adeleke.\n\nOyetola, who is seeking reelection for a second term, enjoys the privileges that come with being incumbent. He is also enjoying the perks of \u2018federal might\u2019 and the backing of Tinubu.\n\nHis chances in today\u2019s poll has been brightened by his good relationship with Osun civil servants. Unlike his predecessor who owed salaries for months, Oyetola has been consistent with salary payment and also improved the welfare of the civil servants. All of these, pundits argue, will work in his favour.\n\nHowever, the cold war between Oyetola and Rauf Aregbesola, his predecessor, may reduce the former\u2019s votes in LGAs controlled by the latter.\n\nThe disharmony within the party left it with factions \u2013 the Ileri Oluwa group is loyal to Oyetola while TOP pledges allegiance to Aregbesola.\n\nNotwithstanding, Oyetola stands a very good chance of getting a second term today.\n\nAdeleke, the \u201cdancing senator\u201d, says he is determined to recover his \u201cstolen mandate\u201d from the APC. He is in the race with a big war chest. He also has a broad support base.\n\nA lot of people from Adeleke\u2019s Osun West Senatorial District, which is yet to produce a governor since the fourth republic, are agitated. Adeleke will gain from this, but may not be enough to make him governor.\n\nThe crisis in Osun PDP may also affect Adeleke\u2019s chances. The party is also divided into factions. One is recognised by the PDP National Working Committee (NWC) while the other is backed by Olagunsoye Oyinlola, a former governor of the state, whose political sway in the state cannot be overlooked.\n\nStrengths on Senatorial Basis\n\nOyetola looks good to win Osun Central where he is from. Besides, many prominent Osun political stakeholders are from this senatorial zone, and they belong to the APC. They include former governor, Chief Bisi Akande and the current Senator, Ajibola Basiru, who is also the Oyetola campaign chairman. Osun Central is good-to-go for Oyetola.\n\nAdeleke is from Osun West, with Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi of the Accord Party. Here, Adeleke will have an upper hand, but not enough to make him governor. Oyetola will still get substantial votes here.\n\nIn Osun East, Adeleke will benefit greatly from the influence of Francis Fadahunsi, the Senator representing the area, who is a PDP member. Oyetola\u2019s good performance during his first term will give him victory in Osun East.\n\nINEC Chairman Charges Staff on Good Conduct\n\nThe Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu yesterday charged the staff of the Commission to remain neutral and repeat the transparent conduct exhibited in Ekiti State governorship election four weeks ago.\n\nIn a statement he signed, the INEC chairman, said: \u201cExactly 27 days ago, we conducted and concluded the Ekiti Governorship Election that was widely adjudged to be free, fair, credible, and inclusive.\n\n\u201cThe feat was happily an elongation of the earlier successes recorded in Edo and Ondo states on 15th September and 10th October 2020, and in Anambra State on 6th November 2021. The sheer determination, resilience, and competence displayed by all of you, our members of staff, made it possible for the Commission to achieve these lofty goals.\u201d\n\nHe reminded the staff of the commission of the need to maintain the same impartial conduct exhibited in the other states.\n\nYakubu said: \u201cI have assured our stakeholders and the people of Osun State that the Commission will not do anything to the advantage or disadvantage of any political party or candidate. We have made adequate arrangements for the election. We have promised a level playing field for all. The security agencies have assured us of safety.\n\n\u201cThe people of Osun State and Nigerians will understandably hold us to our promise on election day. They will observe our attitude and behaviour from the opening to the closing of polls. They will particularly observe our management of the election results and measure the extent of our adherence to the extant laws through every stage of the electoral process.\n\n\u201cI appeal to you to uphold our Code of Conduct, display your usual sense of commitment and professionalism, remain above board and firmly resist any unethical behaviour. You must also stick to the Oath of Neutrality to which we have all subscribed. I have the confidence in your ability to consolidate on our recent successes.\u201d\n\nPDP Claims APC Planning to Rig Election\n\nThe PDP yesterday alleged an orchestrated plot by the APC \u201cto derail the nascent democratic process by compromising the integrity and sabotaging the will and desire of the people for a free, fair, transparent and credible electoral process\u201d in today\u2019s election in Osun State.\n\nThe party, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba alleged that the APC had accentuated its rigging programme by deploying billions of naira to compromise some security and electoral officers to intimidate voters, manipulate electoral process and inordinately favour Oyetola, against the will of the people.\n\nThe PDP alleged that huge money had been funneled to certain compromised security and INEC officials \u201cto execute this ignoble scheme.\u201d\n\nAccording to the PDP, \u201cthe said INEC and security officials are reported to have been bought over to, among other things, criminally assist and provide cover for APC agents to prosecute a well-oiled vote buying and violence-triggering scheme.\u201d\n\nOlogunagba adds. \u201cOur Party has information on how two prominent APC governors from the South-west, a former APC National Chairman from the South-south, certain federal minister and a particular member of the House of Assembly from Lagos State are coordinating the release of billions of naira to bribe electoral and security officials, as well as fund heavily armed thugs imported from Lagos, Ondo, Ogun and other South-west states to unleash violence and help the APC to rig the election.\u201d\n\nThe PDP said that it had however been made aware that some patriotic INEC and Police officials vehemently rejected the poisonous offer by the APC.\n\nThe PDP called on the IG and Yakubu \u201cto take immediate decisive steps to check the activities of police and INEC officials deployed to Osun State so as to avert a breakdown of Law and Order, especially given the manifest determination of the people of Osun State to resist the APC on its evil scheme.\u201d",
          "summary": "Miss Asogwa Ngozika, the Presiding Officer of the polling unit, said they arrived at the polling unit at 6:30 am.\nBut Olatunji said there was a mixed up in the materials brought to the polling unit as a sticker of another polling unit close to the primary school was pasted on the materials.\n\u201cYour colleagues did it successfully in Ekiti and l believe you will also do us proud here in Osun State.\nFor most of yesterday, tension remained very high across Osun State, with voters bitterly divided among the two leading candidates.\n\u201cThe people of Osun State and Nigerians will understandably hold us to our promise on election day.",

          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Earlier on Friday, many African fintech startups offering virtual dollar card services sent emails to their customers stating that their virtual card service will be unavailable indefinitely starting Saturday, July 16, 2022. Virtual cards are digital replicas of physical bank cards. They are created and stored within digital virtual wallets.\n\nAn email sent to Barter customers by Nigerian-born unicorn Flutterwave read, \u201c\u2026effective Sunday, 17th July 2022, all our Virtual Dollar cards will be unavailable for any transactions and purchases.\u201d The payments giant attributed the reason for this suspension to \u201can update from the company\u2019s card partner\u201d. Barter is a Flutterwave consumer-facing virtual card platform that launched in early 2017.\n\nThis announcement by Flutterwave is bound to affect many other startups who use the company\u2019s white-labeled virtual card service to issue virtual cards to their customers.\n\nOther fintech startups including crypto exchange Busha, Rwanda-headquartered Payday, and Ugandan Eversend also issued similar notices.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear which \u201ccard partner\u201d Flutterwave and the other fintech startups are referring to, but these platforms have issued virtual cards powered by MasterCard and Visa\u2014two leading global card issuers. TechCabal is yet to confirm what exactly happened that led the \u201ccard partner\u201d to take this decision.\n\nIndividuals and businesses in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem affected by the unexpected notifications went on social media to complain about the widespread suspension of virtual card services.\n\n\u201cIt affects us in a big way because all our Facebook ads are connected to our Barter virtual card,\u201d Douglas Kenydson CEO Selar said. \u201cOur Amazon web services (AWS) plan is also connected, and you can\u2019t even afford to miss one payment, or else they\u2019ll take you off.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his other options, Kendyson expressed uncertainty about switching to existing virtual cards by Nigerian banks. He complained about the hassle of changing dollars and potentially dealing with failed card payments.\n\nKendyson\u2019s best alternative is to turn to the virtual card services of Mercury, a San Francisco-based digital bank for startups, that had restricted tens of African startups\u2019 accounts in March.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that this happened in the middle of the month so that whatever payment you need to make, make it,\u201d Kendyson said.\n\nIn the midst of the widespread announcement, startups like Bitmama and Mono took the opportunity to announce that their virtual card services are still up, a reminder that not all fintech startups were affected.\n\nBest in email from @bitmamaexchange \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Today\u2019s guest on Everyday People is someone whose magic you\u2019ve probably experienced at any Burna Boy, Wizkid, or Fireboy DML\u2019s concerts. Without further ado, let\u2019s meet Precious Tawo, freelance sound engineer and production manager. He has worked with firms like Google, IBM, and MultiChoice, and is a die-hard perfectionist, perhaps in recovery. He also runs Decibelz Production Limited, a one-stop-shop for all your audio rental needs.\n\nThere\u2019s this saying my sister made all of us get used to, which is still on my email address now:\n\nGood, better, best.\n\nI will never rest,\n\nUntil my good is better\n\nAnd my better best\n\nWe grew up singing that. We always lived by that mantra.\n\nSo I kept on putting my best into what I was doing. Everybody was interested in sitting on the console, but I was interested in knowing the whole craft.\n\nOn the 20th day [of the Calabar festival], we were doing a sound check in the stadium for the band, and my boss was not on the stage.\n\nSo he said, \u201cPrecious, please go to the console in front and mute the whole Front of House.\u201d\n\nFront of House is basically the mix the engineer mixes for the audience. So I ran there and quickly muted it. And he was shocked. Because he knew that at this point, he had not shown me anything that concerned the board.\n\n\u201cHow did you know how to mute the board?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou this boy! You are a Puma!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how they say it in Yoruba, but he called me Puma because he says I jump. At the end of the festival, I became the first trainee to join the main crew in less than three weeks. I was paid \u20a6230,000 ($1,403)*, which was the highest [amount of] money I had ever received.\n\nPrecious Tawo\u2019s journey into sound engineering\n\nPrecious Tawo\n\nI didn\u2019t choose the path; the path chose me. So sometime after I finished secondary school, I wanted to study marine engineering real bad because I had friends in the marine space.\n\nI even had to wait one year at home for the entrance exam period. And I even went as far as Ibadan [Oyo State, Nigeria] to write for Polaris Marine Academy entrance exam. Then I went to the Maritime Academy in Oron to write the exam.\n\nFortunately, I got admission into the Maritime Academy, Oron, but before it came out, I was already working as a facility manager in a hotel in Calabar [Cross River State, Nigeria] because I just wanted to while away time.\n\nI\u2019m not an idle person. And then I\u2019ve always been someone that\u2019s been independent, and I wanted my little stipend. I got to work in a hotel thanks to my dad\u2019s South African friend \u2014 the manager \u2014 who gave me a job as one of the facility guys.\n\nBecause of how fast I was and everything, I was transferred from the hotel to the event centre, where I worked for over six months. And this was when I wrote the Polaris entrance exam. As at November, I knew full well that my time there was done because I know when it\u2019s time for me to leave somewhere.\n\nI don\u2019t need to pray about it; I feel it in my tummy that it\u2019s time to go, and I leave without a plan, but I always have something all worked out later on. So I felt it was time to leave.\n\nAnd in 2013, the Calabar Festival was very popular. This was something that we normally went to the stadium to watch every December and wish that we were on stage or part of the crew.\n\nAt this point, I had no audio background. The only knowledge I had about audio came in November [2013] when we had the Beer Festival in 520 [Hotel, Calabar], and they wanted to rent equipment worth about \u20a65,000,000 ($31,645)**.\n\nI made the company give me \u20a6700,000 ($4,430)** to buy some equipment, and I was like, \u201cI am gonna make this work.\u201d\n\nAnd I did DJ for the Beer Festival with Virtual DJ on my laptop and saved them over \u20a63,000,000 ($18,987)**. That\u2019s the only thing I knew about audio, which was basically from YouTube; plug this here, plug this there, turn this here, turn this there.\n\nWorking at The Voice in 2021\n\nSo on November 25, 2013, I resigned and told my dad that I would like to work with the crew for the Calabar Festival because he had his friend there.\n\nMy dad was an immigration officer in the Tourism Bureau, so he sorted out the passports for most foreigners working in Calabar. So he had relationships with these guys.\n\nThe production manager then was one of his friends, and he told him his son was interested in working with the guys for the December festival.\n\nI heard they were paying them \u20a6200,000 ($1,255)***. And how much was I earning at my place of work? It was just \u20a618,000 ($113)*** initially, then it went up to \u20a625,000 ($156)***. If I could make \u20a6200,000 a month, it\u2019d actually be better than what I was making in a year or close to what I made in a year if I stayed at the event centre.\n\nI planned to join them only for that month and then use the \u20a6200,000 to start school when results come out in January or February.\n\nOn the first day, I was told to go to the Governor\u2019s office for the interview. I dressed in my nicely starched shirt and trousers, and a nice pair of shoes.\n\nOnly for me to walk into the office and they were like, \u201cOh, you are the Precious. Okay, no problem. Hop into the Hilux; let\u2019s go to the warehouse and show you around.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I going to change?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no. Just come.\u201d\n\nWhen I arrived, they were loading trucks to move the equipment to the studio. This was the 28th of November. And when I got there, I had this whole \u201cbig boy\u201d thingy going on, so seeing boys loading trucks, I was like, \u201cNah, that\u2019s not what I came for; I came for the cool stuff.\u201d\n\nSo they asked me what I wanted to do, and I said, \u201cThe sound department,\u201d because I really loved the whole sound thing. When you went to the Festival, you could hear the speakers pumping from miles away, and I really wanted to be a part of that.\n\nPlus, I had just finished the Beer Festival and wanted something higher than I\u2019d experienced. They introduced me to Aigbovosa Giwa-Osagie, my boss. They took me around and showed me speakers I\u2019d never seen before up close.\n\nThen they introduced me to another person who would be my head.\n\nI was like, \u201cOkay, cool. I\u2019ll resume tomorrow. Nice meeting you guys.\u201d\n\nNext thing, \u201cNo o!. You are resuming now and joining them to load that truck.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, no problem. Easy thing,\u201d I told him.\n\nLuckily, I had a singlet and a pair of jeans in my bag because I was supposed to go somewhere from there. Nice pair of jeans o!\n\nWizkid\u2019s concert\n\nSo, I started loading with the guys. The equipment was very heavy, and there I was, not used to carrying heavy things, seeing young people like me doing it, and told myself I could too.\n\nWe finished loading four trucks after almost four hours and headed to the venue for the Festival\u2019s first event. And I was told to jump into the back of the truck because the Hilux was full.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: senior crew sits in the Hilux, junior crew at the back, and trainees like me sit on the equipment inside the 40-foot truck like the one used to convey cows.\n\nAt first, I was like no way, especially since Calabar is such a small place, but I eventually jumped in. Part of the price you have to pay, you know. At this point, my jeans were gone, and my singlet was like rags.\n\nWe got there, and my boss walked up to me and asked me what audio background I had. And I told him I had none, but the only thing I knew was the entry stuff, but I was willing to learn.\n\nSo when we started setting up, he asked me to go and get the 10 mm ep5 cable. In my head, I was supposed to go and see a cable labelled 10mm ep5.\n\nHe pointed in a direction of over 65 open cases, so I went there straight, and for like 40 minutes, I was searching for the ep5 cable, and I didn\u2019t even know what I was looking for. And then I couldn\u2019t even ask because the way he said it, it was like I was supposed to know the cable.\n\nSo I did not ask, and I didn\u2019t want to look small. After 40 minutes, I went back to him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t find the cable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I see it, what should I do to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want to do, but I can\u2019t find the cable in the box.\u201d\n\nAnd then he asked another guy that had been there for like four years to get the cable for him and take me and show me the cable.\n\nThis guy just opened the case, stretched his hand, and picked up the cable.\n\nMixing in a studio.\n\nYo! It was super embarrassing. And I didn\u2019t like the way everyone was laughing and everything. So I told myself that I was going to know everything in the company, how it works, and I was going to know all their needs.\n\nSo that night, I started downloading the PDF files for the equipment manuals and spent another hour downloading more when I got home at 3:00 a.m. before I slept.\n\nThe next night, since I was just a trainee, I sat in one corner with all the loud music and was just reading stuff, checking stuff, and going behind the Front of House to peep and see what they were doing even though it looked like they were running a spaceship.\n\nAfter the Festival, my boss gave me the opportunity to go to an event in Lagos for IBM computers. Then I also did Love Like a Movie by Darey Art Alade in February 2014, the outdoor version with Kelly Rowland.\n\nLong story short, I kept on growing, going from event to event. I\u2019m a sucker for information, always trying to keep myself updated. People were recommending me because no matter how good you are, you need people to recommend you.\n\nOn February 20 [2014], my mom called me to tell me that the result for the Academy was out, and I passed. My name was announced on NTA [a state-owned broadcasting station]. But, I had no plans to go to school anymore.\n\nThat February, I was also offered a position with the company, but my boss advised me not to take it.\n\nHe said, \u201cEvery week and every day, experts fly in from South Africa and the United States or wherever to come and work in Nigeria. And if you are good at what you do, they\u2019ll fly you from whatever hole you are in to come and do an event.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve worked with different companies and been exposed to various equipment and clients.\n\nAnd I will not put this achievement on one company. If I was working with one company, I\u2019d be stuck with their clients and the kind of events they do. I learn from everybody, and I also like the way I\u2019m being treated like the golden egg.\n\nI love my job. I\u2019ve done stuff for Google, Amazon, IBM, Airtel, MTN, MultiChoice, and The Voice. Presently I\u2019m Burna Boy\u2019s monitor engineer and Fireboy\u2019s Front of House engineer. I\u2019ve mixed for Wizkid\u2019s December concerts, Cardi B, and Davido; any big artiste really.\n\nLearning from mistakes\n\nMixing at Burna Boy\u2019s Dakar concert in 2022\n\nSometime in 2015, we had an event in Eko Atlantic; it was supposed to be the launch for Majestic Voyage and ten minutes before the show, we did the sound check. Everything was sounding all right and I was mixing monitors.\n\nFive minutes to the show, I tapped my screen and it was frozen. I tried restarting the console, but nothing. That meant every artiste who climbed that stage was not going to hear jack!\n\nI felt like the ground should open for me to enter. We tried everything and eventually had to plug my monitors into my boss\u2019 equipment. By this time, the first artiste, Yemi Sax, was already on stage. I had already explained to him and everything but the first three minutes of the show were hell.\n\nI somehow survived the performance and my boss stabilised everything and that\u2019s how we ran the show. Another moment was when I was doing a show at Calabar Cultural Centre, and then we had power issues in the middle of the show and the console went off.\n\nThe show was cancelled and they had to fix another date. I spent four years trying to correct that mistake. I was hard on myself for four years. I\u2019m a perfectionist so I like to give 110%. Eventually, I had to accept that every engineer has bad days.\n\nGiving back\n\nIn line with what I\u2019ve learnt over the years, I decided to try and pass on this knowledge because I found out that, at the end of the day, we have to leave a legacy.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about money to me, my job is like my life right now. And I\u2019ve seen that many engineers have come and gone but there\u2019s nothing anybody can point to that they made. And so I started sharing knowledge at every opportunity I got. If I went to an event, I\u2019d teach the in-house engineer things I knew they would need if they asked politely, of course.\n\nI run a clinic for engineers, although I haven\u2019t done it since 2019. I also have some people I mentor, all so I can give back.\n\n*Average dollar to naira to rates in February 2014.\n\n**Dollar to naira rate in November 2013.\n\n***Average dollar to naira rates in 2013.",

          "title": "Why is Nigeria\u2019s inflation so high?",
          "text": "For the 12 months ending in June, Nigeria\u2019s inflation rate skyrocketed to 18.6 percent, the highest in the past five years, since January 2017 when it was 18.72 percent.\n\nThat was nothing compared to what energy prices did. Fueled by heavy demand and by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, crude oil prices have shot up above $100 in the past six months.\n\nThis has led to an increase in diesel prices which has almost tripled from an average price of N239 in May last year to N671 in the same month this year, while Nigeria\u2019s petrol subsidy payments have totalled N947.53 billion, more than half of 2021 subsidy spending, which was N1.573 trillion.\n\nEven if you toss out food and energy prices\u2014which are notoriously volatile and have driven much of the price spike, core inflation soared 15.75 percent over the past year, the highest since February 2017.\n\nConsumers have endured the pain of everyday routines. In a report released recently by Bloomberg, \u201cThe average cost of an intra-city bus journey in Nigeria increased 46 percent to N582 ($1.39) a trip in May 2022 compared with a year earlier, and flight tickets soared 53 percent over the same period to N55,907\u201d, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s inflation hits18.60% in June, highest in 5 years\n\nAn average price of 1 kg of beans (white, black eye, sold loose) rose on a year-on-year basis by 44.3 percent to N519 in April, same as 500g of bread which increased by 35.31 percent to N451, 1 kg of yam tuber by 42.9 percent within the same comparable periods to N361.2 in April 2022, amongst others.\n\nLast year, the World Bank said that the country\u2019s high inflation rate has pushed more people into poverty. In 2020, the number of poor people increased to 90.1 million in 2021 from 82.9 million, and it is projected to hit 95.1 million in 2022.\n\nInflation has consistently risen since the beginning of the year, from 15.6 percent to 18.6 percent in June, when 18.6 percent was recorded.\n\nThe food inflation rate, which is the major driver of this accelerating inflation rate, increased to 20.6 percent in June from January, when it was 17.13 percent.\n\nWhat caused the spike in inflation?\n\nIn July 2019, just before the borders were shut, the inflation rate stood at 11.08 percent, then it declined to 11.02 percent in August, the month when the border was closed, the lowest in 39 months, but the rate started to spike afterwards.\n\nThen the pandemic paralyzed the economy in 2020, and lockdowns kicked in, businesses closed or cut hours, and consumers stayed home as a health precaution.\n\nRussia\u2019s war with Ukraine, which started in February this year, led to supply shocks in energy and food, which accelerated the inflation rate. The war between the major commodity exporters led to higher prices of commodities such as crude, natural gas, aluminium, nickel, wheat, and other commodities which are soaring to record levels, leaving markets in disarray.\n\nThe price of a litre of diesel skyrocketed to a record high of N600, two weeks into Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, from around N420-N450, as oil prices climbed above $120 a barrel.\n\nIn addition, the average exchange rate in the parallel market is now as high as N610 per dollar against the official exchange rate of N416.08 per dollar. Most importers of food, raw materials, and machinery do not have adequate foreign currency from the official channels; as a result, they access the parallel market at a higher rate, thereby transferring the cost to consumers by increasing the price of their products.\n\nRead also: Video: How to Calculate Your Personal Inflation Rate\n\nLastly, according to the daily \u2018Good Morning Nigeria\u2019 report by FBN Quest, soaring food inflation is a result of Nigeria\u2019s agricultural industry\u2019s insecurity, post-harvest losses, lack of mechanisation, and inadequate infrastructure.\n\nWhat can be done about it?\n\nThe World Bank has advised the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to allow further adjustment of the naira at the official window, to reduce the persistent foreign exchange pressure in the country.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the CBN maintains a complete restriction of FX supply to import about 45 products and firms report limited FX supply availability for other imports.\n\nThe World Bank said that \u201cclarity on exchange rate policy, and transparency in its management, are necessary to attract more significant capital inflows, including foreign direct investments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe benefits of a more effective exchange rate management, with a view towards a unified and market-reflective exchange rate, are more significant than in previous years. Favourable external conditions (oil prices being the highest in nine years) provide an opportunity to adjust the exchange rate reflective of market dynamics, \u201cthe World Bank added.\n\nOn the other hand, the CBN has tried to improve productivity in the agriculture sector by improving credit access through its various intervention schemes, the results have been blunted by rising insecurity, which is the sector\u2019s biggest challenge, the report said.\n\n\u201cThere is a limit to CBN\u2019s intervention to curb inflation as the government is armed with the responsibility of solving insecurity and implementing measures to reduce the cost of production,\u201d said Sesan Adeyeye, equity research analyst, CSL Stockbrokers Limited.",

          "title": "Osun election: Major contenders and their chances",
          "text": "Political parties\u2019 mega rallies have ended. Osun State is set to elect a new governor for the next four years come Saturday.\n\nThe election is one of the off-season gubernatorial elections in the country. According to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), a total of 1, 955,657 registered voters are eligible to participate. Fifteen political parties have presented candidates for the election in all the 30 local government areas of the state.\n\nIn the last few days, there were verbal battles among the candidates as they toured the state to sell their manifestos and themselves to the electorates ahead of the election.\n\nPundits predict that just like in 2018, the contest would remain a two-horse race and a straight contest between People\u2019s Democratic party (PDP) candidate, Ademola Adeleke and incumbent Governor Gboyega Oyetola who is the candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). But a couple of the candidates \u2013 Lasun Yusuf, from the Labour Party and Akin Ogunbiyi, of the Accord party \u2013 have outside chances too.\n\nHere, BusinessDay analyses the chances of the four major candidates in Saturday\u2019s election.\n\nGboyega Oyetola\n\nOyetola, survived a scare on Thursday when the Federal High Court in Abuja, dismissed a suit, seeking to disqualify him from Saturday\u2019s election as the APC\u2019s candidate.\n\nIn 2018, the governor won narrowly, defeating the PDP\u2019s candidate, Adeleke, after a run-off election.\n\nBut Oyetola appears confident based on his achievement in office in the last four years.\n\nOyetola\u2019s supporters have argued that since he assumed office, he has improved infrastructures across the state, while salary payment and welfare of civil servants have improved significantly unlike in the past. They also say his administration has done brilliantly in the education sector in Osun State. Observers say this may work in Oyetola\u2019s favour.\n\nHowever, pundits have warned that his victory may not come easy, they say the situation now is different from 2018.\n\nIn recent years, the APC chapter in the state has been engulfed in crisis and factionalised, with major chieftains dumping the party.\n\nThere is the Ileri group which is loyal to Oyetola, while there is another faction, TOT which supports Rauf Aregbesola.\n\nThe relationship between Oyetola and his predecessor, Aregbesola, the current Minister of Interior has also soured.\n\nDuring the APC governorship primary, Aregbesola backed Moshood Adeoti for the APC gubernatorial ticket. In the last few weeks, efforts to reconcile the leaders have not succeeded.\n\nAregbesola was missing when the APC held a mega rally this week ahead of Saturday\u2019s election, an indication that there is no peace between the two leaders.\n\nOyetola, is however, banking on the support of Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the APC to win.\n\nObservers say the governor will definitely use the incumbency power to his advantage as well as the state apparatus.\n\nPundits predict that he might have challenges in Ede and some local governments dominated by the PDP and disgruntled APC members.\n\nJust like in 2018, Saturday\u2019s election would be marred by the inducement of voters and vote-buying across the state. So, the Governor\u2019s large financial war chest may sway voters to his side.\n\nAdemola Adeleke\n\nAdeleke came into the limelight after the death of his brother, Isiaka Adeleke, who was then a senator and had intended to contest the governorship election before his death.\n\nThe PDP\u2019s candidate is popular with his dancing prowess, just like his nephew, Davido, who is a popular hip-pop artist.\n\nUnlike in 2018, where he was defeated in a run-off, after winning the first round, INEC had said Adeleke\u2019s margin of victory was smaller than the number of cancelled votes in seven polling units.\n\nThe PDP\u2019s candidate is all out on revenge, promising that the situation then is different from now.\n\nHe is hell-bent on reclaiming his mandate this time around. He said he is more prepared for Saturday\u2019s election than in 2018 when Oyetola defeated him.\n\nHe equally boasted recently in a viral video that trended on social media that he had come to the state with dollars and all kinds of foreign currencies.\n\n\u201cOsun people, you are the ones to decide. If it is about money, I have enough. I came with plenty of money. And it is not only naira; I came with dollars, pounds, and euros. This time in Osun, it is fire for fire,\u201d he had said in Yoruba.\n\nHowever, Speaking in a debate organised last week ahead of the election, Adeleke said the dollar comment is not an intention to buy votes, but a figure of speech to describe the foreign investment he intends to bring into Osun State.\n\nHowever, observers fear that the crisis in Osun PDP and even at the national level may affect Adeleke\u2019s chances on Saturday.\n\nCurrently, the PDP in Osun is factionalised, with one camp recognised by the national body and another body backed by Olagunsoye Oyinlola, who is a former governor of the state.\n\nAlthough some PDP leaders and governors have made frantic efforts to reconcile the camps and leaders in the last few days, observers say it may be too late to produce any result.\n\nAdeleke may enjoy sympathy from some electorates, considering the manner the 2018 election ended. Some electorates in the state believe he was cheated and that the APC manipulated the results.\n\nSome electorates have vowed to pay him for it this time around.\n\nPundits predict he will garner more votes from Osun West, where he comes from and the Osogbo metropolis. They say, few part of Osun-East may vote PDP because of the imbroglio going on between Aregbesola and Omisore camp in the Senatorial District.\n\nLasun Yusuf\n\nYusuf, the candidate of the Labour Party, is a grassroots politician who has worked closely with notable political leaders in the state.\n\nHe was a former deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, representing the Irepodun/Olorunda/Osogbo/Orolu Federal Constituency.\n\nYusuf was once a youth leader in the Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) and a former state public relations officer of the Alliance for Democracy (AD) before and during Bisi Akande\u2019s administration.\n\nWith his undiluted loyalty, the role played in AD and his doggedness in the political cycle in the state, Oyinlola appointed him chairman of Osun State Capital Territory Development Authority (OSCTDA) in 2004.\n\nThis is the first time Yusuf would be contesting the gubernatorial election.\n\nHe defected to the Labour Party after he was defeated in the APC primaries, where he placed third.\n\nPundits predict Yusuf may enjoy sympathy votes from people of his local government and three others close to his local government.\n\nHowever, his ability to get votes in Osun-East is not clear, but he will play a spoiler role for the APC in his Senatorial District.\n\nIn his manifesto, Yusuf promised to focus on subsidising education, farming, infrastructure, health and exploitation of mineral resources for the benefit of the citizens.\n\n\u201cI want to urge our party members to work for my victory because power is not shared freely.\n\n\u201cAny politician that is contemplating rigging elections at this time, especially after the EndSARS protest, is taking too much a risk and such politicians are heading for doom\u201d, he said.\n\nRead also: Osun 2022: NSCDC deploys 11,226 officers for guber poll\n\nAkin Ogunbiyi\n\nAlthough not ranked among the top contenders, the Accord Party candidate, Akin Ogunbiyi, is not entirely new in the Osun gubernatorial race.\n\nOgunbiyi, a businessman, is the chairman of Mutual Benefits Assurance PLC.\n\nIn 2018, he narrowly lost the gubernatorial ticket of the PDP to Ademola Adeleke but decided to support him for the election.\n\nHe defected to the Accord Party after complaining of unfair treatment in the PDP. He had said he could not realise his ambition at the party.\n\nHowever, observers say he may not spring any surprise in Saturday\u2019s election. It is predicted that Ogunbiyi may just step down before Saturday\u2019s election for a more popular candidate.\n\nSpeaking recently, Ogunbiyi said his key areas of focus are education, industrialisation, agriculture, youths and sports, health and empowerment.\n\nHe promised to give free and compulsory primary education.\n\n\u201cWe are going to employ teachers and train them. I know the Bible says every labourer deserves his wages. We are going to industrialise Osun state. I also plan to have free health care for children, pregnant women and people above 60years,\u201d Ogunbiyi said.\n\n\u201cWe have not had leadership that can put the necessary structure in place and ensure the state gets its due; it is like people are only concerned about their pockets.\n\n\u201cThere is illegal mining going on in Osun on a daily basis, a common patrimony that few people are carting away illegally\u201d.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe National Centre of the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW) has engaged with the Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in the fight against illicit arms proliferation in Nigeria.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that NCCSALW on Thursday gathered a number of local and international CSOs in Abuja to address the issue of arms proliferation in the country.\n\nThe National Security Adviser (NSA), retired Maj.-Gen. Babagana Monguno said the event was part of many multilateral engagements that the government intended to pursue with all stakeholders.\n\nHe said this was in its bid to secure Nigeria from the menace of illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW).\n\nMonguno was represented by his Special Assistant, Special Duties, Amb. Ahmed Muhammed.\n\nHe said the proliferation of SALW in many regions of West Africa had been a matter of grave concern to countries and regional organisations alike for decades.\n\nMonguno said proliferation of illicit arms had become a major source of insecurity in the society, saying it had fueled violent conflict, crime and terrorism.\n\nAccording to him, it requires no emphasis that the uncontrolled availability of SALW, especially the illicit ones, have continued to undermine global peace and significantly hinder development.\n\nHe said the threat and the use of SALW had been directly responsible for much of the untold human suffering in the society.\n\nAccording to him, it is important to emphasise that these weapons themselves do not cause conflict.\n\n\u201cRather, it is the easy access to them and the simplicity of their use that make violence more lethal and conflicts more protracted.\n\n\u201cTherefore, SALW have become weapons of choice for criminals, terrorists and bandits in Nigeria and beyond, posing a significant challenge to the country, especially in the wake of insecurity that has recently engulfed the Sahel Region.\n\n\u201cHence the need to stop the proliferation of these deadly weapons,\u201d he said.\n\nMonguno said it was on the backdrop of the proliferation of weapons and its attendant consequences that President Muhammadu Buhari authorised the establishment of the centre.\n\nHe said the centre was established to serve as the institutional platform to stem the proliferation of small arms within the framework of the various international protocols and instruments to which Nigeria was committed.\n\nAccording to him, the president has further demonstrated Nigeria\u2019s commitment to the provisions of Article 24 of the ECOWAS Convention on SALW.\n\n\u201cWhich requires each member state to establish national institutions to promote a multilateral approach to stamping out illicit arms trade in the Sub-region.\n\n\u201cThe efforts towards eradicating illicit arms globally is one that has involved all stakeholders including the international and regional community, nations, states and most importantly, the civil society.\n\n\u201cIn spite of our best efforts, it has become apparent that West Africa and indeed the global community are losing the war to transnational organised criminal networks, terrorist groups, domestic criminal elements and weapons manufacturers,\u201d Monguno said.\n\nThe NSA said the activities of arms manufacturers to keep the security space awash with illicit small arms and light weapons must not be allowed to continue.\n\nHe said numerous studies conducted by Small Arms Survey, OXFAM and SBM Intelligence suggested that Nigeria currently account for about 60 to 70 per cent of the 10 million illicit weapons believed to be in West Africa.\n\nAccording to him, this has already manifested as evidenced in the level of armed violence witnessed across Nigeria.\n\nHe, therefore, called for the support of CSOs for the government\u2019s avowed commitment to rid the society of illicit weapons.\n\nHe commended the centre for its efforts in ridding the nation of illicit small arms and light weapons.\n\nThe National Coordinator, NCCSALW, retired Maj.-Gen. Abba Dikko, said the engagement with the theme: \u201cHarnessing the Capacities of the Civil Society towards Promoting an Illicit Arms-free Society in Nigeria\u201d was the second since the establishment of the centre.\n\nDikko said the proliferation of SALW had negatively impacted peace, security and socio-economic wellbeing of the nation.\n\nHe said that illicit arms proliferation had remained a key driver for terrorism, ethno-religious conflicts, violent separatism and sundry organised criminal activities within and across borders.\n\nAccording to him, it is also common knowledge that Nigeria has borne the brunt of the instability in the Sahel region occasioned by the push-and-pull effect of arms trafficking.\n\n\u201cConsequently, Nigeria has closed ranks with her neighbours, ECOWAS and other international stakeholders over the years to eradicate illicit SALW in the hands of unauthorised persons or at least, halt their proliferation.\n\n\u201cEven though the progress made in this area has remained a subject of debate, Nigeria has continued to tackle the challenge head-on.\u2019\u2019\n\nDikko said the centre had made giant strides within the short time frame of its establishment to achieve full operationalisation with the establishment of regional offices in six geopolitical zones.\n\n\u201cThe operationalisation of the centre has focused on discharging its core function of providing a strategic platform for arms control in Nigeria through close partnership with stakeholders, especially the civil society, both locally and internationally.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said the meeting would seek to solicit CSOs support in implementation of the various government initiatives and programmes that the centre would roll out in due course, especially commencing grassroots engagements through the zonal offices.

Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu, while constituting a task force to enforce the clampdown at the Government House, Benin City, charged owners and operators of unregistered vehicles in the state to register such vehicles on or before 31st July, 2022 to avoid prosecution.\n\nThe acting governor said the directive became imperative following the need to sustain security in the state, noting that recent security findings have revealed how criminal elements operate in the state using unregistered vehicles.\n\nThe task force is headed by the Commissioner for Transportation, Osasere Evbuomwan, while the Commissioner for Local Government, Monday Osaigbovo is a member. Other members of the committee are drawn from the Edo State Internal Generated Revenue Service (EIRS), Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), the Edo Public Works Volunteers (PUWOV), and the Nigerian Police.\n\nShaibu said, \u201cAll motorcycles, tricycles, and vehicles, both private and commercial, especially Toyota Yaris, must be registered in the state. We are giving them till July 31, 2022, to register as any vehicle that is not registered will be seized.\n\n\u201cWe urge them to comply or face the consequences of disobeying government directives. We want to ensure that these vehicles are providing legal services in the state as our findings have shown that some of these people provide illegal services with their vehicles.\u201d\n\nThe acting governor added, \u201cThe Edo State Government is working to ensure a peaceful and safe state for our people. We are dealing with security issues in our state. We want to clear our state of criminal elements.\u201d\n\nWarning that violators of the government\u2019s directive will be prosecuted in accordance with the state\u2019s extant laws, Shaibu noted, \u201cThe registration will help us to also guarantee the safety of your vehicles as the particulars of the vehicles and plate numbers will be used to trace such a missing vehicle.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cIf you want a safe Edo State, please register your vehicles. We urge cart pushers in the state not to allow themselves to be used for criminal activities or else they will be made to face the full wrath of the law. Let me also reiterate that the ban on motorcycles within the Benin metropolis still remains.\n\n\u201cVehicle owners must carry out a background check before giving their vehicles to drivers because any vehicle whose driver is caught using such a vehicle for kidnapping or any other criminal activity, such vehicle owners will be arrested along with the drivers and they will be duly prosecuted.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n...",

I have monitored the fight against corruption in Africa and I can see both successes and drawbacks.\n\n\u201dThe battle must continue for the sake of the continent and its people no matter the difficulties.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, the fight against corruption has been vigorous since 2015. A lot has been achieved in the areas of arrest, prosecution, conviction, asset recovery and anti-corruption laws.\n\n\u201cI must admit that the fight has not been a bed of roses. Truly, a lot of more work in many fronts is required.\n\n\u201dFor example, civil and public servants must be ethical and professional at all times. The private sector must contribute in curving corruption. The international community needs to close safe havens.\n\n\u201dThe judiciary requires more impetus. Perhaps, an International Anti-corruption Criminal Court is needed,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari said family and religious values would have to be upgraded, and schools have a lot of work to do for a better society.\n\n\u201cI am extremely delighted to address the participants as we celebrate the Africa Day of Anti-Corruption. Distinguished participants, we have come a long way in the fight against corruption in Nigeria and Africa in general.\n\n\u201cMay I use this opportunity to appreciate fellow African leaders for their individual and collective efforts in fighting corruption on our continent. I appreciate all of you for the confidence reposed in me being the Africa Champion on Anti-Corruption.\n\n\u201cI understand that the theme for 2022 is \u2018Strategy and Mechanisms for the Transparent Management of Covid-19 Funds, Lessons from the Pandemic.\u2019 In Nigeria.\n\n\u201dWe responded to the Covid-19 Pandemic swiftly and having tamed it, we have realized the need for more awareness campaigns on health issues and more investment in the health sector.\n\n\u201dAgain, service delivery requires checkmating corruption,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, African leaders must get rid of corruption in Africa if the continent is to realize its full potentials.\n\n\u201cI have come to realize that nations in Africa have to ensure that national resources are not taken to safe havens around the world and we must curtail Illicit Financial Flows in all its ramifications.\n\n\u201dAlso, we must work collectively to recover all resources taken abroad. We must show looters that crime does not pay by depriving them of the proceeds of their crime.\n\n\u201dAlso, elite greed and irresponsibility must be eradicated in Africa. Again, ethics, decency, decorum and respect for rule of law must be promoted in Africa.\n\n\u201dIt is important to develop strategies for behavioral change in Africa if corruption is to be tamed. This will ensure that national resources are allowed to serve the population and not a tiny few,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said anti-corruption agencies must be empowered and allowed to deliver on their mandates.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, I am very proud of our Anti-Corruption Agencies, our law enforcement agencies and our regulatory bodies for their efforts at checking criminality including corruption.\n\n\u201dI very deeply appreciate them for their sacrifices,\u201d the President said.\n\nBuhari noted that the fight against corruption must be sustained for the benefit of present and future generations.\n\n\u201cOur youths have no place to go and live with dignity but in Africa. As I am leaving office next year, I am proud to leave behind a legacy of fighting corruption among others.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I abhor corruption and I will render my best in or out office to get rid of corruption in Nigeria and Africa in general.\n\n\u201dI urge our youths to join me in this noble cause,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged African leaders to work together at whatever level to get rid of corruption in Africa, adding \u201cposterity will judge us right if we deal with corruption as appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe president said it was imperative to kill corruption in Nigeria and Africa.\n\n\u201cIt will give our citizens a better life,\u201d he said.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) July 11 marks the day the African Union (AU) adopted the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combatting Corruption (AUCPCC) in Maputo, Mozambique on 11 July 2003.\n\nNAN reports that on the day, Africans pause to reflect on anti-corruption progress in their communities, what is working, what is not, and what remains to be tried.\n\nThe Convention came into force in 2006.\n\nAs of August 2021, the Convention has been ratified by 44 Member States of the African Union.\n\nThe Anti-Corruption Day also helps Africa\u2019s anti-corruption fighters share good lessons and practices. Asset recovery efforts are paying off in some member states.\n\nNAN also reports that on June 21, Buhari said around 386 million dollars was recovered in 2021 through the whistleblowing policy enacted by his administration in an attempt to repatriate looted funds back into the country and curb corruption.\n\nThe president made this known in an interview with Bloomberg on the performance of his administration in the area of economic growth, security, and corruption since 2015 when he was elected president.\n\nHe said through the whistleblowing policy, established in the first year of his government, hundreds of millions in stolen funds have been returned to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs an illustration, monetary recoveries (January-December) 2021 show that more [than] N152 billion has been recovered.\n\n\u201dDollar recoveries for the year amount to over USD 386 million; GBP, more than 1.1 million; Euro, about 157,000; Saudi Riyals about 1.7 million some more in Digital and other currencies,\u201d Buhari said.

          "title": "Why Peter Obi may become president in 2023 by default, By Farooq Kperogi",
          "text": "Facts I have uncovered from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) show that Labour Party\u2019s Peter Obi may become Nigeria\u2019s president next year by default because Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar, candidates for the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) respectively, have violated the Electoral Act 2022, which may cause them to be disqualified if Obi sues them.\n\nThe Electoral Act 2022 requires political parties to notify INEC of their intent to conduct primary elections at least 21 days before the date of their convention. It also requires parties to submit their membership registers to it at least 30 days before their primary election. The APC didn\u2019t meet the first requirement and the PDP failed the second requirement. The Labour Party met both.\n\nDocuments an INEC insider shared with me show that the APC didn\u2019t notify INEC of its intent to conduct its primary election 21 days before its convention. Section 82 of the Electoral Acts says the penalty for this infraction is outright disqualification of the candidates of political parties.\n\nSection 82 (1) of the Electoral Act 2022 says, \u201cEvery political party shall give the Commission at least 21 days\u2019 notice of any convention, congress, conference, or meeting which is convened for the purpose of \u2018merger\u2019 and electing members of its executive committees, other governing bodies or nominating candidates for any of the positions specified under this Act.\u201d\n\nSubsection (5) then says, \u201cFailure of a political party to notify the Commission as stated in subsection (1) shall render the convention, congress, conference, or meeting invalid.\u201d An invalid convention can\u2019t produce a valid candidate.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at how the APC, the PDP, and the Labour Party fared in their observance of this requirement of the Electoral Act.\n\nRecords at INEC show that the APC notified INEC of its intent to hold its convention on May 23, 2022 (before INEC granted it an unfair extension, which other parties also benefited from) and held its convention on June 8. That\u2019s just 17 days\u2019 notice, which falls short of the 21 days\u2019 notice the Electoral Act 2022 requires.\n\nBased on its May 23 letter to INEC of its schedule of primaries, the APC\u2019s June 8 primary election is invalid in the eye of the Electoral Act 2022, and Bola Tinubu may be disqualified if he\u2019s sued.\n\nUnlike the APC, however, the PDP did give INEC more than 21 days\u2019 notice prior to the conduct of its presidential primaries. It notified INEC of its intention to conduct its primary election on May 4 and conducted its primary election on May 28. That\u2019s about 25 days\u2019 notice, which puts it in the clear on this provision.\n\nThe Labour Party, like the PDP, complied with the requirements of Section 82(1) of the Electoral Act 2022. It notified INEC of its intent to conduct its primaries on March 9, 2022, and held its convention on May 30. That\u2019s more than 80 days\u2019 notice.\n\nThen Section 77 (2) of the Electoral Act 2022 mandates political parties to submit their membership registers to INEC at least 30 days before the conduct of their primary elections.\n\nIt says, \u201cEvery political party shall maintain a register of its members in both hard and soft copy.\u201d Subsection 3 also says, \u201cEach political party shall make such register available to the Commission not later than 30 days before the date fixed for the party primaries, congresses or convention.\u201d\n\nThe penalty for failure to abide by this provision of the Electoral Act is exclusion from participation in elections of the candidates of the political parties that infract the provision. Section 84 (13) Electoral Act 2022 says, \u201cWhere a political party fails to comply with the provisions of this Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate for that election shall not be included in that election for the particular position in issue.\u201d\n\nNow, let\u2019s see how the APC, the PDP, and the Labour Party fared in this provision of the Electoral Act.\n\nThe APC submitted its membership register to INEC on April 25 and conducted its primary election on June 8. That\u2019s clearly more than 30 days. So, it\u2019s in the clear here.\n\nBut the PDP fell afoul of Section (3) of the Electoral Act 2022. Although an INEC document titled \u201cTable of Submission by 18 Political Parties\u201d shows that the PDP submitted its membership register to INEC on April 29, which would make it exactly 30 days since it conducted its convention on May 28, the PDP\u2019s series of correspondence with INEC that an insider shared with me indicates that the party submitted its register in four installments, with the earliest being May 3. May 3 to May 28 is less than 30 days.\n\nThe last correspondence the PDP had with INEC over its membership register is dated May 18. So, technically, the PDP didn\u2019t turn in its complete membership register to INEC until May 18. The Electoral Act makes no provision for a bit-by-bit submission of membership register.\n\nThe Labour Party abided by this provision of the Electoral Act. It submitted its membership register to INEC on April 25, which is more than 30 days before its convention, which was held on May 30.\n\nUnfortunately, INEC erred in not notifying the APC and the PDP that their primary elections\u2014and their candidates for election\u2014 were invalid because they flouted the Electoral Act. INEC erred even further by going ahead to publish the names of people who emerged from invalid primaries even when the Electoral Act mandates it to not include the names of candidates who run afoul of the Electoral Act.\n\nSection 29 (1) of the Electoral Act 2022 says, \u201cEvery political party shall, not later than 180 days before the date appointed for a general election under this Act, submit to the Commission, in the prescribed Forms, the list of the candidates the party proposes to sponsor at the elections, who must have emerged from valid primaries conducted by the political party.\u201d\n\nSubsection 3 says, \u201cThe Commission shall, within seven days of receipt of the personal particulars of the candidates, publish same in the constituency where the candidate intends to contest the election.\u201d\n\nAs I have shown, the candidates for both the APC and the PDP did not emerge \u201cfrom valid primaries\u201d because they contravened significant provisions of the Electoral Act that rendered their elections void. Yet INEC went ahead to publish the particulars of candidates for president and the National Assembly on June 24.\n\nIn other words, even INEC is in violation of the Electoral Act 2022, and this isn\u2019t the first time it is. In its entanglements with the Ahmed Lawan and Godswill Akpabio senatorial nomination fraud, INEC also refused to exercise its power of rejection.\n\nSection 84 subsection 13 of the Electoral Act 2022 empowers INEC to write to political parties and alert them to the fact that the names they sent to it were inconsistent with the reports of the primary elections monitored by its staff. Had INEC done this, it would have obviated the need for litigation by candidates who have been shortchanged by their parties.\n\nIn response to an explosive and credible July 8 Sahara Reporters story (with which I was familiar days before Sahara Reporters published it) titled \u201cNigerian Electoral Body, INEC Succumbs to Pressure from Ruling APC to recognize Senate President Lawan as Yobe Senatorial Candidate, Moves to Destroy Electoral Commissioner\u2019s Report,\u201d INEC\u2019s Festus Okoye issued a statement where he, among other things, claimed that INEC stood by the reports of its state monitors.\n\nThat was obviously not exactly true. One, if INEC did, it would have rejected names sent to it that were at variance with the names their staff recorded and certified. Second, the INEC headquarters in Abuja would not have denied Resident Electoral Commissioners the power to issue Certified True Copies (CTC) of primary elections. CTCs are centralized to Abuja creating needless bottlenecks in the process because, an INEC insider told me, it\u2019s a conduit for corruption.\n\nAnyway, section 285 of the constitution (4th alteration, no. 21) empowers any \u201caspirant who complains that any of the provisions of the Electoral Act\u201d has been violated to seek redress in a court of law. Subsection b specifically confers the right on aspirants to sue if INEC violates the Electoral Act, which it serially has, \u201cin respect of the selection or nomination of candidates and participation in an election.\u201d\n\nSubsection C extends that right to political parties. The Electoral Act itself gives candidates and political parties the right to sue to seek redress if the law has been violated.\n\nSo, if either the APC\u2019s Bola Tinubu or the PDP\u2019s Atiku Abubakar wins the 2023 election, their victory would be invalidated by the courts, and Labour Party\u2019s Peter Obi may be declared president by default since he is likely to be in the top three performers in the presidential contest.\n\nOf course, either Peter Obi or the Labour Party has to sue first for this to happen. And, although the invalidation of Tinubu\u2019s and Atiku\u2019s candidature by the court is a slam dunk, neither INEC, which should supply the evidence, nor the judiciary, which will give the judgement, is reliable. But the evidence is reliably strong.\n\nThere will also clearly be legal disputations about dates since the parties wrote to INEC on the same issue on several dates. But a lawyer called my attention to the Supreme Court\u2019s July 5, 2019 ruling in the case of Garba v APC [2020] 2 NWLR (Pt.1708)345 at 360 where it excluded the date the cause of an action arose. It ruled:\n\n\u201cFrom the passage I have reproduced above (that is the Appellant\u2019s originating summons)\u2026I am satisfied that the cause of action occurred on the 7th of October, 2018. The appellant\u2019s suit was filed on the 29th of October, 2018, 22 days (excluding the 7th October) after the conduct of the primary election. Clearly, the action was filed outside the prescribed period and it is therefore statute-barred.\u201d\n\nSo, there\u2019s plausible cause to invalidate the nominations of the APC\u2019s and PDP\u2019s candidates.\n\nFarooq A.

          "text": "Nigerian superstar musician, Adekunle Kosoko, also known well as Adekunle Gold has shared an emotional story about the struggles he had with his health growing up.\n\nThe \u201cHigh\u201d crooner, in a lengthy letter to his fans disclosed that he was much younger he struggled with his health as he was born with sickle cell anaemia.\n\n\u201cIt feels liberating to finally be able to share this part of my life with you, to finally be able to speak my truth.\n\nWhen I talk about how I struggled to get to where I am today, I need you to know that my struggle was real.\n\nI was born with sickle cell disease. It was life and death, it was physical, mental, financial, you name it and I went through it all. It was tough, painful and frustrating. I lived with a sickness no one around me understood, I lived with restrictions all my childhood. I wasn\u2019t able to join some of the most minor child play and liberating activities like going out in the rain.\n\nThe times when I insisted and rebelled against my parents orders and went out in the rain, I would end up having a crisis.\n\nThe nights were painful and lonely, nights that no one could help me get through. It was just me, God and my mind. The pains and shivers were unbearable.\n\nThey always came in the night, when my family had no means to transport me to a hospital. We simply couldn\u2019t afford the constant hospital bills so I had no choice but to endure the pain.\n\nMy mum wanted me to be well, she did her best. She took me to all the churches she could find, I\u2019m grateful for her because she saw a future for me.\n\nA future where no illness or sickness could hold me back from my purpose. From the life I was destined to live.\n\nSickle cell disease took away my freedom, my childhood. I lost friends, a lot of them. Some didn\u2019t understand the restrictions and rules I had to live by, some just didn\u2019t want to deal with my Illness or thought it was a nasty or contagious disease that they could catch. I was a burden for some. Living with sickle cell is far from living a normal life.\n\nOne of the most intense crisis I had was at the age of 20, I remember laying in my bed in the middle of the night asking for an end to it all. I begged God to take my life away because I couldn\u2019t understand what I did to deserve the pain my body and mind was under. As usual with sickle crisis after some days, the pain subsided and God asked me; \u201cThat end you begged me for, do you still want it?\u201d Of course I said no and that\u2019s when everything changed for me. That\u2019s when I realised that I had been given another opportunity to live my dreams and to show those that mocked me that sickle cell anemia was never going to end me, that it was never going to hold me back from my dreams and aspirations.\n\nMy body caves in once in a while, some symptoms come back but what this disease has taught me is resilience. Sickle cell anemia gave me hope, made me tough, gave me the discipline I needed to be who I am today, built my character. I mean I went through a whole 5 weeks of back to back performances and didn\u2019t fall sick. Grace.\n\nMy mind and body were challenged and I\u2019m stronger, more determined and ready to take on the world. I\u2019m ready for Adekunle Gold Supremacy, I\u2019m ready to live and enjoy the 5 Star life that I deserve, that my body toiled for.\n\nI\u2019m sharing my testimony with you because I hope that you can find strength in my truth.\n\nSome ailments hold us back but I\u2019m thankful this hasn\u2019t. I want to encourage you in whatever it is you\u2019re going through, know that there is hope. You are strong and you must not give up. YOU CAN DO THIS!\n\nVictory lies at the end for you just as it did for me.\n\nIf you know anyone going through any struggle, physical, health, mental. Be kind, show compassion. In fact be kind to everyone, you just never know what they\u2019re dealing with privately. Be supportive, be gentle and love endlessly.\n\nIf you are a sickler, know that the disease does not define you. Don\u2019t allow it to limit your dreams or cap your potential. Spread your wings and dream big! Hope to see you soaring the big skies.\u201d He said.",

          "text": "By Onu Okorie\n\nIn Nigeria today, when agents of transformations in the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari are being counted, the Director General of Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, Mr. Lamido Yuguda will definitely standout, if the numerous reforms he has introduced is anything to go by.\n\nIn less than two years after assuming office the SEC management under Mr. Yuguda has not only set strategic goals but also continued to expand the frontiers of investment space thereby attracting improved local and foreign direct investment, FDIs into the economy through innovative regulatory guidelines and collaboration with other relevant institutions.\n\nFor instance, on market-wide issues, the Commission has drafted and presented an amendment to ISA Bill to the National Assembly as part of its efforts to enhance the regulatory framework of the Nigerian capital market, lead to the introduction of new products into the market, and increase the effectiveness of the Investments and Securities Tribunal, amongst other benefits to ensure that the provisions of the Bill represent realities in the nation\u2019s investment climate.\n\nAlso, the Commission is collaborating with National Assembly Business Environment Roundtable NASSBER to prepare a roadmap towards passage of the Bill within the shortest time frame.\n\nAlso, the Yuguda-led executive management team has been implementing capital market development goals set out in the Capital Market Master Plan (CMMP) (2015-2025) and successfully completed the review of CMMP to realign the initiatives/deliverables to prevailing market conditions and keep the document relevant in the dynamic capital market due to issues related to Fintech, sustainability and regional integration.\n\nTo resolve legacy issues of Identity Management which is a crucial driver in improving market participation and solving unclaimed dividends and related problems, the management also inaugurated a market-wide Identity Management Committee with mandate to harmonize the various databases of investors in Nigerian capital market, facilitate data accuracy in the market, mitigate fraud, improve KYC requirements and manage AML/CFT risks, among others.\n\nThe report of the committee is expected to resolve issues that have hindered growth of the Market, hampered investor confidence, and matters that serve as barriers to entry for potential investors, amongst other benefits.\n\nOn primary market activities, the Yuguda-led executive management of the SEC has also in the past two years approved 41 new equities issues valued at N656.9 billion, 37 bonds valued at N776.2 billion, 28 applications for shelf programmes valued at N2.5 trillion and 21 Exchange Traded Derivatives Contracts.\n\nThis is even as it processed six Schemes of Merger, seven Acquisitions, 21 Corporate Restructurings, and three Takeovers during the period. It also ensured that over N11 billions of untraceable shareholders\u2019 funds from Schemes of Arrangement in the custody of Registrars were transferred to the National Investor Protection Fund NIPF.\n\nAs part of the process of improving time to market of transactions and fast tracking the review process, the Commission conducted training for issuing houses to help improve the quality of applications submitted.\n\nSimilarly, Commission also recorded a landmark achievement on the first electronic offering with combined feature of book building to Qualified Institutions and use of the price discovered from book-build for sales to Retail Investors. It also granted approval for the first 21 derivatives contracts which had seven and 14 different contracts from both the NGX and FMDQ Exchanges respectively in the past two years.\n\nOn Collective Investment Scheme CIS, the Yuguda-led management has also, following completion of series of monitoring and evaluation processes, commenced implementation of 100 per cent custody requirement in the CIS sector to protect investors. As a result, all clients\u2019 assets currently managed under discretionary and non-discretionary mandates are to be held under independent custodial agreements in custodial banks.\n\nThe Commission has also recorded remarkable milestones in its secondary market activities in the past years with successful demutualization of the Nigerian Exchange Limited NGX which investment analysts see as milestone in the development of Nigerian capital market.\n\nThis is even as the management collaborated with University of Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Alternative Finance, UK for the training of its select employees on a certified course on Fintech & Regulatory Innovation, to enhance the Commission\u2019s capacity in regulating Fintech.\n\nAlso, it collaborated with the World Bank to commission a Fintech Scoping project and held collaborative engagements with 15 International and local Fintech stakeholders to guide the Commission on its Fintech policies.\n\nThe Regulatory Incubation Guidelines to operationalize provisional regulation for aspiring Fintech firms were released within the period. In furtherance of its market regulation roles, management of the Commission was able to ascertain the quantum of unclaimed dividends of publicly traded companies that fall within the categories eligible to be borrowed by the Federal Government.\n\nThis amounted to N56, 584,795,648.71 and $8,153,118.41 respectively. In addition, it also facilitated the transfer into the SEC/CNB NIPF Account of N2.3 billion in excess of return monies and N11.4 billion in Schemes consideration money, both of which had previously been held in the custody of the Registrars.\n\nOn the pesky issue of Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing Of Terrorism AML/CFT, following the GIABA Mutual Evaluation of Nigeria, the Yuguda-led executive management had made concerted efforts in the capital market to meet both the GIABA Mutual Evaluation Report MER Follow-Up Process and the FATF International Cooperation Review Group ICRG requirements in order to avoid Nigeria being placed on the FATF public grey list at the Plenary when the grace period expires in October, 2022.\n\nFor instance, following the MER findings that Nigeria had several important deficiencies in its AML/CFT/CPF system in relation to Technical Compliance, and that its effectiveness controls were insufficient to mitigate its high ML/TF/PF risks, the Commission championed the amendments of Rules and Regulations of the Virtual Asset Service providers; the sector specific regulations to repeal the 2013 SEC AML/CFT Regulations and enactment of the 2022 AML/CFT Regulations; the SEC AML/CFT RBS Framework.\n\nThese new rules and amendments were done in order to address Nigeria\u2019s MER deficiencies and broaden the scope of preventive measures available to VASPs. In furtherance of its regulatory mandate, the Commission conducted investigations into complaints by investors and out of the 250 complaints brought forward into the period, 182 were resolved.\n\nAlso, out of the 58 complaints in relation to Ponzi schemes received, 45 were resolved.

          "title": "Nigeria Overcame Recessions with Bespoke Policies, Says Emefiele, as Inflation Hits 5-Year High \u2013 Arise News",
          "text": "The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, on Friday said with the rising global trend of digital economy, the Monetary Policy Committee is expected to chart a new direction for the Nigerian economy.\n\nHe said this in his opening remarks at the 2022 retreat of the MPC held in Lagos, where members convened to discuss \u201cMonetary Policy Implementation in a Digitally-Evolving Developing Economy.\u201d\n\nOn the same day, it emerged that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures the rate of change in prices of goods and services, surged to 18.60 per cent in June 2022, up from 17.71 per cent in the previous month, the highest since January 2017.\n\nEmefiele noted that in the last eight and a half years, the CBN had done bespoke monetary policies, which had seen Nigeria overcome recession twice in four years.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe evolution of FinTechs, cryptocurrencies, digital payments, artificial intelligence and machine learning, have changed the functioning of the financial and banking sectors, both globally and domestically. Therefore, the urgent call for the need to rethink financial system regulation, supervision and monetary policy implementation.\n\n\u201cWhile the innovations come with a lot of risks and uncertainties for the sectors, they also have many benefits for positive economic transformation and particularly, financial inclusion which has been the principal catalyst for inclusive growth, poverty reduction and employment generation.\n\n\u201cWe have seen what is happening in the global economy and we are going to be addressing those issues and see if we can chart a new course and what next we should do in the coming years to see to it that we provide monetary policy direction for the Nigerian economy. So, we would be expecting new ideas, new strategies on monetary policy in a digitised global economy, what we are going to be doing in light of the challenges posed by fintech, cryptocurrencies agents globally and what direction to take.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that after this meeting, we would see a new improved monetary policy and a new and improved CBN that would provide direction for monetary policy in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn how Nigeria overcame recession twice in four years, he said: \u201cWhile the Nigerian economy has been engulfed with many crisis, just like many other countries of the world, we have been able to relatively withstand the storm overcoming two recessions within four years and have performed far better than many of our peers, courtesy of our bespoke, homegrown and ingenious approach of adopting well thought-out and home-grown policy measures aimed at addressing our macroeconomic challenges.\n\n\u201cMonetary policy has been severely challenged, as its policy space narrowed significantly, in some cases, paradoxically and necessitating the need to rethink monetary policy in the context of emerging challenges and economic transformation.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he noted that digital financial services created 95 million job opportunities and boosted the GDP of emerging economies by 6 per cent and that digital finance supports greater financial inclusion by making possible the extension of financial services to non-financial sectors, and to individuals with minimal access to smart electronic devices.\n\n\u201cThe central banking and monetary policy relevance in the digital ecosystem are sometimes challenged as the regulatory oversight functions are largely eroded or weakened by impotency of traditional tools in carrying out those functions.\n\n\u201cIn order to ensure the relevance of monetary policy and the role of monetary authorities in the new digital world, MPC members must embrace advanced level understanding of the interplay of digitalisation with monetary policy objectives, targets and tools.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Deputy Governor Economic Policy Directorate, Mr. Kingsley Obiora reiterated the importance of policies suitable for the global digital economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cA global payment report for 2021 showed that last year was the first-time payments by digital wallets preceded payments by cash worldwide and the data shows that only 13 per cent of payment would now be moved by cash.\n\n\u201cAnother trend globally is the explosion of the electronic and digital trends themselves. And lastly, the rise of digital currencies. These trends and movements that we are seeing are the main reasons why it is important for a retreat by the MPC to discuss how we would respond to these changes. We have to respond so we can make policies that would affect economic growth, inflation and all the intermediate macroeconomic factors.\n\nInflation Hits 5-year High at 18.60%\n\nThe consumer price index (CPI), which measures the rate of change in prices of goods and services, surged to 18.60 per cent in June 2022, up from 17.71 per cent in the previous month, the highest since January 2017.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said this in its consumer price index (CPI) report for June 2022, released yesterday.\n\nThe figure is also 0.84 per cent points higher compared to June 2021, which is 17.75 per cent.\n\nThe development means that the headline inflation rate increased in June 2022 when compared to the same month in the previous year (June 2021).\n\nAccording to the report, increases were recorded in all classifications of individual consumption according to purpose (COICOP) divisions that yielded the headline index.\n\n\u201cOn a month-on-month basis, the headline inflation rate increased to 1.82 per cent in June 2022, this is 0.03 per cent higher than the rate recorded in May 2022 (1.78 per cent),\u201d reports the NBS.\n\nJames Emejo and Nume Ekeghe",

          "text": "Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State on Friday waved aside the disapproval of the Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress by its Christian members, declaring that \u201cpolitics is about good and fair leadership not religion.\u201d\n\nOn the same day, protesters under the aegis of All Christians Community of Northern Nigeria marched to the Presidential Villa to submit a protest letter to President Muhammadu Buhari over the Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nMasari, who spoke while responding to questions from journalists shortly after a meeting with President Buhari at his private residence in Daura, Katsina State, threw his weight behind the choice of Shettima as running mate to Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nThe governor explained that what the nation needed at the moment \u201cis good leadership, a just, competent and fair leader, irrespective of his religion, tribal or geo-political affiliations.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cShettima is a former governor, serving senator and a very brilliant person who has all the qualities to be the vice-president. So, I fully support his nomination as the running mate of Tinubu for the 2023 presidential election under the platform of APC.\n\n\u201cHe is very qualified. So, I am pleased with his nomination. It is better to have a good Christian than a bad Muslim likewise is better to have a good Muslim than a bad Christian. So, it is about the person, not his religion really.\n\n\u201cI know that there are some perceptions out there, but I think as important as perception is, let us understand the reality. When they say a particular person will be this, let us examine the person; his antecedents.\u201d\n\nMasari described Shettima as an accommodating politician: \u201cIf you talk to the Christian community in Borno where he had the opportunity of being the governor for eight years, you will hear their testimonies about his performances of being a just and fair leader.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, tue All Christians Community of Northern Nigeria on Friday marched to the Presidential Villa to submit a protest letter to President Buhari over the Muslim-Muslim ticket adopted by the APC.\n\nThe leader of the group, Moses Adams said the sensibilities of the Christians had been insulted by the ambition of a select few that elected to throw caution to the wind with the decision.\n\nThe Christian group said it wondered why the APC elected to toe a path of dishonour, which it described as deliberate, to relegate the Christians in Nigeria into oblivion,\n\nAdams stated: \u201cMr. President, since the return of democracy in 1999 in Nigeria, the tradition has been a Muslim-Christian or Christian-Muslim paring by all political parties. And this has, to a large extent, ensured religious harmony in the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, the move by our party to adopt a Muslim-Muslim ticket is most insensitive and the height of discrimination against Christians in our country. This is on the heels that other political parties indeed reflected the religious balance in the composition of their presidential team.\n\n\u201cThe two major religions in the country are Islam and Christianity. And these have defined our way of life since the country attained independence in 1960.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore alarmed with the decision of the APC to disregard the Christian community in the choice of its vice- presidential candidate for the 2023 presidential elections. Without mincing words, this is unacceptable and a recipe for creating sharp divides between the Muslims and the Christians in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Excellency Sir, we the Christians in Northern Nigeria are displeased and angered by this insensitivity. By their action, the APC sent a strong message that Christians are not relevant in the scheme of things in the country.\u201d",

          "title": "Osun Election: PDP\u2019s Adeleke Challenges Incumbent APC Governor Oyetola",
          "text": "After weeks of acrimonious campaigns, the people of Osun State will Saturday decide whether Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of the ruling All Progressives Congress should continue for another four years or elect a new man to succeed him.\n\nFifteen political parties are fielding candidates for the election, but it is evidently a straight fight between Oyetola and Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nThis would be the second time the two candidates would be meeting. Both Oyetola and Adeleke contested for the Osun governorship position in 2018, which Oyetola won after a rerun.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has assured the people of a free and fair poll and spent most of Friday moving sensitive voting materials to the 332 registration areas across the 30 local government areas of the state.\n\nThe election umpire restated its readiness to announce the result in less than 12 hours after the poll.\n\nThe two leading political parties are desperate to win Saturday\u2019s contest to signpost readiness to dominate the 2023 general elections.\n\nTo underpin the importance of the poll, the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Tinubu led a final campaign for Oyetola last Tuesday. He was accompanied by party chieftains like the party\u2019s National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, vice presidential candidate, Kashim Shettima and several APC governors.\n\nThe PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, also led a powerful campaign team to the state on Thursday assuring the people that Adeleke is sure of victory in the poll, and that \u201can end has come to the reign of the ruling APC\u201d in the country.\n\nAtiku was accompanied by the National Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu; Vice-presidential candidate of the party and Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki and some governors of the PDP.\n\nFor most of Friday, tension remained very high across Osun State, with voters bitterly divided among the two leading candidates.\n\nFear of violence was palpable, considering the rancorous campaigns before the poll.\n\nThe allegations by the PDP that the APC was working to rig the poll dominated discussion across the state.\n\nOyetola and Adeleke (Strengths and Weaknesses)\n\nThe leading candidates for the election remain Oyetola and Adeleke.\n\nOyetola, who is seeking reelection for a second term, enjoys the privileges that come with being incumbent. He is also enjoying the perks of \u2018federal might\u2019 and the backing of Tinubu.\n\nHis chances in Ssturday\u2019s poll have been brightened by his good relationship with Osun civil servants. Unlike his predecessor who owed salaries for months, Oyetola has been consistent with salary payment and also improved the welfare of the civil servants. All of these, pundits argue, will work in his favour.\n\nHowever, the cold war between Oyetola and Rauf Aregbesola, his predecessor, may reduce the former\u2019s votes in LGAs controlled by the latter.\n\nThe disharmony within the party left it with factions \u2013 the Ileri Oluwa group is loyal to Oyetola while TOP pledges allegiance to Aregbesola.\n\nNotwithstanding, Oyetola stands a very good chance of getting a second term.\n\nAdeleke, the \u201cdancing senator\u201d, says he is determined to recover his \u201cstolen mandate\u201d from the APC. He is in the race with a big war chest. He also has a broad support base.\n\nA lot of people from Adeleke\u2019s Osun West Senatorial District, which is yet to produce a governor since the fourth republic, are agitated. Adeleke will gain from this, but may not be enough to make him governor.\n\nThe crisis in Osun PDP may also affect Adeleke\u2019s chances. The party is also divided into factions. One is recognised by the PDP National Working Committee (NWC) while the other is backed by Olagunsoye Oyinlola, a former governor of the state, whose political sway in the state cannot be overlooked.\n\nStrengths on Senatorial Basis\n\nOyetola looks good to win Osun Central where he is from. Besides, many prominent Osun political stakeholders are from this senatorial zone, and they belong to the APC. They include former governor, Chief Bisi Akande and the current Senator, Ajibola Basiru, who is also the Oyetola campaign chairman. Osun Central is good-to-go for Oyetola.\n\nAdeleke is from Osun West, with Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi of the Accord Party. Here, Adeleke will have an upper hand, but not enough to make him governor. Oyetola will still get substantial votes here.\n\nIn Osun East, Adeleke will benefit greatly from the influence of Francis Fadahunsi, the Senator representing the area, who is a PDP member. Oyetola\u2019s good performance during his first term will give him victory in Osun East.\n\nPolice Deploy 21,000 Operatives\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba has assured Nigerians that Saturday\u2019s poll would be violence-free.\n\nBaba, who spoke last Tuesday, said to accomplish the task, no fewer than 21,000 operatives would be deployed across the state.\n\nBaba warned that the police would not allow any person or group of persons, no matter how highly and lowly placed in the society to derail the electoral process, and vowed that \u201cvote-buying or any form of inducement would not be allowed as they remained serious offences.\u201d\n\nThe IG adds: \u201cThe police will be deployed to protect the facilities of INEC and its personnel. This deployment is not meant to intimidate any law-abiding citizens; rather it is to deter misguided elements that may threaten the conduct of the election and violate the electoral act. It also serves as a strong warning that government is determined to protect the citizens.\u201d\n\nThe IG has also deployed the Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of the Force Criminal Investigation Department, DIG Johnson Kokumo, for the governorship election.\n\nAlso deployed to the state are four Assistant Inspectors-General of Police, four Commissioners of Police, 15 Deputy Commissioners of Police, and 30 Assistant Commissioners of Police.\n\nBaba also moved the Osun State Commissioner of Police, Olawale Olokode (temporarily) to the Force Headquarters until the conclusion of the election.\n\nNSCDC deploys 11,226\n\nSimilarly, the Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Dr. Ahmed Audi, has deployed 11,226 officers and men to cover the 3,763 polling units, collation centres, flash points, as well as critical national assets and infrastructure during today\u2019s poll.\n\nThe deployed personnel were drawn from the national headquarters and nine state commands; Osun, Ondo, Ekiti, Oyo, Ogun, Lagos, Kwara, Kogi and Edo to supply manpower for the election.\n\nThe NSCDC said the objectives of the corps in the election were to create a secured environment for its successful conduct and enhance the general security in the state before, during and after the election.\n\nINEC Chairman Charges Staff on Good Conduct\n\nThe Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu yesterday charged the staff of the Commission to remain neutral and repeat the transparent conduct exhibited in Ekiti State governorship election four weeks ago.\n\nIn a statement he signed, the INEC chairman, said: \u201cExactly 27 days ago, we conducted and concluded the Ekiti Governorship Election that was widely adjudged to be free, fair, credible, and inclusive.\n\n\u201cThe feat was happily an elongation of the earlier successes recorded in Edo and Ondo states on 15th September and 10th October 2020, and in Anambra State on 6th November 2021. The sheer determination, resilience, and competence displayed by all of you, our members of staff, made it possible for the Commission to achieve these lofty goals.\u201d\n\nHe reminded the staff of the commission of the need to maintain the same impartial conduct exhibited in the other states.\n\nYakubu said: \u201cI have assured our stakeholders and the people of Osun State that the Commission will not do anything to the advantage or disadvantage of any political party or candidate. We have made adequate arrangements for the election. We have promised a level playing field for all. The security agencies have assured us of safety.\n\n\u201cThe people of Osun State and Nigerians will understandably hold us to our promise on election day. They will observe our attitude and behaviour from the opening to the closing of polls. They will particularly observe our management of the election results and measure the extent of our adherence to the extant laws through every stage of the electoral process.\n\n\u201cI appeal to you to uphold our Code of Conduct, display your usual sense of commitment and professionalism, remain above board and firmly resist any unethical behaviour. You must also stick to the Oath of Neutrality to which we have all subscribed. I have the confidence in your ability to consolidate on our recent successes.\u201d\n\nPDP Claims APC Planning to Rig Election\n\nThe PDP on Friday alleged an orchestrated plot by the APC \u201cto derail the nascent democratic process by compromising the integrity and sabotaging the will and desire of the people for a free, fair, transparent and credible electoral process\u201d in today\u2019s election in Osun State.\n\nThe party, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba alleged that the APC had accentuated its rigging programme by deploying billions of naira to compromise some security and electoral officers to intimidate voters, manipulate electoral process and inordinately favour Oyetola, against the will of the people.\n\nThe PDP alleged that huge money had been funneled to certain compromised security and INEC officials \u201cto execute this ignoble scheme.\u201d\n\nAccording to the PDP, \u201cthe said INEC and security officials are reported to have been bought over to, among other things, criminally assist and provide cover for APC agents to prosecute a well-oiled vote buying and violence-triggering scheme.\u201d\n\nOlogunagba adds. \u201cOur Party has information on how two prominent APC governors from the South-west, a former APC National Chairman from the South-south, certain federal minister and a particular member of the House of Assembly from Lagos State are coordinating the release of billions of naira to bribe electoral and security officials, as well as fund heavily armed thugs imported from Lagos, Ondo, Ogun and other South-west states to unleash violence and help the APC to rig the election.\u201d\n\nThe PDP said that it had however been made aware that some patriotic INEC and Police officials vehemently rejected the poisonous offer by the APC.\n\nThe PDP called on the IG and Yakubu \u201cto take immediate decisive steps to check the activities of police and INEC officials deployed to Osun State so as to avert a breakdown of Law and Order, especially given the manifest determination of the people of Osun State to resist the APC on its evil scheme.\u201d\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Chuks Okocha and Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo",

          "title": "Biden Hopes for Israeli Integration at Arab Summit in Saudi Arabia",
          "text": "US President Joe Biden will discuss regional missile and defence capabilities on Saturday when he meets Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia.\n\nBiden will be seeking to integrate Israel as part of a new axis largely driven by shared concerns over Iran, said a senior administration official.\n\n\u201cWe believe there\u2019s great value in including as many of the capabilities in this region as possible and certainly Israel has significant air and missile defence capabilities, as they need to. But we\u2019re having these discussion bilaterally with these nations,\u201d the administration official told reporters.\n\nBiden, on his first Middle East trip as president, has focused on the planned summit with six Gulf states and Egypt, Jordan and Iraq while downplaying meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. That encounter has drawn criticism in the United States over human rights abuses.\n\nBiden had promised to make Saudi Arabia a \u201cpariah\u201d on the global stage over the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents, but ultimately decided U.S. interests dictated a recalibration, not a rupture, in relations with the world\u2019s top oil exporter and Arab powerhouse.\n\nBiden needs the help of OPEC giant Saudi Arabia at a time of high crude prices and other problems related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and as he encourages efforts to end the Yemen war, where a temporary truce is in place. Washington also wants to curb Iran\u2019s sway in the region and China\u2019s global influence.\n\nThe administration official said the United States is hopeful it will see an OPEC production boost in the coming weeks. Biden is expected to press other Gulf producers to pump more oil. The OPEC+ alliance, which includes Russia, meets next on Aug. 3.\n\nThe U.S. president, who started his trip to the region with a visit to Israel, will hold bilateral talks with leaders of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq before taking part in the wider summit where he will \u201clay out clearly\u201d his vision and strategy for America\u2019s engagement in the Middle East, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Friday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s intent on ensuring that there is not a vacuum in the Middle East for China and Russia to fill,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nAnother senior administration official said Biden would announce that the United States has committed $1 billion in new near and long term food security assistance for the Middle East and North Africa, and that Gulf states would commit $3 billion over the next two years in projects that align with U.S. partnerships in global infrastructure and investment.\n\nGulf states, which have refused to side with the West against Russia in the Ukraine conflict, are in turn seeking a concrete commitment from the United States to strategic ties that have been strained over perceived U.S. disengagement from the region.\n\nRiyadh and Abu Dhabi have been frustrated by U.S. conditions on arms sales and for being excluded from indirect U.S.-Iran talks aimed at reviving a 2015 nuclear pact that they see as flawed for not tackling regional concerns about Tehran\u2019s missile programme and behaviour.\n\n\u201cThe most important demand from the Saudi leadership and other Gulf leaders \u2014 and Arabs in general \u2014 is clarity of U.S. policy and its direction towards the region,\u201d said Abdulaziz Sager, chairman of Riyadh-based Gulf Research Center.\n\nIsrael, which shares their concerns over Iran, encouraged Biden\u2019s trip to the kingdom, hoping it would foster a warming between Saudi Arabia and Israel as part of a wider Arab rapprochement after the UAE and Bahrain forged ties with Israel in U.S.-brokered pacts that received Riyadh\u2019s blessings.\n\nIn a sign of progress under what Biden described as a groundbreaking process, Saudi Arabia said on Friday it would open its airspace to all air carriers, paving the way for more overflights to and from Israel.\n\nWashington and Riyadh also announced the removal of U.S. and other peacekeepers from Tiran \u2014 an island between Saudi Arabia and Egypt in a strategic position leading to the Israeli port of Eilat. The troops have been stationed as part of accords reached in 1978 and which led to a peace deal between Israel and Egypt.\n\nA plan to connect air defence systems could be a hard sell for Arab states that do not have ties with Israel and balk at being part of an alliance seen as against Iran, which has built a strong network of proxies around the region including in Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.\n\nSenior Emirati official Anwar Gargash said on Friday the idea of a so-called Middle East NATO was difficult and that bilateral cooperation was faster and more effective.\n\nThe UAE, he said, would not back a confrontational approach: \u201cWe are open to cooperation, but not cooperation targeting any other country in the region and I specifically mention Iran.\u201d",
