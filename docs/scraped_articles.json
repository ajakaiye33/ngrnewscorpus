          "text": "Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has said that press freedom and free speech are key to the development of democracy, noting that the state government has expunged sedition from the new criminal law of the state.\n\nObaseki, who was represented by the Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Adaze Enwanta, spoke at the official opening of Super FM in Benin on Friday.\n\nHe said that it was clear that people tune in to radio and television stations to know what the government is doing because the government is the closest to them.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cFor us as a government, democratic freedoms are the most important part of the freedom of expression and press freedom.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that people tune in to radio and television stations because they want to know what the government is doing.\n\n\u201cAlso, in order to respect the people\u2019s opinion, we have taken deliberate steps.\n\n\u201cJust recently, the Edo State Executive Council considered the new criminal law and we have abrogated the provision that has to do with sedition to allow for freedom of expression so that the journalist can express his views by way of report without fear or molestation.\n\n\u201cJournalists occupy a very important position in our society. You also owe the public a duty and I must commend Super FM because you are doing just that.\n\n\u201cThe state government will work with your station and hopefully we will get our own broadcast regulatory body as stipulated in the constitution to regulate what you do instead of being tied to the Nigeria Broadcasting Corporation.\u201d\n\nChief Executive Officer of the station, Yemi Akinwunmi, said the corporate mission and vision statements are to better the individual and the society.\n\nShe added, \u201cAs Super FM continues to grow with new branches springing up across the country, we have a uniform mission and vision statements.

          "text": "The Bauchi State Governor and a presidential aspirant in the Peoples Democratic Party, Bala Mohammed, on Friday described as unrealistic the agitation by the Indigenous People of Biafra for the breakaway of the South-East from Nigeria.\n\nMohammed, who was in Akwa to woo members of the Anambra State PDP ahead of the party\u2019s primary, submitted that Igbo were everywhere across the country and owned \u201cover half of the country,\u201d therefore, IPOB\u2019s self-determination call was unrealistic.\n\nAccording to him, the entrepreneurial drive and enterprise in the South-East is a great potential that must be leveraged for Nigeria\u2019s industrialisation.\n\nThe Bauchi governor said, \u201cWhen I was Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, the Igbo capital investment in Abuja was over 50 per cent. That is the true position; not only in Abuja but also in Kano, Lagos, Kaduna and other states. So, we are interrelated and connected as a people in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe need to stabilise that symbiosis that binds us together. When the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, is talking about self-determination and self-actualisation, for where? When you own over half of the country? God may not give you everything, He has given something to you. That is the truth.\n\n\u201cBecause of this, I am calling for this unity and fraternity among us. If the Igbo youth understand this, they will now know the need for peace and unity in the country.\u201d\n\nMohammed said if elected as President in 2023 he would work to bring out the best in every part of the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019m coming to bring equity and justice to this country where everybody would be recognised, where leadership recruitment will be fair and just so that all sections of the country will have a sense of belonging. We will do it, I have benefited from this kind of justice and it is the only way out of Nigeria\u2019s problems.\u201d\n\nWhile urging the Anambra PDP members to support him at the party\u2019s primary, Mohammed said he was aware that one of their own was also in the presidential race but they should consider his own competence.\n\nAccording him, North-East and South-East are suffering the same fate as the only zones that have not produced the President.\n\n\u201cI know that your son is coming out for the Presidency; if he emerges I will support him but if I emerge, I will go with all of you. We must not allow this country to collapse because if it collapses we will all suffer and blames ourselves.\n\n\u201cMy work as a minister, senator and others has exposed me to the problem of the country and I have gathered better experience to lead this great country to united Nigeria where there will be justice and fairness and every person is respected as a citizen.\n\n\u201cI supported that every Nigerian should be respected where he goes. I am not unaware of the feelings of South, especially the South-East on zoning, but let us look at the issues in context. The South-East and the North-East are suffering the same; the North-East has not been there just like the South-East.\n\n\u201cWe cannot produce President alone, we have to do it, persuasively,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed added, \u201cDistinguished ladies and gentlemen, I am standing here before you, offering myself to serve and return Nigeria to greater height and greatness. With you, we will rebuild and re-launch this country so that we can regain our national pride.\n\n\u201cIf you are voting as a delegate, vote wisely. If you have a better person, vote him or her. If I am not the best, don\u2019t vote for me. But I know I am the best.\n\n\u201cI have the experience and capacity to lead this country to greater glory, but if at the primary I am not elected I will support whosever that emerges so that Nigeria can get out of the mess.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By GodwinOritse\n\nAHEAD of the 2023 general elections, the African Association of Professional Freight Forwarders and Logistics of Nigeria (APFFLON) has declared the country\u2019s logistics supply chain management system as \u201csick\u201d and in urgent need of efficacious remedial measures.\n\nThe group wants the electorate to judge the capacity of each of the aspirants or candidates by their proffered workable solutions to tackle the country\u2019s lingering logistics supply chain management problems.\n\n\n\nAccording to APFFLON so far, the group has not seen any of the aspirants with the capacity to solve the problem facing the logistics industry.\n\nSpeaking during a meeting at the APFFLON Tin-Can Island Port Chapter Secretariat, the Chairman, Mr. Godfrey Emeka Nwosu, expressed concern that, none of the aspirants or candidates vying for the various offices had publicly enunciated manifestos on enthroning cost-effective, efficient, and sustainable logistics supply chain management.\n\nThe leading freight forwarder posited that, once Nigeria is able to get its logistics supply chain management right, all other sectors will fall in place for the actualization of her boundless potential as a great nation.\n\nAccording to him, for too long, a lack of the requisite appropriate logistics supply chain management system in Nigeria has retarded and stunted the nation\u2019s development and progress.\n\nNwosu noted that Nigeria is in self-denial of the much expected huge investment opportunities in the African Continental Free trade Area (AfCFTA ) offers the continent by removal of trade barriers and participate effectively as a major maritime nation in the continent.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria\u2019s bad logistics supply chain management system has her from keying into the AfCFTA, which the promoters says is aimed at accelerating intra-African trade and boosting Africa\u2019s trading position in the global market by strengthening Africa\u2019s common voice in global trade negotiations.\n\nHe stated: \u201cNigeria has suffered needlessly and endlessly from revenue leakages and persisting inflation, among other ills, because she is yet to get her logistics supply chain management right,\u201d Nwosu said.\n\n\u201cThe bane of efficient logistics supply chain management in Nigeria is inexorably linked to the sharp practices by unscrupulous officials of government at the local, state, and Federal tiers, respectively. It is an unfortunate state of affairs that keeps breeding endemic corruption and inefficiency in the system.\n\n\u201cTherefore, as a responsible organization, APFLLON is compelled to express its very real worries that, as the 2023 General Elections are fast approaching, none of the aspirants are talking about what their respective plans are for rehabilitating the nation\u2019s ailing logistics supply chain management system.\n\n\u201cNigeria must get out of the bind of an incompetent system that has held her back for too long. APFFLON is all out for interrogating all seeking elective political offices in 2023 in order to establish their respective positions on this most crucial of matters. APFFLON cannot emphasize it enough that the capacity of any particular aspirant or candidate to offer workable solutions to Nigeria\u2019s lingering logistics supply chain management problems must be a big determinant of that aspirant\u2019s or candidate\u2019s suitability for whatever elective position sought. The electorate must prioritize resolving the multifarious issues strangulating the system in order to rescue Nigeria wholesomely.\u201d",

          "text": "By Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nCHAIRMAN of Belemaoil Production and a presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Tein Jack-Rich on Friday said that 2023 is a critical year that will decide the fate of the country.\n\nJack-Rich, who stated this when he formally declared to contest the 2023 presidential election in Abuja also promised not to take any loan throughout his tenure as a president even as he pledged to create 26,000 jobs in his first day in office in each of the 774 local government areas of the country.\n\nHe also said that he would tackle insecurity geadlong and will encourage the private sector.\n\nJack-Rick who said he organised prayers for President Muhammadu Buhari when he was sick, thanked God that the president is now healthier than ever.\n\nHe said, \u201cI will create smart jobs and will develop the oil and gas industry and optimise the oil and gas in the country.\n\n\u201cMy presidency will strengthen our value system. We will create 26,000 jobs in each LGA on the first day in office.\n\n\u201cI will make it happen. When I create 26,000 direct opportunity jobs on the first day in office in the 774 LGAs, within one year,\u201d adding that the issue of poverty will be a thing of the past.\n\nThe renowned philanthropist and oil and gas magnate said he has a robust plan for the aged, the youths, women and everyone.\n\n\u201cFor the millennial, we need to create infrastructure that will help them to develop digital technology. You need a president that can engage the east and the west economy.\n\n\u201cYou need a president when you travel outside the country, you will be respected. You need a president that will ensure creation of jobs, a president that can grow the economy.\n\n\u201cA president that can create deep private sector engagement. A president that can think for you, not himself. You need a president that will ensure the wealth in Niger Delta is not for the region alone but a president who can utilise it for the benefit of all.\n\n\u201cYou need to have control of your economy and the control of your children. They hang in trees while those who use them have abandoned them. With the Jack-Rich presidency, we will produce more, plan more and be respected in the community of nations. We will strengthen our currency and create jobs for youth,\u201d Jack-Rich said, adding that he sees hope in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAll I see is hope. All I need is the right legislation to back up my plans. We will not make policies that will not be backed up with action.\u201d\n\nJack-Rich, who said without President Buhari, he wouldn\u2019t have been in the APC, added\n\nthat the President has given them the platforms to showcase their ability.\n\n\u201cAll these good ideas will be a mirage if we did not get the right leader to take over from Buhari.\n\n\u201cI will not take a single loan throughout my Presidency,\u201d Jack-Rich said, adding that, \u201cWe will produce what we will consume. God has given us all we need to consume.\n\n\u201cI will fly to Zamfara, Kano, Kaduna and every part of the country if we have issues. I will fly there. I will not send anybody if they have issues, I will fly there.\n\n\u201cYou my brothers that are engaging in banditry, my brothers in the North East, we are all one. I don\u2019t believe in assault or missiles. I believe in economic-based bombadment. Youths, boys and girls are doing wrong things to survive. That\u2019s because the opportunity has shrunk.\n\n\u201cThe best way to stop all these crimes is the oil and gas and I am in that industry and we can do it. Everything that I worked for will go to humanity,\u201d Jack-Rich added.\n\nJack-Rich said that the reason Nigeria is struggling with inflation is because the country is not consuming what it is producing.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you need a game changer. Believe in my visionary leadership whose heart is for the people. I will make Buhari proud, I will make Nigerians proud because I am for humanity. Yahoo boys have a gift to be developed but they engage in such ills because they have been abandoned. I am telling you, because my heart is for you, I will do what is right,\u201d Jack-Rich added.",

This is the handwork of Nigerian paid agents and should be totally ignored.\n\n\u201cIPOB is not a faceless movement and does not announce its activities through voice messages. Biafrans must be very much on alert because the Nigerian government working through its security agencies the DSS and the BBC is trying so hard to create confusion in our land in its attempt to set Biafrans against themselves and scuttle our struggle for liberation. But we assure them that Biafrans know their plans and will not fall for their evil agenda.\n\n\u201cLike Mazi Nnamdi Kanu said, if you did not hear it on radio Biafra then it is not from IPOB. IPOB announces its activities and events only through official channels which are (i)Radio Biafra (ii) Press Statement from Emma Powerful (office of IPOB Media and Publicity Secretary) and (iii) Memo from the Office of IPOB Head of Directorate.\n\n\u201cTo this end therefore the only Sit-At-Home order emanating and announced by IPOB leadership are the 18th and 26th of May, 2022 being the dates our leader Mazi Nnamdi KANU will appear in court. The IPOB leadership is very strategic in its actions and directives to the Biafran people knowing fully well that our enemies are desperate to scuttle this heaven ordained freedom movement.\n\n\u201cOur core reason is the well-being of Biafrans all over the globe but with added emphasis on the well-being of Biafrans in the homeland of Biafra.\u201d\n\nIPOB accused the Department of State Services, DSS, of circulating the voice note.\n\n\u201cThose behind the purported voice note should inform their paymasters to stop dissipating their energy and resources on a hopeless attempt to stop the collective will and decision of the Indigenous people of Biafra IPOB worldwide to pursue our Self Determination Right.\n\n\u201cBiafrans, friends of Biafra and lovers of freedom across the world and especially in Biarraland should therefore pay no heed to faceless DSS agents and impostors recruited to serve the interest of the Fulani Caliphate,\u201d Powerful added.",

In the South-west we have discovered that we can create what we call the Health Tech Center to look at medical care and in the South-east, we have also discovered that we can establish what we call the technology there.\n\n\u201cIn that way, we will be able to ensure that our young boys and girls who go to university can also have certain skills to provide the needed knowledge base, and value to grow the local economy.\n\n\u201cAnd then also help our GDP. We\u2019ve also looked at the North-East and North-West from North Central, but beyond that, we feel that it\u2019s important as part of our strategy to open up the economy.\u201d\n\nHe promised to leverage the oil and gas sectors as a major catalyst the country needs to activate industrial development.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m promising you that by 2023. We have a master plan to move oil production to 3 million barrels. And not only that, but we also have the master plan in such a manner that we can look at the low-hanging fruits where we\u2019re losing our oil and gas resource values and then provide technology-based infrastructure.\n\n\u201cSo, operators will be advised to contribute their fair share. In that way, we will be able to earn the best in oil and gas production and be able to refine what we consume.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAs we speak right now, Nigeria is the largest economy on the continent of Africa. We are not part of the G20.\n\n\u201cWe need a president that can engage the G7 Economist. You need a president that can stand with these advanced economies and negotiate your place in the community of nations.\n\n\u201cYou need a president that when you travel outside this country and you flip your international passport ID card, you will be respected and honoured.\n\n\u201cYou need a president that can speak to Elon Musk to come to Nigeria and invest. You need a president that can speak to Bill Gates, not to give us aides, but give us technology-based centres, so we can grow.\u201d\n\nJack-Rich said if elected, his administration would change the political and economic landscape narrative of the country to give it (Nigeria) a voice in the community of Nations.\n\n\u201cAll I need is the right, coherent, consistent physical policy with the right legislation to back it up so that we can begin to make policies to establish economic footprints.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t take a single loan throughout my presidency.\u201d\n\nThe presidential aspirant said if elected he would not make policies that would not be backed up with legislation that would guarantee investors\u2019 capital.",

But as at 9 pm, we have not seen them or their agents.\u201d\n\nSimultaneously, a group approached a Federal High Court, Abuja praying it to bar the former president from participating as a candidate in the next presidential election, while a Delta State High Court, Kwale, restrained the board of the CBN and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from stopping Emefile from seeking an elective post.\n\nThe Nation gathered that the legal directorate of the party on Thursday began the vetting of documents submitted by all aspirants with a view to determining the authenticity of the papers.\n\nA source in the department said the party leadership learnt a big lesson from the last minute disqualification of the party\u2019s governorship candidate and his deputy in Bayelsa State due to some lapses in the documentation of the then deputy governor-elect.\n\n\u201cWe are going through all the papers filed by all the aspirants in order to avoid any avoidable mistakes. Anyone with past criminal records or convictions will not be allowed to contest. We want to mitigate any post-election litigation that can upturn our victory,\u201d the source said.\n\nOther presidential aspirants whose nomination forms were received at press time were former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; former Minister of Niger Delta Development, Sen. Godswill Akpabio; former Imo State governor, Sen. Rochas Okorocha; and former Ogun State governor, Sen. Ibikunle Amosun.\n\nOthers were Pastor Tunde Bakare; Cross River State governor, Prof. Ben Ayade; his Ebonyi State counterpart, Gov. Dave Umahi; Chairman, Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) and Ekiti State governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi; Minister of State, Education, Hon. Emeka Nwajiuba; former Senate President, Sen. Ken Nnamani; Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello; Jigawa State Governor Mohammed Badaru Abubakar and former Zamfara State governor, Sen. Ahmed Yerima.\n\nAlso on the list of presidential aspirants that filed their papers were Senator Ajayi Borroffice; the only female aspirant, Mrs Uju Kennedy Ohnenye; Pastor Nicholas Felix Nwagbo; former House of Representative Speaker Dimeji Bankole; former Minister of State, Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva; former Minister of Information, Chief Ikeobasi Mokelu; and Mr Tein Jack Rich.\n\nCourt urged to bar Jonathan from contesting next presidential election\n\nA group, the Rights for All International (RAI), has approached the Federal High Court in Abuja to bar ex-President Goodluck Jonathan from participating as a candidate in the next presidential election.\n\nPlaintiff also wants the court to restrain the APC from fielding Jonathan as its candidate and to bar the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from accepting him as the candidate of the APC for the election.\n\nSuit FHC/ABJ/CS: 662/2022 was filed yesterday by the incorporated trustees of the RAI through their lawyer, Okere Nnamdi.\n\nListed as defendants alongside Jonathan are APC and INEC.\n\nThe plaintiff is contending that having taken the oath of office of the President for two times, Jonathan was no longer qualified, under the constitution, to stand for election as president.\n\nRAI stated in a supporting affidavit that the 1st defendant (Jonathan) has been twice elected to the office of the President and held the office on two previous occasions.\n\nIt said: \u201cDespite having held the office of the President of Nigeria on two previous occasions, the 1st defendant has obtained the presidential nomination form of the 2nd defendant (the APC) to contest the 2023 presidential election as the candidate of the 2nd defendant.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution of Nigeria provides for both qualification and disqualification to contest the office of the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe 1st defendant, having been elected President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2011 and having been sworn in as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria from May 29, 2011 to May 29, 2015, served his second terms as President of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe 1st defendant has fulfilled constitutional provisions, having been elected and sworn into the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on two previous elections as envisaged in section 137 (1) (b) of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe 1st defendant is constitutionally not qualified to contest any presidential election in Nigeria, having been elected, sworn in and held the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on two previous occasions.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff wants the court to declare that having regard to the clear, unambiguous and express provisions, spirit and tenor of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (Fourth Alteration Act no 16), which provided a new subsection (3) to section 137 of the Constitution, the 1st defendant is not qualified to contest any presidential election in Nigeria.\n\nIt wants an order perpetually restraining, prohibiting and barring the 2nd defendant (the APC) from nominating Jonathan as its presidential candidate for the 2023 Presidential election on the grounds that the 1st defendant is constitutionally not qualified to contest any presidential election in Nigeria, having been elected, sworn in and held the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on two previous occasions.\n\nThe plaintiff equally wants the court to issue an order perpetually restraining, prohibiting and barring the 3rd defendant (INEC) from accepting the nomination of the 1st defendant as the presidential candidate of the 2nd defendant for the 2023 presidential election on the ground that Jonathan is constitutionally not qualified to contest any presidential election in Nigeria, having been elected, sworn-in and held the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on two previous occasions.\n\nJonathan still in PDP, says party spokesman\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Debo Ologunagba, said yesterday that Dr. Jonathan has not resigned his membership of the party contrary to speculations that he had switched camps to the APC.\n\nOlogunagba, speaking on Channels Television, said as at yesterday, he was \u201cnot aware of his (Jonathan\u2019s) resignation from the membership of the party (PDP).\u201d\n\n\u201dI would assume it is safe to say that he is a member of the party. If events follow thereafter, we can speak to that.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that the PDP would not respond to rumours about Jonathan\u2019s defection as there were no facts to substantiate any such claim.\n\nBut Ologunagba also said: \u201cMembership of the party is personal. Membership of the party is at the ward level.\n\n\u201dI can\u2019t speak for him. I don\u2019t speak for the former President.\u201d\n\nEmefiele steps back from presidential contest\n\nCentral Bank (CBN) Governor Godwin Emefiele remained at his desk at the Abuja headquarters of the apex bank last night with no official word from him on his perceived presidential ambition.\n\nAlthough sources close to his office said a statement would be issued to categorically state Emefiele\u2019s position on the presidential race, there was no such statement at press time.\n\nA CBN source said the governor was \u201con his seat in his office attending to official matters\u201d.\n\nThe source said CBN officials were busy making arrangements for the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) scheduled for next week.\n\nEmefiele, during a visit to President Buhari on Thursday, told reporters to \u2018expect news\u2019. He said he was having fun with speculations about his presidential ambition.\n\nCourt restrains CBN Board, INEC from stopping his political aspiration\n\nA Delta State High Court sitting in Kwale division has granted an order restraining the Board of Central Bank of Nigeria and Independent National Electoral Commission from preventing the CBN governor, Godwin Emiefele from seeking an elective post.\n\nEmefiele had through his counsel, C.N Ofiah esq, filed an ex-parte motion to obtain an order to enable him remain in office while contesting for the Presidency.\n\nThe Nation gathered that the application was filed on May 5, 2022, and his prayer was granted on Thursday, May 12.\n\nJustice DC Maidoh said: \u201cI have read the processes in this suit. The applicant has complied with Order 39 of our rules. Applicant also deposed to an affidavit of urgency.\n\n\u201cFrom the processes before the court, I find that the said application at this stage has merit pending the hearing and determination of the Motion on Notice.\n\n\u201cIn the circumstances, in line with order 39 rule 3 of our rules, this motion is hereby granted. The motion on notice is accordingly adjourned to 25/5/2022 for hearing.\u201d",

          "title": "Zoning: Afenifere, YCE allege conspiracy against South",
          "text": "By Tunde Thomas\n\nAny attempt by either the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) or the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to jettison rotation of their presidential tickets to the South in 2023 would endanger Nigeria\u2019s unity and the current democratic system. This was the opinion of the Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE) and the Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere. Reacting to dumping of zoning by the two major parties, General Secretary, Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE), Dr. Kunle Olajide said it was a dangerous development capable of jeopardizing the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cIt is not a fair thing to do now. Dumping zoning will put Nigeria\u2019s democracy in danger. Nigerians have yet to develop confidence in the democratic ideals, so our leadership, and the two political parties must realize our ethnic diversity ,that we are different people who have come to live together, and because of that we must adopt zoning to build the confidence of people in the Nigerian structure. It is too early in the day to jettison zoning because doing so will endanger our democracy. We must give every part of the country a sense of belonging, and both PDP, and APC must recognize this fact. PDP and APC must accept the reality of the Nigerian situation. No part of the country should have a feeling of being excluded or being marginalized.\u201d\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nSpeaking further on why it is not ideal for the two major political parties to dump zoning now, Olajide said: \u201cZoning promotes inclusiveness, and the moment that it is dumped some sections or part of the country will feel alienated. Some people may even harbour the feelings that a particular part want to dominate the others, and this is not good for our democracy. Nigerians\u2019 confidence in democracy will be seriously eroded if we dump zoning. Dumping zoning will lead to marginalisation of some set of people, and this is not in the nation\u2019s best interests. We need to inspire the confidence of all Nigerians from different parts of the country in the nation\u2019s democracy, and dumping of zoning will negate that. On its part, Afenifere described the move by both PDP and APC as a ploy to ensure that the North retain power in 2023.\n\nAccording to the group\u2019s spokeman, Comrade Jare Ajayi, both parties dumped zoning as a way of ensuring that the person who takes over power from President Buhari in 2023 is another Northerner. He however warned that such a move is dangerous for the unity of the country.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nHe said: \u201cDumping zoning is not good for the country as it is capable of alienating other sections of the country and deepen the mistrust that became more apparent under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nAjayi further added that what was about to be made practical now by the two political parties has been in the offing for some time. He cited, as an example, a view that was reportedly openly expressed by the spokesman of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed as far back as September 20, 2021 in which he not only bragged that a Northerner will succeed Buhari as President, but went further to ask anyone that does not want a Northerner as President to leave the country in 2023.\n\nBlaming Southern politicians for continuing to play into the hands of those who do not want the best for Nigeria, Ajayi said: \u201cWhile we may be telling the North to stop the seeming emperor mentality that some of them have, Southern politicians also need to grow up and demonstrate that the interest of their people, much more than personal interests, matter to them.\u201d\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

          "text": "\n\n*President flays killing, orders thorough, impartial probe of incident\n\n*Victim\u2019s Whatsapp voice note shows alleged blasphemy is false\n\n* Atiku in facebook post, disowns Tweet condemning killing\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nThe Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), the Northern States Christian Elders Forum (NOSCEF) and the British government have condemned the murder of Deborah Samuel, a 200-level female student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, by some fanatical students of the same school for allegedly blaspheming Prophet Muhammad (SAW) in a Whatsapp post.\n\n\n\nThey are also demanding for the arrest and prosecution of all those responsible for the murder of Deborah, who was attacked and killed by the mob of fanatics that burnt her corpse at the school\u2019s premises last Thursday.\n\nLikewise, President Muhammadu Buhari strongly flayed the resort to self-help by the mob in Sokoto, resulting in violence, destruction and killing of Deborah.\n\n\n\nThe General Secretary of CAN, Joseph Daramola, in a statement yesterday said: \u201cThe vampires must be brought to book. The unlawful and dastardly action of the perpetrators must not only be condemned by all right-thinking people but the security operatives must fish them out, prosecute them as it is expected of them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is the failure of the security agencies and the government to rise up to such criminalities in the past that gave birth to terrorists and bandits. And as long as the State fails to bring these beasts and criminals amidst us to book so also the society will continue to be their killing fields.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge the swift reaction of His Eminence, Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III who not only condemned the criminal and religious intolerant action but also called on the security agencies to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe also call on all teachers and preachers of religious intolerance, extremism, and terrorism to repent before the wrath of God descends on them if the State failed to bring them to book. They are agents of death amidst us.\n\n\u201cWe recall the provocative and demeaning advertisement of the Sterling Bank where the bank compared the Resurrection of Jesus Christ to \u201cAgege bread\u201d, up till now, nobody was attacked and even the CAN leadership has accepted the apology tendered by its Managing Director, Abubakar Suleiman.\n\n\n\n\u201cKilling for any God in the name of blasphemy is ungodly, satanic, foolish, reprehensible, and totally unacceptable. This is not a Stone Age and Nigeria is not a Banana Republic. Nigeria remains a non-religious State where no religion is supreme to the other.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge and commend the restraint of the Christian students of the College who refused to embrace self-help and reprisal attacks on those who murdered their colleague. It is our prayer that those vampires in religious garments will not push the country to a religious war.\n\n\u201cThis is why both the government and the security agencies must stop treating them with kid gloves. Enough is enough.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Northern Christian Elders in a statement by its Chairman, Ejoga Inalegwu, in Kaduna yesterday, called on the government to immediately apprehend and make an example of those who perpetrated the dastardly act.\n\nThe Christian group noted that anything short of apprehending and prosecuting those involved in the heinous act was unacceptable.\n\n\n\nAccording to them, the act was purely a murder in the robe of religion.\n\nThe group said, \u201cThe death of Debora Yakubu (Samuel) is one too many by mobs wearing a cloak of religion in the North. In a country where there is a law, nobody, group or individuals has a right to take another\u2019s life whatsoever, outside the due process of law.\n\n\u201cWe also urge the government to make a public example and make a new statement by quickly bringing the perpetrators to book.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis should not be the usual rhetoric of condemnations and then the case is swept under the carpet with publicised arrests, no prosecution or jaundiced prosecution and letting off the hook, when the outcries die down.\n\n\u201cOne day it is the videoed execution of Christians in the North because of a said killing of a terrorist in Syria, and next what should have been an internal WhatsApp class platform chat results in mob action murder, wearing the robe of religion in our dear North.\u201d\n\nBuhari Flays Killing\n\nThe President, in a reaction to the incident via a release issued by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, said the news of the killing of Deborah by fellow students was a matter of concern and demanded an impartial, extensive probe into all that happened before and during the incident.\n\n\n\nHe noted that Muslims all over the world demand respect for the Holy Prophets, including Isah (Alaihissalaam, Jesus Christ) and Muhammad (SAW) but where transgressions occur, as alleged to be the case in this instance, the law does not allow anyone to take matters into their hands.\n\n\n\n\u201cMoreover, religious leaders preach that it is not for the believer to judge the actions of another person. The constituted authority must be allowed to deal with such matters when they arise.\n\n\u201cNo person has the right to take the law into his or her own hands in this country. Violence has and never will solve any problem,\u201d said the President.\n\n\n\nPresident Buhari also directed the Ministries of Information and Culture, Police Affairs and that of Communications and Digital Economy to work with GSM providers and Tech companies to help contain the spread of false and inflammatory information through social media.\n\nHe extended the nation\u2019s condolences to the family of the deceased student and called for tampered comments by the media and calm among the general population while investigation is ongoing to find out the remote and immediate causes of the incident.\n\nBritish Government\n\nThe British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing has condemned the killing of Deborah.\n\nIn a tweet yesterday, Laing said the authorities must ensure that the perpetrators of the act are brought to justice.\n\n\u201cI condemn the murder of Deborah Samuel in Sokoto, and urge the police and relevant authorities to ensure the perpetrators of this horrific act are made to face justice in line with the law,\u201d she wrote.\n\nTambuwal Meets Sokoto Ulama, Kukah\n\nThe Sokoto State Governor, Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal has met with a broad spectrum of Muslim leaders in the state to deliberate on the way to maintain peace and harmony amongst its citizens\n\nA statement by his media office said Tambuwal met with Bishop of Sokoto Catholic Diocese, Mathew Kukah, among others.\n\nThe statement said that the governor had to cut short his various official engagements in Abuja, to rush to Sokoto in view of the importance of the various consultations.\n\nVictim\u2019s Whatsapp Voice Note Shows Alleged Blasphemy is False\n\nThe purported reason Deborah was killed and her body burnt by the mob has been found to be false.\n\nDeborah had shared a voice note on her class Whatsapp group in which she challenged her colleagues who were posting religious information there.\n\n\n\nShe spoke in Hausa. According to a Twitter user who did the translation, Deborah was quoted to have said: \u201cHoly Ghost Fire, nothing\u2019s going to happen to me, you should know what to be sending to this group, it\u2019s not that the group was created to be sending nonsense, the group was created for posting things like, test, assignment e.t.c. not the nonsense you are posting, no be only prophet, you are coming to play on me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe nonsense she apparently referred to were the religious posts.\n\nHer comments were said to have irked some of her colleagues who felt she disrespected Prophet Mohammed, and threatened to deal with her. When the tension was high, the school authorities took her to the security room to give her some protection. However, the enraged students overpowered the security officers, dragged Deborah out, and beat her until she died before setting her corpse on fire.\n\n\n\nFormer President of the Senate, Anyim Pius Anyim also condemned, in the strongest terms, the gruesome and unlawful killing of Deborah.\n\nIn a statement he personally signed, Anyim decried the killing of Deborah as cruel, illegal, callous and inhuman.\n\nAnyim said: \u201cThere is no place in a modern Democracy such as Nigeria for jungle justice and killing of human beings illegally. We cannot afford now to add religious intolerance to the plethora of problems bedevilling our country.\u201d\n\nAtiku Distances Self from Deborah Tweet\n\nPresidential hopeful, Atiku Abubakar, has distanced himself from a tweet condemning the lynching of Deborah.\n\nAtiku, who is running for President on the platform of the PDP, had taken to Twitter on Thursday to condemn the mob action, saying, \u201cThere cannot be a justification for such gruesome murder. Deborah Yakubu was murdered and all those behind her death must be brought to justice. My condolences to her family and friends.\u201d\n\nThe former Vice-President, however, came under threats from some Muslim northerners who threatened not to vote for him if he emerges as the Presidential candidate of the PDP.\n\n\n\nHowever, Atiku later deleted the tweet amid the threats.\n\nOn Facebook yesterday, the former Vice President in a message on his verified Hausa page distanced himself from the message. He also stated that any message on social media that did not come with the initials \u201cA. A.\u201d were not his.\n\n\u201cThis evening I received information that a post was made that doesn\u2019t agree with my orders. I use this to announce that any post without A. A. is not from me. May God protect us,\u201d he wrote in Hausa.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Ngige backs out as Amaechi, Malami, Akpabio, Onu, Sylva, Ogah, Tallen, Alasoadura, Nwajiuba bow out\n\n\n\nDeji Elumoye and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has promised to quickly replace nine members of his cabinet that resigned to contest various elective offices in next year\u2019s general election.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, disclosed this to State House Correspondents shortly after the President held a valedictory meeting with the retiring ministers at the Presidential Villa, Abuja yesterday.\n\nThe ministers that resigned were: Abubakar Malami, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice; Godswill Akpabio (Niger Delta Affairs); Rotimi Amaechi (Transportation); Ogbonnaya Onu (Science, Technology and Innovation); Pauline Tallen (Women Affairs); Timipre Sylva (State, Petroleum Resources); Uche Ogar (State, Mines and Steel Development), and Tayo Alasoadura (State, Niger Delta Affairs).\n\n\n\nThough the Minister of Labour and Productivity, Chris Ngige was at the valedictory meeting, he issued a formal statement after the event to say that he had not resigned because he had pulled out of the Presidential race and notified the President.\n\nLai Mohammed at the press briefing announced that Buhari said he would immediately fill the vacancies created by the exodus of the nine ministers.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe ministers will be replaced very soon without delay, he (The President) said so. I don\u2019t know about reshuffling. He said the vacancies would be replaced very soon.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that on Wednesday, Mr. President directed and I informed you that all ministers and other political appointees aspiring to contest for elective offices in 2023 general elections, should resign their current appointments.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis morning, there was a valedictory service for 10 members of the Federal Council who have indicated their desire to aspire for higher offices. Nine of them were present and the 10th was absent with an apology.\n\n\u201cMr. President used the occasion to thank the outgoing members of cabinet for their sacrifices and services. Mr. President also in addition to wishing them success in their endeavour, also expressed the confidence that given the expertise, the experience and what they must have garnered during their years in office, they, like other aspirants, were fully equipped to run the affairs of the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course, Mr. President also admonished the remaining members of the Cabinet that the journey is still far. And that they should all redouble their efforts, be more diligent and be more committed to the success of the administration. At the end of which the outgoing ministers had a group photograph with Mr. President and also with the Chief of Staff and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation.\u201d\n\n\n\nAsked if all the ministers had tendered their resignations, he said, \u201cWell. Mr. President said some have and others are in the process of doing so. But he thanked everybody for their compliance.\u201d\n\nOn whether the Ministers can return to their positions if they abruptly change their minds Mohammed noted, \u201cOnly Mr. President can say that.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019m just sticking to the speech of Mr. President and so I don\u2019t want to speculate what can happen and what cannot happen. But Mr. President\u2019s speech was very clear. He thanked the outgoing ministers for their sacrifice and contribution.\u201d\n\nThe Valedictory Session\n\nAt the valedictory session held at the State House, Abuja, the President assessed the nine outgoing members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) and declared that many of them were eminently qualified to succeed him in May, 2023.\n\n\n\nBuhari said: \u201cI am happy to note that a significant number of cabinet members have become sufficiently equipped to aspire to higher elective offices, including the Office of the President. This shows the impact of the experience gathered while serving as members of the Federal Executive Council.\n\n\u201dI have no doubt that if the next President emerges from among former members of this cabinet, like any other aspirant, ample competence and outstanding service delivery would be on display. This will be part of our legacies to Nigerians.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuhari, who commended the departing public officers for serving the nation sacrificially, \u201dwith dignity and honour\u201d, had at the last FEC meeting on Wednesday, May 11, 2022 directed that all Ministers and other political appointees who aspire to contest for elective offices in the 2023 general election should resign their current appointments.\n\nHe said: \u201dI note that some have complied while others are in the process of doing so. I would like to use this opportunity to commend your decision and courage to contest for elective offices and your compliance with my directive.\n\n\n\n\u201dI also wish to thank you for your invaluable services to this nation through your contributions as Cabinet members. I wish you success in the upcoming elections and in your future endeavours.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari told the ministers that looking back as the head of the team over the years, he had fond memories of incisive and robust discussions during cabinet meetings, rendering of performance reports during special sessions and presidential retreats.\n\n\n\nNoting that the departure of some cabinet members had undoubtedly created a vacuum that should be filled, the President said appointments would be made without delay so that the business of governance will not suffer.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the outgoing ministers, Godswill Akpabio, expressed gratitude to the President for giving them the opportunity to serve and contribute their quota to nation building.\n\n\u201cAs we step aside from FEC, I want you to know that you have disciples in us. I want you to know that it is time for us to propagate Buharism.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want you to know that we are going to be working closely with the Minister of Information and Culture to take your message of transformation, love, patience, and administrative sagacity to Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Niger Delta Minister told the President that from his interactions with colleagues, leaving the cabinet was like the story of the Spanish play of \u201csadness and joy.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added: \u201cSadness in the sense that we are going to miss the continuous daily and weekly interaction with a father and learning from him; joy because we now have an opportunity to go to the wider audience in Nigeria to speak more of your achievements for this country.\n\n\u201cMay one of us succeed you in order to continue the good legacies you have laid on ground. We have seen and know your vision. We know where you want the country to be.\u201d\n\nNwajiuba, who had earlier tendered his resignation, was not present at the valedictory session.\n\n\n\nNgige Backs Out\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment Chris Ngige has formally pulled out of the 2023 presidential race.\n\nIn a statement signed by Ngige, he said: \u201cHaving also consulted widely with my family, constituents, supporters and well-wishers, it is my pleasure to announce the withdrawal of my interest and earlier decision to contest the office of the President in the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cAs a result of this, I will not be participating in any of the internal party processes of the said election, starting with the primary.\n\n\n\n\u201cI took this momentous decision firstly in the overall interest of the nation, in order to enable me concentrate on my job, and assist the President and the government weather the difficult last lap, in the life of the administration and secondly for other family reasons.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have since communicated this decision to the President and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation.\u201d\n\nNgige also said his constituents, political associates and well-wishers across the country are by this statement informed of his latest decision, which also has the blessing and support of the overwhelming majority, hence supersedes any other interest, personal or otherwise.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "24-Hours After Presidential Directive to Political Appointees to Resign, Emefiele Meets Buhari",
          "text": "\n\n* AGF, INEC, honour court summon as PDP, others join CBN governor\u2019s suit *Court orders accelerated hearing\n\n*FG directs ministers, heads of agencies, ambassadors, other appointees nursing political ambitions in 2023 to resign\n\n*Afenifere hails Buhari, charges him to be decisive too in tackling Nigeria\u2019s problems\n\nDeji Elumoye, Alex Enumah and Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nTwenty-four hours after President Muhammadu Buhari advised political appointees desirous of running for elective offices to resign on or before May 16, 2022, and hours after the Secretary to Government of the Federation issued a circular directing heads of government agencies with political ambitions to also resign, the Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday met with the president at the State House, Abuja behind closed doors.\n\n\n\nThough he was not forthcoming on details of his discussion with the President when State House correspondents asked for his reaction to the president\u2019s directive that appointees interested in 2023 election should resign, Emefiele merely said he had no news for the reporters, but there would be news later.\n\nHis words: \u201cThere is no news now, but there will be news. You heard me, I said there is no news but there will be news.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen further told that international community as well as Nigerians are interested in his position as regards the presidential directive, the CBN Governor stressed that he was not bothered that some people were going to have heart attack, but that he was having fun while those concerned were free to have heart attack.\n\nMeanwhile, there was a new twist yesterday as the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and two others joined in the suit filed by Emefiele, seeking court\u2019s determination of his right to participate in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThis is just as the federal government has issued a circular directing serving ministers in the cabinet, heads of government agencies, ambassadors and other political appointees of the administration, coveting political ambitions in 2023 to resign from the government.\n\n\n\nAlso, yesterday, the Pan Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, lauded the presidential directive that all political appointees interested in the 2023 general elections should resign their appointments forthwith.\n\nOn the suit filed by Emefiele, the court had on Monday adjourned to Thursday to enable the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) appear before it to explain why the court should not restrain them from preventing the CBN Governor from realising his political ambition by participating in all the processes leading to the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe summoning of INEC and AGF was sequel to a motion exparte argued by Emefiele\u2019s lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, to restrain the two defendants from taking any step that would jeopardise the interest of his client.\n\n\n\nRuling in the ex parte, Justice Mohammed had ordered the CBN Governor to serve all court processes in relation to the suit he filed against INEC and the AGF who were the 1st and 2nd defendants respectively.\n\nHowever, when the matter was called yesterday. both INEC and AGF were in court in line with the court\u2019s order.\n\nHowever, instead of proceeding with the case of the CBN Governor, two lawyers stood up to announce appearances for their clients.\n\n\n\nFirst was a Senior advocate of Nigeria, Chief Sebastiane Hon, who informed the court of the intention of his client, the PDP to join as an interested party, which was immediately followed by one John Martins and Olukunle Ebun, who told the court that they were suing for themselves and on behalf of the Save Nigeria our Fatherland.\n\nResponding, Emefiele\u2019s lawyer, who did not oppose the applicants joining the suit, undertook to serve the applicants with all processes within 24 hours.\n\n\n\nWhile INEC through its lawyer, Mr. Ibrahim Inuwa, SAN, did not also oppose the application for joinder, that of the AGF, Mr. Dipo Okpeseyi, SAN, did and urged the court to ensure that only proper parties should be allowed to join in the matter.\n\nIn a short ruling, the court joined the PDP, John Martins and Olukunle Ebun as 3rd, 4th and 5th defendants respectively.\n\n\n\nJustice Mohammed in addition ordered accelerated hearing on the matter, adding that while the 1st and 2nd defendants were directed to respond to the plaintiff\u2019s suit within Monday and Tuesday, the 3rd to 5th defendants have up till Wednesday next week to respond and the plaintiff, 24 hours to reply on point of law.\n\nJustice Mohammed subsequently adjourned to May 23, for parties to adopt their final written addresses.\n\nJustice Mohammed while warning that the court would not entertain any request for extension of time since all parties have pledged to the accelerated hearing of the matter, also warned parties not to take any step that would undermine the proceedings.\n\n\n\nEmefiele had amongst others approached the Federal High Court for an Order restraining the defendants from preventing or hindering his participating in the process of the presidential election slated for February next year.\n\nHe expressed the fear that any political party he chooses to affiliate with in realising his political ambition may disqualify him based on the provisions of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022, which had barred political appointees from participating in the congresses and conventions of political parties unless the resigned 30 days to such conventions and congresses.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, he argued that by virtue of being a public servant he cannot be barred from participating in the political primaries of political parties by Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nHe submitted that constitutional provisions stipulated that he can only resign his appointment as Governor of CBN 30 days to the presidential election which he is interested in contesting.\n\n\n\nAmongst the court processes he filed before the court was an application for maintenance of status, which he predicated on the fact that he would be prejudiced against or hurt if the court does not restrain the defendants from taking any step that would jeopardise his desire to contest the presidential election.\n\nArguing the motion for maintenance of status quo, Emefiele\u2019s lawyer, Ozekhome had told the court that Emefiele, \u201cis in a delimma\u201d as to whether he can run in the forthcoming presidential election.\n\n\n\nAccording to Ozekhome, time is of utmost importance, following the fact that timeline for collection of nomination and expression of interest forms ends on Wednesday May 11.\n\nOzekhome in addition told the court that timeline for the primaries and congresses of political parties have been fixed for May 30 to June 1, and unless the court intervened there will be a carriage of great injustice against his client.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe needs the protection of the court, the court needs to ensure that nobody does anything that will hurt him\u201d, the senior lawyer submitted, adding that if the court refused to grant the order for maintenance of status quo restraining the defendants from hindering Emefiele from participating in the primary election under a political party of his choice within this period, the case would amount to a mere academic exercise by the time parties return to the court.\n\nFG Asks Ministers, Heads of Agencies, Ambassadors, Other Appointees Nursing Political Ambitions in 2023 to Resign\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government\u2019s circular, dated May 11, 2022, with Ref. No.SGF/OP/l/S.3/Xll/173, a copy which was sighted by THISDAY, was issued by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha.\n\nThe circular was addressed to all serving ministers, Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, National Security Adviser, Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria, Chairman, Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission, Chairman, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Chairman, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service and heads of extra-ministerial departments, Directors-General/Chief Executive Officers of parastatals, agencies and government-owned companies among others.\n\n\n\nIn the circular, Mustapha stated that President Muhammadu Buhari had observed and noted the expression of interest and intention by some members of the Federal Executive Council, Heads of Extra-Ministerial departments, agencies, parastatals of government, ambassadors and other political office holders to contest the upcoming presidential, gubernatorial, National and State Assemblies\u2019 elections.\n\n\n\nHe said the president had directed that the affected office holders aspiring to run for various offices in the 2023 General Elections, should tender their resignation on or before Monday, May 16, 2022.\n\n\n\nThe SGF said for smooth running of the machinery of government and the country\u2019s foreign missions, the affected ministers are to hand over to the Ministers of State where they exist or to the Permanent Secretary, where there is no Minister of State.\n\nAlso all ambassadors are to hand over to their Deputy Heads of Mission or the most Senior Foreign Service Officer in line with established practices.\n\n\n\n\u201cSimilarly, Heads of Extra-Ministerial Departments, Agencies and Parastatals are to hand over to the most senior Director/Officer as may be peculiar to the organisation, in line with the service wide Circular No. SGF.50/S. Il/C.2/268 of 4th December, 2017,\u201d the circular added. The SGF said the circular and the incidental directives take effect immediately.\n\nAfenifere Hails Buhari\u2019s Directive for Ministers, Others to Resign\n\nHowever, Afenifere National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, said the directive given by Buhari on political appointees and the promptness of its execution demonstrated that he could be decisive where and when he wants to and on matters that touch his heart.\n\n\n\nWhile conceding that the resignation of those interested in contesting would provide a level playing ground for all contestants, Afenifere spokesman called on the president to apply the same decisiveness with which he charged his appointees to resign also in tackling the myriads of challenges facing the country to avert a slide into anarchy.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe gusto with which the order of President Muhammadu Buhari on political appointees to resign if they intend to contest in the forthcoming elections was carried out indicated that he seems to be comfortable with those other aspects of governance that Nigerians are complaining about because of the pains they are suffering.\n\n\n\n\u201cWere he to be disturbed by and concerned about those things that are bothering Nigerians he would have brought the same swiftness to bear on those areas. It makes it difficult for one to agree with the notion that he does not have the power or capacity to deal with at least some of the major problems Nigerians are battling with.\n\n\u201cHe has failed to deal with them only because he did not consider them as problematic as the rest of us are considering them.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added that unfortunately, those who are close to the president and could make him see the challenges realistically failed to do so either because they were afraid or profiting from the anomalies going on or both.\n\n\u201cFor example, what stops the President from providing all that is needed by the security agencies in the country to put a stop to terrorism and insecurity going on in the country? What stops him from ensuring that the Ministries of Education and Labour provide the wherewithal for the smooth running of our universities in line with the proposition that the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) have been making for several years? What stops President Buhari from breathing life back into the moribund four refineries in the country or build new ones?\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere spokesman argued that the issue of non-availability of fund should no longer be an excuse, saying after all, his party raised several billions of naira in less than two weeks just to express interests in running for offices.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the ruling party could raise such a huge sum within so short a time, why is government finding it difficult to raise the N200 billion required to make our educational institutions at tertiary level worthy of its name? Between contest for elective offices and education of the country, which should be more important?\u201d, Ajayi asked.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A multi-million naira mansion belonging to Prince Joseph Kpokpogri, estranged lover of controversial Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh, has been demolished by the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) in Abuja.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the mansion, which is in the Asokoro area, was invaded on Saturday at about 8am by officials of the FCT Administration with a bulldozer which began to demolish the building.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters, the owner of the building, Kpokpogri and ex-lover of Dikeh, expressed shock saying he was not pre-informed by the officials about the demolition which he described as illegal.\n\n\"I don't have any issue with anybody that will warrant the wicked and illegal destruction of my house this morning without any pre-notice from the FCT ministry. Is it because I am from the Niger Delta region of the country? I just woke up this morning and saw the ministry officials, security men and a bulldozer and the next thing I saw was my fence being brought down.\n\n\u201cThey entered my compound and began to demolish my house; as we talk, my swimming pool is gone, a bungalow in my compound is also down. And any moment from now, the full mansion, which cost me over N700million, my hard-earned money, will soon be brought down and I don't know the offence I have committed and I don't know who is behind this.\n\n\"None of the officials want to speak with me and I am only being told now that the FCT minister, Muhammad Bello, sent them to come and demolish my house that a road will be passing through my house.

And any moment from now, the full mansion, which cost me over N700million, my hard-earned money, will soon be brought down and I don't know the offence I have committed and I don't know who is behind this.\n\n\"None of the officials want to speak with me and I am only being told now that the FCT minister, Muhammad Bello, sent them to come and demolish my house that a road will be passing through my house. My house was approved, I paid for everything, I am not owing the federal government a dime. Before now, about five northerners had approached me to sell my house to them but I refused.

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Google unveils first smartwatch, new phones, virtual cards and more",
          "text": "Google on Wednesday and Thursday held its annual developer conference where it revealed an expanded line of new products and services.\n\nAt its first in-person developer conference in 3 years, the tech giant announced 3 new smartphones and its first in-house smartwatch as well as plans to release a new tablet next year. Google also announced updates to several of its most popular tools including Maps, Google Translate and its core search product.\n\nHere are some major announcements made:\n\nNew Pixel Watch and Pixel phones\n\nIn 2019, Fitbit was acquired by Google for $2.1 billion, a move many saw as a hint that Google was planning to go head-on with the likes of Apple and Samsung, which are already market leaders in smartwatches.\n\nTwo years later, Google has finally launched its first in-house built watch. The Pixel watch can be paired with Android devices only and is 4G-compatible, which means it can function on its own without being near a phone\u2014but to do this it requires its own data plan.\n\nThe tech giant did not reveal a price for the wearable, but it said it would be a \u201cpremium product\u201d when it launches in the 4th quarter of the year.\n\nThere are already many third-party Android watches which run on Google\u2019s Wear operating system but so far Google has not had its own device until now.\n\nAs part of its annual tradition, Google announced its new mid-tier phone, the Pixel 6A. It also unveiled its next flagship phones: the Pixel 7 Pro with a triple rear camera system and the Pixel 7 with two rear cameras.\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, Google announced that it\u2019s getting back to releasing tablets after announcing that it will be focusing solely on building in 2019. The new Android tablet is set to be released in 2023.\n\nUpdated Search and Maps\n\nSource: Google\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that Google processes approximately 63,000 search queries every second, 5.6 billion searches per day and approximately 2 trillion global searches per year. Google search which started from only text queries has over the years added the option to use voice and picture queries options.\n\nNow Google\u2019s new multi-search feature\u2014Multi-search Near Me\u2014allows users to search using text and images at the same time. The tech giant pointed out that the use cases for this feature include searching for a meal or outfit, and finding local results from restaurants, retailers and more.\n\nSource: Google\n\nFor a long time, Google Map has been the most popular Map app in the world, helping people around the world including Africans navigate through cities and rural areas. Now it\u2019s getting a new feature that allows users to view their cities in a more immersive way.\n\nThe new feature, immersive view, fuses together Street View and aerial imagery in order to offer a digital model of the world and a new way to explore cities, key landmarks, restaurants, venues, and other places of interest.\n\nGoogle maps\u2019 new immersive view for cities comes off as a challenger to Apple\u2019s 3D mode map view. In addition to this, Maps also now offers to find the most fuel-efficient route to get there with eco-friendly routing and offer users the ability to access Google Maps Live View in other third-party apps with the ARCore Geospatial API.\n\nVirtual cards\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nGoogle is rolling out virtual credit cards to help protect users\u2019 financial information while they\u2019re shopping online. The feature generates a virtual card number that users can autofill instead of their actual card information on Android mobile devices or in Google\u2019s Chrome browser, masking their real credit card number from the companies they\u2019re shopping from. These virtual cards are typically used for one-time purchases, but users will also be able to use these cards for subscriptions.\n\nVirtual cards will roll out this summer initially only for US users with Visa, Mastercard American Express and Capital One credit cards.\n\nTranslation and AR glasses\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nGoogle Translate has added support for 24 additional languages, bringing the total number of languages the product supports to 133.\n\nOver 300 million people across Africa, Asia and South America speak these newly-added languages. 10 of the 24 new languages added to Google Translate are spoken in Ghana, Togo, Sierra Leone, Mali, South Africa, Eritrea, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Namibia, Uganda and Zimbabwe.\n\nClosely related to this announcement was Google unveiling Augmented Reality (AR) glasses that hint it plans to join companies like Snap and Meta who have AR glasses ambitions. Google showed off a pair of AR glasses that were capable of real-time translation during a conversation. The tech giant revealed no details on whether this will be a product people can buy.\n\nGoogle\u2019s first attempt at creating smart glasses was roughly a decade ago, but it didn\u2019t take off as expected due to its limited launch, high initial pricing and privacy concerns.\n\nAds and user privacy\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nGoogle made a set of security and privacy announcements which will roll out later in the year.\n\nA notable one is the My Ad Centre hub, a new control centre that will give users more control and visibility over how their ads are personalised across Google\u2019s apps and sites, including Google Search, YouTube, and the Discover feed in Google app.\n\nIt\u2019ll let users customise the types of ads they see by selecting from a range of topics they are interested in or opt to see fewer ads on a given topic. For example, if you want to see fewer ads about fashion, you can indicate.\n\nThe hub will also make it easier for users to request that their personal information such as phone numbers, email and home addresses be scrubbed from search results.\n\nThese announcements come after Google reported its 2022 Q1 revenue which was up 23% from the same period last year, reaching $68 billion, while its net profit dropped to $16.4 billion compared to last year\u2019s $17.9 billion.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank edges close to eNaira use case with much-needed upgrade",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank digital currency (CBDC), eNaira, will get an update that will allow it to perform more functions such as bill payment and USSD access.\n\nThis was revealed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Lagos Branch Controller, Bariboloka Koyor, during a sensitisation campaign on the eNaira in Oshodi, Lagos.\n\nAccording to Vanguard, Koyor said, \u201cstarting from next week, there will be an upgrade on the eNaira Speed Wallet app that will allow you to do transactions such as paying for DStv or electric bills or even paying for flight tickets.\u201d\n\nWhat was wrong with the eNaira?\n\nChimezie Chuta, Founder, Blockchain Nigeria User Group (BNUG), told Techpoint Africa on a phone call that the upgrade had been in the works for a while.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Chuta, the CBDC, which launched in October 2021, had to go through a complete rework as some inconsistencies were revealed.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, there were faults that would not have allowed the eNaira to achieve its full potential.\u201d\n\nThere were issues with setting up the eNaira Speed Wallet application at launch. In a test I conducted after the launch, the app had trouble verifying my BVN, which made using the application impossible.\n\nHowever, news by This Day, in December 2021, said the eNaira was getting rapid acceptance among Nigerians. It said the eNaira Speed Wallet app had reached over 600 thousand downloads eight weeks after launch, and \u20a643 million worth of transactions had been carried out just weeks after launch.\n\nPwC\u2019s 2022 CBDC Global Index also reported that the CBN leads global CBDC retail projects. Retail CBDC projects refer to digital currencies designed for public use instead of wholesale projects such as China\u2019s CBDC \u2014 the e-CNY \u2014 created for institutional usage.\n\nAccording to the Index, over 35,000 transactions have been completed on the eNaira, which was downloaded in 160 countries.\n\nWhile the Index lauds the eNaira, a Twitter poll conducted by Intelligence by Techpoint \u2014 Techpoint Africa\u2019s data and Intelligence arm \u2014 in April 2022 said otherwise. The poll had votes from 157 Twitter users, 36.9% (58) of which voted \u201cI don\u2019t own a Wallet.\u201d\n\nNigeria's eNaira adoption\n\nWhat have you done with the eNaira Speed Wallet since its launch?\n\n\n\nKindly vote and retweet. Advertisement April 7, 2022\n\nInterestingly, 27.4% (38) of those who own a wallet had never used it. Only 1.3% had completed a transaction with the eNaira Wallet, while 34.4% were indifferent about the CBDC project.\n\nChuta, however, justified the issues eNaira faced after it launched by saying the \u201cindustry and the technology are still young, so it is normal to go back to the drawing board.\u201d While he cannot point at specific errors, Chuta reiterates that there was a need to rework the project.\n\nWhat will the eNaira upgrade do?\n\nIn addition to bill payments, the eNaira will be accessible via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD). Per Vanguard, Koyor told business owners and market leaders that the USSD code for the eNaira (*997#) would make onboarding more Nigerians easier.\n\nThe Guardian also reported on Friday, May 6, 2022, that fintech could explore investment opportunities with the eNaira. Yusuf Jelil, Principal Manager and Business Lead for the eNaira project, said that the CBN, along with fintech startups, is looking to explore investment opportunities with the eNaira.\n\nHow eNaira USSD could work\n\nWhile there\u2019s little detail on how the eNaira will work with USSD, we can make educated guesses on how the service will work based on our understanding of the eNaira and USSD protocols in Nigeria.\n\nUSSD integration with the eNaira could mean that feature phone users can now use the digital currency without Internet connectivity. This includes setting up a wallet and sending and receiving eNaira.\n\nAccording to the CBN, the first tier of Speed Wallet users can set up a wallet without a Bank Verification Number (BVN). However, they will have a daily transaction limit of \u20a650,000 ($121.50).\n\nA National Identification Number (NIN) will be required in place of the BVN. Given that 71 million Nigerians have their NINs \u2014 17 million more than the 54 million registered BVNs \u2014 more people get access to financial services without going to a physical bank branch.\n\nIt is, however, important to note that the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has been unable to verify NINs, leaving 7.5 million MTN subscribers disconnected.\n\nFacilitating eNaira transactions via USSD also raises the question of who bears the consent charge, a question that stands in the way of free transactions, the eNaira\u2019s biggest value proposition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

If you can remind me \u2014 because I\u2019ve been mentioning it for a week now \u2014 you\u2019ll have all my money this weekend.\n\n$5,000. Yeah, you read that right. So, I had a dream last night and won a singing competition. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Don\u2019t mind me; I\u2019m only joking. My voice is terrible. You don\u2019t want to hear me sing. (Editor\u2019s note: You really don\u2019t.)\n\nHowever, I\u2019m happy. I mean, it\u2019s the weekend again. Aren\u2019t you glad?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, today is Techpoint Africa Pitch Friday! Now, you remember, huh?\n\nTechpoint Africa will host entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts at 43b Emina Crescent, Opebi, Allen, Ikeja by 5 p.m.\n\nWho knows, maybe you\u2019ll meet your next startup co-founder or be inspired to start your own. Don\u2019t pass it up for anything. Kindly register here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAre there many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\nInterswitch\u2019s $110m\n\nSafaricom\u2019s plan to launch M-PESA Junior Accounts\n\nAre there many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat comes to mind when you hear the term \u201cfintech,\u201d especially since every Tom, Dick, and Harry wants to start a fintech startup that \u201cbanks the unbanked\u201d? Digital payments? Lending? Just those two?\n\nPerhaps now\u2019s a good time to ask how many fintech startups you know do not provide lending and payment options in Nigeria. None? Just a few?\n\nIf you believe that fintechs are limited to just those two, I just might hold a fintech Masterclass. For the right amount, of course.\n\nSimply put, fintech \u2014 the combination of the words \u201cfinancial\u201d and \u201ctechnology\u201d \u2014 is the incorporation of technology into the offerings of financial services companies to improve their usability and delivery to customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does it function? It primarily works by disaggregating offerings like digital lending, payments, blockchain, and digital wealth management, while creating new markets for them.\n\nFurther, it refers to a wide range of financial activities that can be performed without the assistance of a person, like money transfers, check depositing with your smartphone, bypassing a bank branch to apply for credit, raising funds for a business startup, or managing your investments.\n\nBut seriously, do you think Nigerian startups primarily offer payment and lending services?\n\nChimgozirim probably has answers to your many questions concerning this. Please read his story here: Does Nigeria have too many fintech startups? What the numbers say\n\nY Combinator in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Y Combinator\u2019s (YCs) website, 3,657 startups had gone through the California-based technology startup\u2019s accelerator programme as of W22 \u2014 its Winter cohort.\n\nIntelligence by Techpoint, the data and research arm of Techpoint Africa, has partnered with YC to give an account of its activities in Africa since 2009. Above is a snippet of the report titled Y Combinator in Africa: A report about African startups that have gone through Y Combinator\u2019s Accelerator Programme.\n\nInterswitch\u2019s 110m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterswitch, an African payments company, has announced an investment from LeapFrog Investments and Tana Africa Capital.\n\nAlthough Interswitch has not confirmed the amount it received from the firms, TechCrunch, reports it at $110 million, but says \u201cthe precise terms of the transaction have not been disclosed.\u201d When asked about the investment and Interswitch\u2019s new valuation, a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch, \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on that for the time being.\u201d\n\nSo, what does the company do? Founded in 2002 by Mitchell Elegbe (CEO), Interswitch is an Africa-focused integrated digital payments and commerce company which facilitates the electronic exchange of money.\n\nThe fintech company is well known for its Point-of-Sale terminals and online consumer payment platforms like Quickteller and Verve. The company claims Verve is Africa\u2019s largest domestic debit card scheme, issuing over 35 million active cards since launch.\n\nThe funding will aid in its expansion across the continent and the provision of digital payment services.\n\nAlso, the funds will be used to support Interswitch\u2019s pan-African strategy, which includes acquiring new customers and developing new products to support a financial inclusion strategy.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in less than nine days!

Children are vulnerable to various risks due to the rapid industrial revolution and digitisation in Kenya and globally. Also, with access to the Internet via various devices, other hazards include child trafficking, prostitution, child pornography, trafficking, early age exposure to alcohol advertising, cyberbullying, and crimes like identity theft.\n\nConsequently, CA wants mobile network operators, broadcasters, internet service providers (ISPs), and content providers to implement policy and technical safeguards to protect minors.\n\nHowever, it appears that Safaricom is at odds with Kenya\u2019s CA with this plan. Well, the company has not revealed additional details on how the M-PESA Junior Accounts will work.\n\nAlso, the telco will launch a virtual debit card for international online payments.\n\nWhy? While some products, like Spotify, can be paid for directly with M-PESA, others, like Netflix, are unavailable, forcing customers to use bank-affiliated cards.\n\nAnd this causes some concern, particularly among those unwilling to do so for security or other reasons best known to them.\n\nFurther, per the World Bank Financial Inclusion Data, 72.9% of Kenyans have a mobile money account, and 26.1% buy and pay bills online. This means that over 14 million people buy and pay bills online.\n\nHowever, the products will be available before the end of June 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nWin up to \u20a61m when you participate in Credo\u2019s Social Payments Hackathon starting May 16, 2022.

          "title": "Does Nigeria have too many fintech startups? What the numbers say",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are at least 150 fintech startups in Nigeria, depending on who you ask. Statista reports that there were 144 fintech startups as of 2021 and a 2020 McKinsey report puts the number of standalone fintech startups at over 200. Ongoing research by our data arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, reveals there are at least 270 active startups in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the McKinsey report, most of these startups are focused on payments and lending. Consequently, it is not unusual to hear comments on the proliferation of fintech startups in the country, which begs the question, are there too many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\nWhy is every Nigerian startup entrepreneur trying to create a fin-tech startup. Why do I need a 1000 different ways to pay for my plantain? \u2014 Aniekan (@ObiHabbibi) May 10, 2022\n\nA common criticism in the fintech conversation is that too many startups are solving the same problem and barely moving the needle. The value proposition for many startups revolves around banking the unbanked and providing better (read faster) financial services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, even with all this, one could argue that financial services have only marginally improved, with most fintech services unable to offer superior services to traditional financial institutions.\n\nFor example, lending apps in Nigeria offer loans in minutes without requiring collateral for users. As impressive as this is, startups still have to contend with debt recovery. While a few startups report repayment rates in the 90th percentile, there are widespread reports of lending startups resorting to desperate measures to get their loans back.\n\nCustomer service is another aspect that fintech startups do not seem to have completely figured out. In a test conducted by the Techpoint Africa team, we discovered that traditional financial institutions did not fare badly in customer service compared to fintech startups. In fact, in some metrics, they fared better than fintech startups.\n\nThe mission to bank the unbanked, which is frequently bandied about, is also moving slowly, and only 54.6 million Nigerians have a BVN, a vital requirement for opening a bank account in Nigeria.\n\nAdmittedly, people can only register for their BVN at banks. Therefore, there is only so much fintech startups can do in this regard. Still, one must wonder if most startups have not opted to build replicas of existing solutions rather than going after new frontiers.\n\nToo many fintech startups?\n\nLooking at the numbers alone will suggest that there are too many fintech startups, so let\u2019s look at how Nigeria compares to other countries.\n\nWith 1.4 billion people, India is only second to China in population. It is also home to 6,636 fintech startups. The largest country in South America, Brazil, has 1,446 fintech startups for its 215 million inhabitants.\n\nIn the United States and the United Kingdom, we have two world\u2019s largest economies. While the United States has 8,775 fintech startups for its 334.6 million people, the United Kingdom has 1,600 fintech startups serving 68.5 million people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBelow is the ratio of fintech startups to the population of each country:\n\nIndia \u2013 1 fintech for 210,970 people\n\nBrazil \u2013 1 fintech for 148,686 people\n\nUnited States \u2013 1 fintech for 38,131 people\n\nUnited Kingdom \u2013 1 fintech for 27,200 people\n\nNigeria \u20131 fintech for 740,740 people\n\nOn this evidence, there aren\u2019t too many startups in Nigeria. Looking at the numbers, one could say that we need at least 1,000 more fintech startups in the country.\n\nWhile the focus is often on how well they have improved financial services in the country \u2014 a fair metric for assessment \u2014 perhaps we should look at other metrics like how many jobs they have created and the industries or services they power.\n\nTo bring financial services closer to the last mile, fintech startups have used an agency banking model that indirectly provides jobs for these agents. OPay, TeamApt, Paga, and CrowdForce are some of the startups with the most agents; between them, they have at least 434,000 agents.\n\nWhen you add the 770,000 and 120,000 agents from MoMo and First Mobile, respectively, it is clear that fintech startups are creating value.\n\nFintech startups also power other industries. A familiar example is PiggyVest, launched in 2016 to help users digitise their savings. A crucial part of their success was launching after Paystack did. If they had launched earlier, users would have had limited options to deposit money, which may have shut the business down.\n\neCommerce startups also benefit from fintech startups with a wide range of payment options provided for merchants, which would have been impossible just a few years ago.\n\nTo the moon\n\nRegardless of the progress made by fintech startups, one thing is sure; much more can be done. While the population of Nigerians with a bank account has steadily grown, a 2021 EFInA report reveals that only 45% of Nigerians are banked.\n\nSimilarly, it states that less than 30% of adult Nigerians have or use financial services from non-banking institutions. With most active fintech startups focused on payments and lending, there is still room for innovation in insurance, where 97% of Nigerians do not have health insurance, investments/wealth management, and cross border payments.\n\nWith a growing population, more players are needed to do the hard work of providing financial services to rural dwellers or improving the services currently available to urban dwellers. Either way, as a wise man once said, \u201cit is day one.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

As part of this partnership, MARA will become the official crypto partner of the Central African Republic and an advisor to the President on crypto strategy and planning.\n\nMARA\u2019s launch comes at a critical inflection point in Sub-Saharan Africa. Political and economic instability has led to devaluation of currencies across the region, while the current centralized financial system continues to present ongoing obstacles to the development of both local economies and individuals. As a result, food prices have doubled to tripled in some areas and created record-breaking interest rates. These tired systems have prompted a dire need for a decentralized alternative.\n\nMARA\u2019s mission is to become the portal to the crypto economy for the African population. While cutting-edge technologies such as cryptocurrency have shown incredible promise among Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s predominantly young and technologically-native population, there are considerable hurdles to using them. Many existing global exchanges cannot operate in the region due to regulatory challenges as well as difficulty reaching the African consumer in an authentic way. These barriers to access significantly restrict both the number of people who can participate in the crypto economy and the potential uses for digital currency in the region.\n\nThe MARA suite of products addresses a variety of essential crypto-finance needs while complying with local regulations and being built authentically for the African audience. MARA\u2019s products include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMARA Wallet \u2013 a brokerage app offering the crypto-curious user a friendly, distilled experience through which they can buy, send, sell and withdraw both fiat and crypto assets instantly and without any prior crypto knowledge.\n\n\u2013 a brokerage app offering the crypto-curious user a friendly, distilled experience through which they can buy, send, sell and withdraw both fiat and crypto assets instantly and without any prior crypto knowledge. Pro-Exchange \u2013 a full-feature cryptocurrency platform focused on experienced users that offers a comprehensive suite of trading options and technical analysis tools.\n\nMARA Chain \u2013 a layer-1 blockchain, powered by the native MARA token, that gives savvy developers a place to build decentralized applications that will help shape the future of the African crypto economy.\n\nThe MARA executive team is led by Chi Nnadi, Lucas Llin\u00e1s M\u00fanera, Dearg OBartuin, and Kate Kallot, and is joined by board advisors Kojo Annan and Tatiana Koffman.\n\n\u201cMARA\u2019s mission is to facilitate a more equitable distribution of capital by providing a decentralized alternative that spans across tribes, class, cultures, and countries,\u201d says Chi Nnadi, co-founder and CEO of MARA. \u201cOur goal is to close the gap in opportunities for Sub-Saharan individuals and establish a financial infrastructure that they can build their lives upon.\u201d\n\nUnlike its competitors from North America and Europe, MARA\u2019s onboarding, support, and ecosystem reflects the needs of Africans. KYC/AML is compliant to global standards, and is compatible with international financial regulations. Customer support is easily accessed and will be available in both local and international languages.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to partner with MARA as it embarks on building a digital financial system for Sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d says Schuster Tanger, Co-Founder of TQ Ventures. \u201cWith the right resources, this region has potential for mass adoption of cryptocurrency. To that end, the local knowledge and specialized skills of the MARA team is quite promising.\u201d\n\nMARA will initially launch in Kenya, Nigeria, and surrounding regions. The MARA Wallet app will be available in the App Store and Google Play stores. Pre-registered users will join a queue to enable early access on a first-come, first-served basis. Users can jump up the queue by referring others, and earn crypto rewards by doing so, while increasing their odds of winning additional prizes and rewards in the process. Once onboarded, the MARA Wallet will enable users to invest in crypto and send money to their family members in real time, without processing times or delays.\n\nAbout MARA\n\nMARA is building Africa\u2019s portal to the crypto economy through a Pan-African suite of products that addresses a variety of crypto-finance needs while complying with local regulations and being built authentically for the African audience. MARA will initially launch in Kenya and Nigeria, with a simplified user-friendly consumer app through which users can easily buy, sell, send, and withdraw cryptocurrencies. MARA will also launch a pro-exchange for experienced users who prefer a full set of trading options and technical analysis tools. The MARA Chain will launch later in 2022, giving savvy developers a place to build decentralized applications that will help shape the future of the African crypto economy. MARA\u2019s executive team includes former executives from Amazon, PayPal, Uber, NVIDIA, Founders Bank, Rappi, and more.

          "text": "Five things to know to start your Saturday\n\nBiden reassures Finland, Sweden of support over NATO decision\n\nFinland and Sweden have been given reassurances by President Joe Biden of the United States of America support over their decision to join NATO or not. This comes after threats by Russia to attack either country should they decide to join the US-backed NATO.\n\nWhile speaking to the press in Berlin, Germany, Sweden foreign minister Ann Linde said that outside of Russia who have strongly objected to her country joining NATO no other country not even Turkey has objected to it consideration joining the pact.\n\nToday, May 14, 2022, NATO foreign ministers are set to discuss the issue of enlargement considering Sweden and Finland\u2019s appeal to want to join the pact.\n\nThe information available to us, reveals that despite denial President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has expressed concern over Sweden and Finland\u2019s consideration to become members of NATO.\n\nMeanwhile, moves are currently ongoing to calm things down between the two superpowers as defence chiefs of US and Russia had their first call since the Russian invasion began. Officials at the defence headquarters told Bloomberg that the conversion was professional and full of mutual respect.\n\nCrypto Ponzi scheme on the rise, as tax investigators identify potential $1 billion crypto fraud\n\nIn an investigation that has been ongoing for some years now, tax officials cut across several countries have through effective collaboration identified more than 50 leads to potential crypto tax crimes. An investigation has even identified a $1 billion Ponzi scheme that has the potential to change the narrative in crypto investment.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, a group known as the J5, which comprises of top financial and criminal investigating officials from the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and the Netherlands met in London this week to not only discuss emerging trends in cross-border illegal crypto activity but to also share valuable intel about identifying these criminals and assisting their governments make laws to curb this ugly trend.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, Jim Lee, the US Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Chief of Criminal Investigation who spoke to reporters said, \u201cSome of these leads I\u2019m talking about, they involve individuals with significant NFT transactions revolving around potential tax or other financial crimes throughout our jurisdictions,\u201d.\n\nHe was emphatic about a particular lead that he believes \u201cappears to be a $1 billion Ponzi Scheme. That\u2019s billion with a B and this lead also touches every single J5 country.\u201d\n\nThis initiative comes as a much-needed relief to identifying and proffering solutions to growing threats of fraud and other risks in the crypto industry.\n\nThe cryptocurrency recent crash made the US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen encourage lawmakers to see the need to come up with new regulations to control the crypto industry.\n\nFor fraudulent crypto exchanges and Fintech companies, Lee assured the press that an important announcement on \u201csignificant targets\u201d will be made very soon.\n\nThis cross-border partnership was necessitated by the need to curtail technology influenced financial crimes and help governments design the relevant laws to keep up with the rapid pace in technology.\n\nNiels Obbink, of the Dutch Fiscal Information and Investigation Service, told reporters that NFTs has become one of the fastest-growing ways for cross-border money laundry activities.\n\n\u201cNFTs are one of the new modern digital ways of trade-based money laundering,\u201d\n\nRead also: The day i died\n\nSomali parliament to choose new president\n\nAs the nation prepares to choose its next president, Somalia\u2019s highly contested, long-delayed presidential vote will take place on Sunday \u201cbehind blast walls\u201d as two former presidents square it up to gather the most support from voting lawmakers.\n\nThe voting is expected to be carried \u201cbehind blast walls\u201d so as to protect lawmakers from Islamist attacks or meddling by factions within the security services, Reuters gathered.\n\nThe current president of Somalia, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed will be battling it up with 39 contenders who will be seeking to take up his job as President of the politically troubled nation.\n\nThe vote will be conducted in a heavily protected airport hangar as lawmakers cast their vote for their choice candidate and with members of the international community scheduled to observe proceedings.\n\nWhoever wins the election will inherit a lot of challenges starting with dealing with the effect of the worst drought in four decades, a violent conflict entering its fourth decade, clan feuds, and a power struggle between the government and federal member states, Reuters said.\n\nPresident Mohamed said when asked by a reporter what were his expectation about the upcoming election. He said, \u201cI am the most deserving person who can take Somalia to one man, one vote,\u201d\n\nDespite his unassuming self-assurances, some political analysts believe that his chances of securing the needed votes to secure his position has been affected by his political allies\u2019 failure to secure enough votes in the parliament last month.\n\nOther factors that may affect the president\u2019s chances include the attack by security forces loyal to the president on the life of a lawmaker. This is added to the \u201cface-off between African Union peacekeepers and security forces loyal to the president who blocked entries to the hangar.\u201d\n\nEurope looks to Africa for more gas as E&P scale up projects\n\nGas production in Africa is projected to hit 470 billion cubic meters by late 2030s, replacing the exact amount Russia supplies to Europe in 2022, this is according to Rystad Energy research, Rigzone said.\n\nDuring the early months of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, provoked by the insistence of Putin to exact his power on the sovereign state of Ukraine, the European Union decided to reduce its dependence by two-third on Russian gas by the end of this year alone.\n\nA move that has seen the EU drive to replace Russian supply from all over the world on overdrive.\n\nRigzone reported based on Rystad Energy research that even with the continent\u2019s unused potential, Africa still has a significant production potential. The continent with Algeria and Nigeria as its biggest gas producer is projected \u201cto increase its gas output from about 260 Bcm in 2022 to as much as 335 Bcm by the end of this decade.\u201d\n\nThe report stated that its modest immediate and mid-term projection can be surpassed only if investment on gas projects and production in the country can be increased.\n\nThe ongoing political impasse between Russia and the European Union driven mainly by the ongoing war in Ukraine has given Africa whose gas supply to Europe averages about 18 percent to replace the 62 percent Russian supply to Europe.\n\nDespite the challenges such as \u201c high development costs, challenges accessing financing, issues with fiscal regimes, and other above-the-ground risks\u201d the continent is likely to not only increase income but to drive investment in the entire oil and gas value chain.\n\nRigzone said that signals from oil and gas majors such as BP, Eni, Equinor, Shell, ExxonMobil, and Equinor indicate further investment in Africa, with several projects that were previously on ice \u2013 including LNG projects \u2013 as they consider restarting or accelerating previously shelved projects in response to rising global demand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe geopolitical situation in Europe is changing the landscape for risk globally. While LNG flows from the US are substantial, demand is much higher.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsian and European importers will need to consider African priorities as they develop projects, as many African producers are focusing on supplying energy locally as well as to intra-African markets along with catering to global markets.\u201d\n\n\u201cExisting pipeline infrastructure from Northern Africa to Europe and historical LNG supply relationships make Africa a strong alternative for European markets, post the ban on Russian imports,\u201d says Siva Prasad, senior analyst at Rystad Energy\n\nAlgeria and Nigeria have the chance to scale up their exports to Europe. With talks of a long-distance pipeline connecting gas fields in Nigeria to Algeria via the onshore Trans Saharan Gas Pipeline (TSGP) and the offshore Nigeria Morocco Gas Pipeline (NMGP) the chance to drive income by scaling up production have picked up in recent months.\n\nWTI closes trading at 7-week high\n\nBuoyed by further supply disruptions from Russia the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose to its highest level on Friday to settle at $110.5 per barrel gaining nearly 4.1 percent in the process.\n\nThis growth represents its highest position since March 25, 2022, and extends its gain in both the future and spot markets.\n\nWith the current political turmoil in Europe not showing any sign of ending, escalating tension driven by the EU ban on Russian oil will likely drive the price even higher next week.\n\nEarlier this week, Moscow as a retaliation against the EU imposed sanctions on European units of state-owned Gazprom. Other developments that drove the price to $110.5 per barrel were \u201cthe fear of a stronger dollar and high inflation, weaker global growth and China\u2019s Covid curbs would dampen demand lingered this week\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the International Energy Agency (IEA) stated on Thursday that increased oil output in the Middle East and the United States, as well as a slowing in demand growth, are \u201cexpected to fend off an acute supply deficit amid a worsening Russian supply disruption.\u201d",

However, online pre-registrants would require time to schedule appointments to complete their registration physically at designated centers.\n\nFor this reason, the Commission has decided to suspend the online registration in the next three weeks to enable the online registrants to complete their registration physically at the designated centres before the exercise is suspended on 30th June 2022.\n\nThis according to him, will enable the Commission to clean up the registration data, print the Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs)and compile the register ahead of the 2023 General Election.\n\nOn the cleaning up of the registration data,the chairman said that, the Commission addressed a Press Conference four weeks ago to present a report on the CVR exercise covering the period from June to December 2021.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, the Commission deployed the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) which is a comprehensive and robust system involving not just the fingerprint identification but also the facial biometric recognition. The report of the ABIS is included among the documents in your folders for this meeting. There will also be a presentation on the exercise by our ICT Department\u201d.\n\nHe also said that, the Commission has reviewed the functionality of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) following the complaints received after the recent Area Council elections in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) held on 12th February 2022; noting that the Commission has just finished the configuration of the BVAS for the Ekiti State Governorship election.\n\nProf. Yakubu also said that, \u201cbeyond the conduct of primaries by political parties, the Commission is required to make Regulations and Guidelines for the implementation of the provisions of the Electoral Act. These Regulations and Guidelines, together with the Constitution and the Electoral Act, constitute the electoral legal framework that govern the conduct of elections. I am glad to report that the Commission will finalise the Regulations and Guidelines next week to guide the conduct of future elections, including the forthcoming Ekiti and Osun Governorship elections as well as the 2023 General Election\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are many progressive provisions of the Electoral Act 2022 which require clear understanding to guide implementation. One of such provisions is the electronic transmission of election results. At this meeting, we will discuss the implementation of the provisions of Sections 60, 62 and 64 of the Electoral Act 2022 regarding the management of election results. We have prepared a document for discussion which is included in your folders for this meeting\u201d.\n\n\u201cSection 54(2) of the Electoral Act makes provision for assistive materials for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs).\n\nThis is another progressive provision of the new Electoral Act. Over the years, we have worked with the disability community in designing some of the assistive materials such as the Braille Ballot Guide and the provision of magnifying glasses for visually challenged voters and posters for the deaf. We are also working together to collect disaggregated data for PWDs to assist the Commission in optimally deploying the assistive materials. To deepen our collaboration, a meeting will be convened as early as next week with the disability community to discuss the implementation of the provisions of the new Electoral Act on inclusivity\u201d, he added.\n\nWhile commending the Commission for a job Welldone, Mrs Ene Obi, Country Director ActionAid & Convener Civil Society Situation Room who spoke on behalf of the CSOs said the Commission needs to do more to encourage citizens to register and come out to vote saying that that is one of the greatest challenges facing the electoral system.\n\n\u201cEven with the PVCs, a lot of people don\u2019t come out to vote and this is not helping the system. We want the Commission through its department for voters education to create more enlightenment,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Civil society organizations also urged the commission to do all within its powers to ensure there is serious improvement on the upcoming Ekiti state election and others.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Evangelist Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, founder of Igbo Youth Movement (IYM), has appealed to Edwin Clark, elder statesman and former minister of information to withdraw his endorsement of Timipre Sylva and throw his weight behind Southeast presidency in 2023.\n\nUko who made the appeal to the elder statesman in a statement on Friday, expressed reservations with his decision to endorse Sylva, minister of state for petroleum who is from Bayelsa State, south-south, despite his known support for Southeast presidency.\n\n\u201cHighly revered Chief Edwin Clark\u2019s support for power shift to the South East is highly commendable, but his equal support to South South aspirants such as Timipre Sylva, makes his support for power shift to the South East, look suspect,\u201d Uko who is also the secretary of Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA), said.\n\n\u201cChief Edwin Clark endorsed Timipre Sylva and gave him his full backing, while giving us the impression that he believes power should shift to the South East. Quite confusing.\n\n\u201cWhich brings me to the altercation between Chief Edwin Clark and Senator Orji Uzor Kalu.\n\n\u201cSenator Kalu had complained bitterly over the greed and insensitivity of our southern brethren from the South West and South South, who discreetly count on using the age long anti Igbo emotions in the country, to scuttle South East presidency in 2023, by grabbing the presidency for themselves, thereby keeping the South East effectively away from the plum office for at least another sixteen years, as power will revert back to the North for their eight years, after SW or SS must have done their eight years.\n\n\u201cKeeping South East out for sixteen years after Obasanjo\u2019s eight years as President and Osinbajo\u2019s eight as VP, simply means that all South East politicians will be too old to contest the Presidency in 2039 when power will rotate back to the South again.\n\n\u201cSenator Kalu had argued that the two big parties should have zoned the presidency to the South East as the country did in 1998 for the South West.\n\n\u201cHe frowned at the pretense and hypocrisy that a South East candidate stands a chance against a South West or South South candidate in the heated ethnic politics of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe lamented over the lack of consideration and inequity displayed by our Southern brethren who are scheming to further isolate the South East by denying the South East the opportunity to lead Nigeria for a season come 2023.\n\n\u201cNow, the game is that our Southern brethren are cleverly pretending that they do not know that the configuration of the anti Igbo coalition that prosecuted the civil war (1967-1970), will always mobilise votes for the other non Igbo candidate running against the South East candidate in the spirit of the ever-alive anti Igbo emotions ruling the country, mostly as a result of the huge envy the Igbo man\u2019s success in trade and commerce usually elicits.\n\n\u201cMoreover, religious leaders and other opinion leaders would readily and easily mobilise their people against the South East candidate in preference for the other Southern choice.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the only truthful way to heal the land, would be to replay the 1998 scenario where the two big parties zoned the presidency to the South West, but this time, doing same to the South East.\n\n\u201cAny body pretending they are unaware of anti Igbo sentiments in the land, that would jeopardise South East candidate\u2019s chances to the benefit of a South West or South South counter choice, is insincere and mischievous.\n\n\u201cNo South East candidate will stand a chance against a South West or South South candidate given the anti Igbo sentiments in the land.\n\n\u201cAccordingly I plead with Chief Edwin Clark to kindly plead with aspirants from the South West and South South to kindly withdraw from the race, in order to allow the South East produce candidates for both parties, as that remains the only way to heal the land. In the spirit of Obasanjo and Falae from the South West in 1999.\n\n\u201cAnything short of this is hypocritical, deceptive and mischievous. Trusting in Chief Clark\u2019s influence and ability to mobilise other elders from other regions to buy into our plea, we hope that our plea will be taken seriously.\n\n\u201cThree weeks to the primaries may seem late in the day, but in politics 24 hours is enough to change the dynamics of the game.\n\n\u201cYes, we agree that all these would have been done at least two years ago. We also agree that lobbying would have been concluded at least two years ago, but scamming the good people of the South East with pretentious and fake support, is unkind and ungodly. The country should do for the South East what we all did for the South West 24 years ago.\n\n\u201cIn that connection, we stand 100% with Senator Orji Uzor Kalu that the two big parties should kindly zone the presidential slot for the 2023 elections to the South East for equity, justice and fairness.\n\n\u201cWe plead with Chief Edwin Clark to withdraw his support and endorsement for Chief Timipre Sylva and help mobilise elders and statesmen from other regions to prevail upon politicians and leaders of the two big political parties to kindly zone the presidential ticket of both parties to the South East this time around.\n\n\u201cAnything else is mere grand standing, deception and sheer mischief.\u201d",

          "text": "Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, ace banker and entrepreneur, has noted that a significant proportion of Nigerian graduates lack the skills most employers are looking for.\n\nAig-Imoukhuede who spoke during the launch of the Youth of Enterprise (YOE) Programme, a flagship initiative by EnterpriseNGR to address the high rates of unemployment and underemployment amongst Nigerian youth, said it is impossible to achieve the aspirations of a developed Nigeria without tackling the problem of unemployment and employability in Nigeria.\n\nAig-Imoukhuede who is the founder and chairman of Coronation Capital Limited stated the need for concerted efforts by all relevant stakeholders to solve problems around unemployment in Nigeria. He said that many graduates are not employable because they are not equipped with the right skill.\n\n\u201cBut more than just what seems to be an oversupply of labour, there is also the problem of the quality of human capital being produced. A large proportion of our graduates are not work-ready as they lack the skills most employers are looking for. This employability issue is what the YOE seeks to tackle,\u201d the former GMD/CEO of Access Bank Plc said.\n\nNoting that the quality of human capital is a critical factor in production, he said that the YOE will help to address the high rates of unemployment and underemployment amongst Nigerian youth as well as to democratise access to career opportunities for them.\n\nHe said, \u201cOnce we are able to improve the quality of labour in Nigeria, we will positively impact the productive output of the country as a whole. We can also position to be a global labour outsourcing outpost like India and China and this has been made even easier with advancements in technology and the post-pandemic work-from-home culture.\n\n\u201cOur youth after going through our world class internship programme can be employed by firms operating in Nigeria or international firms based in any part of the world. We are confident that quality talent always finds gainful employment, hence our reason for focusing on the employability side of the problem as a conduit to resolving the unemployment/underemployment challenges in Nigeria.\n\nObi Ibekwe, CEO of EnterpriseNGR stressed that the initiative would address the lack of employability skills and lack of access to guidance and information on career choices and opportunities.\n\n\u201cEmployability soft skills that make the difference between success and failure in the workplace and they include communication skills, Initiative and problem-solving skills, critical thinking, planning and organizing skills and so on. The current school curricula do not emphasize these skills and yet these are the same skills employers look for in prospective employees,\u201d she said, adding that the programme would help to address these.",

He is also from Kano south and has joined the NNPP. His action now brings to five, APC lawmakers in the state Assembly who have joined the NNPP, while the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has also lost 10 of its lawmakers to the new but fast growing party.\n\nShekarau, who was also expected to join Kwankwaso at the airport and later at the Kwankwasiyya house, was absent in the entourage. He was earlier expected to return with the group and also announce his decamping to the NNPP.\n\nIt was learnt that Ganduje had visited Shekarau last night to encourage him not to defect.\n\nMeanwhile, a former governor of Abia State, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, has warned that if the APC does not address the massive decamping of its members to the NNPP, Kwankwaso, the presidential aspirant of the party may be on his way to coast to victory in the 2023 presidential election.",

          "text": "\u2026 Strike affecting our mental health \u2013 Students \u2026. FG, ASUU playing politics with Nigerian students\u2019 future \u2013 NGOs \u2018\u2026Youths have already lost faith in education\u2019 \u2018\u2026We\u2019re creating a crisis we can\u2019t manage\u2019\n\nParents have expressed sadness over the extension of its industrial action by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) for another 12 weeks (three months), describing the development as \u201cbarbaric.\u201d\n\nParents, who spoke with our correspondents in separate interviews, said the strike has exposed their children to anti-social behaviours like robbery, kidnapping and Yahoo Yahoo (internet fraud).\n\nASUU had embarked on strike on February 14 to press home its demands which included revitalisation of public universities, earned academic allowances and the deployment of the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) for payment of university lecturers.\n\nTheir lamentations\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Blueprint Weekend, on Thursday, Mrs. Josrphine Ayuba, a civil servant who spoke with this reporter expressed fears that the strike has exposed her children to crime.\n\nShe said, \u201cI have two undergraduates who are at home doing nothing. ASUU strike exposed our children to crimes. ASUU should learn how to use proper dialogue in solving problems rather than strikes which worsen things. ASUU has caused a lot of harm since it embarked on strike in February and many students who were exposed to idleness as a result of the strike were involved in many anti-social behaviours including robbery, kidnapping and banditry.\n\n\u201cA society that has debased education to the dump status cannot complain when its youth scorn academic pursuit and embrace get-rich-quick mentality like we are witnessing today. Our children have taken to Yahoo Yahoo due to idleness occasioned by the unending ASUU strikes. Young undergraduates are increasingly being arrested and imprisoned for cybercrime.\n\n\u201cDialogue is the best solution in resolving the problems rather than embarking on strike and I urge them to have a rethink in the interest of the Nigerian youths who may be exposed to idleness that may lead them into crime.\u201d\n\nAlso, in an emotion-laden voice, Mr. Bassey Aniwam said there is the need for parents to rise up and challenge \u201cthis ASUU-FG brouhaha that has continued to disrupt the academic growth of the Nigerian child.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy son would have graduated, but due to the nine months ASUU strike and the Covid-19 pandemic, and now, he is yet to graduate, and presently at home doing nothing. The financial implication is another burden as I have to make an extra budget. And this is not funny, considering the economic situation in the country.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening between ASUU and the government is very pathetic. It is a case of when two elephants fight, the grass suffers. Our innocent children are at the receiving end of all the disruptions because most of the children of our leaders are outside the country studying without any disruption. For a five-year course, my daughter spent almost seven years in school because of the ASUU strike. All her mates in private universities graduated and were making mockery of her. Parents should rise up in one accord, and challenge this oppressive government to resolve this issue permanently,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, stating her frustrations to Blueprint Weekend, Mrs. Eveline Jatau said she fears that her children would fall into bad company.\n\nShe said, \u201cIt is a disturbing situation. You know you cannot keep these young people in one place for too long. They keep finding excuses to go out and there is little you can do as a parent because you know it is caused by boredom. So you just continue to hope and pray that they don\u2019t come to harm\u2019s way\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have two of them who are affected by the strike and the situation is giving me serious problems. Whenever I go to work, I am always afraid of the type of friends they might have taken home or gone to mix with. When school was in session, they were always busy studying or doing their assignments but tell them to study now and they tell you, \u2018for what, when we don\u2019t know when ASUU will call off their strike.\n\n\u201cThis is why we have been appealing to ASUU to consider the long term consequences of this strike and call off the strike. We know that they are fighting for things to be better but they should also see things from the perspective of us, the parents who are disturbed that the future of our children are being jeopardised.\u201d\n\nMrs. Chinyere Uchendu, on her part, appealed to the federal government and ASUU to resolve the crisis for the future of the children and education in the country.\n\nShe said, \u201cThree of my children are in the university, but are now back home doing nothing. If this situation is not properly handled, most students could lose focus in life and be made to indulge in social vices, such as internet fraud, armed robbery, banditry and kidnapping, amongst others.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping that at the end of the one month warning strike by ASUU, that both ASUU and the federal government would have come to an agreement, but it is really unfortunate that ASUU is going on another two months strike. We strongly believe that it will affect our students and the standard of education in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want our children back home; we prefer seeing dialogue between ASUU and the federal government in order to ensure frank talks that will quickly bring the whole problem to an end so that the country continues with sound education policies that will be competitive with international community.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want our children to spend three months at home because of the strike. We are begging the federal government to, as a matter of urgency, go back and resolve their matter with ASUU so that the children can quickly go back to classes.\u201d\n\nStudents\u2019 frustrations\n\nSimilarly, a cross-section of students who spoke with our correspondents in separate interviews expressed their frustrations, saying \u201cthe federal government allowed the strike to linger because it didn\u2019t affect their children, most of who are schooling abroad or attend private universities.\u201d\n\nChinwe Ubani, a 300-level Chemistry Education student of the University of Abuja, said, \u201cThey did all they could to avert the airlines operators from embarking on strike since it would affect them and their children, but ASUU has been on strike since February and it rolled over for another 12 weeks, but who cares? After all, their children don\u2019t even attend public universities.\n\n\u201cThe strike has affected me nearly in every aspect. I practically feel like three months have been deleted out of my life already. I mean, I would have been a graduate today and possibly serving my fatherland. As much as I have been able to do a few things, I would have done a lot more if I had graduated as scheduled. I am losing flair for academics, no thanks to the FG/ASSU situation. To think that I will stay at home for another three month is frustrating.\u201d\n\nAnother student, Enemali Joseph, a student of Federal University Lokoja (FUL), said the strike has devastated him emotionally, putting a cog in the wheel of his dreams.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say the prolonged ASUU strike has affected me negatively. It is so because not only has the strike devastated me emotionally, it has also forcefully put me behind my schedule. You can imagine a four-year degree programme which I had hoped to complete in 2020 now dragging to God knows when.\n\n\u201cWith the strike all my plans are shattered and yet I cannot plan further. It has made me less enthusiastic about reading and education. We have also seen crime rates soaring since this industrial action started. Take a look at the social media; it is all about the book of lamentations, report of all sorts of wrong activities occasioned by idleness \u2013 rape, armed robbery, unwanted pregnancies, prostitution and possibly suicides.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate that ASUU is fighting to make things better, but there are other ways of making their voice to be heard rather than the strike option. We the students are the ones feeling the brunt of the strike and they should take this into consideration and call off the strike,\u201d he said.\n\nFunke Abolurin, a student of the Ahmadu Bello University Zaria (ABU), regretted being in a system that cost her two years of her academic life.\n\n\u201cWell, at first, the strike was really helpful in a way as it gave us enough room to cover up on some course outline, considering our then tight schedule. Now, it is annoying due to the extension as I have lost all motivation to study again. It has done more harm than good to me. Instead of writing my examination and going to the next level, I am stuck at home, not knowing the next line of action.\n\n\u201cThe strike has been horrible to be honest. I should actually be in my third year now, but due to the country\u2019s messed up educational system, I am still in my first year. I should be preparing for examination, but I am at home instead. The current three months extension by ASUU is affecting my mental health. It is really having a bad effect on my mental health,\u201d she said.\n\nNGOs\u2019 concerns\n\nIn their concerns, some non-governmental organisations (NGOs) told our correspondents that the federal government and ASUU are playing politics with the future of Nigerian students.\n\nThe Convener of Justice for All, Mr. Jude Osaleke, said ASUU and its employers could sort out their differences without making students the victims.\n\n\u201cThe strikes are becoming worrisome. The development does not portray the country in good light before the international community. ASUU and the federal government are playing politics with the future of young Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe strikes are causing the youth to lose faith in education and consequently take to negative vices that may compromise their future. This development is dangerous to us as a nation. It does not speak well of us as a nation that truly desires accelerated development and transformation.\n\n\u201cThe government should tackle this issue. It must go down to work, and quickly too, to revisit whatever demands the lecturers are making. I understand that the government is saying that it cannot afford to meet the demands of the 2009 agreement entered into, by the then government, with ASUU.

Victor Adewumi stated this yesterday when he visited the site of the incident at Oku Iboku Community in Uyo, to assess the level of repair works on the instance of the Minister of Power, Engr. Abubakar D.

We are however doing everything possible to reconnect the line to the national grid\u201d.\n\nHe noted that the collapsed tower was not the only one vandalized and that restringing the transmission line involves bringing down the 330kV DC line on some suspension towers, that were minimally vandalized, up to the nearest tension towers on both sides of the collapsed tower and fortifying the suspension towers before restringing the lines to ensure quality work is done,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe noted that work has reached 70% completion and that TCN is working hard to ensure that the 330kV DC transmission line is completed and reconnected to the national grid in one week, to ensure the evacuation of over 400MW stranded power at the Odukpani Power Plant near Calabar as well as the restoration of power supply to Cross River State.\n\nEngr. Adewumi appealed to the public to help TCN in the fight against the vandalism of power infrastructure, saying that such acts are detrimental to Nigerians and the expansion of power infrastructure in Nigeria.

ABCON under my leadership will continue to encourage our members to play the vital role of closing the exchange rate gaps in the market and reducing widening premium between the parallel market and the official window,\u201d he said.\n\nGwadabe listed several factors that continue to undermine the naira stability and the local currency\u2019s value against other currencies.\n\nThe ABCON boss called for the creation of BDCs\u2019 Autonomous Foreign Exchange Trading Window (BAFEX) with determined maximum daily limit for legible BDCs to access dollars from banks, autonomous market and diaspora forex widow at the prevailing market prices.\n\nHe requested for enhancement of existing BDCs\u2019 automation portals to file transaction returns on CBN/ABCON/NFIU/NIBSS portals for effective regulatory monitoring and supervisions.\n\nGwadabe also sought for the creation of an automation portal to encourage registration of undocumented and unlicensed operators for effective monitoring, identification and tracking of their transactions.\n\nHe said the reluctance of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to open new windows through which foreign exchange can be attracted to the economy remains a key factor in the naira continued fall.\n\nHe said the non-inclusion of BDCs in the list of channels through which diaspora remittances flow to Nigeria, under the CBN\u2019s guidance and regulation, has reduced the volume of dollar inflows to the economy.\n\nAccording to him, the World Bank\u2019s latest Migration and Development Brief showed that Sub-Saharan Africa attracting $49 billion in 2021. The bank said officially recorded remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries are expected to increase by 4.2 per cent this year to reach $630 billion.\n\nGwadabe said Nigeria\u2019s contribution to the remittances fund is expected to rise when BDCs are allowed to receive funds from Nigerians in Diaspora into the economy.\n\nHe said the BDCs are to perform this role through contactless and digitised channels that make collections easy and seamless.\n\nHe said there is urgent need to review the guidelines on BDC\u2019s Scope of Operations to include participation in payment space, such as agency banking, Point of Sale (PoS) services, inbound and outbound forex transfers, ATM Forex services, to reflect global business model practice.\n\nHe suggested that the BDCs should be allowed to access dollars or diaspora remittances through the autonomous forex windows that enable operators to receive IMTOs proceeds, carry out online dollar operations and Point of Sale (PoS) Agency, among others.\n\nGwadabe insisted that now is the time to break the current industry monopoly that puts the remittances market in the hands of few players depriving others from tapping into the plan.\n\nThe ABCON boss also called for the establishment of training institutes to enhance capacity and infrastructure in the industry and broaden players\u2019 business scope with cash-back incentives for those that patronize BDCs while also implementing a less cumbersome and complex documentation requirements for end users.\n\n\u201cThe BDCs should be able to operate a network of digital solutions for PTA/BTA. This would reduce overheads, and improve profitability. Some BDCs might still consider working closer with commercial banks. The ABCON can also be recognized as self-regulatory organization to enable it operate effectively and sanction erring members,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cWe wish to reiterate our resolve to align with the policy thrust of the apex bank and ensure that ABCON members play their roles professionally and strategically in the interest of the market and economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that de-marketing of BDCs by regulators and security agencies is not good for the stability of the market.

During the guided tour, I am sure you all saw that this is indeed a purpose-built, state-of-the-art, 100-bed hospital, which is aimed at delivering the highest standard of healthcare, using the most advanced technology and treatments to provide Nigerians with the best medical expertise available anywhere in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that according to available records, Nigerians spend between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion on medical tourism annually, a development he described as a huge drain on the country\u2019s foreign reserves.\n\nHe expressed delight that many of the doctors at Duchess International Hospital, a subsidiary of Reddington Hospital, are Nigerians who had\n\ntrained and worked abroad, but who have now decided to return home because of the availability of healthcare facilities with standard equipment and a good work environment.\n\nThe Minister said the Federal Government, through the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Bank of Industry, provided financial support for Duchess International Hospital, as part of its intervention in the health sector.\n\n\u201cThis is not new. Recall that in the wake of Covid-19, the CBN set up the N100 billion Healthcare Sector Intervention Fund, now expanded to N200 billion, to provide credit support for the healthcare sector through long-term, low-cost financing,\u201d he said, listing other interventions by the Federal Government, through the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority, NSIA, as including a total of $22.5 million which was spent in establishing two diagnostic centres in Kano and Umuahia ($5.5 million each) and the NSIA-LUTH Cancer Centre in Lagos ($11.5 million)\n\n\u201cThe essence of these financial interventions and projects in the critical healthcare sector is to fast-track the evolvement of world class healthcare facilities like the Duchess International Hospital.\n\n\u201cWith that, we can conserve our foreign reserves, earn foreign exchange for the country, create jobs, reverse brain drain, become a destination for medical tourists and also ensure affordable and standard healthcare for Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed commended the management of the hospital for making their world class services affordable and accessible to ordinary Nigerians, particularly with the launching of the \u2018World Class Affordable Healthcare Programme that coincided with the visit of the Minister and the over 30 journalists who accompanied him on the tour.\n\n\u201cWith what we have seen here today and the programme that has just been launched, Nigerians can now get access to affordable and world class treatment in whatever is ailing them in many areas, including emergency medicine, women\u2019s health, paediatric care, cardiovascular medicine, kidney dialysis, dental treatment, eye care, etc,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minister said the visit to the hospital was in continuation of the media tour of the development projects of the Buhari Administration, disclosing that in the past 40 days, he had taken the media on a tour of the Dangote Refinery and Petrochemical Project as well as the Dangote Fertilizer Company in Lagos; the Lekki Deep Seaport and the Duchess Hospital, in addition to the tour of road, rail, bridge and other projects across the country.\n\nThe essence of these tours he further explained was to showcase what the present administration has achieved in the various sectors adding that even where the project was private-sector driven, the Federal Government has either provided the enabling environment or, in some cases, supported such projects with funding,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chief Executive Officer of the hospital, Dr. Tokunbo Shitta-Bey, who conducted the Minister round the hospital, said the multi-specialist hospital, which was already attracting foreigners coming for treatment, is poised to make its advanced elite service affordable and accessible to Nigerians, who would pay only N5,000 for registration and 5,000 for consultation.",

Halo defines a community as any group of people with defined membership and identifiable leadership. This includes professional or trade associations, cooperatives, social clubs, unions, even old boys and girls associations and more. Community members are able to leverage the strength of their union for better financial returns. By focusing on communities, Halo will be able to scale faster.\n\nShe said, \u201cNigerians, have always understood that we progress faster when we do things together. From traditional groups savings schemes like \u2018ajo\u2019, to communities putting money together for community development projects, even friends pooling resources to help one of their squad. There\u2019s strength in numbers. We are using technology to harness that strength to drive wealth creation for individuals through their communities.\u2019\n\nAccording to her, trust is the bedrock of all financial services. By leveraging existing trust networks, Halo will be able to reach more people with the products, tools and knowledge to meet their wealth creation goals.\n\n\u2018One key differentiator for us is that we hold two licenses. We have a micro finance bank license and an asset management license. This allows us to offer a full spectrum of financial services from basic banking to sophisticated investments. It also means we are regulated by both SEC and CBN, so our risk management and corporate governance is very rigorous.\u2019\n\nNoting that the company is keen on serving as many people as possible, she explained that Halo offers multi-channel access. For those comfortable with technology, there is an app, mass market customers can transact with Halo via a nationwide network of agents, and high net worth communities can access a managed service.\n\nShe stated that the fintech space in Nigeria is extremely competitive, so to meet Halo\u2019s very ambitious goals they have built a team of dynamic, knowledgeable, and committed professionals with a deep understanding of market realities, and more importantly, possess the right skills and experience to help communities and their members navigate the financial landscape and reach their goals.",

          "text": "The 67 passengers abducted by terrorists on March 28 after the bombing of a Kaduna-bound train habe spent 48 days in the hands of the terrorists, with families and Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, pleading with Nigeria\u2019s federal government to meet the demands of the terrorists so as to secure freedom for their loved ones.\n\nThe terrorists had two week ago freed Sadik, the son of elder statesman and Northern Elders Forum (NEF) convener, Professor Ango Abdullahi, thus reducing the number of captives to 67.\n\nA relative of one of the abductees, who also speaks on behalf of the affected families in Kaduna State, Dr. Abdulfatai Jimoh, told THISDAY Friday night that their plea remained that the federal government should strike a deal with the terrorists, so that their loved ones can be freed.\n\nPopular Islamic cleric, Gumi, who spoke during a prayer session organised by Jama\u2019iyyar Matan Arewa for the kidnapped passengers on Thursday, also challenged the federal government to meet the demands of the abductors and secure freedom for the abductees.\n\nDr. Jimoh told THISDAY that the traumatised families, for the first time, met with some government officials last week and reiterated that the demands of the captors must be met so that their loved ones can regain freedom.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are sick, tired and frustrated by not having our loved ones for almost 50 days now. There are women, children and the elderly in the forest with these kidnappers. How do you want us to sleep? We can\u2019t sleep. Government has to help us. Government must meet the demands of the terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe affected families at a press briefing in Kaduna last Monday asked the terrorists to fear God and release them, lamenting that life had been tough without their breadwinners.\n\nJimoh, who spoke at the press briefing, expressed disappointment with the Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, and the management of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), for alleged insensitivity towards the plight of the victims.\n\nThe relations also expressed disappointment that they sought the intervention of the leadership of the National Assembly, \u201cwhich is the people\u2019s Court, but nothing had been forthcoming from them.\u201d\n\nAlso, children of the victims at the press conference by the relations, appealed to the government to do everything possible to ensure the release of their parents.\n\nOne of the children, Ismail Abubakar, 11, said life had been tough without his father, saying, \u201cI am appealing to them to release my father and others safely. They should set them free. Life has been tough without my father since he was kidnapped.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, 18 year old Ruqqayatu Jibril, whose parents are in captivity, pleaded with the terrorists to free their victims.\n\n\u201cI have my parents in captivity. This is their 42nd day in captivity and still counting. We are appealing to the government to bring back our loved ones. We have missed them so much. Some of them are breadwinners of the family. We really need them back. We, the family, are waiting in anguish,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile noting that living without them has been traumatic, she said, \u201cIt is so terrifying. We are appealing to the government to do their best possible to rescue our beloved ones unhurt. We are appealing to the bandits to please free our loved ones. They are also humans. We are humans like you. Even if you don\u2019t share anything in religion, then, you share in humanity.\n\n\u201cWhy should you just capture fellow citizens? You are also citizens of this blessed country. But why should you be capturing people that are your brothers and sisters and keeping them in captivity for almost six weeks. Please and please, fear God and free them.\u201d\n\nGumi at Prayer Session\n\nThe prayer session, which attracted religious leaders from both the Muslim and Christian faiths, was held at the JMA headquarters in Kaduna.\n\nGumi, who led the Muslim prayer, assured the families of the kidnapped passengers that the prayers would make the captives feel divine presence as God would comfort them.\n\nHe urged government to meet the terrorists\u2019 demands so that the victims, who had spent over 40 days in their den, can regain their freedom.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhatever they (the terrorists) want, give it to them so that they can release these people and when they release them then, you are at the liberty, to deal with them the way they deserve because when they have captives, you have to tread with caution so that their captives will not be injured.\u201d\n\nBennett Oghifo",

          "text": "The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), the Northern States Christian Elders Forum (NOSCEF) and the British government have condemned the murder of Deborah Samuel, a 200-level female student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, by some fanatical students of the same school for allegedly blaspheming Prophet Muhammad (SAW) in a Whatsapp post.\n\nThey are also demanding for the arrest and prosecution of all those responsible for the murder of Deborah, who was attacked and killed by the mob of fanatics that burnt her corpse at the school\u2019s premises last Thursday.\n\nLikewise, President Muhammadu Buhari strongly flayed the resort to self-help by the mob in Sokoto, resulting in violence, destruction and killing of Deborah.\n\nThe General Secretary of CAN, Joseph Daramola, in a statement on Friday said: \u201cThe vampires must be brought to book. The unlawful and dastardly action of the perpetrators must not only be condemned by all right-thinking people but the security operatives must fish them out, prosecute them as it is expected of them.\n\n\u201cIt is the failure of the security agencies and the government to rise up to such criminalities in the past that gave birth to terrorists and bandits. And as long as the State fails to bring these beasts and criminals amidst us to book so also the society will continue to be their killing fields.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge the swift reaction of His Eminence, Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III who not only condemned the criminal and religious intolerant action but also called on the security agencies to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\n\u201cWe also call on all teachers and preachers of religious intolerance, extremism, and terrorism to repent before the wrath of God descends on them if the State failed to bring them to book. They are agents of death amidst us.\n\n\u201cWe recall the provocative and demeaning advertisement of the Sterling Bank where the bank compared the Resurrection of Jesus Christ to \u201cAgege bread\u201d, up till now, nobody was attacked and even the CAN leadership has accepted the apology tendered by its Managing Director, Abubakar Suleiman.\n\n\u201cKilling for any God in the name of blasphemy is ungodly, satanic, foolish, reprehensible, and totally unacceptable. This is not a Stone Age and Nigeria is not a Banana Republic. Nigeria remains a non-religious State where no religion is supreme to the other.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge and commend the restraint of the Christian students of the College who refused to embrace self-help and reprisal attacks on those who murdered their colleague. It is our prayer that those vampires in religious garments will not push the country to a religious war.\n\n\u201cThis is why both the government and the security agencies must stop treating them with kid gloves. Enough is enough.\u201d\n\nThe Northern Christian Elders in a statement by its Chairman, Ejoga Inalegwu, in Kaduna yesterday, called on the government to immediately apprehend and make an example of those who perpetrated the dastardly act.\n\nThe Christian group noted that anything short of apprehending and prosecuting those involved in the heinous act was unacceptable.\n\nAccording to them, the act was purely a murder in the robe of religion.\n\nThe group said, \u201cThe death of Debora Yakubu (Samuel) is one too many by mobs wearing a cloak of religion in the North. In a country where there is a law, nobody, group or individuals has a right to take another\u2019s life whatsoever, outside the due process of law.\n\n\u201cWe also urge the government to make a public example and make a new statement by quickly bringing the perpetrators to book.\n\n\u201cThis should not be the usual rhetoric of condemnations and then the case is swept under the carpet with publicised arrests, no prosecution or jaundiced prosecution and letting off the hook, when the outcries die down.\n\n\u201cOne day it is the videoed execution of Christians in the North because of a said killing of a terrorist in Syria, and next what should have been an internal WhatsApp class platform chat results in mob action murder, wearing the robe of religion in our dear North.\u201d\n\nThe British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing has condemned the killing of Deborah.\n\nIn a tweet on Friday, Laing said the authorities must ensure that the perpetrators of the act are brought to justice.\n\n\u201cI condemn the murder of Deborah Samuel in Sokoto, and urge the police and relevant authorities to ensure the perpetrators of this horrific act are made to face justice in line with the law,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe Sokoto State Governor, Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal has met with a broad spectrum of Muslim leaders in the state to deliberate on the way to maintain peace and harmony amongst its citizens\n\nA statement by his media office said Tambuwal met with Bishop of Sokoto Catholic Diocese, Mathew Kukah, among others.\n\nThe statement said that the governor had to cut short his various official engagements in Abuja, to rush to Sokoto in view of the importance of the various consultations.\n\nVictim\u2019s Whatsapp Voice Note Shows Alleged Blasphemy is False\n\nMeanwhile, the purported reason Deborah was killed and her body burnt by the mob has been found to be false.\n\nDeborah had shared a voice note on her class Whatsapp group in which she challenged her colleagues who were posting religious information there.\n\nShe spoke in Hausa. According to a Twitter user who did the translation, Deborah was quoted to have said: \u201cHoly Ghost Fire, nothing\u2019s going to happen to me, you should know what to be sending to this group, it\u2019s not that the group was created to be sending nonsense, the group was created for posting things like, test, assignment e.t.c. not the nonsense you are posting, no be only prophet, you are coming to play on me.\u201d\n\nThe nonsense she apparently referred to were the religious posts.\n\nHer comments were said to have irked some of her colleagues who felt she disrespected Prophet Mohammed, and threatened to deal with her. When the tension was high, the school authorities took her to the security room to give her some protection. However, the enraged students overpowered the security officers, dragged Deborah out, and beat her until she died before setting her corpse on fire.\n\nFormer President of the Senate, Anyim Pius Anyim also condemned, in the strongest terms, the gruesome and unlawful killing of Deborah.\n\nIn a statement he personally signed, Anyim decried the killing of Deborah as cruel, illegal, callous and inhuman.\n\nAnyim said: \u201cThere is no place in a modern Democracy such as Nigeria for jungle justice and killing of human beings illegally. We cannot afford now to add religious intolerance to the plethora of problems bedevilling our country.\u201d\n\nAtiku Distances Self from Deborah Tweet\n\nHowever, Presidential hopeful, Atiku Abubakar, has distanced himself from a tweet condemning the lynching of Deborah.\n\nAtiku, who is running for President on the platform of the PDP, had taken to Twitter on Thursday to condemn the mob action, saying, \u201cThere cannot be a justification for such gruesome murder. Deborah Yakubu was murdered and all those behind her death must be brought to justice. My condolences to her family and friends.\u201d\n\nThe former Vice-President, however, came under threats from some Muslim northerners who threatened not to vote for him if he emerges as the Presidential candidate of the PDP.\n\nHowever, Atiku later deleted the tweet amid the threats.\n\nOn Facebook yesterday, the former Vice President in a message on his verified Hausa page distanced himself from the message. He also stated that any message on social media that did not come with the initials \u201cA. A.\u201d were not his.\n\n\u201cThis evening I received information that a post was made that doesn\u2019t agree with my orders. I use this to announce that any post without A. A. is not from me. May God protect us,\u201d he wrote in Hausa.\n\nTHISDAY",
