          "title": "FG risks vaccine donation reduction as one million doses expire",
          "text": "Nigeria is on the verge of losing more donations from multilateral agencies and other countries following the expiration of about one million doses of donated COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, had admitted that some of the vaccines expired but refused to reveal the quantity which Reuters news agency put at one million. Ehanire also stated that the doses were a few months or weeks from expiration before Nigeria received them and their rollout was further delayed by logistical challenges.\n\nThis is despite the fact that N20bn had been earmarked for the distribution of the vaccines early in the year.\n\nEhanire on Wednesday justified the expiration of over one million donated doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. According to Reuters, the expiration was one of the biggest single losses of doses\n\nThe vaccine doses, which according to the news medium were donated through COVAX, were also said to have arrived the country within four-to-six weeks of expiry and could not be used in time, despite efforts by health authorities.\n\n\u201cNigeria is doing everything it can. But it is struggling with short shelf life vaccines\u201d Reuters quoted a source as saying.\n\nBut Ehanire in a statement he personally signed and released on Wednesday said that the vaccines were of residual shelf lives and there were cases of logistics bottlenecks.\n\nHe said, \u201cNigeria has, of late enjoyed the generosity of several, mainly European countries, who have offered us doses of COVID-19 vaccines out of their stockpiles, free of charge, through COVAX or AVAT facility. These donations are always well acknowledged and thankfully received. However, some of them had residual shelf lives of only few months that left us very short time, some just weeks to clear them, after deduction of time to transport, clear, distribute and deliver to our users.\n\n\u201cIf such vaccines arrive back-to-back or are many, logistics bottlenecks occasionally arise\u201d.\n\nEhanire warned that henceforth, Nigeria would no longer receive vaccines with a short shelf life.\n\nHowever, several insiders told The PUNCH that the standard practice was for Nigeria to have returned the doses or donated them to other African countries that were prepared to distribute them immediately.\n\nBut Nigeria left the vaccine doses on the shelf and allowed them to expire thereby depriving others from using them.\n\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention had in May commended the Democratic Republic of Congo for its \u201cremarkable and strategic move\u201d in returning the vaccine doses that they could not administer on time.\n\n\u201cThe DRC has not wasted vaccines \u2026They recognised that they were not going to use all the vaccines in a timely fashion and then called on the COVAX and UNICEF to take those excess vaccines and redistribute them \u2026 We acknowledge their wisdom in doing that,\u201d John Nkengasong, the director of Africa CDC, had said at a news conference.\n\nAfrica CDC, it was learnt, had advised that all vaccines that may expire be quickly distributed even as Africa countries have continued to witness a low vaccine rollout.\n\n\u201cNigeria shouldn\u2019t have collected those vaccines in the first place. Also, Nigeria should have informed the donor so that the doses would be redistributed. The expiration of one million doses is the highest we have ever heard anywhere in the world,\u201d a top health official said, requesting not to be named because he was not authorised to speak.\n\nBut the Director-General, Nigeria Institute of Medical Research, Prof. Babatunde Salako, said Nigeria should not be blamed for the development.\n\nSalako also said Nigeria needed to step up its vaccination campaign.\n\n\u201cI suspect that those that gave us the vaccines did so when they also noticed it will soon expire, so we really didn\u2019t have enough time to use them all. Vaccine apathy is a major issue here,\u201d he said.\n\nNigeria received 700,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the UK in August, 800,000 from Canada in September and 500,000 from France in October while it received four million doses of the Moderna vaccine and 3.6m Pfizer doses from the US in October as well.\n\nIn an interview with The PUNCH, Professor of Medical Virology, University of Maiduguri, Marycelin Baba, told our correspondent that the news about the expired vaccines would take a toll on the vaccination drive. This is as the expert also warned of reduction in the influx of donated doses.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe news may have a toll on the vaccination drive in the country and yes, donors might feel reluctant in donating more doses. We keep talking about vaccine equity, but here we are wasting vaccines. In my opinion, the donors are not to be blamed. They own the vaccines and they would have informed you of the shelf life. You have the choice to accept and the choice to decline the offer.\u201d\n\nAnother health ministry official, however, said the donor countries ought to stop giving Nigeria and other African nations doses with low shelf life.\n\n\u201cOf course the minister did not reveal the number of doses lost in order not to upset donors who may want to stop giving us vaccines since they have now shut us out of their country. But these donors should also stop sending doses that are close to expiration. We are not a dumping ground,\u201d he said.\n\nA former National Chairman of the Association of Public Health Physicians of Nigeria, Prof. Tanimola Akande, also corroborated Baba\u2019s claims.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is a good thing that it was observed because if it was not observed then people would be given something that has expired and they will be given false confidence.\u201d\n\nThe National Primary Health Care Development Agency had said in August that vaccine doses donated by the United Kingdom would expire by the end of September.\n\nThe Executive Secretary of the NPHCDA, Faisal Shuaibu, had however, stated that despite the concerns, he was sure that the country would exhaust the doses before the expiration of the vaccine.\n\nHe said \u201cWe have two batches of AstraZeneca, one batch will expire by the end of September while the other batch will expire by the end of October.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are certain that the doses will be exhausted before their expiration. There has been a huge turnout of people wanting to be vaccinated. We would not have taken them if we were not sure that they would be exhausted.\u201d\n\nThe NPHCDA director said the Federal Government had adequate doses of vaccines in store to cover a large percentage of the population, adding that the country was awaiting about 57 million doses of the vaccine.\n\n\u201cWe have more than enough vaccines in Nigeria for now. We also have a pool of vaccines, almost 57 million vaccines that are awaiting shipment. There are about 40 million already in the country and we have secured about 90million doses.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia bans flights from Nigeria over Omicron COVID-19\n\nMeanwhile, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has barred all flights from Nigeria effectively ending all hopes for those planning to attend the lesser hajj.\n\nAlthough the reason was not expressly stated, it said all non-citizens with history of travel to Nigeria would not be allowed into Saudi Arabia\n\nThis is according to a circular issued by the General Authority of Civil Aviation of Saudi Arabia dated December 8, 2021.\n\nThe circular read in part, \u201cInstructions: Suspending all incoming flights and suspending entry to the kingdom for non-nationals coming directly or indirectly from the Federal Republic of Nigeria except for those who have spent a period of no less than 14 days in another country from which they are allowed to come.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "States grumble as FG slashes N36bn COVID-19 fund, Omicron hits 57 countries",
          "text": "Thirty-six states of the federation have faulted the Federal Government\u2019s handling of N36bn international fund meant to combat COVID-19.\n\nThe PUNCH learnt that at a meeting of state commissioners of health and federal health officers, which started on Tuesday and ended early on Wednesday, state governments opposed the central government over the sharing of the N36bn international fund.\n\nThe World Bank Board of Directors had on August 7, 2020 approved a $114.28 financing to help Nigeria prevent, detect and respond to the threat posed by COVID-19 with a specific focus on state level responses.\n\nThe global body said, through the COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Project, the government of Nigeria would provide grants to 36 and the Federal Capital Territory as immediate support to break the chain of COVID-19 local transmission and limit the spread of coronavirus through containment and mitigation strategies.\n\nAlthough the source of the current international fund could not be confirmed, it was learnt that each state was supposed to get N1bn.\n\nA source at the meeting said, \u201cThe amount that should be given to each state was N1bn, but what we were offered was far lesser than N800m. We have told them (the Federal Government) to investigate it and give us what we are entitled to.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the development, the Benue State Commissioner for Health and Human Resources, Ngbea, said states had been informed that N1bn would be given to each of them.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe just came back from Abuja today (Wednesday) to receive an international fund, but we didn\u2019t get it for some hitches. Once the money is out, we will channel it to appropriate areas like equipping our isolation centres.\u201d\n\nAlthough the commissioner declined to give the amount offered the states, he stated, \u201cThe speculation we heard was that N1bn would be given to each state, but when we got there what we saw was far lesser than that. It is not commensurate with things we want to do. We have resolved that they (the Federal Government) should into that and add to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to make our isolation centres more functional and up our testing capacity. We need to immunise more people because for now only 2.9 percent of our population have been immunised.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner said there were two functional isolation centres in Benue State, one at Federal Medical Centre and the other at Benue State University Teaching Hospital both located in Makurdi, the state capital.\n\nHe disclosed participants at the just concluded meeting of health commissioners across the country resolved that they should prepare for emergencies.\n\nThe commissioner said that states were expecting international funds to tackle COVID-19, especially, to make isolation centres more functional.\n\nOn his part, the Ekiti State Commissioner for Information, Akin Omole, said that the COVID-19 isolation and treatment centres in the state were functional.\n\nOmole said, \u201cThe issue of COVID-19 is under the Federal Government. It is the Federal Government that will take some initiatives and the state governments will begin to implement. The state government will have to wait for the Federal Government to take the matter up before we key into it.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The PUNCH in Jos on Wednesday, the Plateau State Commissioner for Health, Dr Nimkong Lar, said the two isolation centres in Shendam and Riyom were closed because there were no enough patients but that the government would reopen them immediately if need be.\n\nAlso, the Ondo State Government said all its isolation centres were in good condition but there was no patient of COVID- 19 in the them.\n\nThe state Epidemiologist , Dr Stephen Fagbemi, who spoke on development disclosed that the state had four isolation centres .\n\nWe don\u2019t intend to open more isolation centres \u2013 Lagos\n\nThe Lagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso, on his part disclosed that the state did not intend to open more isolation centres.\n\nOmotoso, in an interview with one of our correspondents on Wednesday, said the centre at the Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba was the only one in operation at the moment.\n\n\u201cThe only isolation centre that I know is in operation is the one at the Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba. For us not to open more isolation centres, that is why we are announcing measures and regulations that all of us will have to adhere to so that the cases will not go out of hand.\u201d\n\nWHO forecasts increased hospitalization as Omicron variant spreads to 57 countries\n\nIn a related development, the World Health Organisation On Wednesday said there would be increased hospitalization if more people got infected with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus disease. The global health body stated that the variant had been identified in 57 countries of the world.\n\nThe WHO made this known in its weekly global epidemiological report of the coronavirus.\n\nAccording to WHO, while all the confirmed cases of the omicron in South Africa were asymptomatic, it stated that the country witnessed an increase in hospitalisation rate. ,,\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "How to know you will achieve financial freedom",
          "text": "Agada\n\nOne of the wisest things to do early in your career is to know upfront if you will achieve financial freedom. You then assess what kind of financial freedom you will achieve and what your chances of achieving total financial freedom you have.\n\nNot everyone that sets out to achieve financial freedom will achieve it. Research shows that out of every 100 people only 20% achieve financial freedom; And out of every 100 working professionals only 15% will end up in retirement financially free. The big question is, where would you be at the end of your career; and what gives you the confidence that you will achieve financial freedom?\n\nREAD ALSO:Bank customers\u2019 deposits rise 12.6% to N28.7trn\n\nThus, the goal of today\u2019s article is to show you some of the factors that will affect your ability to achieve financial freedom. And to then show you how to increase your odds\u2019 of achieving it if your current odds are low.\n\n\n\nWhat is financial freedom\n\nFinancial freedom is the ability to fund your life from passive income. It is your ability to move from a life that is funded solely by active income to a life that is funded by passive income.\n\nTo achieve financial freedom, you must separate your physical presence from your income such that your absence is no longer a disadvantage. This means that your income must come regardless of where you are, how you work, and whether you choose to work. This kind of financial freedom can only be achieved when you have investments whose investing work can be completed before retirement and whose cash-flow can last for a lifetime.\n\n\n\nJudging from your present position and the time you have left, would you be able to achieve this kind of financial freedom? If 100% of your current life is still dependent on an active income, you still have a long way to go. The only way to achieve this kind of financial freedom is to create a stable passive income that is worth the size of your current income and then transfer your source of livelihood to it. Only then can you achieve total financial freedom.\n\n\n\nThe truth is your current active income only has one purpose. And this purpose is to provide you the resources that you need to be free from depending on active income. If you fail to wean yourself off your active income before retirement, there will be unprecedented financial consequences awaiting you in the future.\n\n\n\nAchieving financial freedom\n\nThere are three factors that will show you if you would achieve financial freedom; And your understanding or ignorance of these factors is what will determine your financial success.\n\nThe First factor is How You Interpret Your Childhood Experiences. One of the things that will affect your financial decisions in life is your childhood experiences. Your childhood experiences will affect how you spend, save and what you invest in and prioritize as important. Yet your background and childhood experiences only play a little role in determining your overall success.\n\nThis is true because successful people come from poor backgrounds, and successful people also come from rich backgrounds. So, no matter your background you can achieve financial freedom.\n\nBut there is one thing that can determine your success to a greater degree. This one thing is how you interpret your background and childhood experiences.\n\n\n\nThere are only two interpretations that you can derive from your childhood experiences. The first is a positive interpretation and the second is a negative interpretation. Positive interpretation sees the good in your background and experiences and uses this good to propel you towards success. It also helps you make more wealth creating decisions.\n\nNegative interpretation sees the bad in your background and experiences and uses this to demotivate you from success. It also uses this to help you make more wealth draining decisions.\n\nThus, the most rewarding positive interpretation to have is to see your background as the reason why you will be successful. And the most negative interpretation to have, is to see your background as the reason why life is hard for you.\n\nPersons with a negative interpretation see themselves as deprived and disadvantaged. The moment they begin working, they will make decisions that drain their income and give them only little room for savings.\n\nFor example, they will use their financial freedom money to put their children in the kind of schools they couldn\u2019t go, even though they became successful without going to expensive schools, and even when success is no respecter of school.\n\nThey will use their financial freedom money to stock their houses with foods that make them feel rich and special. Even though these food are unhealthy and will land them in the hospital in retirement.\n\n\n\nThey will also create an easy family environment removing any kind of pain, discipline, or delayed gratification, even though success require pain tolerance, patience, and resilience.\n\n\n\nThe results are children with queens\u2019 English, fancy university certificates but with no real skills to help any employer. Parents are having to carry the load of their graduate children longer than necessary.\n\nChildren are now sicker, fatter, entitled, and lazy. And worse of all is that they are now more emotionally fragile in a world that requires toughness to survive.\n\nAll these happened because of trying to run away from childhood experiences. Your childhood and background may not be perfect, but it gave you a gift. Today you are the hardworking, resilient, and responsible breadwinner and provider even without a Queen\u2019s English or fancy certification.\n\nUntil you begin to see the good in your background and rid yourself of your expensive childhood deprivations and cravings, there will not be any money left to pursue financial freedom.\n\n\n\nSuccessful people never look at their background in a negative way. They celebrate their humble beginnings and use their backgrounds as the motivation to strive towards success. The less material things you need to feel happy, important, and accepted the faster you will achieve financial freedom. Similarly, the more you know why you do the things you do the faster you will achieve success.\n\n\n\nWho You Model\n\n\n\nThe fastest way to achieve any goal is to find a role-model and tap into these three things -their knowledge, their beliefs, and their actions. You must learn and model what they are doing, what their core beliefs are, and how they are thinking to get the same results.\n\nThe problem is most people never grew up around wealthy role models. This means that without the extra effort and commitment to find a wealthy role model you won\u2019t make it. You must be able to always ask yourself, What will a wealthy man do in my situation and what will a poor man do? And then ensure that you are making more of a wealthy man\u2019s decisions than a poor man\u2019s decision. Unfortunately, it is easier to model a poor man\u2019s decision than a wealthy man\u2019s decision, because the former are easy and are all over the place. But until you model the wealthy man you cannot achieve financial freedom.\n\n\n\nThankfully, you can easily find wealthy role models today. There are several of them online and there are also at least three presents at your office 24/7, every day, from Monday to Friday. But rather than connect with them and model them you are busy resenting, hating, or judging them. Only a successful person can show you how to become successful and only successful people can help you achieve financial freedom.\n\n\n\nIf you keep modeling your middle-class colleagues and the people you saw while growing up, you will end up in retirement dependent just like your parents.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Discipline\n\n\n\nThere is only one thing that makes a person willing to act, even when they do not feel like it or are afraid to do it, it is Discipline.\n\nDiscipline is the only way to achieve financial freedom. The reason discipline is important is because success requires tough level decisions and the commitment to a future that is worth fighting for. Discovering a purposeful future and taking disciplined action is not a fun. So, most people spend their adult life doing the easy things and postponing the hard things that lead to success. But until you do the hard and high standard things you will not achieve financial freedom.\n\n\n\nKnowing what to do to achieve financial freedom is easy \u2013 now you know. Doing what you know is the hard part, and frankly this is what is holding you back from achieving financial freedom.\n\n\n\nPerhaps you need help to achieve financial freedom. We are the best to help you. To see if you qualify for our help Send an email",
          "summary": "AgadaOne of the wisest things to do early in your career is to know upfront if you will achieve financial freedom.\nYou then assess what kind of financial freedom you will achieve and what your chances of achieving total financial freedom you have.\nNot everyone that sets out to achieve financial freedom will achieve it.\nAchieving financial freedomThere are three factors that will show you if you would achieve financial freedom; And your understanding or ignorance of these factors is what will determine your financial success.\nKnowing what to do to achieve financial freedom is easy \u2013 now you know.",

We can no longer tolerate it.\n\n\u201cWe are stating in very strong terms that the nuisance of noise pollution contravenes both national regulations on acceptable noise levels, and the provisions of AEPB Act, which prohibits any noise that disturbs the neighbourhood.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time we are issuing such notice to the public, but it appears that some people have formed a habit of ignoring them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe director added that the board had sensitised those identified to be involved in raising the noise level beyond the minimum standard in the past.\n\n\u201cThis is why we are issuing this final notice to them as a warning that subsequent contravention will attract stiff penalty in accordance to extant law.\n\n\u201cSection 21 of AEPB Act 10 of 1997, states that any person who operates a grinding machine other than in area designated for that purpose or plays music in a manner which constitutes nuisance to neighbours is causing noise pollution.\n\nALSO READ: Buhari didn\u2019t order sack of AEDC management \u2015 Presidency\n\n\u201cAlso, anyone who makes noise through the use of external bells, loudspeakers or produces smoke to a level dangerous to human health is guilty of an offence.\n\n\u201cSo, such person is liable on conviction to make payment of a fine, imprisonment or a combination of both as the case may be,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAli added that there was a minimum decibel set for residential areas by National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency, (NESREA).\n\nHe explained that noise pollution posed serious health risks, particularly to those who are sick, recuperating at home or elderly and infant populations.\n\nHe said that the board had received complaints from people who had developed high blood pressure and migraine as a result of noise pollution from their neighbours.\n\nAccording to him, it is expected that after an individual or an organisation has been served with an abatement notice, they should comply.\n\n\u201cHowever, after being served up to two or more notices, and a recalcitrant contravener refuses to comply, the person or the organisation is taken to court and prosecuted.\n\n\u201cThe court will issue a directive to seal-up the premises of the offender,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged members of the public to register their complaints in writing to the AEPB director,\n\n\u201cThe complaint will be sent to the Environmental Monitoring Department of the board, whose duty is to monitor and control noise and other nuisance. The enforcement team of AEPB visits anywhere there is complaint.\n\n\u201cWhen it becomes a bit too intractable for them, synergy with sister agencies under the Abuja Metropolitan Management Councils and the Ministerial Enforcement Team, in a joint operation, gets the job done,\u201d he said.\n\n(NAN)\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

A statement by Mr. Tunde Rahman, the spokesman to APC stalwart Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, named the President as the Special Guest of Honour, Lagos Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu as the Chief Host and Tinubu as the Guest of Honour.\n\nA Lagos-based media and publishing company, Gaskia Media Ltd, is the publisher of the 560-page book. It is Akande\u2019s ninth book and may prove to be the most controversial being a comprehensive narration of the former governor\u2019s impactful, colourful and crowded political career.\n\n\u201cThis work is a national gift that could not have been more instructively timed,\u201d the statement quoted Prof Wole Soyinka, Africa\u2019s first Nobel laureate for literature, as writing in a gripping Foreword to the book.\n\nIt went on: \u201cThere are books whose very handling must be done with heavily insulated gloves since, virtually every page sizzles with contradictions between attestable reality and impudent claims, attempts to cover past crimes and dodge responsibilities. Not so, this contribution from the \u2018Wise One of Ila-Orangun.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cIf there is any sizzling, it is simply the fire of truth\u2019s passion that leaps at the reader from between the covers. Akande\u2019s fire purifies, being a flame of illumination carried over from real life to brightens the pages of a saga of service to Nigerian humanity.\u201d\n\nThe book is the most comprehensive autobiography in recent times of a statesman of Akande\u2019s stature and public service experience, which spans almost half-a-century.\n\nTrained as an accountant, he was employed in his younger days as an executive of British Petroleum, one of the global behemoths dominating the oil industry.\n\nHe started his involvement in politics as a councilor in Ila-Orangun, Osun State, before he was elected into the Constituent Assembly in 1977, taking part in the historic assignment of preparing the Nigerian Constitution.\n\nIn 1979 when Chief Bola Ige became the first elected Governor of old Oyo State, he made Akande his Secretary to the State Government, SSG. By 1983, following the rumpus in the ruling Unity Party of Nigeria, (UPN) of Oyo State, Akande became Ige\u2019s Deputy Governor.\n\nAkande was one of the hundreds of politicians detained by the military, following the collapse of the Second Republic in 1983.\n\nThough he regained his freedom in 1985, he vowed never to participate in politics again. However, he soon found himself at the barricade, joining other patriots in the vanguard of opposition to military rule and emerging as the Osun State leader of Afenifere, the mainstream Yoruba cultural and political movement and of the opposition National Democratic Coalition, NADECO.\n\nWhen the military departed in 1999, he became the second elected governor of Osun State.\n\n\u2018My Participations\u2019 dwells on the author\u2019s years of power and its aftermath. The book explains the byzantine politics and convoluted negotiations that resulted in the formation of the APC and the ultimate triumph of the party in the 2015 general elections.\n\nSome of Akande\u2019s most faithful companions in the power game are participating in the event of Thursday which is also expected to witness the attendance of political bigwigs, including governors, ministers, senators and other prominent citizens in the power loop.\n\nThe chairman of the occasion is Dr. Ogbonaya Onu, the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation. The Chief Presenter is Alhaji Kashim Ibrahim-Imam, one of the pivotal figures in the negotiations that gave birth to the APC.\n\nThe book reviewer is Segun Ayobolu, a well-known journalist and columnist. The event will re-affirm Akande\u2019s relevance and clout as one of the dominant political figures of modern Nigerian politics.",

          "text": "The outgoing leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has dismissed insinuations that the party \u201ctaxed\u201d Governor Godwin Obaseki for the September 2020 governorship ticket.\n\nThe PDP had, at the last minute, offered its ticket to Obaseki to re-contest the election, upon his disqualification from the race by the All Progressives Congress (APC) on the platform of which he won his first election in 2016.\n\nBut, in an apparent reaction to the speed with which Osaseki secured the party\u2019s ticket, Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike had branded the PDP leaders \u201ctax collectors\u201d, a veiled accusation of selling the ticket to the highest bidder.\n\nHowever, the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, rejected the \u201ctax collectors\u201d tag as he urged Obaseki to explain to Nigerians and PDP members the processes that led to his emergence as a PDP candidate.\n\nOlogbondiyan spoke yesterday at a valedictory season held in honour of the outgoing team of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC).\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nUrging the Edo governor to tell the truth about the allegation of bribery made against the Uche Secondus-led NWC, Ologbondiyan said the party leaders did not collect any gratification from Obaseki before giving him the ticket.\n\nOlogbondiyan said: \u201cLet me state without mincing words; that the governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, owes members of this NWC the responsibility of clearing our names before the public.\n\n\u201cI will like to place on record that this NWC did not demand any form of gratification from Obaseki before he got the ticket of our party. It is also important to restate that this NWC did not demand any form of \u201ctax\u201d from Governor Obaseki nor did we collect the same. He, therefore, owes it a duty to clear our names.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that the outgoing NWC did its best to reposition and rebuild the party, leading to the regaining of some states.\n\n\u201cBefore the 2019 elections, we had already added three governors from Sokoto, Kwara, and Benue states. The Senate President and Speaker of the House of Representatives led a good number of their colleagues to team up with the party. The APC adopted a reckless maximum rigging to snatch Ekiti and Osun.\n\n\u201cWe rebuilt the party in content and character and this made it an attraction. We came out of the election with 17 governors; the APC stole Imo State while three governors later left the party to pursue personal endeavours, which was the fault of the NWC. The 2018 elective national convention, which produced our presidential candidate, was adjudged the best. It was keenly contested and not by consensus. At the end, none of the astakes, Ayu urged them to learn from such mistakes as they relinquished their positions.\n\nThe party chair said: \u201cI believe whatever mistakes you think you have made, it is only human and all the PDP family will not only appreciate you better but also be ready to forgive you for whatever mistakes you have made.\n\n\u201cBecause your contribution is bigger than whatever mistakes you must have made. And I think you should be proud and very willing to participate actively in party activities. The experience you have gained cannot be bought in the market. It is only experienced people who help us to see that we achieved more.\n\n\u201cThe journey ahead is going to be turbulent and rough. Many people have attributed to me all sorts of capabilities. I\u2019m sorry am not Jesus Christ, neither am I Prophet Mohammed. I am only a team leader who believes firmly that to run a big political party of this nature, you must work with everybody.\n\n\u201cWe must work as a team; there will be no divisions. We will not allow any divisions. And that will extend to all other members of the party. We intend to run an inclusive administration. And that will include all members of the current working committee that is about to handover to us.\n\n\u201cIt will extend to broadening the frontiers of administration to include every party leader in every state. And I believe together we will succeed. And if we succeed, I have succeeded. I thank you for the work you have done in organising this particular valedictory session.\n\n\u201cI think this valedictory session should have actually been an expanded NEC (National Executive Committee) meeting and everybody should have been here to listen to the statements you have made. But I think we have learned from you because, in the next couple of years, we too will be organising another valedictory session. I will try to ensure that everybody is on board.\u201d",

And these two memos are to be implemented by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).\n\n\u201cThe first memo, which has been approved by the FEC, is for the deployment of regulatory systems in the telecommunications industry, which is to be implemented by NCC.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRead Also: NCC to revitalise telecom numbering service segment\n\n\u201cThese regulatory systems have two components.

It is for this reason that a number of notable politicians from other political parties, and indeed, numerous supporters in the PDP, are decamping in droves to the APC.\n\nHe, however, said no matter what Mr Orogu will say about October 6, 2021, local government election in the state, the landslide victory of the APC in the polls is an implicit vote of confidence by the grassroots on the administration of Governor Sule, on the account of his rural transformation agenda.",

Justice Mary Peter Odili, on Friday October 29, 2021, by men suspected to be security operatives, acting on a search warrant purportedly obtained from an Abuja Magistrate\u2019s Court under questionable circumstances.\n\n\u201d I must make it known to all and sundry that we have had enough dosage of such embarrasments and harassments of our judicial officers across the country and we can no longer take any of such shenanigans. The silence of the judiciary should never be mistaken for stupidity or weakness. By the nature of our work, we are conservative but not conquered species and should not be pushed further than this by any individual, institution or agency of the government.\n\n\u201cWith time, those taking the judiciary as a mere weakling will soon realise that it is from the calmest seas we often experience the fiercest storms. The time to oppress, suppress and intimidate judicial officers is gone.\n\n\u201d No one, irrespective of his or her status or position in the country, should test our will because the consequence of such unwarranted provocation will be too dire to bear. We shall begin to resist any clandestine attempt to silence or ridicule us to oblivion. Nigeria, to the best of my knowledge, is not a lawless society.\n\n\u201cWe should begin to do things that will project us favourably and rightly, too, to the International community. No law permits anyone to invade, subdue or overawe any Nigerian citizen in his or her residence with a flimsy, fraudulently obtained search warrant. We are making efforts now to ensure that henceforth, every search or arrest warrant must be issued with the knowledge and approval of the Chief Judge of the respective State/ Federal High Court, as the may be.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Fred Itua, Ndubuisi Orji, Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), yesterday, confirmed three additional cases of COVID-19 with the B.1.1.529 SARS-CoV-2 lineage, the Omicron variant.\n\nThe three cases were in addition to the three earlier announced on December 1. This brings the tally of confirmed Omicron cases in Nigeria to six.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nNCDC, in a statement by its Director General, Dr. Ifedayo Adetifa, noted that all the Omicron cases, so far, were detected in persons with recent travel history to South Africa in November.\n\nThis came as the United Kingdom government said seven travelers from Nigeria had returned positive for Omicron.\n\nNCDC boss confirmed that the UK has formally written to Nigeria on the matter in line with the global health practice.\n\n\u201cIn line with Article 44 of the International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR) reporting framework, the Federal Government of Nigeria through the NCDC has been notified by the UK Government of seven cases of travellers from Nigeria with the Omicron variant.\u201d\n\nDr. Adetifa, however, said that given the reports of increasing numbers of Omicron cases in the UK, the NCDC was also prioritising the sequencing of COVID-19 positive samples in travellers with history of travel to the UK.\n\n\u201cAll viruses naturally mutate over time, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Since SARS-CoV-2 was first identified, several mutations have occurred with the emergence of new lineages.\n\n\u201cThis will continue to happen as long as the world does not act in concert to significantly reduce transmission through vaccination and adherence to effective public health measures such as face mask use, physical distancing, hand hygiene, andensuring good ventilation.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that compliance with the travel protocols provided by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 (PSC-COVID-19) is mandatory for all international travellers arriving in Nigeria from any country and advised incoming travellers to ensure their day two and day seven tests were done as stipulated in Nigeria\u2019s travel advisory, otherwise, there would be consequences which may include publication of details, suspension of their passports and ban on travel to Nigeria.\n\n\u2022Govs Fumes\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) has called on the World Health Organisation (WHO) to intervene by setting uniform standards that are acceptable to all for banning countries across the globe.\n\nThe call followed the travel ban placed on Nigeria by Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe NGF described the inclusion of Nigeria among the Omicron present countries which must stay away from their shores as as precipitate, unfair and discriminatory.\n\nIts chairman and Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, in a statement he personally signed, drew the attention of WHO to what the governors called arbitrary stigmatisation that is caused by the recent banning of countries from visitation based on omicron spread.\n\nAccording to the NGF, \u201cOmicron still remains relatively unknown globally as it is not yet clear whether it is more transmissible from person to person compared to other variants including Delta.\n\n\u201cIt is very discouraging to note that there are several countries that have reported cases of Omicron similar to or higher than Nigeria\u2019s, that have not been banned from entry to the UK and/Canada.\n\n\u201cConfirmed Omicron cases as at December 3rd, across some countries are: Nigeria (3 ); Australia (7); Brazil (3); Germany (9) Israel(4); Italy (9) and Netherlands(16). There is also no evidence that harsh, blanket travel bans will protect the countries that impose them.\n\n\u201cIt is ironical that this ban comes at a time when the DG of the WHO, Tedros Ghebreyesus, has advised that \u201crational proportional risk reduction measures\u201d be taken by countries such as screening passengers prior to departure and/or upon arrival in a country, or enforcing a quarantine period.\n\n\u201cThe NGF, therefore, urges the WHO to intervene in this matter by setting uniform standards that are acceptable to all for banning countries across the globe.\n\n\u201cAs we know, vaccine hesitancy is quite high and for many reasons including disruptive announcements like this which could exacerbate distrust of the vaccine and heighten hesitancy.\n\n\u201cWorld leaders and stakeholders in the West need to remember that with the COVID-19 pandemic, until everyone is free, no one is free. Variants will continue to appear and spread across the globe as long as global herd immunity has not been achieved.\n\n\u201cWe call on countries to be guided by science and fairness in setting the criteria for updating their red list. We encourage both public and private stakeholders to continue to support vaccination efforts and address hesitancy. We encourage Nigerians not to be discouraged and to get vaccinated as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\u2022Senate seeks ban reversal\n\nAlso reacting to the travel ban, the Senate advised the British government to be sensitive to the diplomatic relationship between both countries when taking a decision that affects Nigerians.\n\nIt urged the Federal Government to engage the British authorities to reverse Nigeria\u2019s inclusion on the red list andcharged the administration to remain firm in the enforcement of necessary protocols in the containment of every COVID-19 variant in Nigeria.\n\nIt also called on major vaccines powers, namely, Britain, Canada, America and the European Union, among others, to take urgent and bold steps to ensure vaccine equity in the interest of the entire human race.\n\nThese were parts of resolutions reached by the chamber, following the consideration of a motion on the \u201cNeed for Government of the United Kingdom to remove Nigeria from COVID-19 Red List.\u201d\n\nThe motion was sponsored by Ike Ekweremadu.\n\nComing under order 42 and 52 of the Senate Rules, he noted with satisfaction the efforts of the Nigerian government in the containment and treatment of COVID-19 cases.\n\n\u201cNigeria is among the countries with the lowest cases of COVID-19. The decision by the British government to include Nigeria in their COVID-19 list, with its concomitant implications, will affect many citizens of Nigeria, who had planned to spend their Christmas and New Year holiday with their families.\n\n\u201cAlso worried that Nigerians with genuine needs to visit the UK within this period will be denied visa and those with visa will not be allowed to enter the UK.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker noted that Nigerians have consistently complied with all the COVID-19 protocols required by the WHO and UK government for travelers prior to the ban.\n\nHe emphasised that \u201ctargeting African countries, especially in the COVID-19 travel ban, amounts to profiling and discrimination as well as an attack on our cordial diplomatic relationship with the UK.\u201d\n\nSenate President, Ahmad Lawan, said the decision to include Nigeria on the UK COVID-19 red list poses a strain on the diplomatic relationship between both countries. He bemoaned the poor treatment of Nigeria by the UK government.\n\nLawan, therefore, called on the British parliament to intervene with a view to having Nigeria removed from the country\u2019s COVID-19 red list.\n\n\u201cLet there be justification for it. We are not saying that they cannot put any country on the red list, including Nigeria, but there must be reasons for doing that.\n\n\u201cNigeria has done so well to the admiration of many countries in the area of containment of COVID-19. Therefore, we don\u2019t see any reason why Nigeria will be on that so called red list.\n\n\u201cI believe that Nigerians deserve better treatment from the British government. I\u2019m using this opportunity to ask the British Parliament to mount pressure on their government to remove Nigeria from the so called red list.\u201d\n\nReps kick over UK travel ban\n\nThe House of Representatives also called on the UK to rescind the ban immediately and urged the Federal Government to interface with the UK authorities, immediately over the issue.\n\nElumelu, in a motion moved under matters of urgent public importance, on the \u201cneed to intervene in the issuance of visitors visa to Nigerians by the United Kingdom Government\u201d explained that the ban affects those going to the UK for tourism, visiting friends and family, business trips, exchange programmes, as well as medical reasons.\n\nElumelu expressed worry that \u201crather than seek to work with its commonwealth ally on ways to combat and curtail the spread of this new variant, the UK government decided to out rightly ban Nigerian travelers from entering their country which is a sharp contrast to that of the United States government whose response is for travelers to produce evidence of negative test result at the point of departure as well as a day two test result after arrival in their country, a response that have received wide commendation across board.\n\n\u201cThe UK government chose to announce the ban without discussing the data in its possession with the Nigerian government but instead gave an hour notice to the Nigeria authorities before its inclusion on the red list, contrary to known international convention. \u2026Omicron variant has now been found in over 40 countries around the world including many from the European Union but only Nigeria and a few African countries have been banned by the UK government.\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\nThe lawmaker, argued that if the government does not challenge the ban, thousands of Nigerians, who usually return home from the UK for Christmas festivities would not be able to come. He stated that would cost the country serious revenue loss. The House mandated its committees on health and foreign affairs to interface with the ministries of health, foreign affairs and the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 on how to resolve the issue.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

He held that since the order was made based on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion on notice filed before the court, all pending applications would be taken on the next adjourned date.\n\nThe judge had, on November 5 made the order after counsel to the 36 state governments (plaintiffs), Jibrin Okutekpa, SAN, moved an ex-parte motion, seeking an order of interim injunction restraining the Federal Government from deducting any money accruing or due to all or any of the 36 states of the federation.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nThe court had also ruled that the restraining order would subsist pending the determination of the substantive suit.\n\nWhile the 36 states Attorneys-General are the plaintiffs, some of the defendants listed in the suit include the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Accountant General of the Federation and Ministry of Finance. Others are Central Bank of Nigeria, Debt Management Office, Federation Account Allocation Committee, Incorporated Trustees of Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON), among others.\n\nAccording to the motion dated and filed October 27, 43 defendants are sued in the matter.\n\nAt the resumed hearing, counsel to the plaintiffs, Okutekpa told the court that the matter was slated for hearing. He said he had two motions which he intended to move.\n\nHe told the court that though most of the defendants had responded by serving on them various applications, the ninth defendant (Dr. Chris Asoluka, who does business under the name and style of NIPAL Consulting Network) had refused to receive their court processes.\n\n\u201cWe have a motion ex-parte to serve the nine defendant an originating process. The process dated December 6 was filed on December 6 and it is praying for an order of substituted service on the ninth defendant,\u201d he said.\n\nThe judge granted prayer one of the motion and ordered that the service be made on the ninth defendant within three days through pasting of the notice on his address.\n\nThe senior lawyer told the court that the second motion was an application praying the court for an extension of time to file and serve their counter affidavit and all other processes in response to the defendants\u2019 applications.\n\nEkwo also granted prayer one of the motion and granted prayer two in part subject to the service of the motion on the two counsel who appeared for 15th, 16th, 10th and 11th defendants.\n\nThe two counsel had opposed the motion on the ground that they had not been served with the copy.\n\nOkutekpa then asked for a date for hearing.\n\nHowever, Oyin Koleoso who appeared for the first, 2 second, fourth and sixth defendants (president of Nigeria, AGF, Ministry of Finance Incorporated and Debt Management Office), informed the court that a motion asking the court to vacate the earlier order made had been filed.\n\nWole Olanipekun, SAN, who appeared for the 14th defendant (Dr. Ted Iseghohi-Edwards) also urged the court to set aside the order.\n\nHe argued that he made the plea based on the Supreme Court and Appeal Court decisions under which the judge took the application.\n\nChief Olusola Oke, SAN, who is lawyer to 12th and 13th defendants (Riok Nigeria Ltd and Prince Nicholas Ukachukwu) also supported Olanipekun\u2019s submission.\n\nOke, who told the court that his clients were affected by the order, urged the court to take their application seeking for the order to be vacated.\n\nOrji Orizu, who appeared for himself in the suit as 18th defendant, backed Oke\u2019s statement.\n\nHe argued that since an ex-parte motion lasts within 14 days, the lawyer prayed the court to discharge the order.\n\nIdumodin Ogumu, who represented 15th and 16th defendants ( Panic Alert Security Services Systems Ltd and Dr George Uboh), said he aligned himself with submissions of other counsel.\n\nHe argued that based on the rule of the court, the order granted by the court was deemed to have elapsed and no longer had effect.\n\nHowever, counsel to the plaintiffs, Okutekpa, disagreed with the defence submission.\n\nHe referred the court to the order which its made. The senior lawyer argued that it was an order of interim injunction restraining the Federal Government, acting through its agencies also joined in the suit, from deducting the plaintiffs\u2019 monies pending the determination of the motion on notice.\n\nHe said the order was also made in compliance with the rule of the court.\n\n\u201cYour Lordship was aware of the rule when you were making the order.

          "text": "\u2022Wants restriction scrapped\n\n\u2022 Travel ban discriminatory, attack on diplomatic relations, Senate tells UK\n\n\u2022NCDC confirms three new cases\n\n\u2022Seven travellers from Nigeria test positive in UK\n\n\u2022NCAA threatens to ban international airlines that flout COVID-19 protocols\n\nDeji Elumoye, Onyebuchi Ezigbo, Adedayo Akinwale,\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Chinedu Eze in Lagos\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, The Most Rev. Justin Welby yesterday waded into the growing outrage among Nigerians condemning the United Kingdom\u2019s (UK) inclusion of Nigeria in its COVID-19 red list without justification, saying it was a \u201ctravel apartheid\u201d and calls for it to be scrapped.\n\nIn series of tweets on his Twitter handle,@JustinWelby, the Archbishop of Canterbury urged the UK government to abolish what he described as the \u201cmorally wrong and self-defeating\u201d red list.\n\nThe United Nations Secretary General had a few days ago described the action of the UK government as travel Apartheid, targeted at poor nations.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Senate yesterday, also insisted that the travel ban was discriminatory and an attack on diplomatic relations between the two nations and called for the UK to remove it.\n\nThe Red chamber at plenary accordingly, called on the British authorities to consider removing Nigeria from the red list.\n\nHowever, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) yesterday confirmed three more omicron cases in Nigeria.\n\nThe centre also said that Nigeria has been notified by the UK government of seven cases of travellers from Nigeria with the infection.\n\nThis was just as the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has threatened to ban from Nigeria, any airline operating international services that do not abide by the country\u2019s COVID-19 protocols for passengers as issued by the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC).\n\nNigeria became the 11th country to go on the UK\u2019s red list for international travelon Monday. All nations currently on that list are African.\n\nThe only people allowed to enter the UK from these countries are UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents. They would have to pay for and self-isolate in a pre-booked government-approved hotel for a total of 10 days.\n\nBut in a message to his 165,000 Twitter followers, the Archbishop wrote: \u201cWith #Omicron set to become the dominant variant in the UK, I appeal to the British government to remove Nigeria and South Africa from the red list \u2013 together with all other countries currently on it.\n\n\u201cWe must find fair and effective approaches for those who are vaccinated and tested to enter the UK. I agree with the Nigerian High Commissioner to the UK \u2013 we cannot have \u2018travel apartheid\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt is also morally wrong \u2013 and self-defeating \u2013 effectively to punish other nations for being transparent when they discover new Covid variants, as @ArchbishopThabo of Cape Town has said.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) had said that blanket travel bans would not stop the spread of the variant, and could potentially discourage countries from reporting and sharing important data on coronavirus.\n\nWelby had previously criticised the addition of Nigeria, Botswana and South Africa to the red list, saying they were \u201ccountries already suffering that will suffer more.\u201d\n\nSenate Wants Nigeria Removed from Red List\n\nFurthermore, the Senate advised the UK government to be sensitive to the diplomatic relationship between both countries when taking decision that affect Nigerian citizens.\n\nIt urged the federal government to engage British authorities to reverse Nigeria\u2019s inclusion on the red list.\n\nThe upper chamber also charged the administration to remain firm in the enforcement of necessary protocols in the containment of every COVID-19 variant in Nigeria.\n\nIt further advised developing countries which it listed to include Britain, Canada, United States of America, the European Union, among others, to take urgent and bold steps to ensure vaccine equity in the interest of the entire human race.\n\nThe resolutions were reached by the Senate sequel to the consideration of a motion on the, \u201cNeed for Government of the United Kingdom to remove Nigeria from COVID-19 Red List,\u201d sponsored by the former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu (Enugu West).\n\nComing under order 42 and 52 of the Senate Rules, Ekweremadu noted with satisfaction the efforts of the Government of Nigeria in the containment and treatment of COVID-19 cases.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cNigeria is among the countries with the lowest cases of COVID-19.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision by the British Government to include Nigeria in their COVID-19 list, with its concomitant implications, will affect many citizens of Nigeria, who had planned to spend their Christmas and New Year holiday with their families.\n\n\u201cAlso worried that Nigerians with genuine needs to visit the U.K within this period will be denied visa and those with visa will not be allowed to enter the U.K.\u201d\n\nThe ranking Senator noted that Nigerians have consistently complied with all the COVID-19 protocols required by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the UK Government for travelers prior to the ban.\n\nHe emphasised that, \u201ctargeting African countries, especially in the COVID-19 travel ban, amounts to profiling and discrimination as well as an attack on our cordial diplomatic relationship with the UK.\u201d\n\nEkweremadu drew the attention of the lawmakers to global concerns over vaccines hoarding and inequity and the resulting consequences on low-income nations in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nIn his contribution, Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, said the decision to include Nigeria on the UK COVID-19 red list posed a strain on the diplomatic relationship between both countries, just as he bemoaned the poor treatment of Nigeria by the UK government.\n\nHe, therefore, called on the British Parliament to intervene with a view to having Nigeria removed from the country\u2019s COVID-19 red list.\n\nLawan added: \u201cLet there be justification for it. We are not saying that they cannot put any country on the red list, including Nigeria, but there must be reasons for doing that.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, Nigeria has done so well to the admiration of many countries in the area of containment of COVID-19. Therefore, we don\u2019t see any reason why Nigeria will be on that so called red list.\n\n\u201cI believe that Nigerians deserve better treatment from the British government. I\u2019m using this opportunity to ask the British Parliament to mount pressure on their government to remove Nigeria from the so called red list.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, members of the House of Representatives were sharply divided yesterday, following a debate on the decision of the UK to place temporary visa ban on Nigerians after the discovery of omicron variant.\n\nWhile some House of Representatives members were of the views that the decision of the UK government against Nigerians was harsh and racist, others believed it was a wake-up call on the government and those in authority to fix the country, especially the health and education sector.\n\nWhile the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase who presided over the plenary allocated more time for the debate on temporary visa ban to run for almost an hour, the debate on the death of a pupil at Dowen College, Lagos didn\u2019t enjoy the same preference.\n\nMoving the motion, the Minority Leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu said the decision of the UK government came only a few days after Canada extended its travel ban to travelers who recently visited Nigeria.\n\nHe said though the ban was for Nigerians bound for the UK, it does not exempt over 8,000 Nigerian travelers that had bought air tickets to visit Nigeria during the yuletide period, saying the restriction would affect their re-entry into the UK after holidays.\n\nElumelu noted that rather than seek to work with its commonwealth ally on ways to combat and curtail the spread of this new variant, the UK government decided to outright ban Nigerian travelers from entering their country.\n\nAccording to him, this was in sharp contrast to that of the United States government whose response was for travelers to produce evidence of negative test result at the point of departure as well as a day two test result after arrival in their country, a response that have received wide commendation across board,\n\nThe lawmaker further expressed worry that the UK government chose to announce the ban without discussing the data in its possession with the Nigerian government, but instead gave an hour notice to the Nigeria authorities before its inclusion on the red list, contrary to known international convention.\n\nElumelu said the Omicron variant has now been found in over 40 countries around the world including many from the European Union, but only Nigeria and a few African countries were banned by the UK government.\n\nThe minority leader stressed that if the Nigerian government does not urgently engage the authorities of UK, the decision could have a significant impact on businesses and travelers intending to carry out lawful transactions in the UK as opportunities and investments already made would be lost, hence the need for a quick interface.\n\nElumelu noted that children who school abroad and had thought of returning home during this festive period to rejoin with their families and with fears that when they later go back would be subjected to 10 days mandatory isolation centre and be made to pay \u00a32,700 for such hotel bookings may be totally discouraged from coming home and thereby deny such families the opportunity of their children rejoining them for this annual family union.\n\nContributing, Hon. Aminu Suleiman said there was a need for the country to do internal assessment.\n\nHe said Nigeria has already admitted to having an omicron variant, saying there was no need castigating another sovereign country for taking such a decision as it has the right to do so.\n\nOn his part, Hon. Nicholas Ossai said the issue canvassed by the minority leader was germane, adding that there was need to meet with the British government and resolve the issue diplomatically.\n\nIn his submission, Hon. Nnonli Nnaji said inasmuch as he aligned himself to the motion, the message from the action by the UK government was for Nigerians to fix their country.\n\nOn his part, Hon. Onofiok Luke said there was a need for introspection, stressing that there was need to join hands with the leadership to make sure that the right things are done.\n\nHe said rather than blaming other countries, there was a need to fix the country and make things work.\n\nNCDC Confirms Three New Cases of Omicron Variant\n\nHowever, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has\n\nconfirmed three more cases of the COVID-19 with the B.1.1.529 SARS-CoV-2 lineage, which is the omicron variant, in Nigeria.\n\nA statement signed by the Director General of NCDC, Dr. Ifedayo Adetifa, noted that given reports of increasing numbers of omicron cases in the UK, the NCDC was prioritising the sequencing of COVID-19 positive samples in travellers with history of travel to the UK.\n\nThe three new cases bring the total number of omicron variant so far detected in Nigeria to six.\n\nNCDC had previously announced the detection of three cases of omicron variant on December 2021.\n\nIn the statement, Adetifa said all omicron cases so far detected in Nigeria were detected in persons with recent travel history to South Africa in November.\n\n\u201cIn line with Article 44 of the International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR) reporting framework, the federal government of Nigeria through the NCDC has also been notified by the UK government of seven cases of travellers from Nigeria with the Omicron variant.\n\n\u201cGiven the reports of increasing numbers of Omicron cases in the UK, the NCDC is also prioritising the sequencing of COVID-19 positive samples in travellers with history of travel to the UK,\u201d it explained.\n\nThe NCDC said it would through the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) continue to coordinate genomic surveillance activities across the country to sequence all positive COVID-19 samples from international travellers arriving in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis includes sequencing of positive samples from international travellers from October 2021 to date,\u201d said NCDC.\n\nThe Centre however maintained that the Delta variant has remained the dominant variant than the new omicron variant.\n\nIt also stated that there was no evidence of generalised or community transmission of this variant in Nigeria.\n\nThe Centre said it would continue implement effective public heath measures such as mask use, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and defaulters which may include publication of their details, suspension of their passports take personal and collective responsibility to ensure the safety of all Nigerians.\n\nFurthermore, it advised that incoming travellers should ensure their day two and day seven tests are done into effect on day five in compliance with the travel protocols provided by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID19.\n\n\u201cThe NCDC and the Federal Ministry of Health urges members of the public to continue to COVID-19 (PSC-COVID-19) is mandatory for all international travellers arriving in Nigeria and ban on travel to Nigeria by the PSC-COVID-19.\n\nNCAA Threatens to Ban International Airlines\n\nThe NCAA has threatened to ban from Nigeria any airline operating international services that does not abide by COVID-19 protocols for its passengers, as issued by the PSC.\n\nIt stressed that non-compliance to the boarding requirements by any airline would attract a penalty of $3, 500 per passenger adding that airlines which consistently fail to comply with these requirements, may be banned from coming to Nigeria.\n\nThe aviation regulatory authority insisted that the airlines must follow revised quarantine protocol for travellers arriving or departing Nigeria. It also said passengers must follow the revised provisional quarantine protocol as updated by the PSC on COVID-19.\n\nNCAA therefore directed all airline operators to convey to travellers the revised provisional quarantine protocol.\n\nIn a statement dated December 3, 2021, and directed to airline accountable managers and country manager, it stated: \u201cAirlines are to however note that protocols for international flight operations issued on 1st July 2021 still subsists.\u201d\n\nOn inbound passengers, the NCAA stated that airlines are to only board passengers travelling to Nigeria who are in possession of a paid permit to travel with QR Code and result of a negative COVID-19 PCR test done not later than 48 hours from time of boarding the flight.\n\n\u201cFor any inbound passenger who is unable to either make payment for his /her repeat PCR test(s) or generate a paid permit to travel via the Nigerian international Travel Portal (NIPT), airlines are to send an email to designated email addresses for necessary assistance,\u201d it added.\n\nThe statement which was signed by the NCAA Director General, Captain Musa Nuhu also stated that for outbound flights, airlines are to only board passengers travelling out of Nigeria with evidence of either full vaccination for COVID-19 or result of negative COVID-19 PCR test done at NCDC accredited private laboratories not later than 48 hours from time of boarding.\n\nNigeria Can Only Embark on Retaliatory Action as Last Resort, Says NIIA\n\nIn a related development, the Director General of the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA), Prof. Eghosa Osaghae, yesterday argued that unless all other avenue\u2019s had been exhausted, Nigeria may not retaliate.\n\nSpeaking on ARISE Television, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, Osaghae who was reacting to calls by some Nigerians to ban UK citizens from the country in like manner, argued that until all other alternatives to a peaceful resolution were fully deployed, retaliation would not be necessary.\n\n\u201cBy the way, if you have exhausted all possible avenues for addressing disagreements or conflicts of this nature, then of course, you know if all these fail, you can then resort to reciprocity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that you know that this is not something that is beyond resolution and as the chair of our response team, the secretary to the government of the federation said yesterday that there are talks going on behind the scene and we hope that this issue will be resolved,\u201d he stressed.\n\nOsaghae expressed the hope that the issue doesn\u2019t degenerate in the coming days, saying that the British response had been too highhanded and discriminatory.\n\n\u201c At the last count, there were 47 countries that had reported cases of Omicron, the variant, and out of these 47, there are only about six in Africa. And when you introduce travel restrictions, it is not to all of these 47 countries, it\u2019s only to the Southern African countries and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd yet the evidence suggests that this (virus) is not restricted to Africa. It\u2019s not restricted to Nigeria. And Nigeria itself is not a source. It\u2019s not an originator. The fact that it was detected, that doesn\u2019t make South Africa the owner,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emma Okonji\n\nWith the successful acquisition of GPX India and 13 Bell Data Centers in Canada, Equinix, one of the world\u2019s digital infrastructure companies, yesterday announced its expansion into Africa through a deal to acquire MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider.\n\nAccording to a statement, the transaction has an enterprise value of $320 million.\n\nMainOne currently has presence in Nigeria, Ghana and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, with establishment of its tier 111 Data Centre in the aforementioned countries and is also building a second data centre in Lekki, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nThe acquisition was expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the requisite regulatory approvals.\n\nThe transaction was expected to be Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) accretive upon close, excluding integration costs, marking the first step in Equinix\u2019s long-term strategy to become a leading African carrier neutral digital infrastructure company.\n\nWith more than 200 million people, Nigeria is Africa\u2019s largest economy and, along with Ghana, has become an established data center hub.\n\nThis makes the acquisition a pivotal entry point for Equinix into the continent.\n\nEquinix believes MainOne to be one of the most exciting technology businesses to emerge from Africa.\n\nFounded by Funke Opeke in 2010, the company has enabled connectivity for the business community of Nigeria and now has digital infrastructure assets including three operational data centers, with an additional facility under construction expected to open in Q1 2022.\n\n\u201cUpon closing, these facilities will add more than 64,000 gross square feet of space to Platform Equinix, with 570,000 square feet of land for future expansions,\u201d it added.\n\nMainOne owns and operates a subsea network from Nigeria to Portugal, as well as 1,200 kilometers of reliable terrestrial fiber network across southern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThese are all improving connectivity to and from Europe, West African countries and the major business communities in Nigeria. When completed, this acquisition will extend Platform Equinix into West Africa, giving organisations based inside and outside of Africa access to one of the world\u2019s fastest growing markets,\u201d it stated.\n\nSpeaking about the planned acquisition, President and CEO, Equinix, Charles Meyers, said: \u201cThe acquisition of MainOne will represent a critical point of entry for Platform Equinix into the expansive and rapidly growing African market.\n\n\u201cMainOne\u2019s leading interconnection position and experienced management team represent critical assets in our aspirations to be the leading neutral provider of digital infrastructure in Africa. \u201cGrowth of data consumption in Africa is amongst the fastest in the world, and our customers are looking for a trusted partner to pursue the opportunities presented by broad mobile adoption and greater connectivity across the region.\n\n\u201cMainOne\u2019s infrastructure, customer relationships, partner ecosystem and operating capability will extend the reach of Platform Equinix and bolster opportunities for customers in Africa and throughout the world.\u201d\n\nOn her part, Opeke said: \u201cEquinix will accelerate our long-term vision to grow digital infrastructure investments across Africa. I thank our founding shareholders led by Mr. Fola Adeola, MainStreet Technologies, AFC, PAIDF, FBN, Polaris and AfDB for investing in the MainOne vision to bridge the digital divide in Africa.\n\n\u201cWith similar values and culture to what we have jointly built in twelve years, Equinix is the preferred partner for our growth journey. The MainOne team is excited about the partnership created through the acquisition, and we look forward to building our next chapter together.\u201d\n\nThe President, EMEA, Equinix, Eugene Bergen also said the expansion in Africa, \u201chas long been a strategic priority for us. With MainOne, we have found a company that not only has highly complementary data center and connectivity assets, but can further accelerate the expansion of our business model and growth objectives.\u201d\n\n\u201cCEO Funke Opeke and her team have built a powerful and dynamic infrastructure that will enable international customers\u2019 access to the continent and African organisations access to the global Equinix platform.\n\n\u201cCustomers can take full advantage of Equinix\u2019s leading global interconnection services to connect with customers and partners, participate in rich digital ecosystems and expand their business across Africa and around the world,\u201d he added.\n\nUnder the terms of the transaction, the management team, including Opeke, would continue to serve in their respective roles.\n\nOpeke holds a master\u2019s in engineering from Columbia University and was named one of the World\u2019s Top 50 Women in Tech by Forbes in 2018 for her efforts in sparking internet adoption. She was also recently named one of the Top 10 Women to Watch in the Data Center Industry by Data Centre Magazine.\n\nGlobally, Platform Equinix is comprised of 237 data centers across 65 metros and 27 countries, providing data center and interconnection services for over 10,000 of the world\u2019s leading businesses, including more than 50 per cent of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Facility to save $7bn annual medical tourism spending, says Oramah\n\nDeji Elumoye and\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday conducted the official take-off of the planned $300 million African Medical Centre of Excellence (AMCE) to be implemented in Abuja by the Benedict Oramah-led African Export\u2013Import Bank (Afreximbank).\n\nAt the event which he attended virtually, the president who decried the rising cases of non-communicable diseases like cancer, noted that unfortunately, West African countries lacked the wherewithal to deal with such aliments.\n\nAccording to Buhari, such ailments are now the highest contributors to non-communicable disease mortalities, representing more than 81 per cent of all NCD deaths in West Africa.\n\n\u201cCardiovascular ailments, cancers and haematological disorders have increasingly become matters of concern to public healthcare. The World Health Organisation (WHO) projects that deaths on the African continent attributable to cancer and diabetes are expected to rise over the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe rising NCD burden coupled with inadequate medical infrastructure on the continent threatens the future of our people. Right now, many hospitals in the West African region are underfunded, underequipped, understaffed and relatively inaccessible to most patients especially from rural areas,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe president noted that inasmuch as the situation represents an opportunity for investment in African healthcare, it had not necessarily translated into increased investment activity in the most pressing areas that require intervention.\n\nHe explained that the problem was further exacerbated by the significant brain drain experienced by the continent, adding that the exodus of doctors and nurses to other continents had resulted in a significant gap between the required treatments for non-communicable and the available treatments and care.\n\n\u201cThe above challenges combine to create a regional health market with poor access to critical services and low perception of quality of care available,\u2019\u2019 the president noted.\n\nWhile lauding the bank, Buhari said the 500-bed specialist facility will provide services in the areas of oncology, cardiology, and haematology and will seek to address the significant shortage of clinical care options in the West African sub-region.\n\n\u201cThe AMCE demonstrates that Afreximbank is not only Africa\u2019s trade finance partner, but its a development partner,\u201d he said, adding that a stronger partnership with the private sector will help in improving health facilities and access in the country.\n\nAside Afreximbank , other partners in the project include Kings College Hospital, London, University of Winsconsin Teaching Hospital, USA and Christies Hospital, Manchester.\n\nAccording to the president, in addition to providing comprehensive care across the three critical care areas, the AMCE will offer educational services to develop talent and establish itself as a world-class research centre, in partnership with global institutions.\n\n\u201cThe success of the AMCE will pave the way for future investments and partnerships in the sector while raising the local standard of healthcare and providing a blueprint for quality of services required to address Nigeria\u2019s and Africa\u2019s healthcare and economic challenges,\u201d he said.\n\nOramah, in his remarks said the ceremony was one step towards self-reliance for Africa\u2019s health care delivery as the project will pool world-class technology and global talents, particularly the African diaspora.\n\nOramah noted that the 500-bed and estimated $300 million AMCE was conceived to promote intra-African medical tourism and reduce the outflow of over $7 billion annually in outbound medical tourism.\n\nHe added that the vision for the health centre was borne out of a personal experience he encountered following his recovery from a potentially life-threatening blood disorder.\n\nAside its services in the areas of diagnostics, oncology, haematology, cardiology and general healthcare services, he stated that another significant focus of the AMCE is to perform innovative and ground-breaking research, development and educational programmes in partnership with leading global institutions.\n\nIn addition, the bank said that the facility has the potential to establish the largest and most diverse biobank in West Africa enabling it to attract global and Pan-African partnerships making it a global point of reference and source of medical tourism in the region.\n\n\u201cIt will also offer residency, training and placement programmes such that physicians and students at local teaching hospitals will have opportunities to train under the expertise of its specialists and with the benefit of its AMCE\u2019s patient volumes.\n\n\u201cThe partnership with King\u2019s College Hospital will increase locally available clinical capabilities, provide education and training, relying on KCH\u2019s two centuries\u2019 of experience in providing specialist healthcare services, medicine, and medical research.\n\n\u201cAfreximbank will also set its sights on implementing a continent-wide plan of developing similar AMCEs with the aim of improving the quality of healthcare and health related research to cater for the African population,\u201d the African bank stated.\n\nThe Abuja AMCE is also expected to enhance service exports providing healthcare to over 50,000 people annually, promote employment and creating over 3,000 jobs during its construction and operational phases and conserve foreign exchange.\n\nIn his remarks, the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, said all hands are on deck, with the inter-ministerial committee working to ensure that the project is actualised in a way that is beneficial to all parties.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Among them there are rock bandits, they are dangerous, armed ready to fire.\n\n\u201cIt is dangerous, still we risked our lives to see that we bring peace to this nation. Because somebody has to take that risk and we took it and thanked God we came out safely and knowledgeable, knowing how to come about this issue.\n\n\u201cMaybe in the future when the political situation changes for better, we can do it again so that there will be peace, harmony and tranquility in the country.\u201d",

          "title": "Could Africa ditch cash?",
          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Conrad Onyango, bird\n\nA preference for mobile money, the fast takeup of digital currencies, the growing allure of regulated cryptocurrencies among central banks and now, a call for a continental cryptocurrency. Could this spell the end of paper money in Africa?\n\nThe era of cash could be drawing to an end as central bank-backed digital currencies (CBDC\u201ds) takes root in Africa.\n\nThe cryptocurrency era\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated the use of cashless payments \u2013 mainly through mobile money platforms and online banking \u2013 the period has also ushered in widespread use of cryptocurrencies, with the result that digital currencies are fast becoming mainstream across the continent.\n\nEconomic and financial experts are the latest to rally behind the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies through a call for a common African digital currency to spur trade and economic development post-pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe need to come up with a cryptocurrency that is acceptable to each member state. It\u2019s better to do it at the continental level, and we have the expertise to do it,\u201d Anouar Hassoune, Professor of Finance and CEO of the West Africa Rating Agency, told delegates at the 2021 African Economic Conference last week.\n\nSo far, it\u2019s only Nigeria that has launched an official, state-backed digital currency \u2013 christened the eNaira \u2013 on the continent as more countries continue to express interest.\n\nLast month, Tanzania\u2019s central bank joined a growing list of African countries to express the intention of launching its own, regulated digital currency, taking its cue from the rising adoption of cryptocurrencies and wanting to avoid \u2018being left behind.\u2019\n\nSouth Africa is currently piloting project Dunbar, an international financial settlement system that uses multiple central bank digital currencies, while Mauritius has a digital currency in the development stages.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOther countries in Africa \u2013 including Kenya, Morocco, Tunisia and Ghana \u2013 are researching the best model to deploy in their jurisdictions, according to US think tank Atlantic Council\u2019s digital currency tracker.\n\nPanellists at last week\u2019s African Economic Conference, organized by the African Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the Economic Commission for Africa, said there would first need to be reform in the financial sector through harmonization of national rules and protocols governing the financial systems of individual countries, to make a pan-African cryptocurrency a reality.\n\n\u201cWe should not forget that there is a lot of work to be done on the digital infrastructure, the development of payment systems, payment system interoperability really needs to be worked on, so there is a lot of work to be done in collaboration with the financial institutions on digitalisation of delivery and payment channels,\u201d said Emmanuelle Riedel Drouin, head of the Economic and Financial Transition Department at Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement.\n\nA common cryptocurrency, Hassoune said, would ease the cost of doing business, give the continent an identity and serve as an alternative means to monetise some of the continent\u2019s endowments, such as gold and other commodities.\n\nNestcoin, a new African venture launched last month and headed by former Binance Labs director, Yele Bademosi, has set out to make cryptocurrencies mainstream across the continent, with a promise to make crypto accessible to anyone.\n\n\u201cThe power of crypto lies in its potential to circumvent poorly designed economic infrastructure and connect anyone to a global economy with access to unlimited financial opportunities,\u201d Bademosi said in a statement.\n\nNelly Chatue-Diop and her West African crypto startup, Ejara, made waves earlier this year with the biggest capital raise by a women-led startup in the sub-region, to date. Chatue-Diop\u2019s company provides users with a non-custodian crypto wallet (described in the industry has having your own \u201cbank\u201d) and the company\u2019s markting focus is on women in French-speaking West Africa.\n\nCurrently, three countries are driving the continent towards a cashless era, with a widespread use of both mobile money, or crypto adoption, or both, driven partly by the pandemic.\n\nThe Baobab Network has traced at least 60 cryptocurrency companies in Africa, with the majority (43 percent) of them headquartered in Nigeria, followed by South Africa (18 percent) and Kenya (11 percent).\n\nSimilarly, global digital payments solution provider Visa in a September report showed a growing preference for mobile wallets, particularly in Kenya (56 percent) followed by Nigeria (14 percent) and South Africa (7 percent).\n\nThis is affirmed by another comparative study by GSMA published in March 2021 showing more than half of 310 live mobile money services in 2020 across the globe were found in Africa.\n\nWith over 55 percent of the world\u2019s mobile money services recorded in Africa and a significant population turning to e-wallets and cryptocurrency, the question now becomes whether the continent might ditch paper money altogether.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider with a presence in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is set to be acquired for $320 million by American multinational Equinix Inc., the US company said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe all-cash transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of next year, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the requisite regulatory approvals.\n\nFounded by Funke Opeke in 2010, MainOne is a key provider of enterprise connectivity solutions, with an estimated 800+ business-to-business customers. These include major international technology enterprises, social media companies, global telecom operators, financial service companies, and cloud service providers.\n\nThe company owns and operates an extensive submarine network extending 7,000 kilometers from Portugal to Lagos, Accra, and along the West African coast, with landing stations in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. These provide connectivity to and from Europe, West African countries, and the major business communities in Nigeria.\n\nMainOne also owns digital infrastructure assets that include three operational data centers, with an additional facility under construction expected to open in Q1 2022. These are in addition to key internet exchanges enabling low latency to key global networks, including Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the management team, including CEO Opeke, will continue to serve in their respective roles.\n\n\u201cThe MainOne team is excited about the partnership created through the acquisition,\u201d Opeke said in the statement. \u201cWith similar values and culture to what we have built in 12 years, Equinix is the preferred partner for our growth journey and will accelerate our long-term vision to grow digital infrastructure investments across Africa.\u201d\n\nFor Equinix, a global specialist in data centres and internet connectivity, the deal marks the first step in a long-term strategy to become a leading provider of digital infrastructure in Africa.\n\nEquinix believes MainOne to be one of the most exciting technology businesses to emerge from Africa, making the acquisition a pivotal entry point for the US company into the continent.\n\n\u201cExpansion in Africa has long been a strategic priority for us. With MainOne, we have found a company that not only has highly complementary data center and connectivity assets but can further accelerate the expansion of our business model and growth objectives,\u201d said Eugene Bergen, EMEA President at Equinix.\n\nEquinix\u2019s data centres around the world.\n\nGiven the huge supply gap in digital infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa, Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer, expects more of such transactions in the coming years. \u201cDeals like the MainOne acquisition will keep drawing foreign investors\u2019 attention to the region,\u201d Omole told TechCabal over the phone.\n\nThe UN International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates SSA is home to approximately 700 million of the world\u2019s 3.7 billion people without access to the internet. More so, available infrastructure in the region is barely enough for the current internet users.\n\n\u201cWith increasing internet traffic, smartphone penetration, and digitisation, we can only expect demand for cloud services and digital infrastructure to increase with foreign players looking to plug that gap,\u201d Omole added.\n\nGlobally, Platform Equinix is comprised of 237 data centres across 65 metros and 27 countries, providing data centre and interconnection services for over 10,000 businesses, including more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies. When completed, the acquisition will extend Platform Equinix into West Africa.\n\n\u201cMainOne\u2019s leading interconnection position and experienced management team represent critical assets in our aspirations to be the leading neutral provider of digital infrastructure in Africa,\u201d added Charles Meyers, President and CEO of Equinix.\n\nMainOne\u2019s founding shareholders include Nigerian businessman and founder of Guaranty Trust Bank, Fola Adeola, MainStreet Technologies, the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), Pan African Infrastructure Development Fund (PAIDF), First Bank, Polaris Bank, and the African Development Bank (AfDB).\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Earnipay is improving financial well-being for salaried employees",
          "text": "In Nigeria, wages for formal-sector employees are paid monthly; in the informal sector, however, this is paid daily. Now, when salaried employees go broke between paydays, they have three options: borrow, take a loan, or request a salary advance. But loans, most times, come with exploitative interest rates and salary advance schemes could plunge an employee deeper into debt.\n\nEarnipay, a fintech solution, founded by Nonso Onwuzulike, allows employees flexible access to their accrued salaries on any day of the month.\n\nRevising the payday cycle\n\nIn 2019, Onwuzulike started a recycling company in Accra, Ghana, to reduce plastic waste and enable plastic recycling in the capital city. While running the business, he hired waste collectors and placed them on a monthly payment schedule. However, these employees\u2014all of them coming from informal-sector backgrounds\u2014were unhappy about this. They were used to being paid after a job was completed, or at the end of the workday. The monthly payment cycle left them cash-strapped and unable to match their daily expenses to their income. Consequently, once salaries were paid at the end of the month, many of the workers quit the company in search of other employment.\n\nEager to stem the high attrition rate among the waste collection staff, the company switched from a monthly payment schedule to a flexible one, allowing the workers to be paid more frequently\u2014weekly or bi-weekly. The change increased their productivity and fewer workers jumped ship.\n\nIt was a light-bulb moment for Onwuzulike. He went on to survey 100 formal employees within his network to find out how often they ran out of cash before payday and what their employers did to alleviate their financial difficulties.\n\nOnwuzulike\u2019s original intention for Earnipay was to build a salary advance solution\u2014in keeping with similar solutions already in existence in Nigeria, some of them powered by traditional banks. But plans changed when the results of the 100-person survey showed that 90% of salaried employees would rather have flexible access to their accrued salaries.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t need payday loans or salary advances to fund their lives; they just wish to be paid more frequently,\u201d Onwuzulike said on a call with TechCabal.\n\nEarnipay is currently in beta, with Onwuzulike serving as CEO, Busayo Oyetunji COO, and Joshua Ajayi CTO. As Onwuzulike tells TechCabal, all three of them consider themselves co-builders of the product.\n\n\u201cWorks like an ATM\u201d\n\nEarnipay is unavailable to individual employees, so employers need to sign up and onboard their staff. The Earnipay app allows employees to withdraw up to 50% of their daily accrued salary as earned at the time of access, at any time of the month. Earnipay funds the withdrawal.\n\nFor example, if one dips into their salary on the ninth day of the month, it means they\u2019re entitled to half the amount they\u2019ve earned for working nine days. At the end of the month, their employer deducts from their salary the amount withdrawn, uses it to refund Earnipay for initially funding that withdrawal, then pays the employee the balance as their salary for the month.\n\nTransaction-fee tiers are attached to withdrawals. Withdrawing \u20a65,000-\u20a610,000 attracts a fee of \u20a6500, and withdrawing \u20a610,001-\u20a650,000 attracts a \u20a61,000 fee.\n\n\u201cIt works just like an ATM,\u201d Oyetunji said.\n\nIntersecting the formal and informal workforce\n\nThe informal sector makes up about 80.8% of the workforce in urban Africa. In Nigeria where Earnipay operates out of, the sector makes up over 70% of the workforce.\n\nWhen Earnipay piloted three months ago, Onwuzulike envisaged that the solution would be useful only for low-income staff and informal employees, but the income profile of the app\u2019s users vary, Onwuzulike claims. \u201cOne of our customers earns a million naira a month,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, 17 companies have signed onto the app as active users and their employees have used Earnipay over 400 times.\n\nNo doubt, there are upsides to shorter payment cycles. For example, an employee can see their salary breakdown from day to day on the app, and unlike a loan or salary advance, which are borrowed funds, an Earnipay withdrawal is earned wages.\n\nStill, some of the threats inherent in loan-taking and salary advances may come up here as well. For instance, an earner who is unable to manage their personal finances may end up dipping into their salary before payday for the most frivolous reasons, and even after receiving their salary balance at month end, may still struggle to control their spending.\n\nResponding to these concerns, Oyetunji said, \u201cThe main issue here is, we\u2019re not financially educated. Whether you get your money at the end of the month or access it [daily] as you work, if you\u2019re not financially disciplined, Earnipay may not make a difference to your spending habits.\u201d\n\nScaling up\n\nAt the height of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, Africa\u2019s formal and informal economies took hits. Six percent of formal workers were out of work in Malawi, and in Nigeria, that figure climbed to as high as 45%. Now, as Africa adjusts to the reset forced on the entire world by the pandemic, financial well-being across all employment sectors has become more important than ever. \u201cWe\u2019re in a financial health pandemic,\u201d Oyetunji said. \u201cQuality of life is reduced because people can\u2019t fund their everyday needs. How can our expenses be on-demand yet access to salaries earned isn\u2019t?\u201d\n\nThe Earnipay team began building the product in July, received pre-seed funding of an undisclosed amount in August, and took their Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to market in September.\n\nCommenting on Earnipay\u2019s plans for 2022, Onwuzulike said, \u201cOur goal is to partner with employers to improve employee financial well-being. We provide tools for income earners to make better financial decisions and improve their quality of life. In addition to flexible salary access, we provide financial education to advise employees on best practices to manage their finances, and other products to assist them daily.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Herconomy raised $600,000 in a day. Here's how they did it",
          "text": "Herconomy, a startup empowering women through financial services, capacity building, jobs, and networking, has announced the close of a $600,000 pre-seed round to expand the product offerings on their platform.\n\nThe pre-seed round was led by members of the Herconomy\u2019s community, venture capitalist firm Oui Capital and a host of angel investors including Zephans & Co CEO Nkiru Ayemere; Ehi Onwudiwe, Director of Business Transformation at Ernst & Young; Head of Reserve at Diageo, Ope Makinwa; Ama Akpata, co-founder of Jand2Gidi and a host of others. According to the founder and CEO, Ife Durosinmi-Etti, when the round started, the startup got commitments worth $5.7 million from 509 community members within 24 hours but decided to only accept what it needed to scale\u2014$600,000.\n\nBuilding a tribe\n\nIn June 2018, Ife Durosinmi-Etti published Accessing Grants for Startups, a book that showcases local and international opportunities like grants, fellowships and other opportunities available to entrepreneurs in Africa. The book was a culmination of all the opportunities Durosinmi-Etti had been sharing on her personal Instagram profile for months.\n\nFounder, Ife Durosinmi-Etti\n\nMonths after publication, in December, Durosinmi-Etti decided to create an instagram page for the troves of people who had begun following her to get access to the opportunities on her page. She named the page, AGS Tribe, building a community where women get access to several opportunities globally. In Nigeria, women dominate the unpaid job sector, twice the figure of men. There are also more male wage earners\u2014 about 65.67%\u2014than female wage earners\u201434.33%.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to create a place where women could get access to opportunities, grants and fellowships,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cWhen people saw how much value we had to offer, they started following us and discussions around these opportunities grew. It was at that point we knew that it was more than just an opportunity board, it was a community.\u201d\n\nBy 2019, the AGS Tribe had grown to amass thousands in following. Handling the page and community became a full-time job for Durosinmi-Etti, and she decided to launch a paid community platform where people could access these opportunities seamlessly. The initial plan was to create a web platform to this effect, but that proved impossible when the platform crashed on the launch date on the 6th December 2019. That same evening, the Tribe moved to Telegram group offering people access at \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($120) a year.\n\nA year after launch, AGS Tribe had grown to a community of over 1,500 paying members who could access the community\u2019s opportunities as well as weekly capacity building workshops focusing on a variety of subjects from investments and finance, to SGBV and health issues.\n\nScaling, however, became a barrier as the team behind AGS began to find it difficult to coordinate the number of conversations the Telegram community had. \u201cIt was a bit hectic,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti admitted. \u201cWe had such a large number of people in one group. Logging off for hours could mean you\u2019d return to see thousands of messages in the community. And because opportunities are shared between conversations, people would sometimes have to read through every single message to find what they want. It was imperative to find a solution.\u201d\n\nHerconomy\n\nOne of the global issues exacerbated by COVID was the wage gap. Millions of people lost their jobs due to the lockdown, but women were hit harder with 5.5 million of them affected, almost 1 million more than men. In addition, many more women faced increased responsibilities at home as the lockdown mandated work/school-from-home situations everywhere.\n\nRealising this, AGS Tribe expanded their outlook to other opportunities by launching an app.\n\nHerconomy\u2019s product offerings\n\nThe launch of the app also came with the realisation that not all women would be able to afford the membership fees and they wanted to reach even more women. \u201cThe mobile app also included a free membership option,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti added. The app has a three-tier membership structure: a freemium subscription which gives members access to their community and opportunity board for free; Silver membership which gives you access to their weekly capacity building workshops called the Lightbox; and a Gold subscription which offers access to the community\u2019s affinity network where members can get discounts from over 60 brands including Raddison Blu Lagos, Qatar Airways and Adidas. The mobile app came with additional benefits for their Gold members (people who pay $120 yearly). They also introduced a job board and eventually became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nMoving forward\n\nPresently, Herconomy has a community base of over 15,000 people with 20% of them as paying members. The startup plans to introduce financial services to its community members which it believes will be of great benefit to them. Over the years, it has run several saving challenges overseeing at least 500 women who have saved over $100,000 in total. With its new funding, Herconomy plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interests.\n\nWhile most of Herconomy\u2019s funding has come from bootstrapping, the startup has gotten funding from various individuals and corporates who contributed grants and gifts in kind for its community members. Till date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630,000,000 ($71,600) in grants to forty-two women and men as part of its annual grants programme.\n\n\u201cI pitched the idea of Herconomy to several investors but we didn\u2019t get any yeses at first,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. The game-changer for them was getting selected for the Startup Bootcamp Accelerator program. During the program, they fine-tuned their business model, got advisors on the program. \u201cI quickly figured that many female-led startups do not get funding easily, so I decided to create a table for herself,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti commented. In August, she made a post via Instagram stories, asking if anyone was interested in investing in Herconomy. Within a day, as Durosinmi-Etti explains, she got \u201chundreds of responses\u201d from community members who were interested in investing.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we had 509 people who pledged $5.7 million, but we only needed $600,000. We also noticed not everyone could afford our $20,000 minimums, so we decided to create a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for the people who couldn\u2019t. They did this because it was extremely important for their community members to be part of this raise. So we went on GetEquity, created a private deal room and invited specific people that had indicated to invest,\u201d the founder shared. While the round did include investments from venture capital firms like Oui Capital, most of it came from Herconomy\u2019s own community of users who were interested in building the brand, 70% of whom were women.\n\n\u201cIt all worked out for the best,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. \u201cWe were able to ensure that women could easily invest. I\u2019m excited about creating the mindset of investing in women which is what we preach at Herconomy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on their investment, Olu Oyinsan, Managing Partner of Oui Capital said, \u201cOur thesis is that community is very key to the future of consumer fintech in Africa.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bulk of the funding that goes to African startups comes from outside the continent. In 2020, 71% of the money invested in Nigerian startups came from outside the country. It is a similar story in other countries.\n\nIn recent years, however, the number of investors on the continent has increased, and this could be attributed to early startup founders\u2019 successes. Consequently, seeing African investors either lead or make up the majority of investors on a startup\u2019s cap table is fast becoming the norm.\n\nOne of these investors is HAVA\u00cdC, a South Africa-based investment firm. Techpoint Africa had a chat with Ian Lessem, where he explained the firm\u2019s origins and how they make investment decisions. The interview has been reproduced below.\n\nHow did HAVA\u00cdC get started?\n\nSo we started the business about seven or eight years ago, recognising that there was a lot of tech talent coming out of South Africa and places like Kenya and Nigeria, but very little smart capital supporting these businesses. My partners and I, along with the rest of the team, come from what you would call a very traditional investment background, so we\u2019ve worked in investment banks, M&A\u2019s, etc. We know what it takes to scale businesses. We recognised a gap in the market to number one, find these businesses, and help them grow locally and internationally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is your investment thesis?\n\nWe invest in early-stage technology companies that solve real-world challenges. So early-stage for us is post-revenue seed up to Series A. Revenue could be pretty small, maybe just one customer. Importantly, we only invest in businesses where we feel we can add value, so typically, we take a strategic role on the board, helping the businesses scale.\n\nNumber two, the businesses need to be tech-enabled and use their platforms to scale locally and internationally. Thirdly, we focus on businesses that solve actual challenges, so we don\u2019t invest in what we call \u2018nice to haves\u2019. An example would be Twitter. Those who invested in the early stages have done very well, but it\u2019s not solving any problems. If you look at our portfolio, we have startups providing financial inclusion. We have many fintech, healthtech, and business productivity companies.\n\nWhat\u2019s your average ticket size in these companies?\n\nWe take minority stakes, so we invest from $100,000 to $1,500,000, and we don\u2019t go above 24.9% in the companies. Importantly, we like to invest in businesses where the founders are in control.\n\nBy your standards, what should a startup not be doing?\n\nAt the moment, I\u2019ll say the topical one is a lot of hot money coming in. Some investors don\u2019t have any experience working in Africa and often push the founders to adopt strategies that work elsewhere but not necessarily in Africa.\n\nObviously, different parts of Africa have different nuances so the biggest mistake we\u2019ve seen is founders being caught up in this hot money and taking money from people who don\u2019t have the expertise to give them the help that young businesses need.\n\nAlso, agreeing to chase metrics that may be suitable in other markets but are not ideal in their domestic markets. So you\u2019re doing things because that\u2019s how they are done elsewhere, but it\u2019s not necessarily a smart way to do things locally.\n\nAnother thing is that some entrepreneurs start businesses to solve problems that they or someone they know faced. While that is an excellent place to start because they\u2019re often quite passionate about it, what may be a problem to me may only be my problem; it may not be a problem for other people.\n\nSo what that means is that sometimes entrepreneurs who have not done their research assume that the problems they are solving must be relevant to lots of other people. We often come across businesses that are solving just a small problem, and that\u2019s not a bad thing. But when an entrepreneur says they want to scale into other markets, we may say that problem is not a real problem in those other markets, and doing so would be unrealistic. So I guess it\u2019s essential to understand your market opportunity, and from there, you work out who the right investment partners are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre there investment opportunities that you regret passing on?\n\nTo be honest, we do not regret any. I sometimes think when we\u2019re on the fence, it\u2019s probably at that point where a business is servicing a large customer market in its local base, and they are doing quite well from a revenue point of view. Then, the question is can they replicate this in other markets? If we pass on it, it\u2019s because we feel that they can\u2019t or there isn\u2019t a market opportunity in those markets. This is why I wouldn\u2019t say we regret passing over an opportunity.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nThere are many, but in South Africa, it would be hearX, which provides audiology solutions to the mass market using technology. The product is a smartphone-powered hearing aid. It\u2019s called hearScreen, and they\u2019ve successfully expanded into the US, so they\u2019ve got partnerships with Amazon and many other businesses and are selling thousands of these hearing aids across the US. They\u2019re now entering the UK, so that\u2019s a great example of a local company that has expanded into the US and now Europe.\n\nIn West Africa, we invested in Kuda Bank, which has been quite a success story. When we invested in the company, the revenue was quite low; I think they had about 200,000 active users. It\u2019s only been a year and a bit, but those 200,000 customers have grown to over 2 million customers, and they\u2019ve received support from top global investors, including Valar and Tiger Global.\n\nIn East Africa, we have another fintech called Tanda. They provide basic digital financial services to dukas. In South Africa, we call them spaza shops, but they\u2019re just local shops. They have more than 20,000 shops. Through their services, Tanda provides cash in cashouts and has probably become the most prominent provider in East Africa. They\u2019re expanding into other parts of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, etc., so that\u2019s a great success story as well.\n\nHow do you deal with failed investments?\n\nWe probably have scenarios where things have not gone according to plan. One scenario has to do with my point about things working in one market but not in another. So we invested in a business that was one of our earliest investments in South Africa, where it did very well, but when it looked to expand to other markets, it didn\u2019t do as well.\n\nIn that case, we responded by changing the offering to what the US customers wanted, and we split the company. So we started the US business using some of the technology from the business, but in a very different way, so you\u2019d probably call that a pivot. Fortunately for us, we managed to sell that business to Mailchimp in the US, so I guess what could have been a bad story turned out to be a decent story in the end. I guess that would be a product-market fit problem.\n\nAnother one that is a bit more sensitive and difficult would be when founders have quarrelled, and you as an investor have to try and sort this out. The actual product is still very good, but when two people are not getting along very well, that sets a bad tone for everyone else.\n\nWhat trends would you like to see in the startups coming from Africa?\n\nSo we see a lot of technology coming out of South Africa that could be used in the international markets, so we have 15 companies and three international exits in our portfolio. Those 15 companies are not all South African, but they service over 4 million customers in 180 companies worldwide. So while their main operations are in South Africa, Kenya, or Nigeria, they are very much international businesses. So we want to see African businesses succeed internationally.\n\nThe other one is using technology to service a large part of Africa. I guess that\u2019s why fintech seems to get a lot of airtime because you don\u2019t need a physical bank as long as you have a mobile phone and a decent Internet connection. It\u2019s one example, but there are many others \u2013 eCommerce, education, logistics, etc. You don\u2019t need a classroom to teach people. So we hope that more entrepreneurs start taking up the challenge of serving other sectors with a similar impact as fintech.\n\nIf you\u2019re an early-stage entrepreneur with some revenue, HAVA\u00cdC may be willing to invest in you. Simply send an email to info@havaic.com, and someone will be in touch with you.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "South Africa-based proptech, Flow, is helping real estate agents and developers automate their social media advertising",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a cloudy day a few months ago, I sat down to chat with Gil Sperling and Daniel Levy, Co-founders of Flow.\n\nAt first, I couldn\u2019t quite grasp what they were talking about \u2014 automating advertising for property developers and agents on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. I wondered why that was so important or if there\u2019s a market here?\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick poll.\n\nHow many times have you picked up your phone today either to look through social media or just because? You couldn\u2019t count, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, according to DataReportal, as of 2020, Kenyans spent 3 hours 42 minutes per day on social media; Nigerians, 3 hours 41 minutes; and South Africans, 3 hours 32 minutes.\n\nInterestingly, the average human spent almost 7 hours per day on the Internet, but we could rationalise that based on the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns across the world. However, going by last year\u2019s report, nothing changed much.\n\nThe average user spends about 30 minutes daily on Instagram.\n\nBut what does this have to do with Flow?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlow\u2019s website\n\nSouth Africa-based Flow uses an API that enables estate agencies and property developers to automate their advertising on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.\n\nFlow\u2019s API plugs into an estate agency or property developer\u2019s listing management system. They currently have a commercial partnership with PropData, one of the largest software providers in that space in South Africa.\n\nExplaining how this works to me, Levy said, \u201cSo, we pull in a feed of their listings and agents\u2019 profiles. An agent logs in to Flow on the web and selects the properties they want to promote with their profile. They click a button, and their ad is automatically created.\u201d\n\nWith roughly 2.89 billion monthly active users, Facebook is the biggest social network globally. As of December 2020, that number stood at 255 million in Africa. As of May 2021, there were 25.4 million Facebook users in South Africa \u2014 42.5% of the population.\n\nAccording to Statista, as of July 2021, South Africa had 6.03 million Instagram users and 9.15 million LinkedIn users, respectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe team said that 1.5 million people in South Africa had explored property listings through Flow in the last six months, and nine million buyers and tenants have been reached about agency brands and property listings in the past year via Flow.\n\nThe ad also leads to a customised landing page which could redirect the prospective buyer or tenant to either the agent\u2019s WhatsApp number or SMS.\n\nEssentially, there are four layers to this. Say you are an estate agent who has integrated Flow\u2019s API into your website, to start an ad campaign, you will log in to Flow, select the listing you want to advertise, and voila! several million people can see your property.\n\nOnce a prospect clicks the link, they are redirected to a customised landing page or your proprietary CRM, which has been integrated.\n\nUsing an analogy, Sperling said, \u201cSo, a small business may use Mailchimp to automate their email. They are not gonna pull up Gmail or Outlook and cc 10,000 people. They are gonna just pop up Mailchimp, which allows them to scale their email efforts.\n\n\u201cFlow is a platform that allows property businesses to scale their Facebook and Instagram marketing. Without it, it\u2019s very basic and rudimentary and not tapping into the potential.\u201d\n\nA little background before we continue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R: Flow Co-founders, Gil Sperling and Daniel Levy. Source: Supplied\n\nIn 2015, Sperling and Levy\u2019s adtech startup, Popimedia, had just been acquired by French Communications group, Publicis.\n\nPopimedia had grown to become the sole African official Facebook Marketing Partner after about three years of building a version of Facebook\u2019s current advertising platform.\n\nThe duo met just as Sperling was finishing his training as an engineer at the University of Witwatersrand, in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2006. A year later, Popimedia was founded.\n\nAlthough they stayed on for a while to steady the ship, in 2019, they officially left to found Flow as it is now.\n\nBut why proptech?\n\nCiting an archaic and antiquated property industry, Levy, a lawyer with some background in psychology, says,\n\n\u201cI come from a property family, and I\u2019ve always felt that running and managing property and tenants and things of that nature has always been very antiquated and hasn\u2019t changed over a significant period. And through my frustrations of doing that, I\u2019ve always kind of wanted to improve that in some way, shape, or form.\u201d\n\nWith their varied skill sets, they tried to find an industry where technology could be deployed and be a good fit.\n\n\u201cProperty is one of the largest industries on the planet yet the most leaguered. It\u2019s topsy-turvy, as I call it. You\u2019ve got guys who run and manage assets worth billions of dollars, and the management invariably has very few people doing the work.\n\n\u201cTechnology usually follows industries with significant manpower behind them and goes in there to create efficiencies. But, in property, they just kinda throw resources at the problem.\u201d\n\nWith their adtech background, this was definitely a good fit.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t this straightforward.\n\nPrevious iterations and current challenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGil Sperling. Source: Supplied\n\nIn 2017, Levy and Sperling launched a previous reincarnation of Flow, but as an app that rewards tenants for paying their rent on time.\n\n\u201cWe built an app in the early part of the business that rewarded tenants for paying rent on time and looking after the place, and that was always the path to open up search \u2014 an ability for people to find property \u2014 which is what the business is today.\n\n\u201cBut the big learning that we had at that time was that it\u2019s important to build a product to solve a massive problem. The problem that we were solving at that time was big, but it was not valuable enough for landlords.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Flow raised $1.47 million from Kalon Ventures and CRE Venture Capital in January 2019 while pushing this iteration.\n\n\u201cBacking the jockey is criteria number one for VCs because whether the idea would work or not, a very strong entrepreneur behind it would pivot and do whatever is required to succeed. So I think that our VCs initially primarily backed Daniel and my experience and reputation.\n\n\u201cThe business model behind it was not strong enough, and that created a big pivot for us. Really, what launched the successful part of our journey was setting that aside and focusing on the search part through the social integration,\u201d Sperling said.\n\nBut beyond a pivot, Sperling believes that a big problem is playing in a space that is \u201cthe most valuable industry in the world, yet the most archaic and most traditional. When we are working with estate agents, they are very good at their job \u2014 being the relationship between the buyer and the seller \u2014 but they are very traditional in their sense. We have to do a lot of handholding.\u201d\n\nAnother challenge that Levy sees as more of a blessing is the COVID-19 pandemic. With most of the team working from home, and Levy and Sperling themselves working out of a hotel, chuckling, he told me he would rather deal with hoteliers than commercial landlords.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk numbers; where\u2019s the money?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevy said that even though it is not their main focus currently, Flow is on the cusp of profitability.\n\n\u201cThere are many levers at this stage that could make you profitable; it\u2019s just that that\u2019s not the major metric. We are more inclined to make sure that we are getting the growth, and you will always sacrifice profit, if you will, by virtue of getting growth because you can plough profits back into growth, and then you can move to the top.\n\n\u201cWe understand the model. We understand what it would cost us to get new clients. And so, to that end, we are all about growth. The profitability is cream on the top.\u201d\n\nBut how does the money come in?\n\nFlow makes money from a percentage of what clients pay for their services, a model they employed at Popimedia.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always approached our business model on the basis that it\u2019s very simplistic for our clients to understand. They get A to Z of our offering, and there\u2019s a percentage of the marketing spin.\n\n\u201cWe are incentivised to ensure that they get their ROI, and when they get it, they will increase the amount of money that they\u2019ll spend within the platform because they are inextricably linked.\u201d\n\nAccording to Levy, they currently have about 100 clients with about 4,000 estate agents on the other side, a number he says is 10% of estate agents in the country.\n\n\u201cIn contextual terms, in South Africa, there are about 4,500, around 5,000 estate agency offices and 40,000 estate agents. So we are probably about 10% of the estate agents.\u201d\n\nAnd according to him, there are about 300 to 400,000 buyers and tenants driven to agents on the platform monthly.\n\nPresent and future conquests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Levy; Source: Supplied\n\nFlow is looking at expanding beyond South Africa.\n\n\u201cWe are actually on a few POCs (Proof of Concepts) and trials with some Australian businesses. We\u2019ve had some good movement there. We are in early talks with someone in Egypt as well. Some regions in Africa are definitely a market for us. So the intention is to be as global as possible, where it makes sense,\u201d quipped Sperling.\n\nYesterday, December 7, 2021, the company announced an expansion into Australia with integrations with real estate CRMs AgentBox and Box+Dice which Flow says gives it access to 6300 Australian estate agent offices It has also partenered with an Australian proptech, MRI Software\n\nCurrently, however, as Levy told me, they\u2019ve moved beyond South Africa\u2019s shores, serving clients who want to reach Nigerians and Zimbabweans, and, on the flip side, Mauritian clients looking to get South African clients.\n\n\u201cSo we are naturally piggybacking off the social platform to take the properties to the people.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the plan is to be \u201cthe platform that over time unlocks more and more value in the chain.\u201d\n\nOf course, several things under the hood would be revealed in due time, but the focus is currently on the marketing platform.\n\n\u201cUltimately, there\u2019s a bigger platform here where we hope to better connect buyers and agents and better enable them to make their buying journey way more efficient and valuable,\u201d Sperling concluded.\n\nFor now, they are focusing on growing their platform and navigating what they call a politically charged industry with a different perspective.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s The Experts series, a bi-weekly where tech career specialists take us on their journey from newbie to expert, and how they became successful in the industry. to get email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite Africa\u2019s tech-savvy population, financial exclusion is still a problem on the continent. But with the launch of fintech startups came the challenge of regulatory influence and industry acclimatisation.\n\nIn 2018, a financial expert and tech investor considered it stressful for fintech startups to integrate with banks \u2014 a necessary partnership for the former to enter the banking market successfully. On the other hand, banks need to collaborate with fintechs to increase their revenue and maintain market dominance.\n\nUndeterred by the hassles, Nigerian fintechs have multiplied, with the market growing exponentially, as seen in the increase in investments and frequency of new entrants into the space. Adedeji Olowe saw all this and decided to do something about the challenges in the industry.\n\n\u201cImagine if that pain is taken away entirely and you can easily integrate with any bank,\u201d Olowe said, snapping his fingers to indicate speed, \u201clike what takes years or months can be done in a day. When this happens, fintechs will spend more time delivering their services instead of trying to connect to a bank.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnable to resist bringing up open banking as we chatted in his Lekki Phase 1 home, he referred to it as his most daunting challenge in what can aptly be called a flourishing career.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChatting with Adedeji Olowe in his Lekki Phase 1 home\n\nThe father of three has helped many people build companies. He was an early advisor to Wallets Africa, was an early member of the TeamApt board and now an independent member of the Paystack board. He is also a board member of Nigerian digital bank, Sparkle. Olowe leads Trium, a venture capital firm, and is seen globally as the leader of open banking in Africa.\n\nDespite Africa being slow to enact open banking regulations like other developing regions, he believes now is the time to catch up with Europe and Asia.\n\nSpurred on by his belief, Olowe has taken it upon himself to seek structures that not only help banks and fintechs collaborate seamlessly but also make the process attractive for new entrants.\n\nDespite how much Adedeji has pushed for open banking regulations in the past four years, he maintains that he does not plan to profit from it. He chose not to patent it, preferring to be called a trustee.\n\nSatisfaction for Olowe would be found in the knowledge that his solution positively impacted people for years to come.\n\nPerhaps, the importance of this move isn\u2019t evident yet, but the height of its success would be every bank having the same application programming interface (API) such that it would be easy for any fintech company to integrate. Don\u2019t worry; we\u2019ll simplify everything later.\n\nAdedeji had achieved a lot before setting his sights on open banking and tech investment. Before we dive in, let\u2019s look at where he is coming from.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA background that paid off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdedeji Olowe\n\nRaised by an academic mom in Southwestern Nigeria, Adedeji bagged his first degree in electrical engineering in 2001. And in the middle of a thriving banking career ten years later, he got a Master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering from Kings College, London.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent all my life in financial services; I\u2019ve never worked as an engineer,\u201d he stated.\n\nStill, he didn\u2019t forget to add how he owes his current exploits to his academic and exemplary upbringing.\n\nAdedeji\u2019s career trajectory has been steady in its upward and forward climb. So far in his journey, he has taken somewhat uncalculated risks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a curious kid, and my curiosity has always gotten me into trouble. And I\u2019ve always loved to write,\u201d he confessed as he remembered simpler days when he considered his writing as \u201cletters to abuse people,\u201d for which he was spanked many times.\n\nAdedeji\u2019s blog has many articles explaining topical issues in banking and financial inclusion and tech adoption.\n\nSome of his write-ups contain fintech predictions for the year, which he began in 2017. He has an uncanny knack for accurate fintech predictions but is yet to record 100% accuracy. Olowe delivers his predictions matter-of-factly and calls them \u201ceducated guesses, at best.\u201d\n\nCareer track marked with passion and excellence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdedeji Olowe\n\nIn two decades, Adedeji has risen from an entry-level position in a commercial bank to executive roles in the sector and now heads a venture capitalist firm. After his first two moves, companies sought him for the value he could bring to the table.\n\nAdedeji regularly took the initiative. For instance, in his first stint at Standard Trust Bank as an entry-level member on the e-banking team, he built an intranet \u2014 an internal website \u2014 to fill a gap without being asked to.\n\nTwo years later, at Access Bank, his team built a data analytics system that guarantees easy information access within a bank.\n\nFor some reason, Adedeji often felt the need to prove his worth and take risks. He recalled his best career move yet while at United Bank of Africa (UBA), where he worked for over six years, the longest of all the seven financial institutions he worked with.\n\n\u201cI first worked in finance, and from there, I went back to digital banking. That was when I was in charge of all the card products in UBA across 19 countries. And at that time, I did not know anything about cards, but I always loved to challenge myself. And in about seven months, I became an expert, one of the best. That was a difficult period for me not only because of the demand, but it forced me to grow.\u201d\n\nHe attributes this success to his consistency and obsession with learning, which stood him in good stead for a stint outside Africa before finally focusing on fintech and tech investment.\n\nApart from admitting to a constant need to make an impact by seeking new challenges, Adedeji was deliberate about his career strategy, which was responsible for his steady climb.\n\n\u201cFirst, I was good,\u201d he said quite frankly, \u201cthen, secondly, I moved around.\u201d\n\nThis explains why he had an impact record in many Nigerian banks.\n\n\u201cWhen you move, you get the next thing. When you stay, you\u2019re waiting for the next promotion, which takes longer.\u201d\n\nPausing to add a disclaimer, he said, \u201cThere are risks to it as well. Because if you\u2019re in a good place and you\u2019re greedy and jump to a bad place, you might actually be screwed over.\u201d\n\nPutting it in perspective, like Adedeji\u2019s career shows, being exceptional ultimately does the trick because you would often be called upon for a higher challenge once you have outstanding potential.\n\n\u201cI was solving problems around me instead of joining people to complain about a problem. That\u2019s how I grew.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdedeji Olowe\n\nHe was emphatic in declaring that this strategy, coupled with work excellence, helped him rise to a senior managerial position in banking in under seven years, something that would ordinarily take twice as long if he remained at one bank.\n\nEmbodying open banking\n\nAdedeji\u2019s journey got even more interesting after 2017 when he decided he was done working in banks. Again, his curiosity and desire to apply himself led him to a more significant challenge with the potential to influence Africa\u2019s financial industry immensely for many years to come.\n\nHe realised, rather disturbingly, the need for all banks to speak the same language after working at SystemSpecs, one of Nigeria\u2019s earliest fintech companies, as an executive director.\n\n\u201cThe first problem I found out was most banks don\u2019t have APIs. The second problem, even when they have APIs doing the same thing, two banks don\u2019t solve a problem the same way. The third? There\u2019s no standardised way for everyone to have access to the APIs.\u201d\n\nOnce all banks can have the same APIs and easy guidelines to access them, a new fintech would only need to understand the API standard, and any code that it writes would work seamlessly with any bank.\n\nEnter open banking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new fintech looking to integrate with five different banks with entirely different standards would have to go through a highly time-consuming and intensive process. This is where open banking comes in to take the stress away and save the day.\n\nAdedeji clarifies that open banking is not a technology but a standard.\n\nSimplifying it, he compares open banking to a standard where every bank is required to have an electrical socket type of a particular shape, say, circular holes, and every fintech has plugs with circular points that fit perfectly.\n\nThis means any fintech coming into the market can connect easily without getting a multipurpose adapter or connecting wires directly to outlets.\n\nBut this is easier said than done.\n\n\u201cOne, all the banks have to like the idea. And CBN has to create a rule,\u201d Olowe explained why he almost grew cold feet at the beginning.\n\nHe decided to take the first step on June 1, 2017, just before midnight. He sent an email with a call to action, \u201cLet there be open banking!\u201d to all his friends.\n\nAlthough he received acceptance from friends and other persons of interest, including the CBN, in the following months, there have been many rejections.\n\nAdedeji is pleased that the biggest hurdle is out of the way already \u2014 getting CBN on board \u2014 which means the work is 80% completed. Fortunately, a CBN directive to that effect was released in February, called the \u201cRegulatory Framework on Open Banking in Nigeria.\u201d What is ongoing is creating a standard.\n\nBut he still refers to championing open banking as his highest achievement, \u201cbecause that is me driving something that I\u2019m not going to benefit from, but it will benefit a lot of people.\u201d\n\nAlthough he\u2019s not expecting any monetary gains from this, it would positively impact the investment sector where he now plays. So, win-win.\n\nNot stopping here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdedeji Olowe\n\nAdedeji has grand plans to solve more than one problem for Nigerians. He dreams of building a school for intensive training in vocational studies and creative and tech skills in rural areas in Nigerian cities where indigents can study on a scholarship. This is on the premise that not everyone is fit for the walls of a tertiary institution, and everyone deserves a better life.\n\nIf he isn\u2019t thinking of tinkering and building stuff, he is curious about human genetic make-up (DNA), metacognition, and the sense of being aware. Adedeji\u2019s hobby is travelling, and having visited thirty countries, he\u2019s thinking of getting a helicopter to fly around Lagos State.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Rising import worsens Nigeria\u2019s trade deficit",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s trade balance worsened in the third quarter of 2021 as imports surged and the trade deficit hit N3.02 trillion, according to the latest foreign trade report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nThe country exported goods worth N5.13 trillion in the period under review, 58.87 percent less than its total import value of N8.15 trillion, the highest third-quarter trade deficit in 11 years \u2013 2010 to 2021.\n\nThe weaker trade balance came as the value of import earnings swelled by 17.3 percent quarter-on-quarter (q/q), while exports grew only 1.0 percent. The trade deficit in the reviewed period deteriorated 61.6 percent compared to the second quarter 2021 goods trade deficit of N1.9 trillion.\n\n\u201cThe increase in import bills can be partly attributed to pressure on the naira, weaker by 3.4 percent q/q and 10.7 percent y/y to average N410.29/$1.00 in Q3:2021, compared to N396.25/$1.00 and N366.52/$1.00 in Q2:2021 and Q3:2020 respectively,\u201d research analysts at Afrinvest said.\n\nThe trade deficit reported by Africa\u2019s most populous nation within the period was despite the higher crude price recorded in 2021. Unlike 2019, a higher crude oil price this year may have failed to lift Nigeria\u2019s almost two years trade deficit out of the negative due to stagnating oil production and the country\u2019s increasing dependence on imported goods.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria\u2019s trade sector turns positive after 8 quarters of negative growth\n\n\u201cDespite these relatively high crude oil prices, the reason why trade will remain negative is that import continues to outpace our export,\u201d Laolu Boboye, an economist at Cardinal Stones said.\n\nFor exports, lower earnings from crude oil sales (down 1.3 percent q/q to N4.0 trillion) muted a 10.3 percent increase in non-crude exports of 1.1trillion.\n\n\u201cThe drag in crude oil exports can be linked to depressed output as total domestic crude oil and condensates production fell 5.7 percent q/q and 7.3 percent y/y to 1.6mbpd daily average in Q3:2021, amid ongoing repairs and maintenance at key oil facilities,\u201d Afrinvest Research said.\n\nA breakdown of the NBS report showed that crude oil share of exports earnings rose to 76.5 percent (N10.0 trillion) in 9 million:2021, from 74.2 percent (N6.9 trillion) in 9 million:2020, underpinned by stronger crude oil price (Brent) to $78.52/bbl as at end of Q3:2021, a year till date upswing of 18.5 percent.\n\nIn terms of region of trade direction, Asia was Nigeria\u2019s largest import source with 49.9 percent (N11.0 trillion) while Europe accounted for 38.5 percent (N5.1 trillion) share of exports. Of the five regions of trade, Nigeria booked a trade deficit with Asia (N6.5 trillion), Europe (N2.5 trillion), America (N869.5 billion), and Oceania (N33.9 billion). Only trade with Africa (N1.0trillion) was a surplus.\n\nAs long as Nigeria is not self-sufficient in some key imports, Boboye said Africa\u2019s largest economy will continue to \u201cimport more which would be outpacing exports.\u201d\n\nEfforts to diversify Nigeria\u2019s economy are yet to materialise and reflect substantially in the country\u2019s international trade numbers.\n\nA cursory look at the data showed that crude oil still accounted for over 78 percent of Nigeria\u2019s export value in the third quarter of 2021, after multiple investments in other sectors of the economy to ensure local production, especially in the agricultural sector.\n\nNigeria\u2019s top imports were food and beverage and premium motor spirit, otherwise known as petrol, used vehicles, antibiotics, gas oil and machines. Food and beverage gulped N1.26 trillion while petrol imports guzzled N1.05 trillion between July and September 2021.\n\nAnalysis of Nigeria\u2019s foreign trade in goods statistics report by NBS for Q3-2021 revealed that the value of imported agricultural goods was 21.01 percent higher than the value recorded in Q2, 2021 and 56.74 percent higher than Q3 2020. Export agricultural goods export value in Q3, 2021 was 5.9 percent lower than Q2 2021 but 31.0 percent higher than Q3 2020.\n\nThe value of raw material imports was 9.08 percent more than Q2, 2021, and 29.06 percent more than the value in Q3 2020. Raw material exports value on the other hand increased by 135.2 percent in the period reviewed against the level in Q2 2021 and 1,241.1 percent higher than Q3 2020.\n\nSolid minerals imports in Q3 2021 increased by 10.93 percent compared to Q2 2021 and 53.42 percent compared to Q3 2020. Solid minerals exports value in Q3 2021, increased by 22.7 percent compared to Q2 2021 and 222.8 percent compared to Q3 2020.\n\nManufactured goods import value was 13.98 percent higher in Q3 2021 than the level in Q2 2021 and 42.73 percent more than Q3 2020. Manufactured goods exports on the other hand were 39.4 percent more than the value in Q2 2021 and 121.6 percent higher than Q3 2020.",

          "text": "More than $4 billion of funding has been raised by start-ups in Africa through 754 deals and Nigeria ranks highest among the top four including South Africa, Egypt and Kenya, with $1.41 billion.\n\nDespite this feat, Nigeria has dropped from Africa\u2019s top 10 investment destinations to 14 as Egypt remains the number one nation.\n\nThis is according to a report by RMB, a division of FirstRand Bank Limited, titled \u2018Where to Invest in Africa 2021\u2019. The report positions Morocco as second and South Africa in third place, Rwanda and Botswana, now in fourth and fifth position respectively.\n\nBased on their operating environments, other countries have moved up the rankings as Rwanda and Botswana occupy the fourth and fifth position respectively, while Ghana, Mauritius, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya and Tanzania are the last five.\n\nFor Nigeria, RMB attributed its 14th position on the list to constraints on the nation\u2019s economy by a weak policy environment and sore infrastructure provision.\n\nHowever, the company said Nigeria\u2019s heavy reliance on oil is impacting its economy. \u201cNigeria\u2019s heavy reliance on oil means that the drop in oil prices and production generated by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019 agreement is strongly impacting the economy. COVID-19 came at a time when the economy was still rebalancing from the drop in oil prices during the 2014 to 2016 period.\u201d\n\nRead also: Again, Nigeria\u2019s effort at salvaging electoral process at risk\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, Nigeria was ranked in the top 10 \u2013 eighth in both years, 13 in 2017, and ranked number six in 2016. In 2014, Nigeria ranked as number two and dropped to number five in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe sheer size of Nigeria\u2019s economy and large population base has undoubtedly aided the country\u2019s economic environment and has led to an increase in investments in the economy over the past 10 years,\u201d the company said.\n\nAlso, the country\u2019s hydrocarbon resources as well as considerable agricultural and mining potential are something to boast about. With fiscal support expected to increase and continue over the next few years, given both the coronavirus shock and oil price collapse, the economy is expected to grow but at a slow and steady pace.\n\nThe company further stated that the Nigerian government, which has been criticised for its slow pace of reform, still faces security challenges that destabilise the country, such as the activity of the Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram in the northeast, forcing many people to flee.\n\nRMB Africa Economist, Daniel Kavishe, said the criteria used in measuring the performance of countries that made it to the list took a new approach which was a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe created a new set of rankings that incorporated some of the unavoidable COVID-19-induced challenges, of which the operating environment score was one., as well as fiscal scores which are important indicators of how governments respond to COVID-19. This inclusion aimed to score governments\u2019 fiscal positions and provided a basis from which investors can understand specific jurisdictions,\u201d Kavishe said.\n\nThe top five beneficiaries who make up the total funding raised include Opay which secured $400 million, Andela $200 million, Flutterwave $170 million, Kuda Bank $80 million (two tranches), and Decagon $26.5 million (two tranches).",

          "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic-related school closures have been estimated to cost this generation of students $17 trillion in lifetime earnings, or about 14 percent of today\u2019s global GDP, according to a new report by the World Bank, UNESCO, and UNICEF.\n\nThe new projection far exceeds the $10 trillion estimated in 2020, revealing that the impact of the closures is more severe than previously estimated.\n\nAccording to the report, this will likely increase learning poverty and have a devastating effect on their future productivity.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 crisis brought education systems across the world to a halt,\u201d said Jaime Saavedra, global director for education at the World Bank.\n\n\u201cNow, 21 months later, schools remain closed for millions of children, and others may never return to school. The loss of learning that many children are experiencing is morally unacceptable. And the potential increase of Learning Poverty might have a devastating impact on future productivity, earnings, and well-being for this generation of children and youth, their families, and the world\u2019s economies, \u201d Saavedra said.\n\nRead also: We returned 54,000 Out-of-School children to classrooms in 2yrs \u2013 Oyo Education Board\n\nAccording to the report, the share of children being unable to read and understand a simple text by age 10 which was 53 percent before the pandemic could potentially reach 70 percent given the long school closures and the ineffectiveness of remote learning to ensure full learning continuity during school closures.\n\nThe report also shows that many school children may never return to school post-crisis.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, the effects of COVID-19 lockdown measures reduced children\u2019s school attendance probabilities by nearly 7 percentage points. Students aged 15-18, for whom education is no longer compulsory, were 11 percentage points less likely to go back to school,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThere are about 14 million out-of-school children and Nigeria\u2019s abduction epidemic only exacerbates the situation.\n\nIn the past year in Nigeria, more than 600 schools have been closed and 1,000 children kidnapped, according to UNICEF\n\nThe report shows a similar trend in other emerging countries with girls at heightened risk.\n\nFor example, fathers in Nigeria reported actively discouraging their daughters but not their sons from using the internet and were less likely to assist their daughters\u2019 learning through technology during COVID-19. Gendered demands on girls\u2019 time, including increased responsibilities at home, impede their ability to engage in remote learning and lead to less time for schoolwork\n\nData from Bangladesh show that one in ten girls aged 12-15 reported not going back to school once systems reopened after COVID-19 induced school closures.\n\nIn Brazil, one in ten students aged 10-15 is also not planning to return to school while in Ghana, where national re-enrollment was high at 97 percent, 60 percent of the dropouts were girls.\n\nIn Chile, early simulations from the Ministry of Education indicated that dropout rates might double, increasing from 2.6 percent to 5 percent.\n\nThe drop-out cases countries are experiencing were similar to when the Ebola crisis struck in 2013.\n\nAfter the crisis, 27 percent of Liberian secondary school students did not return to formal education while in Sierra Leone, when schools reopened after Ebola, girls ages 12\u201317 were 16 percentage points less likely to be in school.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic shut down schools across the world, disrupting education for 1.6 billion students at its peak, and exacerbated the gender divide,\u201d said UNICEF Director of Education Robert Jenkins.\n\nIn some countries, we\u2019re seeing greater learning losses among girls and an increase in their risk of facing child labor, gender-based violence, early marriage, and pregnancy. To stem the scars on this generation, we must reopen schools and keep them open, target outreach to return learners to school, and accelerate learning recovery,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nThe report also highlights that, to date, less than 3 percent of governments\u2019 stimulus packages have been allocated to education. Much more funding will be needed for immediate learning recovery.\n\nMore than 200 million learners live in low- and lower-middle-income countries that are unprepared to deploy remote learning during emergency school closures, the report stated.\n\nThe institutions have stated that reopening schools must remain a top and urgent priority globally to stem and reverse learning losses.\n\n\u201cCountries should put in place Learning Recovery Programs with the objective of assuring that students of this generation attain at least the same competencies of the previous generation,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThey further recommend that programs cover three key lines of action to recover learning which are, consolidating the curriculum, extending instructional time, and improving the efficiency of learning.",

We have understood the problem better and we are working in collaboration with them to ensure that by the end of the first half of 2022 we will be able to report back to this committee some of the milestones achieved in solving some of these issues and we believe it will have a massive impact.\u201d\n\nThe SEC boss disclosed that the Commission is also working to combat challenges confronting the Commission on Information Technology.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe need to transform our IT infrastructure as we superintendent over a market that is vast and technology driven.

Statistics in Kenya show that it is less than seven percent the same with South Africa. Kenya is as rural as Nigeria so what have we done to learn from them.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows the story of M-pesa and we even have a companies such as eTranzact that is as powerful as Mpesa but how do we unlock it. So going forward, we need to develop platforms and products that talk to economic and social characteristics of unbanked or excluded population.\n\n\u201cWhere are they, who are they, how do they currently live their life and what do they like. Even for those of us in the investment world are we designing products to suit these people, are we reducing our products to the lowest denomination, the sachet sized model.\n\n\u201cNigeria is driven by the informal sector with 65 per cent of GDP is in the informal sector, for us to catch these people, we need to go lower.\n\nKenya through the M-pesa which is the non-bank mobile money framework, was able to bring financial services even in the hinterlands with market women in the farms having access to payment systems, savings and investments.\n\n\u201cHere we are talking about capital market, a small aspect of financial inclusion.\n\n\u201cInsurance, pension are also aspects of financial inclusion that we should be exploring, if we are going to grow this market and improve through technology, meet them where they are.\u201d\n\nHe further stressed the need to reach out to the financially excluded through technology saying \u201cthese are the people that need health, so we move into health tech, food tech or agric tech.\n\n\u201cWe have stockbroking firms with minimum account opening of N5 million but then we also have those with minimum of zero balance and that is the sachet size model I am talking about.\n\n\u201cEven big men in Nigeria want to buy things that are very small and we have to replicate the sachet size model in the capital market. It has worked in everything it is applied to in this country so why don\u2019t we in the capital market adopt it,\u201d Onadele said.\n\nHe said market stakeholders needed to design investment products to align with financial inclusion strategies to get to the hinter land.\n\nOnadele added that the exchange will in the first quarter of next year unveil new products tailored to meeting the investing needs of the masses.",

          "text": "Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, has said the incessant jailbreaks in the country were not good enough reasons for him to resign from his position.\n\nHe disclosed this to State House correspondents after the federal executive council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa on Wednesday.\n\nSenate Probes Incessant Jailbreaks\n\nAccording to him, the series of jailbreaks did not happen as a result of lack of preparedness, but situations that were occasioned by series of factors, adding that the federal government was doing all that is necessary to make the facilities impregnable.\n\nHe said, \u201cImo was in April this year. Kabba was in September. Abologo was in October and Jos was in November. Those captured the attacks. As painful as those attacks were, very painful, nobody will really want the end of justice to be so vulnerable.\n\n\u201cThe custodial facilities are the final end of criminal justice administration. So, morally, the state owes itself the responsibility of safe custody that must not be violated\n\n\u201cOn that account alone, we must appreciate the enormity of any successful attack on custodial facilities, and I so do, but I want us to put these things in the context of our security situation.\n\n\u201cWhen our best does not suffice, it\u2019s no longer a question of your inability to make preparation or failure for preparation or preparedness. It\u2019s just that at that instance, you just couldn\u2019t hold the defense and several factors are responsible.\n\n\u201cWhat I can assure Nigerians is this. Yes, as contextual as these attacks and the successes such criminals are having, we are upping our game and we will not allow, we will prevent any such opportunistic attack and even make it impossible. And that is what the state must do.\n\n\u201cWe are working with all arms of government, particularly the security, to make our custodial facilities impregnable. We will not rest until that is achieved. So, that\u2019s the assurance I\u2019ll give to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs to whether it calls for my resignation. I still don\u2019t see any need for that because it\u2019s not for lack of preparedness that the attacks were successful. No.\n\n\u201cEven the men in uniform, yes the hazards of their job could lead to their death, but none of them would prepare to die. These are human beings.

          "text": "The Bank of Industry (BoI) has provided over N100billion in funding for the development of the country\u2019s health sector in the last five years.\n\nManaging director of the bank, Mr Olukayode Pitan, disclosed this on Tuesday in Abuja at the ground-breaking event for the African Centre for Medical Excellence (AMCE).\n\nThe AMCE facility located along the Apo Mechanic-Kabusa road in Abuja is being developed by the African Export-Import Bank in partnership with Kings College Hospital, London; Bank of Industry; GE Health Care; Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd and the African Finance Corporation.\n\nIt will provide world-class care to both low and high-income patient groups across the continent.\n\nConstruction of the first phase of the Abuja AMCE is scheduled to be completed in 30 months.\n\nThe entire project will be implemented in four phases over a six-year period, starting off with a 170-bed specialist hospital before expanding to a 500-bed facility.\n\nThe AMCE plans to offer a full range of medical services, including diagnostics, treatment, nuclear medicine, surgery and post-surgical care, along with complementary specialist services covering oncology, haematological diseases (including sickle cell and blood cancers) and cardiovascular ailments.\n\nSpeaking on the project, Pitan said it was conceived as a result of the strategic alliance between African Export-Import Bank and Kings College Hospital London to develop medical centres of excellence across Africa.\n\nHe thanked President Muhammdu Buhari , for the support of his government in creating an enabling environment for the growth of the Bank of Industry and other similar institutions across Nigeria.\n\nThe president\u2019s support, according to the BoI MD, has given the bank the capacity to take part in a transformational project such as this which is aligned to the bank\u2019s mandate.\n\n\u201cWe at the Bank of Industry are very excited to be part of this project which would focus on cardio-vascular cases and oncology not only here in Nigeria but in the entire West African sub-region.\n\n\u201cThe coronavirus pandemic has taught us that we must build capacity to cover various aspects of healthcare within the country. This will save us at estimated $1bn annually on what we spent on medical tourism abroad. The health industry is one of the focus areas of the Bank of Industry because we believe that a healthy people will result in a healthy nation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cConsequently, we have supported the sector with over N100billion in the last five year. On behalf of the investors in this project, AfreximBank, BoI, GE Health Care, NNPC, African Finance Corporation, we are pleased to be part of this transformational project that will literarily transform the provision of health care services not only in Nigeria and in Africa.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope that the dividend that will come from this project will not only be in terms of a healthy nation but the financial success of this project to enable us support similar projects,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president of Afreximbank, Prof Benedict Oramah, said the facility will also offer education and clinical research services with a view to building leading talent and becoming a top tier-level medical facility.\n\nHe said the Abuja AMCE will not only enhance access to healthcare services for 50,000 people every year, but also provide 3,000 jobs during its construction and operational phases.\n\nIn setting up the AMCE, he said Afreximbank aims to assist in the provision of quality healthcare, enhanced service offerings, training, expanded employment, conservation of foreign exchange in Africa and promotion of intra-African medical tourism.\n\nOramah described the AMCE as a landmark project for Africa that is designed as an initiative under Afreximbank\u2019s 5th Strategic Plan.\n\nWith the successful delivery of the Abuja AMCE, he said the Bank will be well prepared to implement its continent-wide plan of developing a network of AMCEs across Africa and contribute its quota in improving the quality of lives of the African people.\n\nThe Afreximbank boss said the Abuja AMCE will also tackle the rising burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases, with general care capabilities that will serve the entire West Africa region and beyond.",

He has no baggage of any kind and he is well loved and respected across the country. He may not be a dealer. Yes he is not wealthy.

          "text": "The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has revealed reasons behind the sack of the management of the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) over the strike by the Nigerian Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE).\n\nA statement issued by the Chairman NERC, Sanusi Garba, and the Director General Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) Alex A. Okoh on Wednesday, debunked news leading to the change of management.\n\nNERC said AEDC management had failed to meet up their legal obligations which led electricity workers to protest, an action that disrupted power supply within Abuja and environ up to 14 hours.\n\nPart of the statement reads, \u201cThe attention of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) and Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) has been drawn to misrepresentations in the press on the facts/circumstances leading to the change in the composition of the board of Abuja Electricity Distribution PIc (AEDC or the DisCo), the licenced utility that serves end-use customers in Kogi, Nasarawa, Niger and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\n\u201cThe general public may wish to note that there has been an ongoing dispute amongst competing factions of AEDC\u2019s majority shareholder/core investor i.e KANN Utility Company Limited (\u201cKANN\u201d); and this dispute eventually spilled over to a dispute with the lender that provided the acquisition loan to KANN for the acquisition of majority shares during the privatisation exercise in 2013, over KANN\u2019s inability to service its debt to the bank.\n\n\u201cDuring the course of the intractable crisis, AEDC not only struggled to meet its obligations to the market under the terms and conditions of its licence but was also unable to meet its obligations to key stakeholders in the organisation including\n\nstaff culminating in the industrial action by members of the Nigerian Union of Electricity Employees (\u201cNUEE\u201d).\n\n\u201cEventually, this resulted in a total service disruption on 6th December 2021 for over 14 hours in EDC\u2019s network area. The\n\nprovision of electricity supply in AEDC\u2019s network area was only restored after the intervention of the Hon. Minister of Power, NERC and BE following an agreement with the union on the terms for the suspension of the industrial action on 6th December 2021.\n\n\u201cThe general public should note that arising from KANN\u2019s inability to service its acquisition loan and the ensuing dispute over the servicing of the loan from UBA PIc, the lender exercised its rights by appointing a Receiver/Manager over KANN.\n\n\u201cStakeholders including NERC, Central Bank of Nigeria (\u201cCBN\u201d) and BPE had on several times worked to broker an amicable resolution between the contending parties. The protracted resolution of the dispute exacerbated the state of affairs at AEDC resulting in an industrial action and a total blackout in the service area for over 14 hours.\n\n\u201cIt then became apparent that decisive steps were required to address the matter and BE agreed with the lender\u2019s request to exercise its powers as Receiver/Manager over KANN by exercising its powers over the 60% equity in AEDC as a means to recovering the acquisition loan granted by the Bank.\n\n\u201cThe action to appoint an interim team to manage AEDC was not done on the basis of a directive from the Federal Government as being falsely reported in the press but on the basis of legal processes arising from the failure of the core investor in AEDC to meet its obligations to a lender.\n\n\u201cThe Receiver/Manager has agreed to the appointment of an interim management team in conjunction with BE as part of measures designed to address business failure events and ensure continuity of service to end-use customers in the service area.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government remains committed to the ongoing initiatives on the recovery of the electricity sector but private investors should remain cognisant of their fiduciary responsibilities to their stakeholders especially in regulated utilities and should not act in a manner that jeopardizes public interest.\n\n\u201cNERC and BPE shall continue to work constructively with key stakeholders in the power sector to ensure continued growth and service improvement under the reforms being embarked upon by the Federal Government for the socioeconomic growth of our great nation.\u201d",

The bandits were saying since the cattle market was closed down, nobody will have access to other markets in Shinkafi.\u201d\n\nAttack On Farmers\n\nGuraguri lamented that the security situation in Shinkafi has worsened, blaming it on the suspension of telecommunications networks in the area.\n\nLocals said the bandits also attacked Birnin Yero community in Shinkafi on Tuesday afternoon when they shot at farmers who were at their farmlands to cultivate crops.\n\nElsewhere, a group of armed men invaded Shinkafi town on Wednesday morning and forcefully left with a nursing mother, Aisha Bature, and her one-year-old daughter. A local vigilante was shot dead by the bandits.\n\nThe victim\u2019s relative, Inno Bature, stated that the assailants have yet to contact the family to make any demand for ransom.\n\n\u201cIt was around 1am when they attacked her (Aisha) inside her house. They (the bandits) have yet to contact the family for ransom. She is an orphan and may Allah return her safely,\u201d said Inno.\n\n\u2018Not Under Siege\u2019\n\nConfirming the incidents, the Commissioner of Police in Zamfara, Ayuba Elkanah, explained that the command has deployed a tactical team to the troubled road.\n\n\u201cThe situation along Kaura-Namoda-Shinkafi road is under control because some few days ago, we had challenges where these bandits took advantage of some locations to attack commuters,\u201d he told Channels Television. \u201cNow, we have put our heads together with other security chiefs and deployed enough security operatives along the road.\n\n\u201cNow the road is free for movement. We have deployed about seven operational vehicles working there morning till evening. Commuters are now using the road. Shinkafi road is not under siege.\u201d\n\nElkanah also confirmed the attack on farmers in Birnin Yero, saying the bandits requested petrol from two farmers which they declined before they opened fire on them.\n\nHe added that the farmers were injured, but they were taken to the hospital by the security operatives deployed in the area.\n\nThe police commissioner urged the people of Zamfara to continue to support the police and the government, especially in view of the measures put in place to restore peace in all parts of the state.\n\nShinkafi, Zurmi, and Bukkuyum LGAs are the only areas where telecommunications services have yet to be restored.",

We continue to adhere to our rigorous standards,\u201d the ministry\u2019s communique explained.\n\nThe statement however emphasized that developing countries like Nigeria accept the vaccines because they close the critical vaccine supply gaps and, being free, save the nation from scarce foreign exchange procurement cost.\n\nWhile stressing that this dilemma is not typical to Nigeria, but a situation in which many Low- and medium-income countries find themselves, the ministry said \u201cdonors also recognize a need to give away unused vaccines, before they expire in their own stock, but they need to begin the process early enough and create a well-oiled pathway for prompt shipment and distribution through the COVAX and AVAT facilities, to reduce risk of expiration\u201d.\n\n\u201cWith better coordination, vaccines need not expire in the stock of Donors or Recipients,\u201d the communique added.\n\nAccording to the health ministry, Nigeria has utilized most of the over 10m short-shelf-life doses of Covid-19 vaccines so far supplied, in good time, and saved N16.4B or more than $40m in foreign exchange.\n\nThe Ministry of Health explained that it shares its experience with partners regularly and now politely declines all vaccine donations with short shelf life or those that cannot be delivered in time.\n\nIn the ministry\u2019s view, the long-term measure to prevent such incident is for Nigeria to produce its own vaccines, so that vaccines produced have at least 12 months to expiration.\n\nThis according to Dr Ehanire, is why the Federal Ministry of Health is collaborating with stakeholders to fast-track establishment of indigenous vaccine manufacturing capacity.\n\nAccording to the health minister, this is a goal the ministry is pursuing with dedication.",

They mandated the House Committees on Education, Youth Development, and Women Affairs and Social Development to follow up with the investigation.\n\nDeath Of A Teenage Schoolgirl\n\nMother of the late teenage girl Mrs Vivien Akpagher in an earlier interview with Channels Television said Keren was raped while she was still in the custody of her school, Premiere Academy, Lugbe, Abuja.\n\nShe said the 14-year old was not healthy when she picked her up two days earlier and when she was rushed to the hospital a day after she came home, a sperm-filled condom was found in Keren which led to an infection and eventually killed her.\n\n\u201cThree (3) days after I took away my daughter, she died in a hospital in Abuja on the 22nd day of June 2021.\n\n\u201cBut, before Keren-Happuch\u2019s death, the hospital discovered that she had been raped, condom left in her vagina, which had caused an infection that resulted to sepsis and trauma that led to her demise,\u201d she said.\n\nWatch an earlier report on the incident below\u2026\n\n\ufeff\n\nBelow are more photos from the protest \u2026",

          "text": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed tougher COVID-19 restrictions in England on Wednesday, ordering people to work from home, wear masks in public places and use vaccine passes to slow the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant.\n\nUndermined by accusations that his staff partied at Downing Street during a Christmas lockdown last year, Johnson said Omicron was spreading rapidly and he had no choice but to move to \u201cPlan B\u201d while a vaccine booster programme rolls out.\n\nWhile still a long way from the full lockdowns imposed earlier in the pandemic, the new measures were described as a \u201chammer blow\u201d for city centre restaurants, cafes and shops that are desperate for Christmas trade to rebuild their finances.\n\nMany lawmakers in Johnson\u2019s own party are also angry with the new restrictions, fearing the impact they will have after the economy shrank by a historic 10% last year.\n\n\u201cWhile the picture may get better, and I sincerely hope that it will, we know that the remorseless logic of exponential growth could lead to a big rise in hospitalisations and therefore, sadly, in deaths,\u201d Johnson told a news conference.\n\nSterling fell sharply when news first emerged on Wednesday that \u2018plan B\u2019 measures were imminent and investors pared back their bets on a Bank of England interest rate hike next week.\n\nJohnson, who lifted most COVID restrictions in England in July following a rapid vaccine rollout, had vowed to navigate the winter without resorting to a fourth COVID-19 lockdown, but had kept a so-called Plan B in reserve.\n\nPart of those measures, such as reintroducing masks on public transport and in shops, had already been brought in, but on Wednesday Johnson said people should also now work from home.\n\nFace masks will be required in public venues such as theatres and cinemas and a COVID pass will be mandatory for access to nightclubs and venues with large crowds.\n\nJohnson said the new measures were needed after 568 cases of Omicron were found in the country, with data suggesting its doubling time of infections could be between two and three days.\n\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said officials estimated that the number of Omicron infections was actually around 20 times higher than the number of confirmed cases, meaning they could be closer to 10,000.\n\nHAMMER BLOW\n\nBusinesses reacted with incredulity.\n\n\u201cThe renewed \u2018work from home\u2019 order during the most important trading period of the year is a hammer blow for our retail and leisure tenants,\u201d said Jace Tyrrell, CEO of New West End Company.\n\nWhile many businesses adapted well to working from home, sectors such as hospitality, entertainment and travel have been hit by huge losses. Unlike previous lockdowns, a furlough job support scheme is also no longer available.\n\nA poll from Savanta ComRes also suggested some people may be less willing to follow new restrictions following the revelations around the Downing Street party.\n\nA leaked video showed senior staff laughing and joking over how to explain a gathering in Downing Street during a Christmas COVID-19 lockdown last year. Johnson has apologised.\n\nThe prime minister also said COVID restrictions could not last forever and the country may need to have \u201ca conversation\u201d about what to do when a substantial proportion of the population refuses to get a vaccine.\n\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own COVID restrictions and had already set tougher rules.",

          "text": "Pfizer said Wednesday that a booster of its COVID-19 vaccine may offer important protection against the new omicron variant even though the initial two doses appear significantly less effective.\n\nPfizer and its partner BioNTech said that while two doses may not be strong enough to prevent infection, lab tests showed a booster increased by 25-fold people\u2019s levels of antibodies capable of fighting off omicron.\n\nFor people who haven\u2019t yet had a booster, the companies said two doses still should prevent severe disease or death.\n\nHealth authorities in the U.S. and other countries have urged eligible people to get a third dose even before these results.\n\n\u201cGo and get your third boost as soon as possible,\u201d Dr. Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer\u2019s chief scientific officer, told The Associated Press. \u201cThis is comforting and a very positive message that we now have a plan that will induce immunity that is likely to protect from infection, symptomatic illness and severe disease from now across the entire winter season.\u201d\n\nPresident Joe Biden said the Pfizer booster finding is \u201cvery encouraging\u201d although he cautioned, \u201cthat\u2019s the lab report. There\u2019s more studies going on.\u201d\n\nPfizer and BioNTech tested blood samples taken a month after a booster and found people harbored levels of omicron-neutralizing antibodies that were similar to amounts proven protective against earlier variants after two doses. For the lab tests, researchers grew samples of so-called \u201cpseudoviruses\u201d that hold the worrisome new mutations.\n\nScientists don\u2019t yet know how big a threat the omicron variant really is. Currently the extra-contagious delta variant is responsible for most of the COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and other countries.\n\nBut the omicron variant, discovered late last month, carries an unusually large number of mutations and scientists are racing to learn how easily it spreads, whether it causes illness that is more serious or milder than other coronavirus types \u2014 and how much it might evade the protection of prior vaccinations.\n\nPfizer\u2019s findings, announced in a press release, are preliminary and haven\u2019t yet undergone scientific review. But they\u2019re the first from a vaccine maker examining whether the booster doses that health authorities are urging people to get may indeed make a key difference.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal Ministry Of Health has clarified reports circulating about one million expired covid-19 vaccines in the country, stating that Nigeria does not dispense vaccines with validity extended beyond expiry date.\n\nThis follows a Reuters report stating that over one million Covid-19 vaccines expired in Nigeria last month without being used.\n\nThe ministry which released a press statement Wednesday, said Nigeria has recently benefited from the generosity of a number of countries, especially in Europe, who have contributed free doses of Covid-19 vaccine from their stockpiles through the COVAX or AVAT facilities.\n\n\u201cThese donations are usually much appreciated; however, some of them had just a few months\u2019 remaining shelf life, leaving us with only a few weeks to use them after deducting time for shipping, clearing, distribution, and delivery to consumers,\u201d the statement said.\n\nLogistic bottlenecks can develop when many vaccines arrive at the same time or in significant quantities.\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cWe appreciate the generous donations, but we also communicated the problem of short shelf lives, and some manufacturers offered to extend the vaccine shelf life by three months after the fact, a practice that, while accepted by experts, is rejected by the Federal Ministry of Health because it does not meet our standards.\n\n\u201cNigeria does not distribute vaccinations having a validity period that extends beyond the expiration date on the label. We will continue to uphold our high standards.\n\n\u201cDonation of surplus Covid-19 vaccines with expiring shelf lives to developing countries has been a matter of international discussion.\n\n\u201cDeveloping countries like Nigeria accept them because they close our critical vaccine supply gaps and, being free, save us scarce foreign exchange procurement cost. This dilemma is not typical to Nigeria, but a situation in which many low- and medium-income countries find themselves.\u201d\n\nThe statement added, \u201cDonors also recognize a need to give away unused vaccines, before they expire in their own stock, but they need to begin the process early enough and create a well-oiled pathway for prompt shipment and distribution through the COVAX and AVAT facilities, to reduce risk of expiration.\n\n\u201cWith better coordination, vaccines need not expire in the stock of donors or recipients.\u201d\n\nAccording to the ministry, Nigeria has utilized most of the over 10 million short-shelf-life doses of Covid-19 vaccines supplied to it so far, in good time, and saved N16.4B or more than $40m in foreign exchange.\n\nThe vaccines that expired had been withdrawn before then, and will be destroyed accordingly, the ministry said.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Health shares its experience with partners regularly and now politely declines all vaccine donations with short shelf life or those that cannot be delivered in time,\u201d it revealed.\n\nAccording to the ministry, the long term measure to prevent such incidents is for Nigeria to produce its own vaccines, so that vaccines produced have at least 12 months to expiration.\n\nThis it revealed, is why it is collaborating with stakeholders to fast-track establishment of indigenous vaccine manufacturing capacity.\n\n\u201cThis is a goal we are pursuing with dedication,\u201d It said.\n\nOmotayo Araoye",
