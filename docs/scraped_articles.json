          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nThe Nigerian Union of Allied Health Professionals has faulted the Medical and Dental Consultants\u2019 Association of Nigeria over its reaction to the bill seeking to redefine the qualifications of heads of university teaching hospitals in Nigeria.\n\nThe bill for an act to amend the University Teaching Hospitals (Reconstitution of Boards etc) Act Cap U15 LFN 2004 was sponsored by Honourable Bamidele Salami representing Ede North/Ede, South/Egbedore/Ejigbo Federal Constituency of Osun State.\n\nThe NUAHP said the doctors\u2019 reaction was a misrepresentation of fact to the general public.\n\nThe PUNCH reports that the MDCAN opposes the bill, saying that passing the bill would portend risks to the running of tertiary health institutions in the country.\n\nThe union in a press statement signed by its National President, Dr. Obinna Ogbonna, and Secretary-General, Martin Egbanubi and made available to The PUNCH on Friday said a body of such professional status should have researched its information and come up with verifiable and empirical evidence of their claims.\n\n\u201cIt is a known fact that international best practices in public health care management and administration is not restricted to a particular profession.\n\n\u201cThis was the case prior to the promulgation of Decree 10 of 1985 now University Teaching Hospitals (Reconstitution of Boards etc) Act Cap U15 LFN 2004.\n\n\u201cThe Decree provided for the appointment of Chief Medical Director (CMD) for Teaching Hospitals. Since 1985, only Medical and Dental Practitioners whom the Decree referred to as medically qualified have been on the exclusive list of appointments while other qualified health professionals have been shut out perpetually from the appointment contrary to international best practices.\n\n\u201cIn our country\u2019s healthcare sector today and in the quest to emasculate all other health workers and downplay competence and diligence, the entire public health system is manipulated to have only members of a favoured profession dominate all others on a permanent basis notwithstanding the multi-disciplinary nature of the health sector.\n\n\u201cFor instance, since Nigeria\u2019s independence, more than seventy-five per cent of Ministers of Health and Commissioners of Health have been medical practitioners while very few have been other professionals as if it is a law to do so.\n\n\u201cAs a result, medical practitioners have tended to believe that it is their sole right to be appointed in such offices.\n\n\u201cIt is on record and widely acknowledged that the tenure (July 2003 to May 2007) of the erstwhile Minister of Health, Professor Eyitayo Lambo; a health economist witnessed a harmonious working relationship amongst stakeholders in the health sector and between Federal Government and health workers unions.\n\n\u201cDuring his tenure as Minister of Health, the first Health Sector Reform Programme for Nigeria was developed and implemented; the National Health Insurance Scheme was launched after being on the drawing board for forty years.\n\n\u201cMany health policies and legislations were formulated during his tenure, including the hotly debated National Health Bill. He was one of the few politically neutral technocrats to serve under the administration. He had a strong focus on long-term health sector reform and good governance.\n\n\u201cHis predecessors and successors who were/are medical practitioners especially since 1985 exhibited and have continued to exhibit discriminatory practices that are responsible for most instability and trade disputes in the health sector till date.\n\n\u201cThis bill, when passed, will address all these discriminatory tendencies, help Nigeria\u2019s healthcare delivery thrive positively, benefit the average Nigerian patients, improve the poor infrastructure that currently defines our Tertiary Hospitals, improve skilled manpower shortage caused by brain drain, and will enhance more participation as more professionals will have the enabling environment to train and practice.\n\n\u201cSuffice to submit here that, the National Assembly should uphold this Bill and see to its successful passage to become the Act so that our health sector and healthcare delivery will become enviable, and be ranked higher by the World Health Organisation.\n\n\u201cResearch has shown that the success of hospitals does not depend on whether they are headed by medical doctors or not. Professional managers are just as good at running modern hospitals as any medical doctors or health professionals.\n\n\u201cIn the United States, the management of hospitals is usually undertaken by an administrative board drawn from the different departments of the hospital, with an equal chance for every director to end up as the Chief Executive,\u201d the NUAP statement read in part.\n\nThe union urged MDCAN and other similar interests in the health sector opposed to the bill to rise above sentiment and parochialism.\n\n\u201cThey should rather align with the legislative process geared towards redressing the unfairness in the sector in line with international best practices.

          "text": "The Police Command in Lagos State has sanctioned two Assistant Superintendents of Police (ASPs) and one Inspector for alleged unprofessional conduct.\n\nThe command\u2019s spokesperson, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, confirmed this on his verified Twitter handle on Friday, monitored by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).\n\nThe officers, according to Hundeyin, are ASP Adedeji Babatunde, ASP Ebiloma John and Insp. Obidah Daniel, attached to the Sagamu Road Police Division in Ikorodu area of Lagos State.\n\nNAN reports that the three officers were arrested after a video showing their unprofessional conduct against 24-year-old David Ogunnusi, a Youth Corps member serving in Lagos and his brother went viral.\n\nAccording to Hundeyin, Ogunnusi told the police that the incident happened at New Garage, Ikorodu at about 11.00 a.m. on Tuesday, while they were heading to Ojota.\n\nHe said that the policemen allegedly stopped them and started harassing them.\n\n\u201cThey asked for our ID cards, which we showed them as Corps members even in our uniforms, that was not enough proof for them.\n\n\u201cI asked them to check my bag if they would find any illicit substance or weapon in it but they chose not to, telling us to go inside their (patrol) bus, then I insisted; saying if they can\u2019t do it publicly we were not going in.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, a police man in mufti gave me a blow, then they removed my Youth Corps\u2019 face cap, while my brother was being carried like an animal.

It would have been a different case if a search at the same spot had yielded discovery of criminal items on them which would have warranted moving them to the station for further interrogation and statement taken.\n\n\u201d For this, CP Abiodun Alabi had ordered that the ASPs be queried and the Inspector defaulted in line with extant procedural rules of the Force.\n\n\u201cThe corps member, on his part, will be prosecuted for inciting the members of the public against the Police,\u201d he said.",

Osita Ngwu (RG), as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for Enugu West Senatorial District in the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe jubilant people of Udi LGA, who came with their clergy, traditional rulers, different masquerades and cultural dance troupes, said they are deeply grateful to Gov. Ugwuanyi for acceding to their yearning to occupy the senatorial seat of Enugu West Senatorial District for the first time in the history of the state.\n\nLed by the PDP senatorial candidate, Engr. Ngwu, the Chairman of Udi LGA, Hon. Philip Okoh, member representing Udi South Constituency in the State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Chuka Eneh, Commissioner for Chieftaincy Affairs, Dr. Charles Egumgbe, the General Manager of Enugu State Housing Development Corporation (ESHDC), Hon. Chukwuemelie Agu, among other stakeholders, the Udi people told Gov. Ugwuanyi that they will forever remain indebted to him for breaking the jinx and ensuring that they receive their fair share in the political positions in Enugu West Senatorial District and the state.\n\nThe people of Udi LGA reassured the governor of their maximum support and loyalty to his administration and the PDP, promising that they will deliver the PDP governorship candidate, Barr. Peter Mbah, and all other candidates of the party, in the forthcoming general elections.\n\nThey also expressed delight at the choice of Engr. Ngwu as the Enugu West Senatorial District candidate of the PDP, describing him as a young, intelligent, matured and unassuming personality, who will bring his wealth of experience in his private and public dealings to bear in providing quality representation to the people of the district, if elected.\n\nThey equally appreciated Gov. Ugwuanyi for the emergence of his former Chief of Staff, Rt. Hon. Dr. Festus Uzor as the PDP candidate for Udi/Ezeagu Federal Constituency.\n\nThe people of Udi LGA, therefore, beseeched God to continue to bless Gov. Ugwuanyi, who is the PDP candidate for Enugu North Senatorial District, and all his endeavours, stressing that the governor, based on his political sagacity and antecedents, will not represent only his district in the Senate, but also the entire state, if elected.\n\nSpeaking, the Rector, Enugu State Polytechnic, Iwollo, Ezeagu LGA, Rev. Fr. Dr. Nnamdi Nwankwo said that \u201cthe governor showed to us that he is a father, not just a father of the entire state but a father that has the pains and feelings of Udi people at heart\u201d.\n\nExpressing deep gratitude, Rev. Fr. Dr. Nwankwo added: \u201cToday, we are all smiling, rejoicing and saying thank you, Your Excellency.\n\n\u201cThe young man (Ngwu) looks so young but his ideas are old, old enough, and very matured. What he has done so far showed me that in Enugu West Senatorial District, the sun has risen.\n\n\u201cOur spirituality is such that it must be sacramentalized.

Ugwuanyi has remembered Udi LGA in so many ways and has always stood by them, disclosing: \u201cUdi LGA is one of the foremost LGAs in Enugu State. And you (Ugwuanyi) have stood by us in your government. Appointments that reached Udi LGA are more than other local governments.\n\n\u201cIn your administration, you have remembered us. I am from Ngwo, the Miliken Hill road you reconstructed and remodeled is a landmark project in which we are the major beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cWe are here today to say thank you.

          "text": "The Non-Academic Staff Union of Universities (NASU) and the Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities (SSANU) have insisted that they will reject any salary recommendation that would cause further disparity in the university system.\n\nThe two unions said there is an already existing disparity in the university system which they had always ignored, adding that to further expand that disparity would be an invitation to the greatest level of anarchy and industrial unrest ever witnessed in the University system.\n\nThe unions said it was yet to reach any agreement with the Nimi Briggs Committee renegotiating the 2009 agreement with all unions in the university system.\n\nWhile rejecting any attempt to cede a certain percentage of pay rise to the unions by the committee, SSANU and NASU noted that it had made its proposal to the committee and was waiting to negotiate the figures in the proposal.\n\nAddressing journalists on Friday in Abuja, General Secretary of NASU, Comrade Peter Adeyemi insisted that the two unions are determined to change the status quo, saying that they remained undaunted and undeterred in the face of their salaries that have been stopped and threats issued to the unions from various quarters\n\nComrade Adeyemi, who spoke on behalf of both unions, said the Prof Briggs Committee which was constituted in March 2022 to renegotiate the 2009 agreement with the four University-based Unions has been biased and has betrayed the terms for which it was set up.\n\nAdeyemi said NASU and SSANU held two meetings with the Briggs Committee and during both meetings, there were no deliberations on salary increment and allowances.\n\nHe said: \u201cFollowing the inauguration of the Committee, so far, the two Unions of NASU and SSANU had only two meetings with the Committee. After the first meeting, the two Unions of NASU and SSANU independently were compelled to create the impression that the Committee appeared not to have had its mandates clearly spelt out by the Government.\n\n\u201cWhile the NASU and SSANU teams had presented a Memorandum of Demands that included proposal for salary review along with appropriate salary tables, the Committee had pleaded that the two unions should take the issue of review of salaries and allowances last, because they were still interfacing with the relevant Government agencies to give them appropriate offers to counter our proposals on salary review.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore shocking, to say the least, that while we have not even commenced discussions on salary review and other allowances, we received reports that the Committee had gone ahead to submit a report to the Federal Government recommending a ten percent (10%) increase for Non-Teaching Unions. This we find to be very unfortunate and a betrayal of confidence by the Committee. While it may be easy to dismiss this information as a mere rumour, our belief is confirmed by the fact that a report was truly submitted to the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nHe said while it is not the desire of the Unions to prolong the strike action, they have, however, been compelled by the shabby treatment that they have received in the University system.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs of today, out of the eight issues that led to the strike, none of them have been conclusively addressed by the Government. Arrears of Consequential Adjustments on Minimum Wage have only been partially paid, as in many Universities, we still have many members who have not been paid, while the Federal Universities of Agriculture have been totally left out. No Arrears of Earned Allowances have been paid. White Papers on Visitation Panels have not been released. Staff School teachers continue to languish despite a Court judgment in their favour.\n\n\u201cOur jobs continue to be usurped by Vice-Chancellors as job for the boys and allocated to Academic Staff. State Universities have been badly hit by poor funding, poor governance and non-payment of salaries to workers spanning into months.\n\n\u201cAs JAC of NASU and SSANU, we are determined to change the status quo. We remain undaunted and undeterred in the face of our salaries that have been stopped and threats issued to the Unions from various quarters. We thank particularly, the Nigeria Labour Congress for its various interventions in ensuring resolution of the matter.\u201d\n\nThe Unions urged parents and other stakeholders to continue to appeal to the Federal Government to do the needful so that they can effectively return to their offices and jobs.",
          "summary": "The Non-Academic Staff Union of Universities (NASU) and the Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities (SSANU) have insisted that they will reject any salary recommendation that would cause further disparity in the university system.\nThe unions said it was yet to reach any agreement with the Nimi Briggs Committee renegotiating the 2009 agreement with all unions in the university system.\nAdeyemi said NASU and SSANU held two meetings with the Briggs Committee and during both meetings, there were no deliberations on salary increment and allowances.\nHe said: \u201cFollowing the inauguration of the Committee, so far, the two Unions of NASU and SSANU had only two meetings with the Committee.\n\u201cAs JAC of NASU and SSANU, we are determined to change the status quo.",

          "title": "Atiku opens up on Tinubu, Obi",
          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nPresidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 elections, Atiku Abubakar has spoken extensively on the presidential aspirations of the presidential candidate of the All progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu as well as that of the Labour Party\u2019s presidential flag-bearer, Peter Obi.\n\nHe also assured that the PDP National Chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu will step down if he (Atiku) wins the presidential election next year.\n\nIn an interview on Arise TV on Friday, the former Vice President said: \u201cIf the elected president is from the north and the party chairman happens to be from the north, automatically, the party chairmanship should revert to the south. If I am elected the president, automatically, Ayu will step down. There is also a general misunderstanding because PDP is different from APC. In the PDP administration, the south has had the highest number of years when the PDP was in office, so we need to separate these two so that we can be rational in our argument,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former VP said that during his campaign in 2007, his \u201cfundamental disagreement\u201d with the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, was because he (Tinubu) wanted to be his running mate and he refused because he didn\u2019t want a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket\n\n\u201cRemember, I opted out of PDP because of zoning, and together with Asiwaju we formed CAN. Tinubu wanted to be my running mate when I was given the ACN presidential ticket in 2007, but I disagreed and because of that, he switched his support to the late Umar Yar\u2019Adua. That was the parting point.\n\n\u201cThe Muslim-Muslim ticket has always been my fundamental disagreement. Nigeria is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious nation, and there should be a religious balance in our leadership. We are still friends, of course. But that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t have political differences. We have been having political differences ever since we became friends. Nothing unusual about that,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also revealed that Obi who was his running mate in the 2019 election didn\u2019t inform him of his intention to declare for president and only did so three days after his (Obi\u2019s) declaration.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult to expect a miracle to happen, simply because Peter Obi is in the Labour Party. After all, they were saying through social media that they had more than one million votes in Osun State. But how many votes turned out for the Labour Party? And then again, mark you, you\u2019re talking about social media. In the north, 90 per cent of our people are not tuned to social media,\u201d Atiku said.\n\nAtiku said he picked the governor of Delta State, Ifeanyi Okowa over the governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike because he believes the former can \u2018deliver\u2019.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t reject Wike, I picked who can deliver. Going by history, I had picked an Igbo as running mate in 2007, in 2019. I still picked an Igbo for 2023. The committee that was set up at my own instance deliberated. There was no vote, and they recommended three names, because they knew it was my prerogative to pick anyone of the three. So, there was actually no vote. It\u2019s not true.\n\n\u201cGovernor Ortom himself chaired that committee. He knew there was no vote taken, and I have the report of that committee. The committee recommended three people and I picked one. I did not go out of that recommendation. So, I think people should be fair to me and should also state the fact,\u201d he added.\n\nAtiku however said that he was reaching out to Governor Wike and that the party stakeholders will soon reconcile with the aggrieved Rivers state governor.\n\nWhen asked what the chances of former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi who is now the presidential candidate of the Labour Party is, Atiku said Obi would be unable to win the election even in the South East because the party has no structure.\n\nOn his relationship with former Presidential Olusegun Obasanjo, he said he has been talking to the former president and that the only thing he has yet to do was to visit him after his emergence as the PDP presidential candidate.\n\nWhen asked if he needs Obasanjo\u2019s support, Atiku said: \u201cWhy will I not need his support? He was my former boss. Why will I not need his support? Of course I will need his support. I assume I have it.\u201d",

          "title": "Mike Awoyinfa at 70: Journalism, Ghana, music, sports and me",
          "text": "By Chika Abanobi\n\nToday is July 23. On this day, in 1952, Mike Awoyinfa, Nigeria\u2019s ace writer, human angle journalism exponent and pioneer Managing Director/ Editor-in-Chief, The Sun Publishing Limited, was born into the world. That is to say, the pioneer editor of the defunct Weekend Concord is 70 years old today. But if white hair or beard is something that can be used to signpost who is 70, forgive him, he does not sport any. At 70, his prayer is that the Lord will keep him long enough to clock 80, 90, and even 100 until, in his words, he exhausts his brain in writing. A widely-travelled man, the prose stylist and famous biographer has traversed virtually all the continents. Referring to an incident in Paris, France in which he had a nasty fall some years ago, he said: \u201cMy life is always a story for my readers even if I have to make a mockery of myself. I don\u2019t mind making myself a laughing stock for my readers to enjoy.\u201d That, exactly, is what he did in this riveting interview with Saturday Sun, while going down the memory lane. Though a slice of his 70 years on earth having to do with mainly his days in Ghana, and partly in Nigeria, it reads like one of those biographies he and his late bosom friend, Dimgba Igwe, could write. This is Mike Awoyinfa\u2019s story.\n\nHow does it feel turning 70, in terms of aspirations and achievements?\n\nWe have to start by thanking Jehovah, God Almighty, the Father of Heavens and Earth, the One who created us. When we were children, 70 years was associated with bearded men like Moses and Abraham and other biblical characters. It sounded a very distant thing, you know. But we thank God that He has brought me thus far. They say that 70 is the Biblical age. I pray to God that it will not be the limit because there\u2019s so much to do in terms of my profession as a journalist and as a writer, as a biographer. There is so much for me to write. Writing is what keeps my alive. It keeps my mind alive; it\u2019s like a form of exercise. My prayer every morning is, \u2018God, forgive me all my sins, all my iniquities and let me live long enough to do your will and to do all my writings, to write as many books as possible before I finally die in my 90s or 100.\u2019 I want it to be that by the time they bury me, there would have been be nothing left in my brain. I would have exhausted my brain so much so that when I meet my friend, Dimgba, one day in heaven, there will be nothing left.\n\nBut it is said that age is in the mind. Do you feel old?\n\nOld age has its own challenges. Shortly before I became 70, sometimes last year, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. These are things you don\u2019t think will ever come to you. You think it is somebody else\u2019s sickness. You don\u2019t think you will ever be a victim. But that is reality for you. I am very, very health-conscious. I go for regular checkups. It is by the grace of God that the doctor discovered this thing very early before it begins to metastasise. I have survived it. Doctors said I am a cancer-survivor. I did radiology for 45 days. Radiology or chemotherapy has its own challenges too. It takes both the good and the bad. Here am I. Me that used to be an exercise freak, me that wakes up every morning jogging. Now I cannot even jog again. That\u2019s one of my regrets.\n\nI was going to ask you that question, whether at 70 you still jog\u2026\n\nAt 70, I cannot jog anymore. Apart from that, there is this lumbago at my lower back, degenerating bones. You go to see a doctor and they tell you there is no cure. You have to manage it. That\u2019s the challenge, the annoying thing about old age. Very annoying indeed\n\nAll the same, one must be grateful to God to be alive\u2026.\n\nI am grateful to God. When I look back and see people that were not even up to 40, 50, 60, 70 dying, I have to be grateful to Him that I am alive to see my children and my children\u2019s children. I have about four grandchildren. And they give me a whole lot of joy.\n\nYou were born in Ghana. How long did you stay there before you came down to Nigeria?\n\nMy father migrated to Ghana because he was having children at home, and they were dying.\n\nSo, in essence, you are not his first child?\n\nNo, I am not the first child. I have two sisters ahead of me. That was after my parents relocated to Ghana\n\nWere your parents traders or what?\n\nOf course, they were traders or entrepreneurs because they were quite enterprising. It was when they got there that they had my two senior sisters. Then after that I came, and then my younger brother. So, we are four: two girls and two boys. It was fun growing up though my elder sisters were in Nigeria. I never met them until Ghana sent us packing. Ghanaians said Nigerians must go. They sent two of them to Nigeria, my two elder sisters, to be trained by their relations. The one I am following is the one that tells me about my childhood. He said whenever she sees my son, Jide\u2019s daughter it reminds her of my childhood. He said that\u2019s the way I used to bubble. We give God the glory.\n\nTell us about your reading habit. When and how did it start?\n\nI read a lot when I was a kid because my father made a strategic decision by sending me to stay with the son of his senior sister. He was living with him in Ghana and he trained him up to the advanced teachers\u2019 education level. So, when he became a teacher, he took me under his tutelage. So I became his boy. I was the one preparing his food. It was a childhood of solitude. I feared him.\n\nHe must have been a disciplinarian\u2026\n\nHe was to me. In fact, as he was preparing for his O\u2019 and A\u2019 levels, he was also waking me up. We would be reading together. I would be angry and feeling sleepy. But he would give me a dirty slap. I was good in the arts but not in mathematics. It did not add up. So I read all his books: Peter Abraham\u2019s Tell Freedom, Mine Boy. I mean, all those books on the African Writers Series. I read them. That\u2019s how I became addicted to reading. And every morning he would ask me to buy newspapers: The Ghanaian Times and Weekly Spectator. Before he read them, I would have read them. From there, I knew I was going to be a journalist. Reading helps a lot. It affects your mind. It expands your horizon and makes you creative. You want to write like the people whose books you read. I was doing well in essays. I loved English Literature at school such that if I wrote an essay, whatever essay they gave me, I must steer the topic to whatever I had read. The teacher or school inspector would ask me to come and read my essay to the whole class. That kind of thing is motivational for every kid. Being the \u2018son\u2019 of a teacher, you have to do well. I had my O\u2019 level in Ghana. I was doing very well even in the Ghanaian language. If I write essay here in Ghanaian language, you will be surprised.\n\nWhich of them? Akan?\n\nNo. Fante. I was winning prizes.\n\nDo you still speak it?\n\nOf course, I do! When Ghanaians came to Nigeria, I was speaking it to them.\n\nWhich of their schools did you attend?\n\nInitially, I went to Sekondi College. I passed the Common Entrance when I was in Form 2. It was very early for me, and I had scholarship. But there is what they call \u2018The Monsoon\u2019. It is a term used to describe a situation in which the whole class could be sacked or sent packing if they feel they are not doing well or underperforming educationally. And, they needed the very best. We had Form 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D. They may have to sack students in Form 3D and some of them in Form 3C, and ask you to go and look for another school because you are not good for the school.\n\nHow does the system operate?\n\nThey would weed away some students they feel were not doing well academically as they had expected. They were so strict in that school that, in their quest for excellence, they had to cut away about two classes. That\u2019s how I was affected. The name, \u201cThe Monsoon\u201d, is just a slang word. They wanted just the best. And to them, it is either you are in Form 3A or Form 3B, then part of C. So I went to secondary school too early. Every year, there was massive expulsion of pupils who didn\u2019t do well academically.\n\nIt was like a selection of the very best?\n\nYes, but it affected me. It was based on age and academic performance. I went to secondary school very early in life.\n\nSo, after they sacked you, what happened next?\n\nI had to go and look for another school. I then went to Kwame Nkrumah Secondary School, Nsei-Axim. So that was a turning point in my life. I said, it will never happen to me again. You can be painting your story, and said it was a success all the way, that you had been a whizz kid. I was never a whizz kid. I had my failures when I was in Form 3 or so. I love Sekondi College so much that when I saw the result I got sad.\n\nWhat memories do you have of your parents, your father and mother?\n\nMy mother was such a very sweet woman. She was a daughter of an Imam. So I grew up as both a Muslim and a Christian. According to what I was told, when my father came to marry my mother, my mother said no. My father kept on persisting for three years. He was after this woman. My mother was still saying no. So, eventually my father\u2019s people found a wife for him. But when my mother heard that the man that had been tormenting him was about getting married, suddenly she agreed. So, that\u2019s how my father married two women at a go in his life. So, he went to Ghana with two wives. And those wives were very, very intimate. It was such that I could eat here or there. The second woman had only one daughter who was one year ahead of me. She is still in Ibadan. My mother had four.\n\nWhen you said your father relocated to Ghana because his children were dying, did it also affect the other wife?\n\nYes, both wives\u2019 children were dying. They had a dispute on who among them should be called the first wife. My father said no, my mother is the first because she is a woman he had been chasing for almost four years. So, he made my mother the senior wife. So, I grew up under two mothers. And I was educated both in the Muslim and Christian ways. I went to both the Quranic and Western schools. My experience is that studying at Quranic school comes with a lot of beatings: you memorise and memorise until you get tired. It was a great experience learning from the two religions.\n\nSo your dad allowed that?\n\nMy father was a very tolerant man. He wasn\u2019t difficult. He allowed you to practise your faith. He didn\u2019t disturb anybody. When the Muslims were celebrating, we joined my mother to celebrate. When Christians were celebrating, my mother would go to church. She was such a beautiful and quiet woman. She is the one whose character I have. I resemble my father. It was my sisters that took after my father character-wise, because he was a no-nonsense man. A tall man like that.\n\nTalking about your mother\u2019s children, how many of them are alive today?\n\nMy senior sister died last year at 77. The next to her is alive. But right now, she is in the UK. She is the one I am following. And I have a junior brother who is in Lagos.\n\nWhat does he do?\n\nHe is a commercial driver\n\nWhat do you think was responsible for the death of your parents\u2019 children at the time? Was it an African phenomenon?\n\nI don\u2019t know. People believe that it is witches that are responsible for that. But miraculously when one moves from there to another place, he doesn\u2019t have that kind of experience. Ghana was such a lovely place. We grew up under Kwame Nkrumah\u2019s Convention People\u2019s Party. He was an Africanist. He created Ghana\u2019s Young Pioneers. It was like the Boys\u2019 Scouts. I was a member of the Pioneers. It was more like all these Soviet and Chinese kinds of ideological movements.\n\nYou know, Nkrumah was widely regarded as a socialist\u2026\n\nYes, he was. That\u2019s why they eventually removed him through a coup de tat.\n\nWhat memories do you have of Ghana in those days?\n\nThere were always conflicts between Ghana and Nigeria. That rivalry has always been there from the beginning. Even at school, they would be tormenting you. They would say: \u2018look at you, tribal marks,\u2019 though I was not sporting any. There\u2019s a song they used to sing that \u2018the tiger is coming o, you better go and hide.\u2019 They used to mock or taunt us with it. And, when it comes to football, Ghana\u2019s Black Stars must defeat Nigeria. And anytime they did, we were in trouble in our school. It came to a point that I began to wish that I was a Ghanaian because of their taunting after those soccer tournaments.\n\nWas it where you developed your love for soccer?\n\nYes, I can say so. To Ghanaians, soccer was like a religion. They were like Africa\u2019s Brazil. That was the way they saw themselves. They had many soccer legends. And every time they were playing soccer, we stuck to our radio sets because there was no television by then. Ghana was always beating Nigeria. But on the side of Nigeria, there was Thunder Balogun. That was the kind of environment in which I grew up.\n\nEventually, Ghana asked you people to go\u2026.\n\nYes, it was one of the saddest moments of my life. But I didn\u2019t know it was going to be a blessing to me. After my O\u2019 levels, I came to Nigeria to do my A levels at Ijebu Ijesha Grammar School. There I was appointed the Library Prefect. I think I had the best results in the A\u2019 levels. When I came to Nigeria, there were books. But there weren\u2019t many books in Ghana. It was like a world of books, like a kid in a toy shop. I read and read and read. My friends in Ghana would ask me to send books to them. And I would buy books and send to them. I did it on one or two occasions. I was into sports at Ijebu Ijesha Grammar School. Those were the things I learnt from Ghana. I was into Hurdles. I was doing 100 metres. That was where I met my wife. I never knew she was going to be my wife because I was not even talking to her. It was after our schooldays that we got married. We had graduated, and I was looking for a wife. My people were pressurizing me. We were closing from church, and I just saw her. I said: \u2018How are you? Are you married?\u2019 She said: \u2018not yet.\u2019 I said, \u2018Oya, come, I will marry you.\u2019 Like a play, I took her to meet my parents. They were very happy to see her. My father carried wine to her parents, and that\u2019s how we began our marital journey.\n\nWho gave you your name, Mike?\n\nIt was my father that gave me the Christian name.\n\nSince you were at one time a Muslim, so to say, do you have a Muslim name?\n\nYes. Tiamiyu. In fact, every of my mother\u2019s children had a Muslim name. As a child, it was a Muslim name they used to call me. Nobody was calling me Mike. And they used to call my mum, \u2018Mama Tiamiyu.\u2019 My brother was Ganiyu. My immediate senior sister, the one I am following was Nimota. I have forgotten the Muslim name they were calling my eldest sister. She wasn\u2019t with us in Ghana. But her husband was the one God used to hone my writing skill because in those days we used to exchange letters. He would write with a literary flourish. For me to reply, I would have to do my own research. Every expression I had I would be keeping it for him so that when I wanted to reply to his letter, I would use those expressions. He was one of the reasons I went into journalism because he was working in Radio Nigeria and then as an engineer. But occasionally, he did the editorial side too. He was a contemporary of Biodun Shobanjo, the advert guru.\n\nYou studied Mass Communication at the University of Lagos but majored in broadcasting instead of print journalism. What was the reason for that?\n\nDid I know what I wanted in those days? What was reigning was the deejay of a thing, and I wanted very much to be one. I was a disc jockey on campus. And when I saw that we had a radio station, I said, \u2018ah, let me major in broadcasting so that I can be a deejay.\u2019 So, I learned radio writing, production and all that. The advantage I had was that whenever you are writing for the radio, you write for the ear. You write the way you talk. That has influenced the way I write. I was taught that if there is a bigger word and a smaller word, use the smaller word. So, it has really affected me. I hardly sound bombastic. I try to simplify my expressions, which is very good.\n\nWhat happened after you finished with your studies?\n\nFrom my NYSC which I did in Jos, Plateau State, I applied to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you look for job in a radio or TV station since you majored in broadcasting?\n\nDuring my NYSC I freelanced for a radio station, presenting a programme, but I didn\u2019t find that challenging enough. So I had to teach myself all over again how to write a feature story. I worked for NAN as a correspondent for a year or so. But I had to resign when National Concord came into existence. Before then, I was even getting frustrated with the work at NAN because there was no by-line. No feature story. Nothing! You are just like a civil servant. Initially, I got a job with the Daily Sketch, under Segun Osoba. I didn\u2019t know him then but they gave me the job. Upon getting the job, I went to NAN to tell them that I had been placed on Level 9. They quickly promoted me from Level 8 to 9. But shortly afterwards, Concord came brandishing Dele Giwa, Innocent Oparadike and other big names. I went for the interview in Kaduna. And, they retained me as their Chief Correspondent. While there, I was doing some human angle features and sending them to Dele Giwa on Sunday Concord. He then created a column for me called \u2018Reporter\u2019s Notebook.\u2019 There was a human-angle story on a Hausa journalist, an old woman. I interviewed the woman. It was at Aminu Kano press conference where she was asking questions. I didn\u2019t know that an uneducated woman can be a journalist. She asked the question in Hausa. I did the story, and Dele Giwa entitled the story: \u2018Hajiya \u2026somebody, a reporter without biro and notebook.\u2019 Later on, they brought me down to Lagos. Eventually, Dimgba came to join us. In journalism, you just have to be good. In the writing world, you don\u2019t need a godfather. Your talent is your godfather.\n\nYou lost a friend, Dimgba Igwe. But over the years, nobody has been able to find out the hit-and-run driver that killed him. How does that make you feel?\n\nMy joy is that Dimgba is in heaven. And over there he knows everything. If his killer is found, of what use is that? Will that bring him back again to life?\n\nBut don\u2019t you think it could help to bring a kind of closure to the sordid episode?\n\nWe may have something like that in other developed parts of the world. But we don\u2019t have anything like that here. That\u2019s why crime continues to grow in Nigeria because people can do some things and get away with it. In other places, before someone goes out to commit a crime, he evaluates it. What are the chances of being caught? But here in Nigeria, the chances of being caught are next to nothing. You can get away with murder in this country. You don\u2019t have the facilities to detect crime. No CCTV cameras. Nothing! We are still in the Stone Age in terms of things like that. It is so sad that criminals can brazenly enter prisons to release inmates. These are things that we are not even supposed to find in fiction. They would spend hours waiting for security men to come, and yet nothing would happen. This is a country where criminals would go and waylay a train, kidnap people and demand ransom. I mean, Nigeria has become a land of fiction. You can\u2019t travel by road again. And, the price of airfare is so exorbitant now. That\u2019s not the Nigeria we prayed for. It\u2019s so sad.\n\nHow do you think that Dimgba would have celebrated your 70th birthday if he had been alive today?\n\nAh! He was more of an influencer and organiser! While alive, he organised my 40th, 50th, and 60th birthdays. He would never have agreed that I should be quiet about my birthday. He would have pulled out all the plugs. He would have called out the media and everything. That was one area of his strengths. What he wants is what he wants. And, he wants the best for me.",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC), has given reasons for its poor performance in last weekend\u2019s governorship election in Osun.\n\nThe party also noted that its defeat has confirmed to Nigerians that the ruling party is not in control of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nAPC Deputy National Organising Secretary, Hon Nze Chidi Duru, made the declaration while taking a post-mortem review of the party\u2019s loss in last weekend\u2019s Osun governorship election.\n\nHe further argued that many factors might have contributed to the defeat, noting however that the ruling party did everything legally possible to smile home with the victory at the poll.\n\nHe also quipped that President Muhammadu Buhari congratulating the opposition party was to affirm the ruling party\u2019s liberal mindedness.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe lost the election in Osun State as was proclaimed by INEC and our party has accepted the result. It could be for a number of reasons.\n\n\u201cIt could be that the people of Osun wanted a change in government. It could be that they preferred the PDP to be in a position of authority in Osun, but as to what was required by our party to win the election, the party even did more. We energised the base, we mobilise the base, we went out to campaign, all our governors were there few days to the election to hold the closing ceremony and continue to message and explain to the people of Osun what the party represents and what they hope to achieve.\n\n\u201cWe understand and know as a fact that the governor cleared most of the outstanding liabilities in Osun State, but then, ultimately the electorate chose otherwise. We accept our defeat, we are ready and prepared for the next election.\u201d\n\nOn how the internal crack among the stakeholders in the state contributed to the defeat, the Deputy Organising scribe said: \u201cYes, of course, the party had continued to send the signal and the message that we needed to close ranks. We cannot cut our nose to spite our face. Politicians should realise that it is always better to be from inside than from outside.\n\n\u201cWe understand that in the political sphere, what is important is helping the party to win election and being accommodated after the emergence of the party in power in a particular locality. We do not discount the fact that perhaps if we had resolved the apparent division of the stalwarts and stakeholders in Osun State and if perhaps we brought them together, we may have had a different result. But then we don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cThere are states where, despite all these, APC had a good showing. If you take Ekiti State for example, there were stalwarts of the party that worked differently, but the party worked very hard and we won the election with a landslide. The scenario again repeated itself in Osun state but we had a different result. We have come to a point, in the party administration, to recognize the fact that there are parties, personalities and stakeholders that for some reason, have chosen not to work together.\n\n\u201cWhat has also become very clear is that this government of APC has no hand and does not impose anything on INEC in the discharge of its responsibility.\n\n\u201cAs a party, we are committed to helping the commission to bequeath to Nigeria the possibility of free, fair and transparent elections. We believe, as a party that it is the only guarantee we need as a country to hold leaders accountable.\n\n\u201cIf the electorate speak as they did in Osun, we will abide by it and if the law court gives an interpretation as to what transpired in Osun, we will also respect the judiciary. These are what is required to build a country,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "What Babachir Lawal Must Remember \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "The campaign of calumny against Tinubu by the former SGF is uncalled for, argues KOLA AMZAT\n\nBabachir Lawal is relatively an unknown stock to the generality of Nigerian people before his ascendance to the office of Secretary to the Federation in 2015. Even after his emergence as the SGF, his visibility in the political sphere was still shrouded, until his involvement in that grass cutting scandal of about N258 million that dominated the public sphere like wildfire. We recall that it was that inglorious scandal that led to his premature exit from the government of President Buhari in 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, after few years in the political doldrums, he resurfaced with Tinubu\u2019s presidency bid and indeed, proved to be one of those northern front liners and vanguard, mobilizing and canvassing for supports of Nigerians for the project till Asiwaju Tinubu eventually won at the presidential primary. But thereafter, Babachir\u2019s outbursts on the choice of running mate by the APC presidential candidate has been unsavory, combustible, very volatile and indeed, largely unbecoming of any top politician who desire victory for the party during the forthcoming presidential elections.\n\nNigerians must commend and appreciate the president for his maturity, circumspect and truly being a fatherly figure for keeping Babachir in government in that exalted office for good three years with that type of destructive, ruinous and devastating posture he continually exhibits even, while in government.\n\nIf indeed Babachir\u2019s resounding voice was one of the key elements that ensured the victory of Tinubu at the APC presidential primary, his recent militant disposition, provocative, offensive and very arrogant posture to the Muslim-Muslim ticket, which the presidential candidate and the party have resolved to adopt has completely eroded whatever support and contribution he has made towards the realization of the victory of Tinubu at the primary.\n\nWe need to unequivocally emphasis that the larger than life status that the APC Muslim-Muslim ticket has attracted is due to the spirited efforts that Babachir, Abbo and their co-travelers have jointly made to attempting to derail the presidency bid. As if he\u2019s in the one in charge, he\u2019s fruitlessly justified why other candidates of Christian stock are better than Kassim Shettima, who is the choice of the party and the presidential candidate.\n\nBabachir has bluntly failed to reckon with the fact that the choice of vice presidential candidate is essentially the prerogative of the presidential candidate, while working on the candid advice of the major stakeholders of the party. Presently in the Nigeria political setting, the major stakeholders of APC is the sitting president, the governors and the National Working Committee, and perhaps some few resounding voices in the party.\n\nFrom facts available to the public, majority of the stakeholders wanted Babagana Zulum to be selected for the ticket. Meanwhile, the indefatigable governor of Borno state opted to complete the rebuilding and rehabilitating exercise presently on-going in the entire state, consequent upon the devastating and destructive effects of Boko Haram. He pointedly and passionately pleaded to the president and party hierarchy that his predecessor in office, Kassim Shettima should be chosen instead. He backed his claims with Shettima\u2019s amazing and incredible performance as former governor, the achievements which have made his own jobs as the incumbent governor relatively easier and seamless.\n\nWith the submission by Zulum, it wasn\u2019t too difficult for the party and particularly Tinubu to eventually zero in on Shettima, especially considering what he did as Tinubu\u2019s key member of entourage canvassing and mobilizing for the votes of the delegates. His present office as distinguished Senator is also a contributory factor to his choice as the vice presidential candidate. Of course, Shettima\u2019s profile as a thoroughbred financial professional with a distinguished career in Zenith, a top rated Financial Institution in the country where he exited as General Manager, as well as chequered career as University don also placed him in good stead for the plum job.\n\nHis capacity, capability, emotional and mental intelligence for the job is also not in doubt. A key element in his candidacy is his popularity in the entire north, a factor that would significantly assist the Tinubu administration in seamlessly and conveniently establishing communication with the north thus assisting in rebuilding and reigniting the trust and confidence that have almost disappeared between the North and the South.\n\nJust like his boss, Shettima\u2019s personality and ebullient posture is also an advantage to attract honor and respect of generality of Nigerians to the ticket, a development that would surely translates into victory at the polls. So, where has Tinubu gone wrong in the choice of Shettima as his vice presidential candidate to have attracted this loads of vituperations from Babachir Lawal and his ilk? Every presidential and governorship aspirant is looking for vice/deputy candidate capable of attracting mileage to his ticket. Tinubu has got one in Kassim Shettima.\n\nWhat we expect from all members of progressive family across the country is to unite behind the ticket. Any other agenda other than supporting the ticket is dastard, obstructive, self-serving and destructive. We therefore appeal to Babachir Lawal and other mischief makers in APC to reconsider their stands in the interest of the party and henceforth, sheath their swords. It\u2019s in their best interest for the party and her candidates to be victorious at the polls. Churning out invectives and highly provocative statements based on religious sentiments would only be counterproductive.\n\nKola Amzat (FCA), is a Lagos-based financial consultant",

          "text": "There appears to be no love lost between Governor Hope Uzodinma and the good people of Imo State. It does not take a lot to sense that for a very long time, the people of Imo State will feel aggrieved with the Supreme Court for foisting on them someone they could never have voted for in a million elections even if the court only did what the law dictated and no more.\n\nIf the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) group had thought that its agitations and activities were in the interests of the Southeast, it has since stood by, watching haplessly as criminal elements have infiltrated it, piling atrocities with each passing day. Multiple attacks have been carried out in the Southeast to push a region known for its relative peace towards the precipice.\n\nUntil recently when Anambra State became the epicenter of the troubles, a lot of the attacks were in Imo State with citizens taking as many hits as security forces. Even before the attacks started, Governor Uzodinma was already hugely unpopular, with many perceiving him to at best be the beneficiary of an opaque judicial verdict that fed from Nigeria`s highly corrupt patronage system.\n\nWhat one will never know is how much of the attacks happened because Uzodinma was on seat as Governor, and how many of them were by forces bent on achieving their own goals. What is clear is that Uzodinma\u2019s incendiary rhetoric has never helped matters. Neither has his formation of the infamous Ebubeagu security unit which has lurched from one controversy to another since it came into existence.\n\nCreated at a security summit of 11th April 2021 as a regional security outfit by the five South-east governors to tackle insecurity in the region, Ebubeagu was formally inaugurated by the Ebonyi State Governor David Nweze Umahi in December last year. The outfit was no doubt created to ape Amotekun,a similar outfit in the Southwest which was created to counter growing security threats in the region.\n\nWith its headquarters in Enugu, it was mandated to coordinate the vigilante in the Southeast and generally improve the security situation in the Southeast. It appears however that more than anything else, it was the activities of IPOB that panicked the South-east governors to the security summit in which Ebubeagu was formed.\n\nWith the incarceration of its leader in Abuja, the IPOB had increased the frequency of its attacks in the South-east, threatening and targeting the governors directly. If today, Ebubeagu in spite of its handful of modest achievements is being fingered for contributing to some of the problems it was created to tackle, it is because many of its members have shown that they lack any iota of professionalism. On Sunday, 17th July 2022, the lives of seven youths in Awomama, Imo State were brutally cut short, reportedly by operatives of Ebubeagu. Uzodinma has since absolved Ebubeagu of any complicity in the murder.\n\nIt does not take clairvoyance to see that some unscrupulous governors who already operate like demi-gods will leave no stone unturned in turning their state police into their personal vigilante and vicious attack dogs. One only needs to look at what some state legislatures have become at the hands of some overbearing governors to know that in Nigeria anything is possible. It however does not mean that in the face of rampaging insecurity, Nigeria should not explore all legal avenues to secure her citizens while getting justice for all those who are ever treated outside what the law prescribes.\n\nKene Obiezu, keneobiezu@gmail.com",

          "text": "It has to be said that the political landscape in Nigeria is ever changing and with the recently passed electoral laws, it would be harder to have bad elections in Nigeria. I deliberately use the word bad elections because in the past elections were really bad. Suffice to say, the Osun elections is a testament to the fact that the BVAS technology by INEC and the transmission of results will make elections more accountable in Nigeria.\n\nThe first lesson I will like to point out is the role of the electoral umpire. Once we get it right with electioneering, then the voice of the people will start to count and I must give commendations to INEC on this.\n\nAnother lesson is the role internal democracy plays in the affairs of a nation. The APC got its internal democracy wrong in Osun and the party was already fragmented before the elections and it was evident as they lost many strongholds in the state and this culminated in the total defeat of the APC. Once things fell apart, it was difficult for the center to hold.\n\nAnother important lesson is the role of the people, in recent elections cycle. The Osun turnout was one of the highest, 42% of the people with PVC voted. That cannot be said for Ekiti and from that we can deduce that, there was a candidate that excited the people on the ballot and for democracy to work, the people must play their own part and play it well. .I think those in the. political ecosystem will imbibe these lessons as we approach 2023.\n\nRufai Oseni, rufaioseni@gmail.com",

          "text": "\u00b7 We are all too familiar with the men and women of the Nigeria Police. At least, at numerous illegal roadblocks, the familiar encounter is the \u2018anything for the weekend\u2019 request; or when one had cause to go to a police station to incident a complaint and seek police intervention, it is not unlikely to be met with a demand for money to open a file or buy paper. The general perception of the average citizen is that the rank and file of the police is corrupt. As a legal practitioner of almost four decades\u2019 experience, I have had a fair share of encounters with men and women of our police force and I have some of them, ranging from the lowly constable to the top echelon as friends and acquaintances.\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7 On 8th July 2022, I received a report of theft of some items at my site in Mowe which necessitated making a complaint to the Mowe police station. The first thing that struck me when I got to the station was that I met four officers at the desk. Expectedly, I requested to see the head of the station, the DPO which prompted the most senior of the four to take me to an office. It was then I realised that the person who interacted with me at the desk was the DPO. To me, this was quite unusual as most protocol is that the DPO is the last person you will find at the station desk. I sought to know why SP Folake Afeniforo was found at the desk when I came in. Her explanation struck me that she is better off monitoring her station\u2019s activities at close quarters, and not giving room for unnecessary delays and untoward conducts in attending to matters reported at the station.\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7 With finesse, her personal interrogation of suspects and fact-finding led to the resolution of the issue at hand such that within three hours, the location of the stolen items was discovered and were recovered. Suffice it to state that SP Afeniforo\u2019s approach to the job is visibly reflected in her subordinates at the station, unlike what one will find at a typical police station. This is the kind of service delivery the public expects from our policemen and women. I can only but commend SP Folake Afeniforo and her subordinates at the Mowe Police Station and I am sure her unusual approach to duties will take her to places.\n\n\u00b7\n\nChief Wale Taiwo,SAN FCArb",

Grievances and mutual distrust in these areas are fed into the intermittent attacks by armed bandits, leading to reprisals, and cycles of ethno-religious or political violence,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cClashes between farming communities and herder communities also add a critical dimension to insecurity, as they can trigger conflict directly, or spiral into the involvement of armed criminals.\n\n\u201cThe Kaduna State Government is acutely aware of the devastating impact that conflict and violence have had on communities. In 2021, 1,192 people lost their lives in Kaduna State due to banditry, terrorism, communal clashes, violent attacks and reprisals; 406 of these lives were lost in the Southern Kaduna general area, mostly through killings and counter-killings. In the first six months of 2022, 645 people lost their lives in such circumstances across the State; 234 of these occurred in the Southern Kaduna area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBesides the loss of life and limb, there are the grim socio-economic effects of violence, eroding the viability of affected communities. Food insecurity is a close reality in frontline areas where farmers are threatened and attacked by bandits.\n\n\u201cThe situation also presents a persistent threat to education; students and teachers have been attacked in several incidents over the last 18 months. Healthcare delivery has been affected, as health workers and facilities in frontline locations face the threat of marauding bandits.\n\n\u201cAll of these portend the near-total collapse of the local economy in frontline areas, which is mainly sustained by crop and livestock farming. Residents have been dispossessed of their foremost means of sustenance. Vibrant weekly markets have been disrupted.\u201d\n\nHe, however, added that the state government remains committed to improving security and ensuring better welfare for residents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAmidst all of these, the Kaduna State Government has remained unrelenting in its initiatives for peace and participatory security management, through the Kaduna State Peace Commission. Relative stability is now enjoyed in many usually turbulent communities in the Southern Kaduna area,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said Kaduna would follow in the footsteps of Plateau on the latter\u2019s recent peace accord instituted between the Fulani and Irigwe groups in Bassa LGA.\n\n\u201cFollowing this encouraging development on the Plateau State end of things, the Kaduna State Government will follow through with a similar accord involving the groups in Kauru local government area, to ensure an all-encompassing peace in the general area between the states,\u201d Aruwan said.\n\nHe also called for improved operations by security operatives across the state to ensure that residents can enjoy a peaceful environment.",

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Yesterday, global streaming service Netflix announced via its Q2 2022 financial results that it lost 970,000 subscribers in the second quarter of the year.\n\nThis is the second time in a row that the streaming service is suffering a massive blow to its subscriber base. In the first quarter of this year, the service reported its first subscriber loss in 10 years with a 200,000 subscriber decline.\n\nAt the time, Netflix outlined 4 reasons for its subscriber decline: an increase in streaming services; geopolitical events like Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine; a decline in addressable market; and more notably, an increase in household password sharing. According to Netflix, over 100 million of its 222 million paying subscribers are sharing their passwords with people outside of their households.\n\nNetflix experiencing another dip in its subscriber count doesn\u2019t come as a shock to the service because it predicted, in April, that it would lose up to 2 million subscribers in Q2. Its subscriber growth decline, however, was less than half of that. Netflix\u2019s biggest subscriber loss came from its largest markets, the US and Canada, where Netflix said it lost 1.3 million users. This number was offset by an increase in subscribers from other regions.\n\nWhile the streaming service has not commented on reasons for its recent decline, experts project that it\u2019s due to the proliferation of streaming services. With the launch of HBO Max, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\u2019s library of movies, series and even games will be limited as more studios launch their own streaming platforms.\n\nNetflix, however, still has the biggest share of the streaming service market with 220 million subscribers while Amazon\u2019s Prime Video holds 200 million, while Disney+ and HBO Max hold 87.6 million and 74 million subscribers respectively.\n\n1 million subscribers in Q3\n\nThe service also plans to keep its top spot and add 1 million subscribers to its tally by Q3.\n\nTo do this, the service will implement a few long-term solutions, including increased movie and game development budgets. It\u2019s introducing ads to its platform in a partnership with Microsoft. Later this year, starting with the US and Canada, the platform will introduce a cheaper ad-tier option for streamers.\n\nThe platform is also taking a tough stance on password-sharing as it announced the testing of an \u201cadd a home\u201d feature which will charge users an extra $3 to share accounts with users in other households. \u201cWe know this will be a change for our members,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cOur goal is to find an easy-to-use paid sharing offering that we believe works for our members and our business that we can roll out in 2023.\u201d\n\nRevenue soars\n\nIn its letter to its shareholders, the service stated that Q2 was \u201cbetter than expected\u201d.\n\nWhile its total number of subscribers might have declined by 970,000, its year-on-year revenue, however, increased by 9% in Q2 2022.\n\nImage source: Netflix\n\nThe streamer\u2019s net profit for the quarter was $1.44 billion, up 6.5% from $1.35 billion in Q2 2021. It, however, noted that it expects its revenue growth would slow to 4.5% by Q3.\n\nDespite this news, Netflix\u2019s shares jumped by 7% after the report was released.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Hannah Subayi believes the gap between Anglophone and Francophone African startups is reducing",
          "text": "Hannah Subayi Kamuanga\u2019s passion for investing is evident in the many hats she wears as a foremost investor in the African tech ecosystem.\n\nShe\u2019s currently the country manager for development finance institution Propaco in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a board member of the African Business Angel Network, and a partner at Dazzle Angels, a female-focused angel fund. She\u2019s also an investment committee member in 2 pan-African investment funds: Aruwa Capital and Launch Africa Ventures.\n\nPrior to her taking up these roles, she spent 7 years at South Suez Capital, an African private equity fund, and 2 years at the Switzerland-headquartered financial services company, Credit Suisse.\n\n\u201cI love to find, identify talent, provide capital, and see talent grow to create something out of the business, see it grow over time,\u201d Subayi shared with TechCabal over a call. \u201cInvesting in companies allows me to combine my data crunching technical skills and legal skills, such as poring over legal briefs or policy documents, while redefining the future of Africa one investment at a time.\u201d\n\nTechCabal sat down with Subayi to learn more about her experience and life as an African investor.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: What does investing mean to you?\n\nHannah Subayi: Investing is really about identifying talent, whether it\u2019s a startup, a large business, or a team of promoters trying to set up infrastructure projects. You assess funding needs, structure a deal, invest and monitor the investments. This turns out to have a massive impact in Africa, which I\u2019m very passionate about, and then obviously, you make money while at it.\n\nCurrently, as Propaco\u2019s country officer in DRC, which is a frontier market, I have the opportunity to invest through the entire spectrum of different projects from infrastructure financing, down to early-stage startups. Without any conflict, I also advise Aruwa Capital and Launch Africa Ventures, which is the most active fund on the continent with 90% of our founders being local African founders and 25% of them being female.\n\nAs an investor, I\u2019d like to ensure that founders in markets like DRC and Madagascar are also getting the funding that they need from institutional investors.\n\nPersonally, I have set up a new investment club here in the DRC. In March, we did our first seed investment in a local Congolese company manufacturing and distributing industrial cleaning products such as soaps and toothpaste, which are made from local African products like palm oil.\n\nThis investment is a big deal for us because DRC is a typical African country where about 80\u201390% of our products are actually imported. We don\u2019t have any active industries outside of the mining industry. One of our mission statements as an investment club is that we\u2019re going to support local companies that\u2019ll turn out to become as big as Africa\u2019s leading industrial conglomerate, Dangote, and help industrialise the economy in DRC.\n\nDA: What has the transition from private equity to angel investing and venture capital been like?\n\nHS: As an investor, I\u2019m quite passionate about reinventing myself. Every 3\u20134 years I discover new industries, new financial instruments, and products. I started out investing through private equity in Africa for a few years; this prepared me as I built my own personal wealth to become an angel investor to back the next wave of entrepreneurs.\n\nI started Dazzle Angels angels back in 2019, right after investing for many years through private equity. I think my experience as an angel investor led me to become more passionate about startups and early-stage investments. And with many investment clubs behaving more like VC firms, despite not having the same technical skills, network and funds, it\u2019s natural that many angel investors move over to become VC investors.\n\nDA: What do you look out for in startups you want to invest in?\n\nHS: For me, I really like to focus on the team, focusing on their consistency and ability to deliver, as well as their resilience, because I think it\u2019s really important in Africa to be resilient.\n\nI ask questions such as do I like the business? Do I understand what they do? Do I feel like there is a prospect for growth and profitability? How disruptive are businesses or what type of impact do they have on the ground?\n\nWhat is the execution risk? Personally, when I look at an investment opportunity I think of how I can mitigate all of those risks. Obviously, you have to consider the competitive dynamics of the sector and the regulatory environment. But again, with the right team and the right business model, you can navigate those things pretty easily.\n\nIn addition, the deal structure is important because you need to make sure that you\u2019re providing the right amount of funding.\n\nDA: What red flags do you look out for when investing in startups?\n\nHS: Personally, it\u2019s always down to the people. For me, a red flag is when the entrepreneur is not completely committed or convinced by his business, his venture\u2014if he\u2019s running 4 or 5 other projects.\n\nThe next has to do with the deal terms, which is also a reflection of the team. I think as an investor if you\u2019re not comfortable with the deal terms, and you feel that the entrepreneur is asking for a valuation that\u2019s too high or asking for terms that are too negative for you, then it\u2019s something you might want to walk away from.\n\nFor example, there have been instances when entrepreneurs that don\u2019t have a turnover or make less than $5,000\u201310,000 per month state that their valuation is $5 or $10 million. I often reply by telling them that\u2019s not how it works. These unreasonable expectations are reflected in the terms of the percentage founders offer investors. This also comes up when founders expect investors to make too many business introductions for them. Obviously, as an investor, you\u2019re to make a few introductions but not to become the commercial director.\n\nSo already during the due diligence phase, if you hear that the entrepreneurs are asking for many things like commercial introductions that you can\u2019t deliver, then I think you should walk away, and vice versa.\n\nDA: Can you share an overview of what investing in the different regions of Africa look like?\n\nHS: The difference between regions in Africa is a reflection of the economic and social development history. As you know anglophone Africa tends to be a bit more advanced than Arab-speaking and francophone Africa.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t speak too much about lusophone Africa\u2014Portuguese-speaking countries\u2014even though I\u2019ve made an investment in a startup in Mozambique because I think these are frontier markets with a different language, which are not that connected to the rest of the continent.\n\nNevertheless, we noticed that in all the 3 main regions\u2014anglophone, Arab-speaking, and francophone\u2014we see more and more local institutional funders being active with the right technical skills and willingness to back local champions, which is very optimistic.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing an improvement in the regulatory environment. More startup investment clubs are being supported by local governments. We see universities putting in place structures to assist students who want to create their own startups. We see VC firms being more active at the seed level, series A, and other levels. Generally speaking on the continent, there is still a lack of sufficient pre-seed funding, which typically is taken care of by the government.\n\nThe quality of companies is increasing everywhere. I\u2019m always happy to demonstrate that even in francophone Africa, you\u2019ll find 5 founders and startups who have better metrics in terms of turnover, number of users, and profitability than in Anglophone Africa.\n\nHowever, we cannot deny that the operational environment remains a bit tougher to some extent in francophone Africa. So, obviously, if you\u2019re a founder in one of these francophone markets, compared to someone who might be in South Africa, or Egypt, you\u2019ll struggle a bit more and the pace at which your business grows is not the same.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing an increase in intra-Africa transactions. So, we see more North African investors who are trying to get into anglophone Africa. We see more anglophone African investors trying to invest in francophone Africa. So it\u2019s very exciting to be alive at this time when investors and startups are operating across different regions.\n\nPart of the reason why this is happening is that there are more investors just like me who have worked and studied across different regions, enabling them to understand the different contexts and navigate them better. We have more African investors who are well-rounded in terms of understanding the different ecosystems and we see an increase in investment into the 3 regions, and hopefully, francophone Africa will continue to catch up.\n\nDA: Anything more, especially about the francophone Africa space?\n\nHS: Historically, francophone Africa, just by virtue of the language, mainly only looked to France for funding and expansion. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the case anymore.\n\nIf you look at startups, like Wave, you can see that most of the funding came from the US and other international investors. If you look at francophone African startups, they are incorporated in Paris but that\u2019s not any different from other startups that are incorporated in Delaware.\n\nIrrespective of where startups are incorporated, I think that there\u2019s some uniformity around standard practices and strategies of startups in the continent, which also explains why we see an uptick in investments for Africa. There\u2019s a similarity in the way entrepreneurs think about their growth and expansion and how they talk to investors, which is literally what you want because you want to make sure that everybody\u2019s playing on an equal field and to make sure that startups are receiving the right level of funding.\n\nDA: What\u2019s it like being a female investor?\n\nHS: I think there are many features in my profile that some people might interpret in a good or negative way, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s all about positioning. It\u2019s all about being consistent in terms of who you are as an investor, what you\u2019re trying to achieve, and connecting with the right type of opportunities.\n\nAs a female investor in francophone Africa, I haven\u2019t really felt potentially discriminated against because I\u2019ve worked with entrepreneurs who respect me. Typically, if you demonstrate that you have the right technical skills, the right network, and are a nice person, people will work with you.\n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to managing our careers or raising funds, it might be more challenging for female investors. But it\u2019s a representation of the issues that female professionals face in all industries. So I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s the worst in the investment space.\n\nIt\u2019s about understanding what you can bring to the table and adapting your strategy to suit the person you\u2019re dealing with. Also, at the end of the day, as an investor, you also have to walk away from situations and opportunities that are clearly not capable or willing to work with you.\n\nDA: How do you spend your time? What does a typical day look like?\n\nHS: When I look at all the great African investors like Mariame Diop, Zachariah George, or Tomi Davies who are doing much more than I\u2019m doing, it\u2019s always humbling.\n\nManaging Propaco in DRC takes most of my time, attending investor committees, talking to CEOs of large companies and startups to talk about due diligence processes monitoring, investment, doing site visits, as well as here in DRC. I also occasionally deal with lawyers to be sure the legal documentation is correct or dealing with litigation.\n\nI do all of this and attend social events like seminars and conferences. We don\u2019t talk enough about that because as an investor, it\u2019s quite important to be well connected to your business community, whether it\u2019s other investors or entrepreneurs.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in the market?\n\nHS: When we started Launch Venture Africa last year, we were investing in startups with no revenue but now it\u2019s difficult for us to look at a startup that\u2019s not generating at least $20,000. That\u2019s how competitive the market has become.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing more and more investments between various financial institutions. We\u2019re seeing more synergies between investment clubs, and there are new structures that are put in place that are a mix of investment clubs and VC funds, like Future Africa and Dakar Network Angels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "How to navigate delivery apps and traditional logistics companies in Lagos and Kaduna",
          "text": "This week\u2019s Everyday People comes with a little twist. In the last two months, we\u2019ve talked to a DJ who teaches kids coding, a lawyer who\u2019s also a content creator, a gadget seller at Computer Village, Ikeja, an Uber driver, a dentist turned YouTuber, and Burna Boy\u2019s monitor engineer.\n\nThis time, we\u2019ll be talking to three business owners about their experiences with delivery and logistics in the bustling city of Lagos and the ancient Kaduna town.\n\nFirst up, Egemba Michael Kachi, chef, photographer, and perfume merchant.\n\nKachi, Perfume Merchant\n\nDo you use delivery apps?\n\nI don\u2019t really use delivery apps. Someone introduced me to one, but I can\u2019t remember the platform. I booked the ride and was asked to pay, which I did. I was told the delivery person would be with me in about two hours. Throughout the day, I did not see anybody, didn\u2019t do the delivery, and had already paid.\n\nSo, I spoke to them, and they said, \u201cOkay, it won\u2019t happen next time,\u201d and I believed them. The next day, the same thing happened.\n\nKachi\n\nThey eventually did the delivery, but that was it for me; I just went back to my individual rider companies.\n\nWhat\u2019s your experience with traditional delivery companies?\n\nWith delivery companies, just mentally prepare yourself because you can\u2019t control anything. They could pick up from you and tell you they are going there immediately, and only for you to realise five or six hours later, late in the evening, that they\u2019ve still not delivered.\n\nThey\u2019ll tell you, \u201cOh, the bike spoilt.\u201d\n\nOr, they were held up by local government boys, or they had an accident, blah blah blah. So whenever I\u2019m doing deliveries, I basically tell my customers, \u201cYou could get it today or tomorrow.\u201d\n\nNot that I\u2019m giving an excuse, but just in case something happens. And the annoying thing is when they know they\u2019re running late, they won\u2019t call. If you call, they might not pick up or be very rude when they do.\n\nOne time I gave a package to the wrong rider; I was so confused that day, like, \u201cWho did I give my perfume to?\u201d It didn\u2019t end there, though. The rider dropped it off at their office, and my perfume went missing. The manager had to threaten not to pay his people their salaries before it was found.\n\nAnother time, the rider delivered the perfume at 11 p.m. At night! To give him credit, the manager had told me it would be same-day delivery; I just didn\u2019t know his today meant from the start of the day to the end of the day.\n\nSo how do you handle customers then?\n\nI steadily update them. So that gives them a bit of confidence. It would be very odd if I told them a rider had picked up and they didn\u2019t hear anything from the rider or me all day, and they didn\u2019t see their deliveries all; it\u2019d look like I\u2019m a fraud. So I\u2019m constantly communicating with the riders and giving the customers feedback.\n\nNext, we have Feranmi Ajetomobi, a growth marketer at Flutterwave and the Co-founder of Nigerian food startup, NiFries.\n\nFeranmi, Co-founder of NiFries\n\nFeranmi\n\nHow do you run your deliveries?\n\nWe do a mix, actually. So we have apps, and our delivery guys, like people we built relationships with to help handle the deliveries. That is very important because when you start running a delivery service for food in Lagos if you depend solely on apps, you\u2019d most likely be disappointed unless the orders come from the apps.\n\nMost times, you have to actually get traditional riders who are available at any time. It\u2019s a supply-demand issue because, say, I finished cooking by 11:00 a.m. and somebody orders at that point, I would have to go into the app, order for a rider, and then wait for the rider to come.\n\nSometimes some riders don\u2019t come early, and at other times, you wouldn\u2019t even get the rider. So there\u2019s a big supply issue when it comes to the delivery apps.\n\nFor areas around us, we\u2019ve actually resorted to bicycles that handle deliveries on our behalf.\n\nThere\u2019s also pricing. If somebody orders food by 11:00 a.m. and you tell them they\u2019ll get it in 45 minutes, but another order comes before you finish packaging it by 11:45 a.m., one rider can take everything.\n\nBut when it comes to the apps, I need to wait for orders to compile before I can make a request.\n\nBut\u2026\n\nI think logistics companies that focus on other forms of logistics have no business with the food business because, first off, the margins are very low. Nobody wants to pay \u20a61,000 ($2) for food that costs \u20a6800 ($1.8). But say I\u2019m buying shoes, I will pay \u20a61,500 ($3) because the shoes probably cost \u20a610,000 ($23) or even \u20a630,000 ($70).\n\nBecause of that margin cost, you either give that delivery company a bulk of those orders, or they charge you high because you\u2019ve made just one order.\n\nThe alternative I\u2019ve seen work is with companies like Chowdeck, a logistics company for food businesses. And their approach is to run a marketplace where food operators like me can list our business and get orders through them. It is the same thing with Bolt Food.\n\nThat way, I don\u2019t bother with logistics; I don\u2019t bother about the price. The good thing is that aside from running that marketplace, you can have an agreement with Chowdeck that allows you to have some bikes and bicycles at your store.\n\nIt is possible to get orders or process orders outside their marketplace. The hybrid structure is the best, honestly, because it allows you to mix the marketplace structure with your bike.\n\nYou have more professionalism, and you can easily track your goods. There\u2019s accountability and protection for your product. And some of them even insure your products, so if they get damaged, you are covered to an extent.\n\nWould you ever enter the logistics part of the business?\n\nThere\u2019s no economic sense in owning a bike. In the future, I can come together with other food business owners and build a consortium of bikes; we\u2019d put money together and own our delivery network.\n\nThen I can be confident to own bikes. But for me, to own banks on my own, it\u2019s not a wise business decision at all. It\u2019s too expensive. Maintainance capital costs and even operational costs.\n\nWhat\u2019s one thing you wish delivery apps could do better?\n\nTracking. Most of them are bad at it so you can\u2019t accurately track where the rider is with your food.\n\nLast but not least is Yetunde Aisha, the Founder of Shop Yetu, who sells thrift items and essential oils.\n\nYetunde, Entrepreneur\n\nYetunde\n\nSo how do you do your deliveries?\n\nI deliver within and outside Kaduna. At first, I was using all these normal bike logistics companies for deliveries within Kaduna.\n\nBut late last year, there was a ban on all motorcycles, so those logistics companies couldn\u2019t operate. You had to have a car or Keke [tricycle] to do what the bikes were doing. So deliveries within Kaduna were halted for some time because I had to look for another means of delivering my items.\n\nAnd the thing with having a business online is that apart from the price of the item, some people get discouraged when they hear the cost of delivery. Delivery within Kaduna used to cost \u20a6500 ($1), but the people using cars were charging \u20a61,000 ($2) or \u20a61,500 ($3). So it\u2019s either you increase the delivery fee, or you take out of the profit you\u2019re making from your business. Then I got a Keke guy.\n\nFor deliveries outside Kaduna to certain places like Abuja, I like using public transport and a car costs \u20a61,500. But those ones are a bit tricky because you can\u2019t track them. You have to keep calling the driver, and sometimes they switch off their phones. Or you take it to the motor park, and they put it in another car.\n\nThere was an item I sent to Jos last year, but it ended up in Sokoto; I still don\u2019t understand it. And then, because of kidnapping issues, some of the cars don\u2019t arrive until late at night. So I had to get someone at the holding park in Mabushi [Abuja].\n\nFor any place outside Abuja, I strictly use GIG Logistics because you can track the packages, and so far, I am satisfied. I\u2019ve been using GIG since last year, and I\u2019ve had only one issue when they mixed up my packages.\n\nHave you tried other companies?\n\nI tried DHL, but it wasn\u2019t working out because they\u2019re very expensive. A good example is Maiduguri, where I send items using regular public transport. I used DHL three times when their rates were still reasonable, but with the fuel scarcity and increase in fuel price, their rates have gone up. I think one month, when I wanted to send a package, they told me it would cost \u20a68,000 ($18).\n\nHow much is the cloth the person bought? With public transport, you pay like \u20a62,000 ($4), and it gets there.",

          "title": "Petrol subsidy nears N6.7trn as debt service exceeds revenue",
          "text": "The federal government has projected that petrol subsidy will gulp N6.7 trillion in 2023, if bold steps are not taken to do away with it, even as debt service outpaced its revenue in the first four months of this year.\n\nZainab Ahmed, minister of finance, budget and national planning, said on Thursday that huge subsidies had overburdened government finances and pushed the fiscal deficit to as much as N3.09 trillion between January and April this year.\n\nShe spoke in Abuja at the public consultation on the draft 2023-2025 Medium Term Fiscal Expenditure/Fiscal Strategy Paper, which officially commenced preparation of the 2023 budget.\n\nBetween January and April this year, Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas revenues slumped 51 percent compared to budget estimates to N1.23 trillion, as expected benefits from rallying oil prices continued to elude the country due to significant oil production shortfall and petrol subsidy burden.\n\nFor the full-year 2022, oil revenues were projected at N9.37 trillion, but just 39 percent of the proposed N3.12 trillion for April-January was realised.\n\nAhmed said despite higher oil prices, oil revenue underperformed due to \u201coil production shut-ins resulting from pipeline vandalism and crude oil theft; and high petrol subsidy cost due to higher landing costs of imported products.\u201d\n\nData indicate that as at April 2022, the federal government\u2019s retained revenue was N1.63 trillion, indicating only 49 percent of the prorated target of N3.32 trillion.\n\nIts share of oil revenues was N285.38 billion (representing 39 percent performance), while non-oil tax revenues totalled N632.56 billion \u2013 a performance of 84 percent. Company income tax and Value Added Tax collections were N298.83 billion and N102.97 billion, representing 99 percent and 98 percent of their respective targets.\n\nRead also: The Immorality of petroleum subsidy\n\nCustoms collections (made up of import duties, excise and fees, as well as federation account special levies) fell below the target by N76.77 billion (25.42 percent).\n\nOther revenues amounted to N664.64 billion, of which independent revenue was N394.09 billion.\n\nHowever, aggregate expenditure for 2022 which was estimated at N17.32 trillion, with a prorated spending target of N5.77 trillion at the end of April, but actual spending was N4.72 trillion, the minister said.\n\nOf this amount, N1.94 trillion was for debt service, N1.26 trillion for personnel cost, including pensions, while only N773.63 billion was spent on capital expenditure.\n\nOn how the government intends to fund the huge subsidy burden going forward, Ahmed said the transition of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to a commercial entity has raised the expectation that the huge bill could be offset through royalties and taxes from the company, which will no longer make contributions into the federation.\n\n\u201cNNPC will be paying royalties, dividends and taxes; so while the revenue might not be monthly, we will work out an arrangement with them on how this will be paid. It is possible to work out an arrangement where the payment could be made to the federation either monthly or quarterly. We can negotiate that these remittances are done on a quarterly basis,\u201d she said.\n\nShe confirmed that for about eight months prior to the NNPC\u2019s transition, the federation had not been receiving any revenue from the national oil company mainly because it had been covering the cost of fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cAssuming they were not paying that subsidy, that value would have been remitted to the federation and this is the arrangement that we seek to continue in 2023,\u201d the minister said.\n\n\u201cTherefore it will still be a federation expenditure but will be undertaken by NNPC as a supplier of last resort and we see a situation where maybe there will be coming on stream of new refineries that other marketers will be begin to find the PMS retail market attractive enough to invest in buying fuel themselves and selling to the Nigerian market.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it is important for us to consider this issue of removal of fuel subsidy very seriously, because no marketer is willing to buy PMS after sourcing the foreign exchange and come and sell it at a lower price.\u201d\n\nAhmed said the government\u2019s projected fiscal outcomes in the medium term are presented under two scenarios based on the underlying budget parameters/assumptions, with implications for net accretion to the Federation Account and projected deficit levels.\n\nThe first indicates what she called \u201cthe business-as-usual scenario\u201d, which assumes that the subsidy on PMS, estimated at N6.72 trillion for 2023, will be retained and fully provided for.\n\nThe second, according to her, is \u201cthe reform scenario\u201d, which assumes that petrol subsidy will remain up to mid-2023, based on the 18-month extension announced early 2021, in which case only N3.36 trillion will be provided for.\n\nAdditionally, there will be tighter enforcement of the performance management framework for government-owned enterprises (GOEs) that will significantly increase operating surplus/dividend remittances in 2023.\n\nThe draft 2023-2025 MTEF/FSP has been prepared against the backdrop of continuing global challenges occasioned by lingering COVID-19 pandemic effects, as well as higher food and fuel prices due to the war in Ukraine.\n\nAhmed said that fiscal risks were somewhat elevated, following weaker-than-expected domestic economic performance and structural issues in the domestic economy as revenue generation remained the major fiscal constraint of the federation.\n\nAccording to her, under scenario one, the federal government\u2019s 2023 aggregate expenditure is estimated at N16.98 trillion, which is N337.05 billion (1.9 percent) lower than the 2022 budget, but N20.29 trillion and N22.73 trillion are projected to be spent in 2024 and 2025, respectively.\n\nShe said that given the severely constrained fiscal space, it is not feasible to make any provision for the capital expenditure of ministries, departments and agencies in 2023 beyond multilateral/bilateral loan-funded and donor- funded projects.\n\nAnother scenario shows 2023 aggregate expenditure estimated at N17.99 trillion, N669.82 billion (3.9 percent) higher than 2022, inclusive of GOEs. The sums of N20.29 trillion and N22.73 trillion are projected to be spent by the federal government in 2024 and 2025, respectively.\n\nOn the revenue side, N6.34 trillion has been projected for 2023, out of which only N373.17 billion or 5.9 percent comes from oil-related sources in the first plan. The balance of N5.97 trillion is to be earned from non-oil sources.\n\nThe minister said in addition to subsidy reform, the second scenario assumes an aggressive implementation of cost-to-income limits of GOEs. With these, the 2023 revenue is projected at N8.46 trillion (15.1 percent or N1.51 trillion less than the 2022 budget) but N2.12 trillion more than the earlier.\n\nOf this, N1.99 trillion or 23.6 percent is projected to come from oil-related sources, while the balance is to be earned from non-oil sources.\n\nThe key parameters and other macroeconomic projections driving the medium-term revenue and expenditure framework have been revised in line with the emergent realities because the initial projection is not likely to be achieved based on current trends, according to the minister.\n\nConsequently, the medium-term projections deviate from the projections in the National Development Plan 2021-2025. They have been updated based on a combination of current realities and a modified medium-term outlook.\n\nIn the draft MTEF, the federal government projected an oil benchmark of $70/barrel, oil production of 1.69 million barrels per day and an exchange rate of N435.57/$.\n\nReal GDP growth is projected at 3.75 percent in 2023, from a revised projection of 3.55 percent for 2022. Growth is expected to moderate to 3.30 percent in 2024 before picking up to 3.46 percent in 2025.\n\nThe inflation rate is projected to average 17.16 percent in 2023, up from the revised average of 16.11 percent for 2022.\n\nAccording to Ahmed, investment, especially from foreign sources, is expected to be dragged down by interest rate hikes in advanced economies, foreign exchange management concerns and other domestic challenges, including insecurity.\n\nBen Akabueze, director general, Budget Office, said from January to April, the subsidy payment exceeded the revenue generated by the NNPC.\n\nHe said: \u201cThat is why we consumed all of the revenues and they have been unable to remit anything. And this is because during the period January to April, the average daily production of crude from Nigeria was 1.3million barrels per day, while the budget for 2022 was originally based on 1.86 million barrels per day.\n\n\u201cEarlier in the year when we noticed that there were challenges, that was revised down to 1.6 million barrels but in the January to April period, production was down 300 thousand barrels per day bis-\u00e0-vis budget and that\u2019s because of the oil theft and the vandalization of pipelines in the Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine if we were pumping an additional 300 thousand barrels of crude oil per day, what that would have meant for government revenues during the period. And better still, if we were able to meet our OPEC quota currently approximately 1.8 million barrels. So we are about 500 thousand barrels short of our quota, even though currently the capacity to produce more than our OPEC quota exists. That is a problem that also must be fixed, addressing oil theft and pipeline vandalisation and that\u2019s a job for the security agencies.\u201d",

          "text": "A delegation of United States-based National Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute, said on Friday that the 2023 presidential election may go into rerun with the emergence of Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, and candidate of the New Nigeria People\u2019s Party, Rabiu Kwankwaso,\n\nAccording to them, the 2023 elections would be a departure from some of the political dynamics that defined previous polls in Nigeria.\n\nThe delegation of the NDI/IRI which visited Nigeria from July 13-22 and led by Secretary of State for Ohio, Frank LaRose, stated these while presenting its first joint pre-elections assessment statement to journalists in Abuja.\n\nThe institutes, which described Obi and Kwankwaso as a viable \u201cthird forces\u201d, said their emergence as presidential candidates for the 2023 elections has excited many young Nigerians.\n\nThey said that \u201cif a third party draws sufficient support, a runoff presidential election could be a real possibility for the first time since the transition to democracy, adding complexity to the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nWhile maintaining that the 2023 elections present a significant opportunity to consolidate Nigeria\u2019s democracy, the organisations observed that the 2022 Electoral Act enjoys a wide stakeholder support and has elevated public confidence in the commitment of the Independent National Electoral Commission to deliver democratic elections in 2023.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe 2023 elections are a departure from some of the political dynamics that defined previous polls. For the first time since 2007, the presidential election will be an open contest with no incumbent. The ruling All Progressives Congress selected former Lagos governor, Bola Tinubu, as its flagbearer. Former Vice President and 2019 presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, will contest on the ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cHowever, the emergence of Peter Obi \u2014 former Anambra State governor and presidential candidate for the Labour Party \u2014 and Rabiu Kwankwaso \u2014 former Kano governor and presidential candidate for the New Nigeria People\u2019s Party \u2014 as viable \u201cThird Forces\u201d has excited many young Nigerians. If a third party draws sufficient support, a runoff presidential election could be a real possibility for the first time since the transition to democracy, adding complexity to the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nThe document also said that the 2022 Ekiti and Osun governorship elections, the first elections held since the electoral law was passed, demonstrated the positive impact of initiatives implemented by INEC since 2019 to improve results\u2019 transparency.\n\nSuch measures included the introduction of the INEC Result Viewing Portal and elimination of voting points, and adoption and proper configuration of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System for voter accreditation, which has quickened the voting process and reduced tensions in polling units.\n\n\u201cThe recent surge in voter registration numbers and increased voter turnout in the 2022 Osun polls, especially among young people, point to a renewed interest in political participation among Nigerians. However, there are questions about whether the 2022 Electoral Act will be fully implemented and whether political parties will take advantage of this increased enthusiasm to engage Nigerians on issues that matter to them. There are also questions about whether these new technologies \u2014 IReV and BVAS \u2013 will perform at the same level when scaled up for the national elections\u201d, the organisations said.\n\nThe institutes said, while there had been some positive changes since the 2019 elections, stakeholders with whom its delegation met expressed concern about the direction of the country.\n\nAccording to them, confidence in the government and elections has declined over the past 10 years, \u201cas exemplified by the #EndSARS movement that gained traction in 2020 to protest security forces abuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, insecurity has deepened, spreading to every corner of the country. Extremist and sectarian violence continues to spread, banditry and criminality are endemic, separatist elements are gaining traction, and informal security forces are proliferating.\n\n\u201cThis intensifying violence takes place against the backdrop of increasing religious and regional division permeating the political discourse. If the 2023 polls fail to improve upon past elections, Nigerians may lose faith in the ability of democracy to deliver,\u201d the organisations warned.\n\nThey called on the government to allocate the remaining funding to INEC, saying this would ensure the completion of procurement processes, training, and deployment of necessary staff and materials.\n\nAccording to them, INEC should extend the period for voter registration to capitalise on excitement from the Osun and Ekiti elections and the nomination of final presidential and vice presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cThe courts should be allocated sufficient funding to ensure members of Election Tribunals have the necessary resources for training, transportation, and security.\n\n\u201cINEC and security forces should anticipate and plan for areas where violence may be used to suppress votes/change outcomes. The government should formally address the role that informal security outfits (such as Amotekun and Ebube Agu) may play in the lead up to and during elections.\n\n\u201cThe government should resolve the Academic Staff Union of Universities\u2019 strike. This is critical for security, as young people unable to study could be easily recruited into cults, gangs, or other groups that could contribute to electoral violence\u201d, they added.",

The Government and people of Nasarawa State, as usual, have a great role to play in returning our party to governance in the 2023 elections, in order to create a path for greater socio- economic growth and development. This is not only important for Nigeria alone but also for the West African Sub-Region.\u201d\n\nBuhari, who said Nasarawa remained very dear to his heart, described the State as the symbol of hope and determination in collective efforts to entrench democracy in Nigeria.\n\nHe recounted that during the 2011 general elections, the State stood out as the one that compensated the political efforts in the then Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), defying rigging and ensuring that their voices mattered.\n\n\u2018\u2018To demonstrate this admiration and appreciation to the people of Nasarawa State, I personally attended the inauguration of Governor Tanko Al- Makura on May 29, 2011. In 2015 and 2019, the State remained one of the strongholds of our great party, the APC.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am optimistic that the people of the State, the APC government and this broad representation of your delegation will not disappoint me, as we sustain concerted efforts in pushing forward the frontiers of good governance in our country.\u2019\u2019",

The works will also be available for physical viewing at Hourglass Gallery \u2013 979 Saka Jojo St, Victoria Island 106104, Lagos for the duration of the auction.\n\nThe ARTSPLIT app allows users to own fractions of prominent African artworks, also known as \u201cSplits,\u201d and keep or trade them on the app if they win the \u201cSplit Auction.\u201d The Splits allow multiple people to co-own a single iconic piece of art, which no other art platform allows. Users can also participate in a \u2018Lease Auction\u2019 on the app to win physical custody of these split artworks for a set period.\n\nThe MOCONA auction follows a successful inaugural auction held in May, where Ben Enwonwu\u2019s 1977 artwork \u2018Agbogho Mmuo\u2019 from the Ogolo series was valued at $105,000, as well as ARTSPLIT\u2019s debut at the 59th Venice Biennale, where the platform partnered with The African Art in Venice Forum (AAVF) and the South African pavilion at the 59th Venice Biennale in 2022.\n\nThe complete list of works available at the auction and links to buy splits are as follows: Abiodun Olaku, \u2018The Seeker\u2019 (Portrait of a beggar), 1994; El-Dragg Okwoju, Euphoria, 2022; Duke Asidere, The Death of Honour, 2022; Edosa Ogiugo, Market Day in Dalston, London, 2017; and Oliver Enwonwu, Rite of Passage, 2022.\n\nBy presenting MOCONA, ARTSPLIT intends to raise the profile of these artists further and introduce them to a new set of diverse art collectors and investors, which would ultimately boost the status of both their works and the platform.

          "text": "A federal jury has found former adviser to Donald Trump, Steve Bannon guilty of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol Building.\n\nThe conviction is a victory for the House January 6 select committee as it continues to seek the cooperation of reluctant witnesses in its historic investigation. It is also a victory for the Justice Department, which is under intense scrutiny for its approach to matters related to the January 6 attack, CNN reports.\n\nAfter nearly two days of hearing evidence and witness testimony, the jury reached a unanimous verdict on the two contempt charges in less than three hours.\n\nBannon will be sentenced on October 21. He faces a minimum sentence of 30 days in jail, according to federal law.\n\nBannon\u2019s team did not mount a defence during the trial, and he did not take the stand.\n\nHe was indicted by a federal grand jury in November after he blew off October deadlines for producing the documents and testimony the committee had subpoenaed.\n\nIn demanding his cooperation, the committee had pointed to Bannon\u2019s contacts with Trump in the lead up to the Capitol assault, his presence in the so-called war room of Trump allies at the Willard Hotel in Washington the day before the riot, and a prediction he made on his podcast before the riot that \u201call hell\u201d was going to \u201cbreak loose.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn short, Mr. Bannon appears to have played a multi-faceted role in the events of January 6th, and the American people are entitled to hear his first-hand testimony regarding his actions,\u201d the House committee report recommend a contempt resolution against him said. The House voted to hold Bannon in contempt in October.\n\nBefore the verdict was announced, Bannon entered the courtroom before the jury reassembled in a relatively buoyant mood. He threw his face mask down on the table as soon as he arrived, then sat on his phone for several minutes, a few times showing his lawyer a message.\n\nOnce the jury assembled, and before the verdict was read, he had one hand bracing the table, and glanced at the jurors just a few times, primarily watching the judge. He smiled and smirked some after the verdict was read, and then patted his lawyers on the back.\n\nThe forewoman read the verdict in a soft voice. She wore a green face mask \u2014 and the rest of the jury all kept their masks on as well.\n\nThe jurors answered in unison, \u201cyes,\u201d guilty was their verdict.\n\nThe Prosecutor described it as a simple \u2018A simple case\u2019, saying Bannon is one of two uncooperative witnesses to be charged so far by the Justice Department for contempt of Congress. Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro was indicted by a grand jury last month for not complying with a committee subpoena and has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn its closing argument Friday, the Justice Department told the jury that the case was \u201cnot complicated,\u201d but that it was \u201cimportant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a simple case about a man \u2014 that man \u2014 who didn\u2019t show up,\u201d prosecutor Molly Gaston said. Bannon, she argued, \u201cdid not want to recognize Congress\u2019 authority or play by the government\u2019s rules.\u201d\n\nBannon\u2019s team argued in closing that the jury had reason to doubt the case, while suggesting the government\u2019s key witness was not impartial.\n\n\u201cMr. Bannon was not in a position to testify\u201d for the committee, his attorney Evan Corcoran told the jury, while pointing to statements Trump had made about executive privilege in the House investigation.\n\nWhen the House committee was demanding his cooperation, Bannon\u2019s lawyer claimed that Trump\u2019s stated assertions of executive privilege prevented Bannon from testifying or producing arguments \u2014 an argument the committee roundly rejected. Lawmakers noted that Bannon had for years not been a government official, while pointing to their interest to topic areas not involving conversations with Trump.",

          "text": "The 2023 presidential election may go into rerun with the emergence of Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, and candidate of the New Nigeria People\u2019s Party, Rabiu Kwankwaso, a delegation of United States-based National Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute, said on Friday.\n\nAccording to them, the 2023 elections would be a departure from some of the political dynamics that defined previous polls in Nigeria.\n\nThe delegation of the NDI/IRI which visited Nigeria from July 13-22 and led by Secretary of State for Ohio, Frank LaRose, stated these while presenting its first joint pre-elections assessment statement to journalists in Abuja.\n\nThe institutes, which described Obi and Kwankwaso as a viable \u201cthird forces\u201d, said their emergence as presidential candidates for the 2023 elections has excited many young Nigerians.\n\nThey said that \u201cif a third party draws sufficient support, a runoff presidential election could be a real possibility for the first time since the transition to democracy, adding complexity to the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nWhile maintaining that the 2023 elections present a significant opportunity to consolidate Nigeria\u2019s democracy, the organisations observed that the 2022 Electoral Act enjoys a wide stakeholder support and has elevated public confidence in the commitment of the Independent National Electoral Commission to deliver democratic elections in 2023.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe 2023 elections are a departure from some of the political dynamics that defined previous polls. For the first time since 2007, the presidential election will be an open contest with no incumbent. The ruling All Progressives Congress selected former Lagos governor, Bola Tinubu, as its flagbearer. Former Vice President and 2019 presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, will contest on the ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cHowever, the emergence of Peter Obi \u2014 former Anambra State governor and presidential candidate for the Labour Party \u2014 and Rabiu Kwankwaso \u2014 former Kano governor and presidential candidate for the New Nigeria People\u2019s Party \u2014 as viable \u201cThird Forces\u201d has excited many young Nigerians. If a third party draws sufficient support, a runoff presidential election could be a real possibility for the first time since the transition to democracy, adding complexity to the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nThe document also said that the 2022 Ekiti and Osun governorship elections, the first elections held since the electoral law was passed, demonstrated the positive impact of initiatives implemented by INEC since 2019 to improve results\u2019 transparency.\n\nSuch measures included the introduction of the INEC Result Viewing Portal and elimination of voting points, and adoption and proper configuration of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System for voter accreditation, which has quickened the voting process and reduced tensions in polling units.\n\n\u201cThe recent surge in voter registration numbers and increased voter turnout in the 2022 Osun polls, especially among young people, point to a renewed interest in political participation among Nigerians. However, there are questions about whether the 2022 Electoral Act will be fully implemented and whether political parties will take advantage of this increased enthusiasm to engage Nigerians on issues that matter to them. There are also questions about whether these new technologies \u2014 IReV and BVAS \u2013 will perform at the same level when scaled up for the national elections\u201d, the organisations said.\n\nThe institutes said, while there had been some positive changes since the 2019 elections, stakeholders with whom its delegation met expressed concern about the direction of the country.\n\nAccording to them, confidence in the government and elections has declined over the past 10 years, \u201cas exemplified by the #EndSARS movement that gained traction in 2020 to protest security forces abuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, insecurity has deepened, spreading to every corner of the country. Extremist and sectarian violence continues to spread, banditry and criminality are endemic, separatist elements are gaining traction, and informal security forces are proliferating.\n\n\u201cThis intensifying violence takes place against the backdrop of increasing religious and regional division permeating the political discourse. If the 2023 polls fail to improve upon past elections, Nigerians may lose faith in the ability of democracy to deliver,\u201d the organisations warned.\n\nThey called on the government to allocate the remaining funding to INEC, saying this would ensure the completion of procurement processes, training, and deployment of necessary staff and materials.\n\nAccording to them, INEC should extend the period for voter registration to capitalise on excitement from the Osun and Ekiti elections and the nomination of final presidential and vice presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cThe courts should be allocated sufficient funding to ensure members of Election Tribunals have the necessary resources for training, transportation, and security.\n\n\u201cINEC and security forces should anticipate and plan for areas where violence may be used to suppress votes/change outcomes. The government should formally address the role that informal security outfits (such as Amotekun and Ebube Agu) may play in the lead up to and during elections.\n\n\u201cThe government should resolve the Academic Staff Union of Universities\u2019 strike. This is critical for security, as young people unable to study could be easily recruited into cults, gangs, or other groups that could contribute to electoral violence\u201d, they added.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nManufacturing giant of mining explosives, Nigachem Nigeria Limited, yesterday, organized a capacity building training of over 50 mining companies on use of explosives at their sites this is following issues on safe- mining in the solid minerals sector.\n\nSpeaking on the essence of the \u2018Two-day Technical Training In Explosives Management and Optimization\u2019 , the Founder and Chairman, NIGACHEM Nigeria Limited, Engr Sylvanus Ghasarah, represented by the Executive Director, Administration and Human Resources, Maureen Tiamiyu, explained that the company deed it fit to give back to its customers across the country through capacity building that would cushion effects of high cost of materials via optimization.\n\nGhasarah also noted that the cost of doing business has been over 300 per cent, and there was need to optimize this cost to continue in business.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe know how the inflation rate has gone up. We know the exchange rate, how much is gone up. So the cost of doing business has been over 300 per cent.\n\n\u201cI know that our product has gone up a lot. So for us to give back a little bit to a customer to appreciate their patronage, we have put up this optimization so that even though the cost has gone up, if they can know how to manage the explosives properly, they can manage their costs more efficiently.\n\n\u201cWhat we want is for them to be able to carry out that blast with profits. We don\u2019t want the increase in prices to affect them because sometimes some businesses are closing down. So the aim is for people to be aware. I mean, mining engineers versus the accountants in the organizations versus the owners of the business, everybody needs to come together and put their heads together; the miners need to understand that there is a cost to blasting and the better they can efficiently manage their blasting, the better for the business owners.\n\n\u201cAnd they effect of all the other factors; diesel price has gone up, exchange rate, the effect could be cushioned with optimization basically.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, he added that the training would be taken to other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning. We have started this at this time. We have planned to go to different regions where we have our customer cluster, like I said, is a give back to our customers and our customers all over Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo we will continue to have one programme or another to give back to our customers\u201d, he said.\n\nAlso Executive Director, Sales, Nigachem Nigeria Limited, Engr Bayo Yusuf, described the capacity building workshop as reawakening training for customers.\n\n\u201cBasically, everybody here is not a greenhorn but professionals, and they understand the language, and what we need to do is to just follow up on the product we supply them to make sure they get the best value in the application against the value for their money for using our product\u201d, Yusuf said.\n\nOn the areas lacking among mining companies as customers, he said, \u201cThe emphasis is on security and safety of our products because of global wave of terrorism and insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cExplosive if it gets into wrong hands could do a lot of damage. We have to emphasize that whoever buys our products, we have the technology, capacity, and infrastructure to be able to track and trace whatever takes our material.\n\n\u201cWe say to our customers to safeguard our products, ensure you have proper human reliability of your workers so it doesn\u2019t leak out of your premises. Leakage can hardly happen with us but when it gets to the end-user we don\u2019t have control\u201d, he said.\n\nHe also explained that there was difference between his company\u2019s product called Super Power Explosives or 90 Super Power 80, and it is not an Improvised Explosive Device, IED, rather is for civil works- mining, quarrying and oil and gas exploration\n\nHowever, he called on government to make sure roads across the country are reconstructed, rehabilitated and properly maintained, and if not safety and security of Nigerians cannot be guaranteed.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on the impact of insecurity on the mining sector, the Director, Mines Inspectorate, Ministry of Mining and Steel Development, Engr Frank Odom, said there was need to track and monitor movement from point of manufacture to usage or storage as the case maybe, and stressed the need for companies in the mining sector to copy what Coca-cola Bottling Company, Dangote Company, and others are doing to track their trucks.\n\n\u201cThese trucks carrying mining explosives are not monitored while moving on the roads. It is important putting additional measures to know probably on your phone or tablets you can see when a material leaves from the point it was sold or conveyed from or loaded from or even the sea port and to look at it as making progress to where it will be delivered for usage or storage.\n\nThis will prevent diversion, you can raise alarm over delay on the road by calling nearest security agency, you will know what it is happening to the truck every minute.\n\nHe made it known that there will designated companies specifically for explosives movement of explosives, that would be registered and licensed for that purpose, but not there yet because mechanisms are being put together, and he added that the tracking would be done by the Ministry.\n\n\u201cHowever, when those companies come on stream they would be compelled to do the same because there is no too much monitoring because it is for the same purpose in order for us not to be lost in anything or caught unawares. So that is the main purpose,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the workshop organised by NIGACHEM will boost and improve productivity of miners as far as safe mining and profitability are concerned, which is also the key in capacity building.\n\nOne of the participants at the workshop, Assistant, Manager, Section 9 (1) Manager, Mines Department, Dangote Cement Plc, Obajana Plant, Kogi State, Engr Caleb Aransiola, commended Nigachem for the capacity building and new knowledge acquired as far as optimisation is concerned.\n\nAransiola said Nigachem did not only focused on profit but showed concern to help its customers by giving back to their customers\n\n\u201cDespite two decades of practical experience on the field I still gained a lot from the resource people, who have four decades of experience, especially on the issues we are talking about I\u2019m terms of optimisation\n\n\u201cWhat I am taking back home is to make sure my employer, Dangote Cement Plc, Obajana Plant have more profit and the turnover of the business, improve on the cost analysis and making more because if the company doesn\u2019t make profit we also will be out of job.\n\n\u201cI need to improve more on safe-mining because we basically focus on blasting because blasting is the most technical aspect of mining. I need to avoid misfire which at the end we will record success; no fatality and also maximize cost\u201d, he said.\n\nAccording to him, the company has strong policy on tracking movement, use, storage and management, which no explosives have left the company since exception due to the high technology and discipline put in place to curb ay breaches, but more will be done to improve on what the company has security of explosives and movement.\n\n[7/22, 1:57 PM] Palma Jennifer: \u201cI will prioritize education, engage youths in nation building\u201d- Adebayo\n\nPresidential Candidate of the Social Democratic Party, SDP, Prince Adewole Adebayo has promised to prioritize education and engage youths in leadership roles if elected as President of the country next year.\n\nAdebayo stated this when he played host to the leadership of National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS in Abuja.\n\nWhile promising to represent the interest of the masses and youths through a policy that sustains and guarantees a smooth educational system, Prince Adebayo charged the student body to rise to the defense of the nation\u2019s educational sector.\n\nThe leader of the delegation and national secretary of the National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS, Mr. Salahudeen Lukman said the visit was to interface with Presidential flag bearers of political parties on their agenda for the educational sector.\n\nLukman advocated more fundings for the sector to save it from incessant strikes and urged the federal government to find a lasting solution to the current industrial action embarked upon by he Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU.",

          "text": "By Kayode Abdulazeez\n\nGovernor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Godwin Emefiele on Thursday commissioned a 600 million naira poultry farm project at the University of Ilorin, Kwara State.\n\nSpeaking at the commissioning ceremony the CBN governor, who was represented by Edwin Nzelu, Deputy Director and Secretary to ACGSF, Agricultural credit guarantees scheme fund, said CBN introduced various Intervention Schemes focused on creating decent job, boosting poultry production fostering innovation in the poultry sub-sector and One of such schemes is the Tertiary Institutions Poultry Revival Scheme that was conceptualized specifically for Tertiary Institutions to design and implement viable poultry projects.\n\n\u201cDespite Nigeria being the largest producer of eggs and the second largest producer of chicken meat in Africa, demand gap for eggs and meat stands at and outstrips current supply by 1.2Million Metric Tonnes and 140,000Metric Tonnes for meat and eggs respectively.\n\n\u201cOver the years, this demand gap has driven the smuggling of unhealthy frozen chicken into the country. To close this gap, the Central Bank of Nigeria has introduced various Intervention Schemes focused on boosting poultry production, creating decent jobs, and fostering innovation in the poultry sub-sector. One of such schemes is the Tertiary Institutions Poultry Revival Scheme that was conceptualised specifically for Tertiary Institutions to design and implement viable poultry projects.\n\n\u201cToday we witness the commissioning of the first project to be funded and completed through the Scheme. Certainly, the laudable objectives of the Scheme including improving the revenue of tertiary institutions, employment creation and enhancing research into poultry by tertiary institutions are already being realised\u201d\n\nThe CBN Boss, however, tasked other similar institutions across the country to follow the University of Ilorin example.\n\nIn his speech, the Vice-chancellor of the University of Ilorin, professor Sulyman Age Abdulkareem, spoke on how the journey to the realization of the project began and extol the significance of the project in the history of the University.\n\n\u201cThe journey has been long and hard for us as a University. The university took a 600 million naira loan from the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, at a concessionary interest rate of 9% (5% for the first year) and a repayment period of 6 years, with a moratorium on the repayment of the principal for one year. Zenith Bank plc is the participating financial institution on the project.\n\n\u201cAccessing the loan required the University to set up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the project. The SPV is Unilorin Bizface synergy Limited, a limited liability company registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission.\n\n\u201cTo guarantee the loan, the University worked out an irrevocable standing payment (ISPO) with Zenith Bank plc, ensuring Zenith Bank was paid quarterly the amount due, according to the amortization\u201d, he said.\n\nThe project which is placed on 30 hectares started in February in the year 2022 and was commissioned on 21st July.\n\nThe VC, noted that \u201cthe farm has 6 fully built Broilers\u2019 pens with a capacity, of 5,000 birds each and another two of similar capacity, under construction to raise the total installed capacity to 40,000 Broilers, four fully built layers pens currently housing 17,000 layers, though with an installed capacity of 33,000, a Feed mill with an installed capacity of 5tons/hours, a semi-automated Broiler processing unit (BPU) with a capacity to process 1,000 birds/day and a manure processing unit.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn job creation, at the height of construction, the site had over 200 artisans earning their daily sustenance from it. Today the farm has 55 full time employees and has created space for students of the hosting institution to work on part time basis\u201d, he further stated.\n\nHe dded that the University is also developing 2,000 hectares of land for Maize and Soya beans cultivation for the exclusive use of the poultry farm\n\nThe vice-chancellor however lauded the project and thanked the steering committee led by the deputy vice-chancellor, research, technology and innovation Professor Mikhail Olayinka Buhari for the efforts put in place to make the project reality and subsequent overseeing of the project.",

          "text": "\u2026 Says Bayelsa Airport Is Not Downgraded\n\nBy Eunice Nnachi, Yenagoa\n\nThe Bayelsa State Government has made a clarification that the state-owned international airport had not been downgraded, as being insinuated in some quarters.\n\nHe said the absence of scheduled flights to and from the Bayelsa International Airport for a couple of weeks now was not the making or fault of the state government, but has to do with some technical issues with the two airline operators.\n\nThe Deputy Governor, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, gave the clarification on Wednesday when the Federated Correspondents Chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, Bayelsa State Council, paid him a courtesy call in Government House, Yenagoa.\n\nSenator Ewhrudjakpo explained that two airlines, Ibom-Air and United Nigeria Airlines, were carrying out what he called D-Check on their aircraft, which had also affected their flight operations from their primary routes.\n\nAccording to the Deputy Governor, the D-Check is a major maintenance check to determine the air-worthiness of an aircraft after it had made commercial flights for a period of 10 years.\n\nHe pointed out that the state government was in touch with the management teams of both airlines, giving the assurance that normal flight operations would resume at the airport before the end of the month.\n\nHis words: \u201cI can assure you that the Governor Diri-led Administration is very much on course. I know that you are going to ask us what is happening to the Bayelsa International Airport.\n\n\u201cThere are a few issues, but they are not really our issues as a government per se. We are aware some persons are pushing the news that the airport has been downgraded. That is not true. The Bayelsa Airport has not been downgraded.\n\n\u201cWhat happened is that the two airlines working with us have gone for D-Check. The D-Check means a plane going for a major maintenance check after it had been put to flight operations for 10 years to determine its airworthiness.\n\n\u201cIf you watch very well, even flights in their regular or primary routes, like the Port Harcourt to Abuja route, have now been reduced to only one daily flight.\u201d\n\nSenator Ewhrudjakpo, who noted that government was doing its best to change the general impression of leadership in the state, said the administration had taken proactive steps to checkmate the impact of the forecast impending large flood.\n\nHe called on the Federated Correspondents Chapel to help push out the good things government was doing in Bayelsa, noting that the Prosperity Administration was not resting on its oars in all sectors ranging from agriculture, sports, health to security.\n\nSenator Ewhrudjakpo, thanked the media for their support to the present administration right from its inception to date and assured the Chapel that government would support their annual lecture slated for November this year.\n\nThe Deputy Governor, however, observed that the standard of journalistic practice was in a steady decline in Nigeria, and therefore, called on the Correspondents Chapel and its parent body, the Nigeria Union of Journalists, to raise the bar.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the state Chairman of the Federated Correspondents Chapel, NUJ, Mr. Tife Owolabi, said the visit was meant to formally introduce the newly elected executive members of the Chapel to the Deputy Governor.\n\nMr. Owolabi, who poured encomiums on the Deputy Governor for being media friendly, prayed the state\u2019s government to carry the correspondents chapel along in its programmes and events, even as he appealed for support towards their annual lecture programme.",

          "title": "University Strikes: More Trouble As NASU, SSANU Reject Briggs Committee Report",
          "text": "The crisis in the nation\u2019s public university system has taken a new twist as members of the Senior Staff Association of Universities (SSANU) and the Non-Academic Staff Union of Universities (NASU) rejected the report of the Professor Nimi Briggs-led renegotiation committee.\n\nBoth unions insisted that they would not be bound by the recommendations of the committee which was set up by the Federal Government to end all strikes across the nation\u2019s universities.\n\nNASU General Secretary, Peters Adeyemi, and SSANU National President, Mohammed Ibrahim, made the position of the unions known on Friday at a joint press conference in Abuja.\n\nThey said they never concluded negotiations with the committee before it submitted its recommendations to the government for implementation, stressing that such an action was a betrayal.\n\nIn a bid to resolve the crisis in the university sector, the Federal Government in March constituted a committee headed by Professor Briggs to negotiate with NASU and SSANU, as well as the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).\n\nASUU had grounded academic activities in public universities since February 14 when the lecturers embarked on strike, a situation that became complicated when NASU and SSANU also downed tools in April.\n\nRead the full text of the press conference by the Joint Action Committee (JAC) of NASU and SSANU below:\n\nThis address is coming on the heels of the recent revelations and development arising from the ongoing national strike embarked upon by the various university-based unions. The revelations leave a sour taste in the mouth and given the incendiary and combustible excitement and tensions which the developments have generated amongst our members, we feel compelled to make our position known on the status of our negotiations with the Federal Government on the ongoing industrial action.\n\nYou would recall that the Presidency convened a meeting on Thursday, 12\u2033 May, 2022 tagged \u201ctripartite plus\u201d where certain resolutions were reached on the following salient issues:\n\nRenegotiation of the FGN/2009 Agreements signed with the University-Based Unions; and\n\nIntegrity tests for the proposed payment platforms from ASUU, the JAC of NASU and SSANU and the existing platform of IPPIS by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA).\n\nIt is expedient at this point, to report to the public what has transpired in respect of these two issues and the resolutions of the JAC of NASU and SSANU arising therefrom.\n\nTHE RENEGOTIATIONS OF THE FGN 2009 AGREEMENTS WITH NASU AND SSANU\n\nIn line with the terms of the Agreements reached with the two unions, the Year 2009 Agreements were supposed to have been reviewed after three years. Following agitations and industrial actions demanding a review of the agreements, it was only until 2018 that the Federal Government set up the Dr Wale Babalakin (SAN) Committee to negotiate with the unions with a view to reviewing the agreements. The Babalakin Committee took off and was meeting with the various university to be very unfortunate and a betrayal of confidence by the Committee. While it may be easy to dismiss this information as a mere rumour, our belief is confirmed by the fact that a report was truly submitted to the Federal Government.\n\nThe Honourable Minister of Labour and Employment in his various statements had exposed the fact that a report had been prepared and presented to the Federal Government by the Briggs Committee. The Committee which had clear Terms of Reference to renegotiate with the University-Based Unions, chose to solely review the salary and submit its report on the strength of its conclusion, surreptitiously allocating a salary increment to the two Unions even without having a single discussion on the issue with them. This is tantamount to shaving a man\u2019s head behind his back. This is an utmost breach of faith and infringement of collective bargaining processes.\n\nOn the recent directive by the President to the Honourable Minister of Education to take over negotiations with the aggrieved Unions, we wish to point out that this is a welcome development, hoping that the Federal Ministry of Education will correct the anomalies.\n\nWhile we place on record, our appreciation and commendation to the Honourable Minister of Labour and Employment and his team, for always filling the gap and making efforts to intercept industrial disputes, it should also be placed on record that the Federal Ministry of Education had in the past absented itself from such meetings leading to poor follow-up action on the various Memoranda of Agreements signed.\n\nThese absences of our employers have been a major albatross to all Memoranda of Action or Agreements as the case may be. It is to the commendation of the current Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Education, that since he assumed that office, the Ministry has been markedly more responsive to matters affecting the Unions.\n\nLet it be stated clearly, that SSANU and NASU reject any salary recommendation that would cause further disparity in the University system. There is an already existing disparity in the system which we had always closed our eyes to. To further expand that disparity would be an invitation to the greatest level of anarchy and industrial unrest ever witnessed in the University system.\n\nINTEGRITY TESTS FOR THE VARIOUS PAYMENT PLATFORMS\n\nWe commend the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) for the painstaking labour in undertaking the assignments so far. The deliberations at NITDA on the test cases of the three-payment platform-IPPIS, UTAS and U3PS-based Unions concurrently. The meetings with the Babalakin Committee were exhaustive and deliberations were robust in terms of what real negotiations should be.\n\nThe Unions, NASU and SSANU had made significant progress with respect to the issues being negotiated before the life of the Babalakin Committee was cut short in 2020. Following the disbandment of the Babalakin-led Committee, the Federal Government reconstituted the Committee this time around, led by Professor Munzaili Jibril.\n\nThe Munzali Jibril Committee commenced its assignment in 2020 and for over one year that the Committee sat, it never invited the Non-Teaching Unions for any meeting. Unlike the Babalakin Committee which had meetings with the four University based Unions concurrently, the Munzali Jibril Committee, upon our enquiry, maintained that their modus operandi was to conclude negotiations with one union and move on to another.\n\nUntil the Committee was again disbanded, it never had meetings with the NASU or SSANU negotiation teams. After the disbandment of the Munzali Committee, another Committee under the leadership of Professor Nimi Briggs was constituted in March 2022. The Briggs Committee was given three months to conclude its negotiations with the University based unions which would effectively mean that its assignment ought to have ended by June 2022.\n\nFollowing the inauguration of the Committee, so far, the two Unions of NASU and SSANU had only two meetings with the Committee. After the first meeting, the two Unions of NASU and SSANU independently was compelled to create the impression that the Committee appeared not to have had its mandates clearly spelt out by the Government.\n\nIt needs to be pointed out that at the two meetings held with the Briggs Committee by both Unions, there were no deliberations on salary increment and allowances. While the NASU and SSANU teams had presented a Memorandum of Demands that included a proposal for salary review along with appropriate salary tables, the Committee had pleaded that the two unions should take the issue of review of salaries and allowances last, because they were still interfacing with the relevant government agencies to give them appropriate offers to counter our proposals on salary review.\n\nIt is therefore shocking, to say the least, that while we have not even commenced discussions on salary review and other allowances, we received reports that the committee had gone ahead to submit a report to the Federal Government recommending a ten per cent (10%) increase for Non-Teaching Unions. This we find to have been transparent and open so far. We urge NITDA to accelerate the results processing and come up with its findings in order to lay to rest the contentious issues of a viable and enduring payment platform best suited for the Nigerian University system.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nLadies and gentlemen, today marks the 117\u2033 day of our national strike. It needs to be reiterated that it has never been the desire of NASU and SSANU to ground the system. We have however been compelled by the shabby treatment that we as workers have received in the University system.\n\nAs of today, out of the eight issues that led to the strike, none of them has been conclusively addressed by Government. Arrears of Consequential Adjustments on Minimum Wage have only been partially paid, as in many Universities, we still have many members who have not been paid, while the Federal Universities of Agriculture have been totally left out.\n\nNo Arrears of Earned Allowances has been paid. White Papers on Visitation Panels have not been released. Staff School teachers continue to languish despite a Court judgment in their favour. Our jobs continue to be usurped by Vice-Chancellors as jobs for the boys and allocated to Academic Staff. State Universities have been badly hit by poor funding, poor governance and non-payment of salaries to workers spanning months.\n\nAs JAC of NASU and SSANU, we are determined to change the status quo. We remain undaunted and undeterred in the face of our salaries that have been stopped and threats issued to the Unions from various quarters.

Her firm also sent out a disclaimer that Ogunde\u2019s letter was sent out without their authority.\n\nBy a letter dated July 19, the NBA wrote a petition against Ogunde recommending that she be required to answer for the allegations of professional misconduct.\n\nThe NBA President swiftly followed up on Friday with a call for Olanipekun to step aside to allow for due process and for the LPDC to carry out its duties without the BOB chairman coming under undue suspicion of impartiality.\n\nWhen contacted for his reaction to the letter, Olanipekun told Channels Television that he was on holiday outside the country and had not seen the letter or received it.\n\nRead the full letter by the NBA President below:",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Debt Service Hits N1.94trn, Overwhelms Revenue by N310bn",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed on Thursday sounded the alarm bells as she revealed that the country\u2019s debt service cost in the first quarter (Q1) 2022 was N1.94 trillion, N310 billion higher than the actual revenue received during the period.\n\nAlso, Ahmed projected a total of N6.72 trillion as full-year budget for petrol subsidy payment in 2023, if the country decides to continue with the policy that had been identified as a drain on the economy.\n\nIt also emerged on Thursday that the federal government spent more to service debt in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, than the actual revenue it earned during the same period.\n\nThe Minister of Finance disclosed these when she unveiled the Medium Expenditure and Fiscal Strategy Paper (MTEF-FSP) in Abuja.\n\nWith debt service cost outstripping the country\u2019s revenue, it is a clear indication of dangers ahead and policymakers must be more than willing to implement the much-needed reforms to save the economy.\n\nThe minister explained: \u201cThe aggregate expenditure for 2022 is estimated at N17.32 trillion, with a pro rata spending target of N5.77 trillion at the end of April.\n\n\u201cThe actual spending as of April 30th was N4.72 trillion. Of this amount, N1.94 trillion was for debt service, and N1.26 trillion was for personnel costs, including pensions.\n\n\u201cAs at April, N773.63 billion had been spent on capital expenditure. As of April 2022, FGN\u2019s retained revenue was only N1.63 trillion, 49 per cent of the pro rata target of N3.32 trillion.\u201d\n\nShe affirmed that the federal government\u2019s share of oil revenue was N285.38 billion, representing 39 per cent performance while non-oil tax revenues totalled N632.56 billion \u2014 a performance of 84 per cent.\n\nAhmed also projected that should subsidy end in June 2023, based on the federal government\u2019s earlier timeline, the sum of N3.36 trillion would be required to meet the financial obligations associated with subsidising the product.\n\nThe government explained that the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, which on Tuesday officially transitioned into a fully commercial entity, would bear the cost of subsidy on petrol for the first six months of the year.\n\nAhmed noted the government was projecting fiscal outcomes in the medium term under two scenarios based on the underlying budget parameters/assumptions.\n\nAhmed explained that under the first scenario, which she described as, \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d assumes that the subsidy on premium motor spirit (PMS) estimated at N6.72 trillion for the full year 2023 would remain and be fully provided for.\n\nAccording to her, the second scenario was that, \u201cpetrol subsidy will remain up to mid-2023 based on the 18-month extension announced early 2021, in which case only N3.36 trillion will be provided for.\u201d\n\nThe minister stated that both scenarios have implications for net accretion to the Federation Account and projected deficit levels.\n\nOn the import of NNPC\u2019s transition to a limited liability company, she explained that the company would no longer be contributing to the monthly Federation Account, but would take care of subsidy for the first six months of 2023.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe new arrangement has indicated that NNPC will not be contributing monthly to the Federation Account as they used to in the past. But NNPC will be paying royalties, dividends and taxes. So, while the revenue might not be monthly, we will work on an arrangement on how this will be paid. And it is possible to work out an arrangement where the payments could be monthly or quarterly.\n\n\u201cNNPC has been paying for subsidy, but they are doing it on behalf of the federation, on the cost of the federation, even though they are the ones that have been paying.\n\n\u201cSo, when they generate revenue, instead of remitting the revenue they are using part of the revenue or all of them to fund the subsidy. That has been the arrangement and that is what will continue to be in place until we exit the first time scenario one.\n\n\u201cSo I was just saying that a new arrangement regime, NNPC will not be contributing to FAAC (Federation Account Allocation Committee) on a monthly basis, but NNPC will still be paying taxes, royalties and dividends.\n\n\u201cWe will be engaging the NNPC on how we expect this to come. We can negotiate how these remittances will be done on a quarterly basis for example. But let me also say that prior to the NNPC transiting, for about eight months, we have not been receiving any revenues.\u201d\n\nHowever, the minister expressed hope that the emergence of new refineries would fully lay to rest the issue of subsidy.\n\nProviding further details of the 2023-2025 MTEF-FSP, Ahmed noted that the projections deviated from the projections in the National Development Plan (NDP) 2021-2025., adding that they have been updated based on a combination of current realities and a modified medium term outlook.\n\nShe said: \u201cIn the MTEF, real GDP growth is projected at 3.75 per cent in 2023, from a revised projection of 3.55 per cent for 2022. Growth is expected to moderate to 3.30 per cent in 2024 before picking up to 3.46 per cent in 2025.\n\n\u201cThe inflation rate is projected to average 17.16 per cent in 2023, up from the revised average of 16.11 per cent for 2022.\n\n\u201cUpward pressure on prices is expected to be driven by the current and lag effect of the global price surge due to the Russia-Ukraine war, domestic insecurity, rising costs of imports, exchange rate depreciation, as well as other supply-side constraints.\u201d\n\nProviding further insight into the MTEF-FSP, the minister disclosed that the aggregate expenditure for 2023 were predicated on two scenarios of N17.99 trillion and N16.98 trillion.\n\nThe first scenario of N17.99 trillion projected for 2023, which is N669.82 billion or 3.9 per cent higher than the 2022 budget of N17.32 trillion (Inclusive of Government Owned Enterprises) is based on the non-provision for ministries, departments and agencies\u2019 capital expenditure beyond multilateral/bilateral loan- funded and project-funded projects.\n\n\u201cIn this scenario, given the severely constrained fiscal space, it is not feasible to make any provision for MDAs\u2019 capital expenditure in 2023 beyond multilateral/bilateral loan- funded and project-funded projects. The FGN\u2019s 2023 aggregate expenditure is estimated at N16.98 trillion, which is N337.05 billion (1.9%) lower than the 2022 budget,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the second scenario, Ahmed said: \u201cThe FGN\u2019s 2023 aggregate expenditure is estimated at N17.99 trillion, N699.82 billion (3.9%) higher than 2022 (Inclusive of GOEs). The sums of N20.29 trillion and N22.73 trillion are projected to be spent by the FGN in 2024 and 2025 respectively.\u201d\n\nOil price benchmark for 2023 was predicated on $70, $66 and $62 per barrel in 2023, 2024 and 2025 respectively\n\nOil production is also based on 1.69 million, 1.83 million and 1.83 million barrels per day in 2023, 2024 and 2025 respectively.\n\nThe projected exchange rate for 2023 was pegged at N435/$ as against N410.15 in 2022.\n\nOf the projected revenue of N6.34 trillion revenues in 2023, only N373.17 billion or 5.9 per cent is coming from oil-related sources while the balance of N5.97 trillion is to be earned from non-oil sources.\n\nResponding to questions on subsidy, the Minister of State, Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mr. Clem Agba said the federal government subsidies PMS to the tune of between N600-N700 per litre, adding that this should not be allowed to continue.\n\nAgba said if the trend was allowed to continue full stream till the end of next year, nothing would be left for capital expenditure.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is still a huge subsidy because the cost of production of PMS is in the neighborhood of about 600 to 700 naira per litre. Right now, Nigeria is the only country in the world that is selling at about N165 or N200.\n\n\u201cIf you call your friends or brothers in the States or in Europe or in other African countries, you will know that PMS is currently being sold at a range of between N800 to N1000 per litre.\n\n\u201cI think that the time to remove the subsidy was yesterday. We are only eating away our future and that is what some people call a consumption economy. Finally, it is difficult to understand a situation where citizens say that they want an omelette and then when the government wants to break eggs so that they can produce, they say don\u2019t break the eggs.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a decision that Nigerians will have to take because if you look at scenario one, it means that we will not have any capital expenditure in 2023. Simple.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be no capital expenditure at all, and taking care of recurrent expenditure will be a huge challenge.\u201d\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja",

          "text": "Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Thursday, granted permission to a civil group, Incorporated Trustees of Center for Reform and Public Advocacy, to apply for an order of mandamus, compelling the Inspector General of Police, Alkali Baba, to prosecute the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, over alleged perjury.\n\nThe permission followed an ex-parte application argued by the group through its lawyer, Mr Ugo Nwofor.\n\nThe group had petitioned the police over alleged act of perjury by the former governor of Lagos State but, since its letter was received by the defendants some weeks back, he has yet to carry out its duty of investigating and prosecuting reported crime as in the Tinubu case.\n\nThe court, in a ruling, held that the ex-parte application was meritorious and subsequently granted it, fixing November 1, for hearing of the substantive suit.\n\nThe main suit, dated and filed on July 4 by the group, has the Nigerian Police Force and the Inspector General of Police as 1st and 2nd respondents, respectfully.\n\nAccording to the NGO, the legal action against the police was necessitated by IGP\u2019s refusal to take action on its petition against Tinubu over an offence it claimed the presidential candidate was indicted for by the Lagos State House of Assembly in 1999.\n\nThe applicant in its petition to the IG, claimed that Tinubu lied on oath in his form CF 001 he submitted to INEC in aid of his qualification for the governorship election in Lagos State in 1999.\n\nApplicant further claimed that, Tinubu \u201cforged all the educational certificates he listed in his INEC Form CF 001, which he admitted he did not posses in annexure C.\n\n\u201cFor purpose of clarity, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu in the said INEC Form deposed to on oath that he attended Government College, Ibadan and University of Chicago, USA, when in actual fact he did not.\n\n\u201cOn the strength of the above, we respectfully demand that you initiate the criminal proceedings of Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu consequent upon the express findings of the Lagos State House of Assembly as captured above.\u201d\n\nThe order to investigate Tinubu is seen as a huge blow to the APC presidential candidate, who is facing several allegations of perjury, which meant he made false declaration under oath.

          "title": "In the Aftermath of Osun Poll, Wike, Ortom, Makinde Agree Not to Leave PDP",
          "text": "Convinced that the prospects of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), might have improved up after it won the governorship election in Osun State, last weekend, the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has said his colleagues in Rivers and Oyo states, Nyesom Wike and Seyi Makinde, as well as himself, have agreed to remain in the party.\n\nSome governors and chieftains of the party loyal to Wike, had been engaged in cold war with the leadership of the party, after Wike was denied the vice-presidential position in spite of committee\u2019s recommendation, weeks after losing the presidential ticket to former Vice-President, Atiku Abubakar.\n\nOrtom, while featuring on ARISE News Channel on Thursday, revealed that the trio had, decided against leaving PDP, but insisted that there was a need for the leadership of the party and Atiku to pacify Wike.\n\nHe further clarified that Wike, Makinde and himself did not attend the PDP mega rally in Osun, because they were out of the country and not because they were contemplating leaving the party.\n\nOrtom noted that what happened in the Osun State governorship election, won by candidate of the PDP, Senator Ademola Adeleke, was what would happen in the 2023 elections.\n\nThe Benue governor, who also hinted that Atiku reached out to him speak to Wike in collective interest, stressed that Nigerians were fed up with excuses over security, economy and their social life that could have added value to humanity.\n\nHis words: \u201cComing to why some of us were absent, I was not around, I travelled. This was a programme that was planned over three months ago. I had to go to the United Kingdom, I had to go to the United States of America.\n\n\u201cI actually met with Governor Wike in London and met with my brother, the Governor of Oyo State, Makinde, and the Governor of Abia state. That provided an opportunity to brainstorm on what was happening back home in our party, the PDP especially.\n\n\u201cOne thing I want to assure you and Nigerians is that we are not going to defect to any political party; we\u2019re members of PDP. Wike in particular, has been very instrumental to the growth of our party in the absence of any former president produced by our great party.\n\n\u201cPresident Olusegun Obasanjo was produced by this party, you are aware that President Goodluck Jonathan also have issues and he decided not to get involved with what is happening in the party.\n\n\u201cSo, Wike was the anchorman. We discussed this matter in our meeting in London and we all agreed we are not leaving the party. But let there be due process and the need to ensure that everybody is carried along.\n\n\u201cYou are aware that since the emergence of PDP in Nigeria, Wike has been there, even some of us, because of the injustice meted out to us in 2016, we left for APC, until when APC started dancing in the wrong direction, we left back to PDP. And who was instrumental to me coming back, it was Wike.\n\n\u201cOur presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar too, at a point including our National Chairman today, we left for other parties, but Wike remained in this party. So, it is a big factor. I have always said that power belongs to God. Wike contested, some of us believed in southern presidency and Wike we thought he was the right person to get the ticket, he did not get\n\n\u201cThe issue of vice-president comes, I want to tell you that I was one of the people that was able to convince Wike that half a loaf is better than none, you wanted to be president but, God did not make it possible. There is nothing wrong in asking to be the vice-president. Unfortunately, this did not work. I have explained what transpired the last time,\u201d he explained.\n\nOrtom insisted that the leadership of the party needed to do the needful by reaching out to Wike immediately to pacify him, adding that there was a need for everybody to come together to rescue the country.\n\n\u201cWe are still members of PDP; we are working together and we look forward that the leadership will do the needful to bring all of us together. Our presidential candidate has reached out to me to also further persuade Governor Wike that he\u2019s coming to see him. They will sit down together and discuss. For me, that is the end of it.\n\n\u201cI took my time, because at a time, I was not very clear about the happenings and I went into hibernation, but I am out now. And my decision is that, let our presidential candidate discuss with Wike and once there is an agreement on what to do to move forward, we can work on that.\n\n\u201cBecause I don\u2019t like betraying people, Wike stood with me at my worst time in the history of my life, when my state was under siege. He did everything including financial support to help the internally displaced people, who have been suffering. Visited with a team of stakeholders from Rivers State.\n\n\u201cThe Bible says if somebody does something to you that is good, don\u2019t reward him with evil, if you do that, evil will never depart from your house. I\u2019m a student of the Bible; I\u2019m a Christian and I don\u2019t want God to hold me responsible for being irresponsible,\u201d he said.\n\nOrtom was of the opinion that working together with Wike, the main opposition party, would achieve a better result.\n\nHe said, \u201cI believe our presidential candidate will work with Wike, once they discuss, he\u2019s pacified, I will be pacified. I may not be speaking for my other colleagues whom we are working together. But in our meeting, we agreed that our brother, Governor Wike needed to be pacified and once that is done, all of us will team up together.\n\n\u201cNow, we don\u2019t know where we are. We have been dropped from top to bottom. My worry is not just being at the bottom, we are going beneath the bottom. So, we need everybody to come together to see how we can rescue our country, Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAddressing issues of salaries and pensions, he said: \u201cWhen I came in, I inherited arrears of pensions and salaries of over N70 billion, but I have depleted that to 30 billion naira now from 2015 to date. On salaries, the challenge is not only with my state, more than 20 states are finding it difficult to pay salaries as it stands now, and this is as a result of poor allocation from the federation account due to non-remittance from the NNPC.\u201d\n\nChuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Numeh Ekeghe in Lagos",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal government has pleaded with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) to cancel its planned protest over the prolonged strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and other university-based unions scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday next week.\n\nIt also urged the organised labour not to mobilise support for Labour Party as it would amount to a violation of the Trade Union Act.\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige made the appeal Thursday, during a meeting with the leadership of NLC in his office.\n\nThe Minister said he incorporated NLC into the tripartite conciliation going on in his Ministry, adding that being very much aware of efforts of the government to resolve the impasse, they cannot embark on any rally or protest.\n\nA statement issued by the Head, Press and Public Relations, Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, Olajide Oshundun, quoted Ngige as having told the labour leaders that the Federal Executive Council (FEC) mandated him to notify them of the serious security implications of the planned protest.\n\nAccording to Ngige, a security report also sent to his office by the Department of State Services (DSS), had strongly warned against holding the protest, slated for July 26 and 27.\n\nHe urged the NLC\u2019s National Executive Council (NEC) to reconsider the planned rally, saying hoodlums might take advantage of it to cause breach of security.\n\nNgige also expressed the concern of the government that politicians might hijack the rally to wreak havoc in the country.\n\nFurthermore, Ngige told NLC not go ahead with plans to campaign for the Labour Party in the 2023 General election.\n\n\u201cI heard when you said you are mobilising for Labour Party. But, a trade union is not a political party. Look at the Trade Union Act. It does not allow trade unions to use their contributions to support any political party,\u201d he said\n\nThe minister further said that, \u201cthe masses might wrongly interpret the rally as a ploy by the NLC to enhance the chances of the Labour Party (LP) Presidential candidate, a situation which could spur the supporters of the other political parties into violence.\n\n\u201cSection 40 of the constitution is clear on Freedom of Association. One of the provisions is that people of like minds can organise themselves and form a political party. There is also a provision that people in work or employment can organise themselves into unions. They are two parallels. Parallels don\u2019t meet.\u201d\n\nHowever, the NLC rejected the plea by the federal government, insisting that the two-day national protest would go ahead as planned.\n\nBoth the Deputy President of NLC, Mr. Najeem Usman and General Secretary, Mr. Emmanuel Ugboajah who led the NLC team to the meeting, however assured the government of a peaceful protest by the Congress, saying, \u201cinfiltrators would not be allowed to participate in the protest.\u201d\n\nUgboajah said the NLC appreciates all the efforts of Ngige towards the resolution of the industrial actions in the university system and urged him not to hands off the conciliation.\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",
          "summary": "It also urged the organised labour not to mobilise support for Labour Party as it would amount to a violation of the Trade Union Act.\nFurthermore, Ngige told NLC not go ahead with plans to campaign for the Labour Party in the 2023 General election.\n\u201cI heard when you said you are mobilising for Labour Party.\nBut, a trade union is not a political party.\nOne of the provisions is that people of like minds can organise themselves and form a political party.",

          "text": "Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has vowed that a former governor of the state and the immediate past Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi as well as the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate for the state, Tonye Cole must face court trial over alleged looting of state\u2019s assets.\n\nThe governor who said Rivers people had resolved to resist individuals who had looted assets of the state from presiding over them as governor, insisted on prosecuting any individual or organisation identified as taking part in looting the treasury of the state.\n\nWike said this on Thursday, shortly after signing the contract for the construction of the 11th and 12th flyover bridges and the dualisation of Azikiwe Street- Illoabuchi Road in Port Harcourt. The contract was signed between the State government and Julius Berger Nigeria Plc at Port Harcourt.\n\nWike said he was determined to safeguard the state from those who are only interested in looting the commonwealth of Rivers people.\n\n\u201cThey can run helter-skelter to stop their arraignment, but they must be arraigned and tried. What Rivers people will hear, Rivers people will be shocked to know what the former governor of the State and Minister did in this state with his partner, Tonye Cole.\n\n\u201cIf they (Ameachi and Cole) like, let them bring 500 Senior Advocates of Nigeria, they will face the trial. So that Nigerians will hear, Rivers people will see how this state was looted\n\n\u201cAnybody can be governor, but not those we have identified that have looted the state treasure. If we can do 12 flyovers from 2019 to now with the little amount of money we are getting, imagine what the previous administration would have done.\n\n\u201cIf the previous administration that had a lot of money had done them, we would have concentrated on other things. But we are still working within the city to change its landscape.\u201d\n\nThe Rivers State governor said alleged looters were desperate to cover their track, maintaining that Rivers people would not allow such persons who do not have the interest of the state to take over its affairs.\n\nWike explained that genuine lovers of the state should be the ones presenting themselves to serve the state as governor not looters.\n\nHe said his style of politics and governance was clearly different from other politicians who take the people for granted and hardly fulfil promises they make.\n\nWike maintained that the good of Rivers people and the state remained the priority of his administration, \u201cwhich is why more projects are still awarded as we prepare to leave office on 29th May 2023.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, we are very proud that this administration has kept all the promises made to the people. So, it gives us joy. Some people would have said why not go with the money.\n\n\u201cBut I asked, how much money can you make? What can you amass as against the interest of the people? So for us, we are very happy and anybody who is working with this administration can carry his shoulder high that we have made a difference as far as governance is concerned.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, governor Wike said payment for some of the ongoing projects had almost been completed.\n\n\u201cWe have finished paying for the first phase of the Trans-Kalabari Road; we have finished paying for the dualisation of Bori to Kono Road; we have finished paying for the Ada George- Rumuepirikom flyover; we have almost finished paying for the first phase of Ahoada Road.\u201d\n\nWike told the construction company, Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, that excuses would not be tolerated from them because 80 per cent of the contract sum had been released to the company with the monthly N2 billion irrevocable standing order of payment.\n\nThe governor also commended leaders of the state for the immerse support that they had given to his administration to succeed.\n\nIn his speech, Managing Director of Julius Berger, Dr. Lars Richter, said the contract they signed with the Rivers State government was for two new flyover bridges that would be completed in 10 months and the dualisation of Azikiwe Street- llloabuchi Road in six months.\n\nBlessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt",
