          "title": "Uba plans appeal of disqualification as APC candidate over illegal primary",
          "text": "The Media Director, Senator Andy Uba Governorship Organisation, Dr. Ikechukwu Onyia, has said that Senator Andy Uba and his party, the All Progressives Congress will appeal the judgment of Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court that nullified it\u2019s candidate\u2019s nomination as the candidate of APC for the November 6, 2021, Anambra governorship election.\n\nOnyia also accused the All Progressives Grand Alliance in Anambra, of doing everything possible to derail Uba\u2019s attempt to upturn the governorship election result at the election petitions tribunal.\n\nHe made these remarks in a press release on Monday.\n\nOnyia said, \u201cWe are not surprised that APGA members are celebrating the Justice Ekwo judgment like a child that received Christmas clothes from his father. They believe that the judgment will stop Andy Uba from proving his petition at the tribunal. The good thing is that this is not the last court in this instance. We are heading to the Appeal Court to prove them wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, urge the APGA-led government of Anambra State to keep herself busy with challenges facing the state rather than investing in \u2018Operation Stop Andy Uba\u2019 dance.\u201d\n\nHe urged the APC supporters to remain calm.\n\nHowever, the APGA Coordinator on Media Affairs, Mr Chinedu Obigwe, in his reaction, described the APC\u2019s comments as \u201cempty and baseless\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cIs APGA INEC or the court that has nullified their candidate\u2019s validity? This is to tell you that these people don\u2019t know what they are doing. Just ignore them.\u201d\n\nThe court had nullified the APC governorship primary in Anambra State, insisting that Uba\u2019s emergence as winner was illegal.\n\nJustice Ekwo therefore stated that Uba\u2019s participation in the November 6 governorship election was void.\n\nThe judge added that the plaintiff, George Moghalu, succeeded in proving that the APC did not conduct a valid primary election from which Uba claimed to have emerged as the party\u2019s candidate\n\nIn a judgment on Monday, Justice Ekwo held that Uba was never a candidate in the election having emerged from an illegally conducted primary election.\n\nThe court ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to delete Uba from its record as a candidate in the election and ordered the APC to refund to Moghalu, the sum of N22.5m which is the amount he paid for expression of interest and nomination forms since the party failed to conduct a valid primary.\n\nAt the direct primary which has now been annulled, Uba scored 230,000 votes but only managed to garner some 43,000 votes at the main election which was won by Prof. Chukwuma Soludo of the APGA.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Oil pipeline\n\n.As rig count falls 38%\n\nBy Udeme Akpan\n\nNIGERIA\u2019s crude oil exploration has suffered a setback as the rig count, a global index for measuring activities in the upstream sector, decreased by 38 per cent to 80 in the first 11 months of 2021, from 129, recorded in the corresponding period of 2020, according to the reports of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC.\n\nDuring the period under review, activities appeared on the low ebb in April with just five rigs in operation, but it quickly rose to 11 in August and September, before dropping consistently to seven in November 2021.\n\nThe organization did not provide reasons for the sliding trend, but Vanguard\u2019s investigation showed that it might have been connected to limited investment, still haunting the industry.\n\nComparatively, some African nations, especially Algeria and Libya did well at 247 and 140 rigs respectively during the period, indicating that unlike Nigeria, they would likely build additional oil reserves, capable of leading to increased production capacity in the coming years.\n\nIn an interview with Vanguard, Lead Promoter, EnergyHub Nigeria, Dr. Felix Amieyeofori, noted that the new Petroleum Industry Act, PIA, a comprehensive legislation would lead to increased investment in medium and long term.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe completion of work on the PIA is a welcome development for the oil and gas industry and the country at large as it will provide the long expected business and Investment environment for the oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cThis is coming at the time when oil and gas dependent economies are grappling with the reality of the energy transition to cleaner renewable energy sources to arrest the global climate problems.\n\nREAD ALSO: Navy arrest 20 suspected crude oil thieves in Bayelsa\n\n\u201cNigeria must ensure that we utilize the opportunities created by this Law to fully harness the total hydrocarbon value chain in order to generate the capital that will propel our Transition into the renewable world.\u201d\n\nA Port Harcourt-based Energy Analyst, Dr. Bala Zaka, also said that there was a great need for the deployment of many rigs for exploration, especially as Nigeria\u2019s oil reserves have for too long stagnated at 37 billion barrels.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe many foreign investors had before now gone to other nations, including Angola and Ghana, which had looked more attractive than Nigeria before the completion of work on Nigeria\u2019s PIA.\n\n\u201cNow that the PIA is place, conscious efforts should be made to attract and retain foreign and local investors in the oil industry, particularly as it would lead to the creation of contracts, jobs, Local content and other multiplier effects.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the National President, Oil and Gas Service Providers Association of Nigeria, OGSPAN, Mazi Colman Obasi, said: \u201cWe expect that the PIA, would impact positively on exploration.\n\n\u201cWith the expected increased investment, the nation\u2019s production should rise in the medium and long term, thus enabling the country to meet higher OPEC quota in future. Remember, there was a time Nigeria had the capacity to produce up to 2.5 mb/d. It was increased hostility in the Niger Delta and other factors that culminated in low output.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) has called for synergy and collaboration among stakeholders in the industry.\n\nIn a statement obtained by Vanguard, Chief Executive Officer of NUPRC, Mr. Gbenga Komolafe, said the PIA, which was signed into law after almost two decades has created a clear fiscal and regulatory framework for the industry.\n\nHe said the objective of the Act was to attract investments to Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector and optimise the nation\u2019s hydrocarbon resources for national development.\n\nAccording to him, the PIA was aimed at increasing the nation\u2019s oil and gas reserves and reduction in operating costs in the country.\n\nKomolafe, who had held several engagements with stakeholders in the industry since assuming office, noted that the effective implementation of PIA was very important to the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration.\n\n\u201cWe must continue to collaborate, synergise, and build partnerships across all agencies of government and our stakeholders, for the purpose of innovation, data gathering, information sharing and to breach specialized human capacity gaps among others, as these are positive drivers to improve local human capacity for Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said the commission has the responsibility of technical, operational and commercial regulation of upstream petroleum operations in Nigeria.\n\nHe maintained that the goal of the commission was to function as a 21st century regulator by promoting an enabling environment for investment in upstream petroleum operations.\n\nKomolafe added that the Commission would however; ensure strict implementation of environmental policies, laws and regulations for upstream petroleum operations.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\u2018Monarch accused me of being too stingy with money\u2019\n\nAs governor of Osun State, Chief Bisi Akande had problems with the immediate past Ooni of Ife, Oba Okuade Sijuwade, and the Owa-Obokun of Ijeshaland, Oba Adekunle Aromolaran.\n\nAkande, in his book, \u2018My Participations\u2019, said the late Sijuwade wanted him to plunge the state into debt by taking a loan for a water project the Oba had an\n\ninterest in.\n\nHe also said Oba Aromolaran was always saying bad things about him because of his belief that he was stingy.\n\n\u201cI was not surprised that most of the obas did not want to associate with the Owa-Obokun, His Majesty, Oba Adekunle Aromolaran.\n\n\u201cOne day he came to me to complain that he had no car. I told him that Osun State had no money now to buy cars for traditional rulers.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cBut his pestering was too much and I secretly sent money to him to buy a car.\n\n\u201cI went to meet him at his palace in Ilesha and told him that he should use the money I sent to buy a car. He then called Lere Adebayo.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to know how much of the money he should return to me! Lere then told him, \u2018Don\u2019t try that with Akande o! Ajemonu tie niyen!!\u2019\n\n\u201cMaybe that was the practice before my time. A few weeks after that incident, the Commissioner of Police was changed and the new man was touring the state and when he got to Ilesha, the Owa called him aside.\n\n\u201cHe told the CP that the only person he should be careful of within the state was Governor Akande. \u2018He is too stingy with money,\u2019 Kabiyesi said. The Commissioner of Police reported to me.\n\n\u201cSo one day the Owa came again to report to me Mr Niran Fajuke, the chairman of the local government in Ilesha. He complained that Fajuke was not taking good care of him.\n\n\u201cI accused him, saying, \u2018Baba, you too are not sometimes a nice person. Even after I gave you money secretly to buy a car, you still told the new Commissioner of Police that I was dangerous and stingy!\u2019\n\n\u201cOn another day, I met Owa alongside Rauf Aregbesola in Bola Tinubu\u2019s house at Bourdillon and tried to warn Aregbesola to be careful with Owa Aromolaran. Among the Obas and chiefs, the Owa seemed unpopular,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the Owa had a long-standing grudge against Ooni Sijuwade who wanted to dominate the entire space.\n\n\u201cOoni wanted to make an entourage of the smaller obas with a view to tormenting the Owa and other obas who might be opposed to him. He would give them money.\n\n\u201cWhat worried me with bringing the smaller obas into the Council of Obas to make them have an equal ranking with the other paramount rulers was that it might undermine the age-old tradition of the Yoruba people.\n\n\u201cAs far as my government was concerned, only three obas were paramount in Osun State: The Ooni, the Orangun and the Owa,\u201d he said.\n\nAkande added that when his old boss at BP, the Ajalorunof Ijebu-Ife, Ogun State, wanted to honour him with the traditional title of Jagunmolu Oodua, the late Ooni opposed it.\n\n\u201cHe wrote him a letter insisting that he being the Arole Oodua, was the only one who could confer a title with the word \u2018Oodua\u2019 as part of its name.\n\n\u201cHe warned that if Oba Oguntayo should go ahead he would incur the wrath of the Yoruba deities. The Ajalorun wisely went ahead and I received the title. The Ajalorun has been waxing stronger since then.\n\n\u201cThe Ajalorun is one of the most ancient of Yoruba traditional thrones and like all other leading obas, the throne originated from the House of Oduduwa in lle-Ife.\n\n\u201cIndeed, Ijebu-Ife is regarded as a replica of the old Ile-Ife. But the problem I had with the Ooni was more serious and graver and it also had to do with money,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that the late Ooni wanted him to renew the Ede-Osogbo Waterworks which was to be repaired with $300 million.\n\nHe refused to sanction the deal.",

That didn\u2019t make me to have a change of opinion about Obasanjo.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI have never seen anything genuine about him despite his self-glorification,\u201d Akande wrote.\n\nHe claimed the ex-president\u2019s nationalism and patriotism were fake, adding that his ambition to be the centre of Nigeria\u2019s universe made him express constant hatred for the late Obafemi Awolowo.\n\n\u201cIt was this vaunting ambition that made him express constant hatred to the most altruistic and selfless leader of our time, Chief Obafemi Awolowo.\n\n\u201cHe continues to wonder till tomorrow why the Yoruba people, especially after his tour of duty as a two-time President, continue to elevate Awolowo to the highest pedestal while they have no respect for him. So, he would wonder to his grave!\n\n\u201cIn his detestations for Awolowo, he is ruled by a virulent inferiority complex, believing that he needed to do everything to supplant the greatness of Awolowo or undermine his legacies.\n\n\u201cThat was why he launched the Universal Basic Education in 1978, knowing that free education would be the core of Awolowo programme for the Second Republic.\n\n\u201cThat was also why he continued in this line during his two-term disastrous presidency.\n\n\u201cFor the reason that I was not dancing to his tune, Obasanjo did everything to depress and discredit my government and undermine us in Osun state.\n\n\u201cIndeed, he wanted my government to collapse and once I had problem with Omisore, he adopted him as a willing tool and railroaded him into the Senate despite his detention for the assassination of Bola Ige,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe accused Obasanjo of ordering that Osun State should be short-paid by N216 million monthly from the Federal Allocation.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, we were earning about N150 million when our salary bill was about N260 million.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, the price of crude oil was rising and the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) was back in the account.\n\n\u201cSo instead, of our own income to move from N150 to N300 million, we were experiencing reduction.\n\n\u201cSuddenly also, they decided deducting N216 million from our allocation.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Budget Office in Abuja to find out why they were making the deductions and we were told it was \u2018order from above,\u2019 meaning they were acting on a directive from the Presidency.\n\n\u201cMy finance commissioner, in frustration, advised that perhaps we should bribe them. I said \u201cNo\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wanted to know what the cause of this order from above was but we didn\u2019t find out anything. They did this for a few other states too.\n\n\u201cThey claimed they were deducting for some inexplicable international debts.\n\n\u201cBut I came to know the sinister motive when Oyinlola became governor and they paid the arrears of the deductions to his government,\u201d Akande added in the autobiography.",

The allegations and my responses are now before the public.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesman said he built his house from his sweat, adding that he also sold his landed property, including the land given to him by the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo, to build the Lekki house.\n\nAdebanjo added: \u201cI hereby authorise the EFCC to verify the facts.\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere leader said he has no reason to ask for money from Asiwaju Tinubu after he left office since he never demanded such from him before he became governor.\n\nDescribing Akande\u2019s allegations as \u201cmalicious falsehood\u201d, Adebanjo challenged the former Osun State governor to disclose how he got his own property as he had done.\n\nAccording to him, Akande \u201cis a neophyte, a beneficiary of a struggle he never took part in\u201d.\n\nGiving details of how he built his house, Adebanjo said: \u201cI deny the lie propagated by Akande. I wish to state categorically that my house at Lekki was built with my resources through the sale of three developed properties, loan from GTBank and the sale of undeveloped landed property given me by my former leader, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, of blessed memory.\u201d\n\nOyinlola, in a statement in Osogbo, the Osun State capital, maintained that Akande accused him wrongly.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the Osun State Governor\u2019s Office (Bola Ige House) contract, Chief Akande said I wrongly accused him of corruption in the construction of the Governor\u2019s Office. I did not level any false charges against him. I came into office in May 2003 and discovered that the Governor\u2019s Office complex, which Akande commissioned for use after he lost the election, was not completed.\n\n\u201cThe state government asked the contractor to come back to the site and complete the works; more so when evidence in government accounts showed that he had been paid. But the project consultant shocked everyone with his claim that part of the payment was taken back to finance the 2003 re-election bid of Chief Akande.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe consultant said the contractor could not go back to work unless he was paid his full dues. One of Akande\u2019s appointees confessed collecting money from this contractor for Akande\u2019s re-election.\n\n\u201cI consulted Chief Akande on this. He denied having any deal with the contractor and the consultant. Some people were subsequently taken to court on a seven-count criminal charge. Stakeholders in the state and Alhaji Arisekola Alao later intervened. I have the details of who collected how much in my forthcoming book\u2026\u201d\n\nOyinlola alleged that Akande made N800 million advance payments to contractors in his last days in office, despite complaining that there was no money to pay workers and pensioners, leading to mass retrenchment.\n\n\u201cChief Akande wrote on the Government House that he wanted to build on a site on Ilesa Road in Osogbo, which I stopped. I found it strange that Chief Akande, who boasted that he was prudent and honest as governor, awarded the construction of a Government House in his last days in office, after he lost the election and in advance paid the contractors the entire contract sum of N800 million. Chief Akande confirmed this strange payment on page 393 of his book.\n\n\u201cThis was a man who said there was no money to pay workers and pensioners, but he had enough to pay a contractor in advance for a Government House after losing his re-election. In any case, the state already had an ongoing Government House started by the military government, which Akande refused to complete.\n\n\u201cI completed the project and added chalets plus a presidential lodge. Everything was completed and commissioned within my first year in office. The state has continued to use the structures till date.\u201d",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has withheld his assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021.\n\nIn a letter to the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, and read by AriseTV News monitored in Abuja, the president said that the prevailing situation in the country would not allow him to sign the bill.\n\nAmongst other reasons, he cited the high cost of conducting direct primaries, the security challenge of monitoring the election, violation of citizens rights, and marginalisation of small political parties.\n\nPresident Buhari also noted that adopting direct primaries also has implications on the rights of citizens to participate in the government, as constitutionally insured.\n\nAccording to the President, the conduct of direct primaries will lead to a significant spike in the cost of conducting primary elections by parties, as well as the increase in the cost of monitoring such elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nHe explained that the direct consequences of the high cost are monetization and that it will drive and increase financial crimes and constitutes further strain on the economy. In his view, Buhari said it will also stifle smaller parties without the enormous resources required to mobilize all party members for the primaries, a situation which he said is not healthy for the sustenance of multiparty democracy in Nigeria.\n\nThe president further stated that security agencies will also be overstretched, as direct primaries will be open to participation from all and sundry.\n\n\u2018Such large turnout without effective security coordination will also engender intimidation and disruptions, thereby raising credibility issues on the outcomes of such election\u201d, he said.\n\nSignificantly, Buhari said: \u2018The amendment as proposed is the violation of the underlying spirit of democracy, which is characterized by freedom of choices of which political party membership is a voluntary exercise of the constitutional right of freedom of association.\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari also said that the proposed amendment might also give rise to a plethora of litigations based on diverse grounds and issues of law, including but not limited to the fact that the proposed amendment could not work in retrospect, given that the existing constitution of the parties already registered with the INEC permits direct, indirect and consensus primaries.\n\nPresident Buhari said his decision is based on informed advice by relevant ministries, departments and agencies of the government, and careful review of the bill in light of the current realities prevalent in the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the circumstances.\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidency has said the National Assembly is free to make public President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s reasons for withholding assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021.\n\nAccording to Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, \u2018The President has sent a letter to the National Assembly stating his position on the bill amending the electoral act. It is privileged communication so it is for them to disclose the contents.\u2019",

          "text": "From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nThe proposed launch of the Ebubeagu security outfit may have hit a brickwall following threats by the Indigenous People of Biafra(IPOB) to resist every attempt by the south east governors to rekindle the security outfit.\n\nIPOB in a statement by its spokesperson,Emma Powerful reacting to the wakeup call on the governors of the south east by Ohanaeze Ndigbo to make the security outfit operational before the end of the year , insisted that its arm of security,the Eastern Security Network(ESN) can never work alongside Ebubeagu.\n\nPowerful stating reasons why ESN can not coexist with Ebubeagu, claimed that the new outfit is a traitor responsible for the death of most of their members. He further claimed that Ebubeagu is only being used as a spy by the governors of the south east to cause tension in the zone and later blame it on IPOB.\n\nHe said \u201cThe attention of the global movement and family of the Indigenous People of Biafra under the command and leadership of our great leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has been drawn to the laughable call by Ohaneze Ndigbo President General Prof. George Obiozor on South East Governors to re-establish the ridiculous, weak and unpopular Ebubeagu security outfit that has never been able to confront the Fulani bandits terrorising our ancestral land but only good at humiliating innocent Biafra youths with the collaboration of security agents.\n\n\u201cWe want to make it categorically clear to Ohaneze Ndigbo and its co-travellers that any attempt to re-establish Ebubeagu security outfit in South East will further worsen the precarious security situation in the zone. They should understand that our gallant Eastern Security Network ESN operatives have been sacrificing so dearly to secure our ancestral land.\n\n\u201cBut instead of complementing the efforts of ESN and IPOB to secure and defend our land against Fulani terrorists masquerading as herdsmen, these sabotures disguising as Ebubeagu security operatives give information on ESN to the wicked Nigeria security agencies. Because of this treachery, IPOB and ESN cannot operate together with Ebubeagu with undefined mission.\n\n\u201d It is on record that South East governors have ulterior motives in forming Ebubeagu security outfit and we have not seen them as a sincere outfit to secure or protect our mothers, wives and sisters in the whole of Biafraland.\n\n\u201cSouth East governors have no plan to protect our land but formed Ebubeagu to attack ESN and IPOB members. George Obiozor and Ohaneze Ndigbo should not set Igbo land on fire.\n\n\u201cESN/IPOB are ready to resist them anytime they are re-launched, and Biafrans should hold George Obiozor and Ohaneze Ndigbo responsible for anything that happens. They will regret any attempt to resurrect or re-launch this treacherous outfit that has sabotaged our march towards freedom.\n\n\u201cMany IPOB and ESN operatives tracked and killed were done by Ebubeagu sponsored by south east governors and this time around, it is not going to be business as usual. Our intention has never been to attack our people or innocent people except Fulani terrorists masquerading as herdsmen and rampaging in our territory.\u201d Powerful stated.",

          "title": "Electoral Bill: Lawmakers talk tough as Buhari withholds assent within deadline",
          "text": "From Fred Itua and Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nPlans by senators and the House of Representatives to override President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s veto on the Electoral Amendment Bill may have hit a dead end.\n\nThe development, Daily Sun gathered, is the seeming inability of lawmakers from the two chambers to reach a compromise on how to mobilise members should the president decides to withhold assent the Bill.\n\nHowever, Daily Sun gathered that some lawmakers across party divide would not let the rejection go without a fight. Consequently, they are said to be frantically mobilising and restrategising in spite of the difficulties.\n\nThe signing of the Electoral Amendment Bill by President Buhari, elapsed yesterday, having clocked the mandatory 30 days, within which the president must communicate to the National Assembly on his decision regarding any Bill passed by the parliament.\n\nSection 58 (4) of 1999 (as amended) stipulates that \u201cWhere a bill is presented to the President for assent, he shall within thirty days thereof signify that he assents or that he withholds assent.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, section 58 (5) provides thus \u201cWhere the President withholds his assent and the bill is again passed by each House by a two-thirds majority, the bill shall become law and the assent of the President shall not be required.\u201d\n\nThe bone of contention in the proposed amendment is the expulsion of indirect primaries from the existing Act by members of the two chambers of the National Assembly.\n\nIts removal was spearheaded by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila. The Senate, had in its earlier amendment retained indirect primaries.\n\nObservers believe that lawmakers made the sudden U-turn after they lost out in the recently-conducted primaries of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) across the 36 states of the Federation and the FCT.\n\nPolitical pundits, who spoke with Daily Sun, said the move by the National Assembly to make political parties powerless in the selection of candidates for any election is unconstitutional and will therefore not stand.\n\nWith the purported rejection of the Bill, members elected on the platform of APC and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), are strategising ahead of an unveiling of a letter of rejection sent to the two chambers by President Buhari.\n\nFormer chairman, House Committee on FCT, Sergius Ogun, who represents Esan North East/Esan South East federal constituency of Edo State, told Daily Sun, in a telephone interview, said lawmakers would wait for an official communication from President Buhari before deciding on the next course of action.\n\n\u201cWe will wait until we get a communication from him. The other thing would have been to override his veto but I don\u2019t think the National Assembly as it is constituted has the courage to do that. The leadership of the National Assembly as it is constituted might not have courage to veto the president.\u201d\n\nEfforts to reach the House spokesman, Benjamin Kalu, the House Leader, Alhassan Ado Doguwa and the Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu, were unsuccessful. While Kalu did not answer reported calls to his mobile phone, Doguwa and Elumelu\u2019s mobile line were unreachable.\n\nMeanwhile, a top government source has told Daily Sun that a notice of rejection of the Bill was sent to the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and Speaker Gbajabiamila in early December. He said the National Assembly, which is expected to embark on its annual Christmas break this week, may be unable to take any action until mid January, 2022 when it would reconvene. He further revealed that the National Assembly is already divided along regional lines on the issue of direct primaries and electronic transmission of results from polling units.\n\nThe source said many northern leaders were opposed to electronic transmission of results but indifferent to direct or indirect primaries.\n\nThe top government official said many northern lawmakers would side with Buhari if the National Assembly makes any move to override him.\n\nThe process of overriding the president is tedious. Since the beginning of the fourth republic in 1999, the National Assembly has only overruled the president\u2019s veto once, when it passed the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), following President Olusegun Obasanjo veto.\n\nFor each chamber to override the president, it needs two-third of members. For the Senate, it needs 74, out of 109 members seated and voting. For the House of Representatives, a similar requirement is needed. It needs at least 240 members present, out of 360 constitutionally recognised by law.\n\nAs soon as the process is kicked off, the rejected Bill would be recommited on the floor of the two chambers. After its first and second reading, it may likely go for a public hearing. During the third hearing on the floor, if 74 senators and 240 members of the House vote, it would become a law without the approval of the president.\n\nHowever, despite the growing pressure from the public and the political class, it is unclear if Lawan and Gbajabiamila would muscle the courage to call the bluff of the president and override him.",

          "text": "*Hope now is for him to sign since by law he failed to communicate rejection\n\n* Govs, Malami, APC still against democratic reform of voting culture\n\n* CSOs express shock, disappointment in president\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nBy failing to assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill and communicate same to the National Assembly within the time stipulated by the constitution, President Muhammadu Buhari, might have resolved to sign the bill forwarded to him by the legislature on November 19, 2021.\n\nAlthough some governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, as well as other party stakeholders were still against the electoral bill as passed by the National Assembly, failing to clearly reject the bill as demanded of him by the constitution and communicate the decision, has left the country with the hope that the president would sign the bill, ultimately.\n\nThis, nonetheless, the president has continued to received flaks from different quarters of the country, particularly, the civil society groups, which objected to his decision to keep the nation in suspense, knowing the importance of the bill to an average Nigerian.\n\nThe president has for the past couple of days put Nigerians and the diplomatic community on the edge, as the December 19 deadline, which marked the expiration of the constitutional 30 days required for him to communicate his position on the Electoral Act Amendment Bill to the National Assembly lapsed.\n\nThe bill passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives, had been forwarded to the president since November 19 for the president\u2019s assent.\n\nInterestingly, the law only requires of the president to communicate to the legislature if he was not going to sign the bill, there\u2019s no specified time within which he must sign the bill into law, once he has resolved to sign it. Indeed, the law does not compel him to give reason for declining assent if he chooses to.\n\nSection 58(1) of the 1999 Constitution as amended provides that the power of the National Assembly to make laws shall be exercised by bills passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives and, except as otherwise provided, be assented to by the President. This is in furtherance of the principle of separation of powers, which ensures that every organ of government in democratic dispensation, is checkmated by the other arms.\n\nTherefore, where a bill has been passed by the House in which it originated, it shall be sent to the other House, and it shall be presented to the President for assent, when it has been passed by that other House and agreement has been reached between the two Houses on any amendment made on it.\n\nWhere, however, a bill is presented to the President for assent, the President shall within thirty (30) days thereof signify that he assents or that he withholds his assent. It is, however, the prerogative of the president to give reasons for his refusal to assent to a particular bill.\n\nHowever, the refusal of assent to a bill by the President might not be the end of the process for the passage of such bill. Where the President withholds his assent to a bill, which has been duly passed by the National Assembly, and the National Assembly considers it expedient that such bill should be passed into law, the Constitution empowers the National Assembly to veto the refusal of assent by the President.\n\nSection 58 (5) of the CFRN provides that where the President withholds his assent and the bill is again passed by each House by two/thirds majority, the bill shall become law and assent of the president shall not be required.[1]\n\nWhat this signifies is that upon the refusal of assent to a bill by the President, if the National Assembly considers that the bill is of such nature as to become law notwithstanding the refusal of assent by the President, each House of the National Assembly may pass the bill again by two/thirds majority and when that happens, the bill automatically becomes a law even without the assent or signature of the President.\n\nThe National Assembly once exercised this overriding power in the case of the Niger Delta Development Commission Bill. Both Chambers of the National Assembly had passed the bill into law upon the failure of the President to sign or give his assent within the time prescribed by the Constitution.\n\nPoignantly, the overriding power is vested with the National Assembly to consider the expedience of each of the bills to which the President has refused assent and to determine if it would take the passage of the bills a step further.\n\nFlowing from this, the interpretation is that President Buhari might have actually resolved to sign the bill, but still contending with the pressure from other equally weighty forces that were opposed to the bill hence his silence.\n\nThis is also because the president had hardly wasted time with any bill he was not going to sign into law, if recent past experience was anything to factor into account.\n\nFor example, some of the bill the president had declined assent included the Nigerian Film Commission Bill 2018, the Chartered Institute of Pension Practitioners of Nigeria Bill 2018, the Immigration Amendment Bill 2018, the Climate Change Bill 2018, the Digital Rights and Freedom Bill 2018, the Chartered Institute of Training and Development of Nigeria (Establishment) Bill 2018.\n\nOthers were the Nigerian Aeronautic Research Rescue Bill 2018, the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria Bill 2018, the National Housing Fund Bill 2018, the National Institute of Credit Administration Bill 2018, the National Bio-Technology Development Agency Bill 2018 as well as the Ajaokuta Iron and Steel Completion Fund Bill.\n\nIn withholding his assent, President Buhari gave such reasons infractions on extant laws, duplication of responsibilities of existing agencies, and financial constraints owing to prevailing economic circumstances.\n\nTherefore, on this particular bill, apart from the expiration of the one month deadline, which was known to all, there have not been reports or indications that the presidency had triggered any process of communication with the National Assembly to decline assent to the bill.\n\nSources within the presidency insisted that Buhari was still disposed to signing the bill and would sign it eventually, which is just a matter of choosing a date for the ceremony and also why he was not bothered about the deadline.\n\nBut he was still neck deep in managing the other tendencies that have maintained an unyielding opposition to a section of the bill, which approved direct primaries for political parties to determine their candidates for election.\n\n\u201cIt is a very simple process, the law only requires that he communicates to the National Assembly if he was not going to sign it and explain why. But if he has decided to sign it, there is no need for any communication or watch over any deadline; it is just a question of picking a date to sign and that is it. It is purely at his beck and call.\n\n\u201cHowever, I am convinced he is signing it, because if you know the president very well, he does not like to disappoint the international community and having given his words on leaving a legacy of credible electoral system, I believe he would sign it. Besides, there are no indications of any communication to the legislature and the 30 days have expired, so, let\u2019s take it that he would sign it,\u201d the source explained.\n\nInterestingly, had the president declined assent to the bill and communicated same to the legislature, it would have marked the second time in two years, that he has botched an attempt to reform the country\u2019s electoral system.\n\nBuhari had previously declined assent to an earlier version of the same bill passed by the Eighth National Assembly led by then Senate President Bukola Saraki of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), citing closeness to elections.\n\nBut the president did not adduce any reason for his latest refusal to approve reform of the country\u2019s electoral system, despite passage by the bicameral legislature under the leadership of his fellow All Progressives Congress (APC) member, Senate President Ahmed Lawan.\n\nAgain, by repeatedly voicing an intention to leave behind a legacy of credible electoral system, Buhari would have handed victory against the electoral reform to governors, particularly, those elected on the platform of APC; the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, and some prominent members of the ruling party, who never hid their disdain for a progressive electoral culture, if he had declined assent.\n\nThe National Assembly had, while forwarding the amended Electoral Act Bill to the president, urged him to sign it in the collective interest of the country, especially, in view of his promise to leave a legacy of free, fair and credible electoral system for the country.\n\nAmong the major amendments to the electoral act bill was the approval by the legislature of direct primaries by political parties in the election of candidates for elections. But this proposition did not sit well with some elements within the political class, especially, from the ruling party. They had since launched an offensive against direct primaries, urging the president not to sign the amended electoral act bill.\n\nIn the forefront here was Malami, who advised the president in writing to shelve the intention, if there was any, of signing the bill, because he found some contentious clauses. Two days to the expiration of the 30 days within which the president must communicate rejection of the bill, Malami, reportedly, wrote another letter, reaffirming why the president should not sign the bill. He claimed mandatory direct primaries would cause chaos.\n\nBut since Malami\u2019s first official advice to the president, many of the governors of the ruling party had equally mounted pressure on Buhari not to sign the bill, citing cost and the fact that the choice of the mode of primary should be a decision for the political parties and their leaderships to take.\n\nWhile the anti-direct primaries elements were mounting pressure on the president, those inclined to the idea, including President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, and Speaker, House of representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, had also met with the president repeatedly and came out with the assurances that Buhari would do the needful.\n\nCivil society groups, members of the diplomatic community, and ordinary Nigerians had also appealed to the president to sign the bill because it would strengthen participatory democracy and also hand power back to the people in the choice of their representatives at all levels of the electoral process.\n\nBuhari has yet to assent to the bill or give reasons why he has not, even though he recently said at a virtual summit on democracy put together by United States President Joe Biden that he would leave behind a credible electoral culture by 2023, when he is billed to leave office after two terms of eight years.\n\nIt appears the president intentionally chose to keep Nigerians in suspense. But some sources said he was concerned about the governors, who were against the amendment, and has been trying to strike a balance since the governors fund the party.\n\nAn inside source, who did not trust the president, told THISDAY that, \u201cCan\u2019t you see that the governors stopped talking about it for a while? They had reached an understanding with the president and they won. They boasted they would prevail and they just did. Whoever says the governors are not powerful is a joker. They are not only powerful, they always deploy their power to effective uses, especially, when a lot is at stake for them.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, what seemed to corroborate this happened two weeks ago, following reports that the president might have resolved to decline assent to the bill. But both Gbajabiamila and a presidential spokesperson, Garba Shehu, denied it and said they were not privy to such information.\n\nSo far, there has not been any official communication on the bill generally considered crucial to the success or otherwise of the next general election.\n\nMeanwhile, the Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), yesterday, expressed shock and disappointment at the failure of the president to assent to the electoral act amendment, describing him as the biggest threat to Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nThe CSOs called on the National Assembly to override the president\u2019s veto. They spoke in a joint statement signed by Executive Director, Adopt A Goal Initiative, Ariyo-Dare Atoye, and endorsed by Convener, Raising New Voices Initiative, Jude Feranmi; Programme Officer, Centre for Liberty, Maryam Ahmed; Convener, Speak Out Africa Initiative, Kenneth Eze; Executive Director, The Nigerian Alliance, Simi Olusola; and Executive Director, Youth and Students Advocates for Development Initiative (YSAD), Obinna Eze Nwagbara.\n\nThe CSOs accused Buhari of trying to destroy the country\u2019s democracy.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cIt has come to the point where we must tell President Buhari in unmistaken terms that his failure to sign the bill within the 30 days window has exposed him as the biggest threat to the Fourth democratic republic, having failed to perform a similar responsibility four times in his first term.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari benefitted significantly from some of the electoral reforms initiated by Yar\u2019Adua and signed by Jonathan; if he fails to sign the amended electoral act, history will record him as a major impediment to electoral credibility and governance. This is a low hanging lifetime opportunity for the president to salvage his terrible electoral credential.\u201d\n\nThe civil society groups vowed to storm the National Assembly today in protest, to press for the overriding of the president in the interest of Nigerians.\n\nThe statement also said, \u201cThere is a constitutional window opened to the National Assembly to recall the bill and give it the effect of law with a two-thirds number. From Monday morning, we will turn to the National Assembly to act in the national interest and pass the bill expeditiously before they embark on the Christmas recess.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the next step is for us as CSOs to take our advocacy to the National Assembly to step in, exhibit courage, recall the bill, and ensure they override the president with an accelerated passage before Christmas.\n\n\u201cThe Ninth National Assembly has deferred too much to President Buhari almost to the point of ridicule, so, if the president does not respect and reciprocate this gesture, history will be kind to them if they override the president and salvage their own political future.\n\n\u201cThis will not be the first time in the last 20 years that the National Assembly will override the president; the Fourth legislative session did so and got the NDDC Act passed and operational. The Ninth National Assembly has the opportunity of not sharing with the executive, the glory that will accompany the new act.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Rampaging Terrorists Kill 38 in Kaduna Communities",
          "text": "Deji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, said the last vestiges of terrorists were the ones soft-targeting innocent citizens, looting their assets and burning houses, because they were already frustrated as a result of the heat turned on them by the nation\u2019s troop.\n\nThe president, who just got back from a three-day visit to Turkey, returned to the news of some 38 persons, reportedly killed in some communities in Kaduna State by bandits and stressed that killing of innocent citizens were no more acceptable.\n\nAlso, the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs in Kaduna State, Samuel Aruwan, who disclosed the latest killings in a statement, confirmed that no fewer than 38 people were killed in Giwa Local Government Area of the state.\n\nHowever, in a counter effort, operatives of the Nigeria Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), working with the Taraba State Police Command, said they arrested eleven notorious kidnap suspects in Taraba over alleged complicity and various criminal roles in the recent spate of kidnap incidents, including the killing of a police sergeant in Jalingo, the state capital.\n\nA statement by Force Headquarters, which also claimed that the suspects were responsible for the kidnapping of a serving personnel of the Nigeria Customs Service and a relative of the Emir of Jalingo, stated that the police recovered seven AK47 rifles, two baretta pistols, 121 rounds of live ammunition of different calibre, four magazines, masks, illicit drugs and other incriminating items during raids of various hideouts of the suspects in the state.\n\nBuhari, while condemning the renewed killings in Kaduna State, said the gruesome nature of recent incidents in Kauran Fawa, Marke and Ruhiya of Idasu Ward of Giwa Local Government Area, has made him particularly sad and the killings unacceptable.\n\nIn a release by the president\u2019s spokesman, Garba Shehu, Buhari expressed the nation\u2019s condolences to the Government of Kaduna State, the people of Zonkwa Chiefdom and the family of His Highness Nuhu Bature, the Agwam Kajju on his demise.\n\nIn praying for the repose of the souls of the deceased, the president reiterated that the nation\u2019s security forces had \u201cturned the heat on the terrorists, who are getting frustrated and are soft-targeting innocent citizens, looting their assets, burning their homes and killing them indiscriminately.\u201d\n\nBuhari further reiterated his directive to the security and intelligence chiefs to do everything they could to destroy the remaining vestiges of the terrorists.\n\nAruwan, while speaking on the Kaduna killing, said the incident was reported to the state government by the military and police authorities, adding that, \u201csecurity agencies have confirmed to the Kaduna State Government that 38 people were killed across the locations attacked.\u201d\n\nHis statement identified some of the affected villages to include Kauran Fawa, Marke and Riheya villages in Idasu district, adding that houses, trucks, and cars were also burnt, along with food and farm produce.\n\nAruwan said Governor Nasir El-Rufai of the state received the news with sadness and had sent condolences to the families of the victims of the brutal attacks while praying for the repose of their souls.\n\n\u201cThe governor also commiserated with the affected communities and directed the Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency to conduct an urgent assessment of the area towards providing relief,\u201d he said.\n\nBut, \u201cin the meantime\u201d he said, security agencies had sustained patrols in the general area.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner said 29 of the victims had been identified, with nine yet to be identified atthe time of the security update.\n\nAccording to him, the 29 identified victims included Rabi`u Wada, Salisu Boka, Nura Nuhu, Bashari Sabiu, Lawal Dahiru, Abbas Saidu, Inusa Kano, Lawal Nagargari, Malam Aminu, Lawal Maigyad and Mustapha Lawal Aliyu.\n\nOthers victims, according to Aruwan, include, Sale Makeri, Sani Lawal, Auwal Umar,Jamilu Hassan, Badamasi Mukhtar, Malam Jibril, Lawal Tsawa, Sule Hamisu, Sadi Bala, Kabiru Gesha, Abubakar Sanusi, Saiph Abdu, Haruna Musa, Lawal Hudu, Shuaibu Habibu, Yahaya Habibu and Abubakar Yusuf.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Taraba situation, a statement by Force Public Relations Officer, Mr Frank Mba, a Commissioner of Police, said the arrest of the suspects followed the deployment of operatives of the Intelligence Response Team by the Inspector General of Police, Mr Usman Alkali Baba, to the state to complement efforts of the sState command in promptly containing the disturbing trend of kidnapping, armed robbery, and other violent crimes in the state.\n\nThe suspects, Luka Adam, Shuaibu Nuhu, Moses Amos, Peters Mashi, Ahmadu Mallam, Adamu Mohammed, Dahiru Mallam Dalha, Gambo Isah, Sanusi Ahmadu, Mallam Mohammed Mauludu, Ibrahim Idi, all indigenes of Taraba State, were arrested by the police team from their various criminal hideouts.\n\nPolice investigations revealed that the suspects, who were on the wanted list of the command, were members of a notorious kidnap syndicate and had been evidentially linked to the recent upsurge in incidents of kidnapping in the state, including deliberate and calculated attacks on security personnel.\n\nInvestigations also revealed how two of the suspects, Gambo Isah and Sanusi Ahmadu, masterminded the killing of the police sergeant and left a police inspector with gunshot injuries in their recent operation to enable them escape arrest, having abducted some victims in Jalingo recently.\n\nFurther investigations revealed that the modus operandi of the suspects included trailing individuals notably, business owners, government functionaries, motorists with flashy and exotic cars, among others, to their houses and thereafter planned and executed the kidnap of such persons.\n\n\u201cThey also collect huge sums of money as ransom from relatives and friends of their victims before their release,\u201d it said.\n\nThe police, in the course of investigations, identified and raided various criminal hideouts,where kidnap victims were usually kept. The police stated that while a cache of weapons and other incriminating items were recovered from their hideouts, all the kidnap victims held hostage at the various hideouts were carefully and successfully rescued unhurt and reunited with their families.\n\nTo that extent, investigators had intensified efforts at arresting other suspects currently at large.\n\nThe IG, while commending the people of Taraba for supporting the police especially, in providing useful information that aided the prompt apprehension of the suspects, assured that the police would continue to work with all stakeholders in deepening the collective safety of the Taraba people.\n\nThe IG condoled the family of the late Sergeant Ogidi Habu and maintained that the force would sustain efforts at improving public safety in all Nigerian communities, adding all the suspects would be charged to court on completion of investigations.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The Federal Government of Nigeria, through the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19, the Federal Ministry of Health, as well as NCDC and its partners, are therefore intensifying risk communication efforts to remind Nigerians of the risk we face and need to take collective responsibility to reduce transmission of the virus.\n\n\u201cThe response to COVID-19 requires a whole-of-society approach. Therefore, individuals, families and institutions also need to play their part in protecting each other by ensuring adherence to COVID-19 public health and social measures.\n\n\u201cCritically, Nigerians are urged to adhere to recommended measures by NCDC and other public health authorities, as they celebrate Christmas and New Year.\n\n\u201cPlease avoid all non-essential travel within and outside Nigeria to reduce the risk of transmission. The virus that causes COVID-19 is more likely to spread in mass gatherings especially when held indoors with full capacity and poor ventilation.\n\n\u201cWe strongly recommend outdoor events with physical distancing, compulsory use of facemasks, and provision of handwashing facilities or hand sanitisers. Please make use of every opportunity provided to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

          "title": "Inside TeamApt: How an upstart overturned competition to dominate agency banking",
          "text": "Six years after TeamApt, a little-known banking software development company, had launched, it stirred excitement after Bloomberg reported the startup\u2019s move to raise $150 million at a billion-dollar valuation\u2014which would elevate it to the coveted unicorn status. TeamApt\u2019s co-founders had bootstrapped the company from a four-man team in their flat in 1004 Estate to building products, MoneyTor and AptPay, which serviced virtually all the commercial banks in Nigeria. TeamApt followed the growth with a $5.5 million Series A round by 2019.\n\nHowever, it was Moniepoint, the product it launched next, that skyrocketed the company to near-unicorn status.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Nigeria had 4.3 bank branches per 100,000 people in 2018, thereby leaving many of its 200 million population either unserved or underserved. Moniepoint provides payment, withdrawal, and deposit services to these underbanked users through an army of agents mostly in mom-and-pop stores across the country. In 2019, when OPay announced a total of $170 million in fundraising from two rounds and marched thousands of point-of-sale (POS) terminal-wielding footmen across the country to convert agents and successfully grow agency banking in the country, Moniepoint launched that September after a beta-testing phase, with about 1,000 agents.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have money then, so we were taking terminals from banks and manually sending them to agents, individually, in other parts of the country. That was so base and hectic,\u201d says Tolu Adetuyi, Moniepoint Head of Growth.\n\nAfter the $5.5 million raise, TeamApt had cash in the bank to place orders for terminals in China and invaded the Nigerian market. Now it processes over $4 billion monthly, servicing 18 million unique customers, and has over 120,000 active merchants in almost all of Nigeria\u2019s 774 local government areas (LGAs)\u2014only the terror-prone LGAs in the country\u2019s northern regions are left out. A regulator report seen by TechCabal back in June capturing transaction volumes by super agents showed TeamApt recorded an agent transaction volume of roughly 50 million, which accounted for 75% of total agent volumes collated for the month reported. Although, an industry analyst under anonymity told TechCabal that he doubts OPay\u2019s numbers were captured in the report.\n\nSo how did TeamApt become this super agent?\n\n\u201cBack then, our fee was only 1% of each transaction, which was high, but that was what we could afford, but we obsessed about our agents and offered them unmatched user experience,\u201d Adetuyi explained.\n\nTolu Adetuyi, as growth lead, along with 40 other support staff, oversee a massive network of agents engaged through Whatsapp groups dedicated to each LGA in Nigeria and a few other separate high-level Whatsapp groups of LGA agent leaders also called cluster managers, state managers, and regional managers. These performing agents-turned-managers are responsible for increasing and engaging the agents in their communities in order to increase their commission.\n\n\u201cMy phone is always buzzing, and I\u2019m attending town hall meetings. That\u2019s like, the whole of my work. I know what\u2019s happening on the streets right from my room,\u201d Adetuyi tells me excitedly via a Google Meet call.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s strong feedback loop facilitates rich market intelligence which enabled the company successively introduce groundbreaking features to the market which some competitors adopted and eventually became industry standards.\n\nMrs Ogunleye, an agent in the Alimosho local government area of Lagos, runs a grocery store and owns three POS terminals. \u201cI started using Moniepoint because of their daily commission settlement while others were paying monthly,\u201d she tells TechCabal.\n\nSources at TeamApt credit Moniepoint\u2019s early success and breakthrough growth to this payment feature. \u201cMany of these agents are like petty traders who need their daily earnings for restocking and running their households. I study my agents. I literally have documents on agent motivation,\u201d Adetuyi shares.\n\nMoniePoint also provides agents with live analytics dashboards to see a detailed breakdown of their performance and earnings. This transparency enables agent trust in the commission given and drives them to improve their performance as opposed to opaque estimated monthly earnings.\n\nTeamApt deploys an interesting active POS terminal performance management system for its merchants. For example, for every 10 terminals given, a certain number must be doing transaction values exceeding a fixed amount. The figure is determined by the area and market trend. This drives cluster managers to identify and recruit the best agents and engage them daily to improve their performance.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really want merchants who use our terminals only when they need to make quick money. We want active agents who use them daily. We try to prevent what they call bozo explosion, where we bring in lots of agents but are not able to service the 20% that\u2019s going to give you most of your revenue, then you end up losing them,\u201d Solomon Amadi, Vice President at TeamApt, tells TechCabal.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s agent network is a vibrant talent ecosystem that allows enterprising agents to grow through the rank. Merchant agents can become cluster managers at LG level, grow into state managers, and finally regional heads, while increasing their earnings along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a talent war. Competitors are calling and trying to poach our star agents, so much so that we know the name of some of the employees calling them because our agents tell us. That\u2019s why we sign exclusive contracts with some of these agents,\u201d Amadi disclosed.\n\nThe talent grab, though, goes both ways. TeamApt also tries to convert performing agents on other platforms.\n\nTo improve the reliability of its product, TeamApt introduced to the market a 24-hour resolution service for false debit card withdrawals. Usually, it takes 8 days after physically visiting a bank branch to resolve an unsuccessful card withdrawal where the customer\u2019s account got debited. But TeamApt funds customers from its account once it can verify the transaction and later sorts out the reconciliation at the back end with the bank.\n\n\u201cThe solutions we introduced to the market seem commonplace but many of them weren\u2019t being done till we did. In Nigeria, we just like to copy and paste models without thinking to adapt them to our peculiarities. But, first principles thinking has really helped us in how we approach problems and come up with the solutions we have introduced,\u201d Adetuyi concludes.\n\n\u201cFirst principles thinking\u201d is a phrase I heard often while interviewing management executives at TeamApt. It\u2019s a problem-solving thought process of attacking problems by first identifying the fundamental issues. It was first taught by Aristotle and currently made popular by South African-born physics engineering genius, Elon Musk. Tosin Eniolorunda, founder and CEO of TeamApt, champions the thought process and is instilling it into the company culture.\n\n\u201cWhen we hit a roadblock while thinking up a solution, Felix (TeamApt CTO) would often say, okay, let\u2019s go back, let\u2019s go back,\u201d Eniolorunda tells me as he rolls his wrist backwards. He shares that his exposure to first principles philosophy came in stages. The first time was in his 100 level at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) as a mechanical engineering student.\n\n\u201cI got into OAU on merit, first try. So, I was feeling fly with myself. But I now failed in my first year. My CGPA was 3.3,\u201d he shares in-between laughs. \u201cThat was a major learning experience for me. I learnt the power of focus. Secondly, it sparked a new way of thinking because adversity changes us. I questioned myself on why I want excellence and I began to think of how to get there.\u201d\n\nTosin, the first born of a building contractor father and primary teacher mother, worked and paid his way through tertiary school and graduated with a second class upper in mechanical engineering. He had always wanted to be an entrepreneur and build \u201csomething massive\u201d. With TeamApt seemingly to be crowned with unicorn status, the company now has its eyes on digital banking but with a slant. \u201cThere\u2019s a me too movement in tech. Everyone is launching digital banking with different offerings. But the fundamental question is, what do customers really need? Zero cost transaction accounts? That\u2019s good, but I think credit is one of the key needs.

          "title": "Want luxury fashion? Play Africa\u2019s first metaverse crypto game",
          "text": "The digital age has seen people try to imitate reality online. A result of this trend is that people are buying the online versions of what they would normally buy in real life: luxury houses, dresses, and even land. For example, this year saw the purchase of the world\u2019s first digital home, sold for over $500,000 on the NFT market. Instead of physical artworks, people now buy Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), digital assets whose ownerships are recorded on the blockchain.\n\nDigital fashion allows designers to model their designs in pixels instead of silk, cotton, lace, or polyester. Digital fashion can be in the form of digital fashion conceived to produce physical garments or fashion that a person can wear only with augmented or virtual reality. Or it can be fashion that is sold directly to an avatar.\n\nPowered by blockchain and NFTs, the digital fashion world is steadily growing. This growth is marked by the emergence of fashion houses like The Fabricant, which creates digital-only fashion; and RTFKT, a company that specialises in making digital sneakers that can be used and traded in virtual spaces as NFTs. In what represents a landmark moment in digital fashion, The Fabricant sold the world\u2019s first digital-only dress, \u201dIridescence\u201d, for $9,500 to a Canadian, Rachel Ma.\n\nThe Fabricant\u2019s \u2018Iridescence\u2019 | @the_fab_ric_ant\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic forced designers to rethink and seek a digital option to showcase their collections, leading to the creation of hyper-real digital showrooms around the world.\n\nA product of digital fashion, hyper-real fashion, is used to explain the use of tech to virtually showcase fashion products. By removing the need for humans to physically examine fashion products, hyper-real fashion tech continues to blur the lines of a prominent human physical experience: shopping.\n\nThis has also led to the development of Obsess, an experiential e-commerce platform, that uses 3D to create 360-degree virtual stores. Their portfolio includes brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Dior, and Charlotte Tilbury. \u201cVirtual stores can be created completely digitally and don\u2019t have to exist in real life. Brands use this option to create super engaging experiences for their customers,\u201d says Neha Singh, Obsess\u2019s founder and CEO, in an interview with Vogue India earlier this year.\n\nPositioning for \u201cmeta fashion\u201d\n\nThe metaverse is the use of the combination of technology like virtual reality, augmented reality, and video to create a digital world. The metaverse, unlike the way we currently access the internet, is immersive.\n\nSome of the earliest collaborations between the metaverse and fashion industry can be seen in games. There is Burberry\u2019s first-of-its-kind NFT collection with Mythical Games\u2019 Blankos Block Party, Gucci\u2019s Garden Metaverse with Roblox and their Aria Collection Film at Christie\u2019s, and Louis Vuitton\u2019s \u201cLouis The Game\u201d NFT in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French house\u2019s founding.\n\nWhile it is evident that the metaverse will enjoy massive investments from the fashion industry, the gaming industry is not left behind. Collaboration between the fashion and gaming industry in the metaverse presents a huge economic opportunity. Some notable collaborations in recent times include Balenciaga and Fortnite working together to design accessories and skins, Burberry partnering with Tencent to create exclusively designed skins for Honor of Kings characters.\n\nThe fashion industry is investing in the metaverse to create the branding of the future. While the metaverse is still new and building around it is still ongoing, its building blocks\u2014fashion avatars, digitally designed spaces, exotic pets in games\u2014are not entirely foreign.\n\nIn an attempt to tap into the trend of combining fashion and the digital world, Delz Erinle, a product and UX designer and Niyi Okeowo, an art director, started Thrill Digital, a company that started as a virtual fashion showcase and now pioneers a fashion metaverse. Thrill Digital uses a combination of Web3 technologies like XR (AR/VR), video, audio, crypto, and gaming to create its own fashion metaverse and other unreleased digital products.\n\nDuring the pandemic last year, Erinle saw how difficult it was to shop. So, he decided to bring in Lead Developer and Chief Technical Officer (CTO), Luke Jeffers, to use 3D to create a VR shopping product, to make shopping more accessible and effortless for an audience that was stuck at home.\n\nPivoting from creating the initial idea of a fashion show, Thrill started working on a VR shopping product. Thrill Digital pitched a lot of investors and won Epic Game\u2019s MegaGrant worth $40,000 in January this year to create the VR shopping product. They eventually delivered the product during Lone Design Club fashion week in February.\n\nAfter that, Erinle carried out research in a mall in London where he asked people if they would play a game to win luxury prizes. The feedback they got from people was affirmative. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to create a metaverse project initially. It was like a virtual shopping experience, first, \u201d Erinle said.\n\nThis was how Thrill Digital started Astra, a fashion crypto game where players can win real-life fashion luxury items. The game would have its own crypto token, which must be connected to a crypto wallet like the popular crypto game, Axie Infinity. The game will be open on December 20 and users can play to win a Balenciaga Small Hourglass Tote Bag. When players win a luxury item on Astra, it would be delivered to them wherever they are in the world.\n\nErinle, who doesn\u2019t believe a fully fleshed metaverse has been created yet, explained the metaverse as \u201ca collection of interoperable virtual worlds which people can experience using an avatar. The metaverse is a virtual 3D environment where people can interact but this time with phones; it is an immersive experience.\u201d\n\nLead 3D designer, Charles Egbejule, believes daring to dream they can build a mini metaverse out of Africa was one of the biggest challenges they had to face. While lead VR architect, Adekunbi Ajai, believes building remotely from different parts of the world also poses a challenge for the team. But they were able to adapt and can now easily communicate, she added.\n\nFor the team\u2019s brand designer and co-founder, Niyi Okeowo, one difficulty they faced was raising awareness on a new concept like digital fashion. \u201cWe were trying to sell the product while teaching people about it.\u201d\n\nThe audience that Astra is targeting is people who love fashion, people who use crypto, and people who love games\u2014or people who love all three.\n\nSo here is how the game works: players amass as many crypto tokens as they can within an allotted time, after which a leaderboard is created where winners will be declared and win luxury fashion.\n\nJeffers explained that NFTs would play a huge role in claiming ownership of clothing accessories and land in Astra.\n\nErinle explained that it chose to build its metaverse on the Solana blockchain because of its low gas fees and low energy consumption. Citing a report that says transactions on the Solana blockchain consume less energy than two Google searches, Astra believes it is contributing to the reduction of environmental sustainability issues.\n\nThe game will be available first on PC before VR headsets and, hopefully, mobile devices.\n\nTapping into the play-to-earn trend\n\nLike the play-to-earn crypto game, Axie Infinity, Astra will make money through protocol profits too. Revenue is generated via fees for interacting with a protocol\u2014a game\u2019s unique crypto token.\n\nAxie Infinity made huge profits using a similar approach this year. The leading crypto game has raked in $84.9 million in funds, making its protocol profit one of the biggest in the market. In the case of Axie Infinity, whenever a player sells one of the Axie creatures, he pays a 4.25% marketplace fee. He does this when he sells land or special items. Another way Axie makes money is through the fee of 4 AXS, the game\u2019s native token for \u201cbreeding\u201d more digital creatures called Axies.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ventures Platform launches a $40m fund, invites Seni Sulyman as venture partner",
          "text": "As far back as 2005, Kola Aina knew he wanted to invest in companies. He even registered a company name after his MBA program\u2014one which he\u2019s too embarrassed to share and ended up not using. After a number of rejections, unreplied messages, and bootstrapping his first business, Kola Aina launched Ventures Platform, an early-stage pan-African VC firm, in 2016.\n\nToday, Ventures Platform, announced a $40m fund for African tech startups. The new fund which has reached the first close is being led by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).\n\nThe fund features participation from experienced investors and some new leading names in Africa\u2019s technology and corporate ecosystem,, including UAC Nigeria, VFD Group, Gbenga Oyebode, Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, as well as global investors like Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, and Adam Draper. A sizable portion of the fund comes from local partners, Ventures Platform told TechCabal.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Ventures Platform has backed almost 70 startups including Seamless HR, PiggyVest, Mono, and Paystack\u2014which Stripe acquired in October 2020 for over $200m.\n\nThis new fund will allow Ventures Platform to significantly deepen its long-standing presence in Nigeria and West Africa while also investing in select companies in East, North and Francophone Africa that are able to expand across the continent.\n\n\u201cPrior to this fund, we could only write one cheque, then introduce the entrepreneur to our network of investors for a follow-on round. Now we\u2019re not only able to write their first cheque but also write follow-on rounds for our companies,\u201d Kola Aina, founder and General Partner at Ventures Platform, told TechCabal.\n\nThis new capital injection will enable Ventures Platform to double down on existing investments in its category-leading portfolio via subsequent rounds. Aina believes that being able to double down on existing investments means they can assure startups that they have a long-term capital partner. It also helps Ventures Platform defend their ownership stake in the companies, as they can participate in the upside they helped build, which is important from a returns perspective.\n\nAs part of a move to further deepen its expertise, Ventures Platform has also onboarded leading figures across African tech as Venture Partners, including Seni Sulyman (ex-VP at Andela, founder at Black Ops.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very bullish about the market; it\u2019s about the entrepreneur first. Across our portfolio, we now have two companies whose entrepreneurs we\u2019ve funded twice. We funded their first project, it didn\u2019t work; we\u2019ve funded them again,\u201d Aina said.\n\nAina has a heart for entrepreneurs as he\u2019d been one before becoming an investor.\n\nFascinated by the power of capital\n\n\u201cI was just always fascinated by the power of capital. I always wanted to end up being an investor, even when it wasn\u2019t popular.\u201d\n\nWhat attracted Aina to investing? It was the notion of giving people money and seeing them build something meaningful with it.\n\nIn 2009, Aina moved back from the US to Nigeria and co-founded Emerging Platforms, a software company. Initially, they had some customers willing to pay, but the business needed funding. They tried to raise funds but faced rejection at every corner.\n\n\u201cWe wrote a letter to every bank in Nigeria, got introductions but everyone said no. So, we went back to the drawing board and bootstrapped the business.\u201d\n\nThe harrowing experience of fundraising stayed with Aina and ignited the desire to change how people got access to capital in Africa.\n\nMaking new mistakes\n\nFortunately, the bootstrapped business thrived and Aina started angel investing in 2014. Two years later, he had an epiphany that waiting for the government and donors to solve society\u2019s problems was pointless. A better alternative was to find and fund young people using technology to solve these problems.\n\nInspired by Silicon Valley-esque accelerators, Ventures Platform was born in 2016. The initial approach was to get the best entrepreneurs from across Africa to fly into a campus in Abuja for a 16-week acceleration program. They were paired with investors, team members, capital, and mentors.\n\n\u201cObviously everyone told us acceleration is too difficult to do in Africa, but we told them we\u2019ll make new mistakes.\u201d\n\nWhile making new mistakes, they also got a few things right. One of the things Ventures Platform did then that was pioneering and different was that it was fully transparent with its terms of investing in startups. It offered $20,000 for 10% equity.\n\n\u201cAt that time it was one of the fairer deals out there,\u201d Aina said.\n\nThis transparency helped ventures attract talents like Kayode Oyewole, partner at Ventures Platform and Fola Olatunji-David, who later left the firm to become Head of Startup Success and Service at Google. Aina also believes that sharing the firm\u2019s manifesto helped move the market forward in setting the terms of evaluation for pre-seed companies in Africa.\n\nAlongside the accelerator, Aina continued investing and got to invest in startups like Paystack, Kudi, Kangbe (now Reliance HMO), Printivo and Tizeti.\n\nAfter the first year, Aina and his team saw that the accelerator wasn\u2019t ideal for the continent, so they pivoted to an early-stage fund model.\n\n\u201cWith people living together on campus, you\u2019re not just investing and helping people scale their businesses, you\u2019re also dealing with personalities. It was almost like the Big Brother House but for investing.\u201d\n\nNotably, the initial capital used to run the accelerator and invest in startups was Aina\u2019s personal funds. He had to have a conversation with his wife telling her that he needed to raid their savings to support startups.\n\n\u201cWe did over a million dollars in investments in the early days. But, in retrospect, that was a smart decision because it helped us show a track record.\u201c\n\nBy late 2017, Ventures Platform started raising external capital: syndicate funds. This happened because people who were impressed with the performance of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies wanted to invest in Ventures Platform.\n\nThe syndicate style investments continued until mid last year when Aina felt it was time for Ventures Platform to start working on raising its first institutional fund.\n\nWhy did he wait this long to raise an institutional fund?\n\n\u201cI wanted to see evidence that there\u2019s liquidity in this market before I raised an institutional fund. Startups are not just about inspiration or motivational talk. It\u2019s real business. Startup founders sometimes forget that I have to return money to my investors.\u201d\n\nWhy $40m matters\n\n2021 has been a record year for African startups as they\u2019ve raised over $4 billion so far. It\u2019s easy to see $40m, in an era where $100m raises are the new normal and wonder \u201cWhat difference does $40m make?\u201d\n\nAina believes that while the increase in capital inflow is important, the venture capital space needs to be seen as a continuum. For him, Venture Platforms\u2019 role is to find companies early and support them along the way as they gain product-market fit and look to scale.\n\n\u201cThere was a period when a company raising $500,000 was huge. Five years ago, you could count the number of local funds in the market. I think it\u2019s day one for this fund. We must not get ahead of ourselves. We want to stay disciplined. We\u2019re very clear about our thesis and are staying grounded to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, technology has had a strong role in how we create, distribute, and consume works of art. Music, for example, has gone from stringed cassette tapes that\u2019ll go on to become a child\u2019s plaything (if you\u2019re me) to being globally available with a simple tap.\n\nOne of the most profound effects technology has had on music is blurring the geographical boundaries that set sounds from different cultures apart, making music truly universal.\n\nIt\u2019s no doubt technology has aided major paradigm shifts in every industry, rendering applauded methods of doing things obsolete and establishing another method as the status quo. But at the point where music is now, it\u2019s hard to think of innovations that will disrupt the current model of music creation, distribution, and consumption.\n\nBut after a closer look and talking to some of the industry\u2019s brightest, the signs are there \u2014 the next frontier for music tech may be closer than we imagine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t predict the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nMusic is in a very exciting place right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Marcela Laskoski on Unsplash\n\nWhile Victor Okpala, who recently became Spotify\u2019s Artist & Label Partnerships Manager, West Africa, sees amazing things coming to African music tech, he\u2019s still pretty excited about where things are right now. Okpala is also the Founder of Nabsolute Media, a communication and marketing agency.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he started with the subject of monetisation and said artistes can now truly live off their music.\n\n\u201cFor example, we know how bootlegging used to work. A huge percentage of the people that consume music in Nigeria downloaded them from free websites. It was something illegal that somehow got normalised. But we are moving to a place where people see the value in music enough to pay for it.\n\n\u201cApart from the traditional streams of income which were live shows and endorsements, the music itself is able to bring in revenue as a product.\u201d\n\nBootlegging or piracy is the illegal manufacture, distribution or sale of goods. It has been a thorn in the flesh of Nigerian artistes for years. The amount lost to piracy runs into millions of dollars every year.\n\nAdeyemi Adetunji, a lawyer who is also Audiomack\u2019s Manager of Operations and Commercial Partnerships, is just as excited about African music.\n\nAccording to him, he knew afrobeats would become a thing when he was a DJ, playing the songs to an international audience back in the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would play them Wande Coal, P-Square, and D\u2019banj songs all the way back in 2011, and I just felt like the music was resonating with people, so I knew there was something there.\u201d\n\nAdetunji is particularly pleased that Nigerian musicians were maximising the opportunities technology presented. From building a strong following to connecting with fans on a deeper level.\n\nInternational collaborations and more international award nominations are also exciting phenomena in music right now. Adetunji beams with excitement as he recounts how the international collaborations that only started trickling in in 2010, are becoming the norm today.\n\n\u201cAll the new school kids are doing that a lot now, the Fireboys, the Remas and Omahlays. They\u2019re really big on that.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Okpala, the next frontier for music is that it will be viewed more as a product. He said it\u2019s currently seen solely as a form of art that doesn\u2019t drive enough investment in the industry. Ultimately, he believes the music industry is worthy of the same attention investors pay to fintech or healthtech, for example.\n\nA study by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) published on November 17, 2020, revealed that music supports two million jobs and contributes \u20ac81.9 billion ($91.69 billion) to the European economy annually.\n\nIn the US, music contributes even more to the economy. According to a 2021 study by the Recording Industry Association of America, music contributes $170 billion to the US GDP annually and supports 2.5 million jobs.\n\nThis is possible due to robust investments in the industry. In the US, record companies invested more than $4.5 billion in the industry in 2015.\n\nWhile Nigeria cannot boast such levels of investment, the state of the music industry signals that more investments could have a positive impact on the economy. Per Statista, motion picture and music recording made up $1.8 billion out of Nigeria\u2019s GDP.\n\nIn terms of revenue, the music industry raked in $40 million in 2021. This number is projected to reach $44 million in 2022. Interestingly, there are now data points that can be used to predict investment in music. As Okpala points out, this will aid more investments as there is enough data for investors to bet on.\n\n\u201cAs an investor, if you\u2019re about to invest in an artiste that has, say, 10,000 monthly listeners and 1 million monthly streams on Spotify, you can calculate his monthly revenue to be $5,000. So, if you decide to invest $5,000 towards branding, marketing, and extending reach with the goal of multiplying your audience, you can predict what the revenue could look like.\u201d\n\nHe adds that gone are the days when investors had to bet on just talent as it is never enough.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that come into play when it comes to the success of an artiste, which could be the name, the branding, the story, and the content, of course.\u201d\n\nMusic, blockchain, and the metaverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@zarakvg?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Zarak Khan</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/music-streaming?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a></span>\n\nWhile Adetunji believes no one knows tomorrow and doesn\u2019t like to make bold statements about the future, he indicates that the advent of Web3 and blockchain might have a strong role to play in the future of music.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing blockchain innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) disrupting the music space.\n\nWhile Okpala agrees that these technologies will play a big part in music, he believes that the future is still very far away. Streaming, on the other hand, isn\u2019t going anywhere soon but will only get better.\n\nNot only is it the current frontier, it\u2019ll most likely still be the next frontier. The convenience streaming brings to music is probably why it\u2019s playing a big role in music growth now.\n\nGlobal streaming revenues have grown by 42% since 2015, surpassing the entire recording industry, which has only grown by 9% in the same amount of time.\n\nAdetunji and Okpala are optimistic about the future of African and Nigerian music, one where tech will definitely determine what the next frontier will be.\n\nWith such interesting predictions, I can\u2019t wait to see more experts from the music scene share their thoughts at Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nYou can also be a part of Techpoint Build 2021, the biggest tech event in West Africa, by registering here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nOgheneruemu, Bolu, and Chimgozirim here.\n\nYou are probably wondering why all three of us are writing this newsletter. Yes, we are all hale and hearty. Hearts working fine, livers functioning perfectly, and all of that. This is the last time this year we get to write the Techpoint Digest, and we decided to give you a triple whammy.\n\nOluwanifemi and Emmanuel would do a final wrap up tomorrow, but for the last time this year, from the three of us:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, we\u2019re discussing:\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s shiny new Data Protection Act\n\nProblems in the metaverse\n\nA Bitcoin trust fund\n\nAfDB\u2019s $170m loan\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s Data Protection Act\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Succo on Pixabay\n\n\u201cAfrica is a dumping ground for technologies produced elsewhere.\u201d These first nine words of this article by Privacy International probably accurately sum up one of Africa\u2019s biggest problems.\n\nA perfect example is social media. As of December 2020, 255 million Africans used Facebook. Although these numbers appear small compared to the continent\u2019s population of over a billion people, you also have to consider other challenges such as smartphone penetration and Internet coverage.\n\nTo put all of this in perspective, that\u2019s 255 million datasets in the hands of a foreign entity. I want to re-emphasise that number, but I also want to avoid my sub-editor\u2019s wrath.\n\nSo here\u2019s the thing, Africa needs to protect its citizens\u2019 data from breaches, theft, and several other issues. Thankfully 27 out of 55 countries on the continent have enacted data protection laws and regulations. Although some are yet to enforce these laws, we are off to a good start.\n\nRecently, on December 3, 2021, Zimbabwe joined the ranks of African countries with a data protection law.\n\nFor this month\u2019s Privacy Roundtable, I talked to Nellie Tiyago, a Zimbabwean lawyer, on some of the Act\u2019s provisions and also tried to understand the intriguing decision to include cybersecurity sections.\n\nTake a look: A Zimbabwean Data Protection Act to rule them all. Or not\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProblems in the metaverse\n\nWhat is the metaverse? According to Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadal, the metaverse allows us to \u201cembed computing into the real world and to embed the real world into computing.\u201d\n\nIt is a platform, technology, or even a concept that takes the Internet beyond looking through a screen and actually being inside it. Interacting with people as if it were real.\n\nSame problems, different technologies: While the metaverse makes interactions more intimate, it also amplifies issues such as privacy, cyberbullying, or harassment that already exists online.\n\nDoes it? Oh, yes. According to The Verge, a beta tester for Horizon Worlds, Meta\u2019s (formerly Facebook) virtual reality (VR) powered metaverse claimed a stranger inside the virtual world groped her avatar.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cSexual harassment is no joke on the regular Internet, but being in VR adds another layer that makes the event more intense.\u201d\n\nAlthough Meta says the beta tester didn\u2019t make use of the safety features provided by Horizon, the incident proves that such problems should be a concern for creators of virtual worlds.\n\nWhy does this matter? Meta\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that the metaverse \u201cwill be the successor to the mobile Internet.\u201d if his predictions are anything to go by, then care needs to be taken before the metaverse becomes mainstream.\n\nJack announces \u20bftrust board\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter ex-CEO, Jack Dorsey\n\nTwitter\u2019s ex-CEO, Jack Dorsey, has announced the board of a Bitcoin trust fund, \u20bftrust, he set up with American rapper and business mogul, Shawn Carter aka, Jay-Z.\n\nWho are they? The board, which has four members, includes three Nigerians \u2014 Abubakar Nur Khalil, Obi Nwosu, and Ojoma Ochai \u2014 and a South African, Carla Kirk-Cohen.\n\nKhalil is a 22-year-old Bitcoin Core contributor, an open-source project where contributors propose upgrades to the Bitcoin client or software.

          "text": "The expected combination of Flour Mills Nigeria (FMN) and the flour mills unit of Honeywell Flour Mills plc (HFMP) will form a formidable entity and an unassailable market leader in the agro-allied sector in Nigeria, according to industry players and market analysts.\n\nLast month, Flour Mills announced it had reached a deal to acquire the flour mills business of Honeywell in an N80 billion deal that will significantly enhance its market leadership.\n\nFMN is believed to hold about 40 percent of the flour business in Nigeria and its leadership in the sector will become even more secure following the combination with Honeywell Flour, which has a production capacity of 835,000 metric tons of food per annum.\n\nBusinessDay learns that the deal has been helped by several factors including the fact that the combination is seen as a \u201cstrategic fit\u201d and also the leaders of the two businesses including their chairmen have known themselves for a very long time. They have mutual respect for each other.\n\nIn full year ended March 2021, the turnover for the two was N771.6 billion for Flour Mills and N109.59 billion for Honeywell Flour, and the combination will see FMN emerge as a true continental giant, amassing substantial value for shareholders and huge economic benefit for Nigeria.\n\nRead Also: Honeywell, Flour Mills N80bn merger to boost Nigeria\u2019s food production\n\nFMN, established in 1960, prides itself of being in the vanguard of feeding the nation for the past 60 years.

          "title": "The many legal battles of Ecobank and Honeywell",
          "text": "The lawyers for both Ecobank and Honeywell Group are pushing several cases against each other in connection with the dispute over the settlement of claims of N5 billion by the bank against Honeywell as well as an unrelated matter of the sale of shares held originally in what is today\u2019s Airtel Nigeria plc.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, Honeywell wrote to Ecobank accepting the terms for the resolution of the claim by the bank agreed at the meeting held the day earlier and saying, \u201cwe confirm our agreement to pay the sum of N3.5billion as full and final settlement of our indebtedness to your bank. As part of the verbal agreement reached at the meeting, we shall immediately pay the sum of N500million towards the facilities. We propose that the balance of N3 billion be paid in three equal half yearly payments.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Ecobank sent back a response in which the bank said, \u201cplease note that the agreement was for a full and final payment of N3.5 billion to be part paid immediately by \u2013 N500 million on Monday, July 22, 2013, and the balance to be paid immediately thereafter before the CBN examiners leave the bank.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the payment became a big issue and this saw both parties moving their wranglings to the court on October 16, 2015, via a suit by Ecobank before Justice Tsoho seeking to wind up Honeywell.\n\nRead Also: Ecobank warns FMN against Honeywell acquisition deal\n\nHowever, both parties began to get public attention for their dispute after Ecobank secured an ex-parte motion to restrain Honeywell and Oba Otudeko from operating their accounts in all banks and financial institutions and an order directing their respective banks to furnish Ecobank with details of their accounts in the banks.\n\nThis same bank-customer dispute was submitted to the subcommittee of ethics and professionalism of the Bankers\u2019 Committee for adjudication and ruling was issued in favour of Honeywell, but Ecobank in a letter dated November 14, 2014, maintained that \u201cduring a recent CBN/NDIC review of the bank, the accounts were flagged and that the CBN had insisted that the amount outstanding be paid without further delay.\u201d\n\nOn August 6, 2015, Honeywell filed a suit before Justice M. B. Idris in which it sought an interim injunction to restrain Ecobank from making any representation suggesting that it owed the bank and on August 10, 2015, the interim injunction was granted and both parties ordered by the court to maintain status quo.\n\nFollowing this, Ecobank filed a preliminary objection on the basis that the Federal High court lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute and on December 11, 2015, the court presided by Justice Idris held that the Federal High court had jurisdiction to hear the matter. Ecobank immediately appealed this decision.\n\nOn October 16, 2015, Ecobank filed two separate suits before Justice Abang. On this same day, Ecobank filed another two petitions before Justice Yunusa who on December 4, 2015, varied the ex-parte orders by granting Honeywell Flour Mills restricted access to its banks accounts allowing the company to take no more than N15 million weekly.\n\nWorried by the orders of Justice Yunusa, Honeywell petitioned the National Judicial Council alleging judicial misconduct arising from what the company called, \u201cthe unfair and unlawful exercise of his discretion.\u201d\n\nAfter this petition to the NJC, Ecobank\u2019s lawyer wrote to Honeywell demanding a copy of the petition. This got Honeywell thinking that something was amiss.\n\nSensing that Ecobank\u2019s lawyers might be attempting to use the administration of justice to blackmail Honeywell into submission, on April 7, 2016, Honeywell petitioned the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee also known as the Body of Benchers.\n\nIn the petition, the company said, \u201cin view of the critical role of the judiciary in preserving the sanctity of the law and in light of the facts set out above, we respectfully urge you to conduct an investigation into Mr Kunle Ogunba\u2019s conduct with respect to this dispute and to take such disciplinary actions as are necessary in line with Section 11 of the Legal Practitioners Act CCAP L11. LFN 2004) to ensure that the integrity of the legal profession is preserved.\u201d\n\nAt an emergency meeting held on September 15, 2017, the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee adjudicated on the matter and in a statement dated 11/1/2018 and signed by Hadizatu Mustapha, Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court, the committee said as follows, \u201cHoneywell Group petitioned Kunle Ogunba SAN alleging professional misconduct against him. The misconduct alleged consists of the institution of multiplicity of proceedings before different judges of the Federal High Court on the same subject with the deliberate aim of abusing the process of court and derailing the course of justice. This is to further notify the general public that after a thorough investigation of the petition by the sub-committee set up by the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee (at which the respondent was given a fair hearing) it was decided that the petition is meritorious.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee at its 129th plenary meeting sanctioned the senior lawyer, withdrawing a set of privileges from him forthwith.\n\nHoneywell is also in court pressing damages claim against Ecobank for harm to its interests arising from the ex-parte order granted against it and which has now been made voided by courts including the Supreme Court.\n\nOn July 13, 2018, justices of the Supreme Court made two rulings, both in favour of Honeywell.\n\nIn one, suit number SC.401/2016, which was an appeal by Honeywell against the ruling of a lower court in favour of Ecobank, the justices in the ruling read by Amiru Sanusi upheld the appeal.\n\nIn another ruling delivered by John Inyang Okoro, the Supreme Court justices reviewed an appeal brought before them by Ecobank in relation to the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered on March 30, 2016, said inter alia, \u201chaving resolved all five issues against the appellant (Ecobank) , I hold that this appeal lacks merit and is hereby dismissed. I affirm the decision of the court of appeal delivered on 30th March, 2016.\u201d\n\nIn doing so, the Supreme Court justice said, \u201cHonestly, I have tried to understand the complaint of the appellant in this issue but it appears to be the more you look, the less you see.\u201d\n\nIn an unrelated matter, Honeywell and Ecobank are also in court over the sale of Airtel shares by Ecobank to Bharti Airtel for $28 million. Honeywell claims that as at the time the shares were sold to Delta State government, which then sold to Oceanic Bank (acquired by Ecobank), there was a subsisting shareholder agreement that stipulated that existing shareholders were to be given rights of first refusal.\n\nHoneywell is now asking that the court compel Ecobank to deposit the $28 million proceeds from the share sale into the accounts of the court until the determination of the substantive suit brought by Honeywell.",

If you are going to replace some of the critical facilities like ballot boxes and voting cubicles, these things must be done before the elections.\n\n\u201cParty primaries must be conducted and concluded before the elections and names of candidates submitted, registration of voters would have to be concluded before the elections.\n\n\u201cPrinting of Permanent Voters Cards would have to be concluded before the elections and some of the critical election technology must be concluded and procured before the elections,\u2019\u2019 Mr Yakubu said.\n\nMeanwhile, in his remarks, committee chairman, Jibrin Barau (APC-Kano North) said the required appropriation would be made for the electoral body in the 2022 budget.\n\nMr Barau assured that the report of the committee on the 2022 budget proposals would be laid in plenary at both chambers on Tuesday, \u201dconsidered and passed,\u201d NAN reported.",

          "text": "Access Bank, the largest Deposit Money Bank in Nigeria by total assets has concluded plans to join the league of financial institutions that have transited to Holdco firms.\n\nShareholders of Access Bank Plc recently approved the restructuring of the Group into a non-operating financial holding company structure, Access Holding Company.\n\nAt a Court-Ordered Meeting held at the Access Tower in Victoria Island, Lagos, on Thursday, shareholders of the financial institution voted in favour of the corporate reorganisation, which would result in shareholders holding shares in the Holdco in the same proportion as their current holdings in the Bank and the Bank\u2019s shares being held wholly by the Holdco, which will be a regulated entity for CBN purposes.\n\nDr Faruk Umar, Dr Faruk Umar, President, and Association for Advancement of Right of Nigerian Shareholders, applauded the move of the Bank to become a holding company while noting that the diversification was a welcomed one which would take the financial institution to greater heights given the manner the board had managed the bank so far.\n\nHe noted that the diversification would bring more profitability to the institution, given the quality of the members of the board, thus more returns for the investment of shareholders.\n\nPatrick Ajudua, National Chairman, New Dimension Shareholders Association, also said the new development would be of great value to the bank, the shareholders and all stakeholders, adding to despite the security situation of the country and other parameters, the bank would achieve its objectives of group.\n\nMrs Bisi Bakare, Chairman, Pragmatic Shareholders Association of Nigeria, appreciated the board and management of the bank for proposing under the restructuring scheme to give shareholders one HoldCo share in exchange for every one scheme share, which would be transferred to the HoldCo without any further act or deed by shareholders.\n\nEarlier at the meeting, the Chairman of Access Bank Plc, Dr Ajoritsedere Awosika, explained that the Board considered the restructure to be the most appropriate approach to create greater strategic flexibility and diversification of the Group\u2019s revenues, adding that the restructured group would have a structure like that of some major global financial institutions, including those that Access Bank considers to be its peers and competitors.\n\nShe noted that HoldCo structure ensured full compliance with CBN\u2019s Regulation on the Scope of Banking Activities and Ancillary Matters, which repealed the Universal Banking Guidelines and limited the ability of banks to undertake non-banking business, and Guidelines for Licensing and Regulation of Financial Holding Companies in Nigeria, 2014.\n\n\u201cDue to its oversight function, the HoldCo structure would facilitate the business growth of the banking group and expansion of services into underpenetrated regions in Nigeria, Africa and beyond,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that other considerations of the restructure include diversification into permissible financial services as it enables Access Bank to diversify its business portfolios into new areas within the financial service industry that are permissible by the CBN HoldCo regulation; as well as into Risk management which would ring-fences each business from the risks of the other, by preventing the business performance of one business from affecting the performance and valuation of another.\n\nAlso, she said the restructure would ease funding as it would facilitate a consolidated financial strength of the Group, which would improve access and ability to raise capital with benefits including lower transactions costs.\n\nOther benefits according to Dr Awosika includes capital allocation and speed in decision making as the Bank is unburdened by the oversight functions and responsibilities of managing the subsidiaries and ensuring the Bank is solely focused on its core operations.\n\nAccess Bank, the largest bank by assets solidly grew its Profit Before Tax (PBT) by 30 percent to N60.1 billion in the first quarter 2021, from N46.2 billion recorded in the same period last year, an impressive performance despite the challenging operating environment.\n\nThe banks profit before tax saw a significant increase of 31per cent y/y to N97.5billion (H1 2020: N74.3billion).\n\nIn the third quarter ended September 30, 2021, the bank\u2019s Profit before tax grew by 16% to N135bn from N116.623billion in 2020.\n\nWhile its Interest Income grew by 24% to N395bn from N318bn in the previous quarter, Profit after tax grew by 19% to N122bn.\n\nIn the same vein, Net Assets grew by 6.4% from N751bn to N799bn.

          "text": "By KEN EMORDI\n\nStanbic IBTC Holdings PLC, a member of Standard Bank Group, is now offering pragmatic loan solutions to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria.\n\nThe introduction of this loan offer essentially complements the bouquet of product offerings by Stanbic IBTC, as it aims to be the leading end-to-end financial solutions provider in Nigeria.\n\nThe creation of this credit solution is geared towards encouraging SME growth in an ever-evolving economy. SMEs are the backbone of most economies, particularly in developing countries. These enterprises account for many businesses in nations as they are significant contributors to job creation and economic development.\n\nIn Nigeria, SMEs contribute over 48 per cent to the national gross domestic product (GDP) and account for about 96 per cent of businesses, which in turn creates about 84 per cent of employment in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nDespite the substantial contribution of SMEs to the Nigerian economy, challenges still abound that hinder the growth and development of the sector. These challenges include limited access to capital and financing, inadequate public infrastructure, and recently, the COVID -19 pandemic. The pandemic caused several distortions to the economic framework of the country, causing several startup businesses and SMEs to fold up.\n\nFurthermore, the Nigerian business terrain is very challenging. According to a World Bank report, Nigeria ranked 131 out of 189 countries in the 2020 Ease of Doing Business index. In addition, access to finance is a key constraint to SME growth.\n\nThese challenges have driven Stanbic IBTC to introduce the SME short term loan facility. The SME loan is aimed at augmenting working capital to finance various business projects and bridge urgent cash flow needs.\n\nThis initiative enables SMEs to take loans with ease and convenience. It also offers benefits which include repayment flexibility and limited documentation with no collateral. The ease of accessibility to funds is worthy of mention, as this solves one of the key issues facing small and medium scale businesses in Nigeria which is access to adequate funding.

          "text": "By KEN EMORDI\n\nStanbic IBTC Holdings PLC, a member of Standard Bank Group, is now offering pragmatic loan solutions to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria.\n\nThe introduction of this loan offer essentially complements the bouquet of product offerings by Stanbic IBTC, as it aims to be the leading end-to-end financial solutions provider in Nigeria.\n\nThe creation of this credit solution is geared towards encouraging SME growth in an ever-evolving economy. SMEs are the backbone of most economies, particularly in developing countries. These enterprises account for many businesses in nations as they are significant contributors to job creation and economic development.\n\nIn Nigeria, SMEs contribute over 48 per cent to the national gross domestic product (GDP) and account for about 96 per cent of businesses, which in turn creates about 84 per cent of employment in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nDespite the substantial contribution of SMEs to the Nigerian economy, challenges still abound that hinder the growth and development of the sector. These challenges include limited access to capital and financing, inadequate public infrastructure, and recently, the COVID -19 pandemic. The pandemic caused several distortions to the economic framework of the country, causing several startup businesses and SMEs to fold up.\n\nFurthermore, the Nigerian business terrain is very challenging. According to a World Bank report, Nigeria ranked 131 out of 189 countries in the 2020 Ease of Doing Business index. In addition, access to finance is a key constraint to SME growth.\n\nThese challenges have driven Stanbic IBTC to introduce the SME short term loan facility. The SME loan is aimed at augmenting working capital to finance various business projects and bridge urgent cash flow needs.\n\nThis initiative enables SMEs to take loans with ease and convenience. It also offers benefits which include repayment flexibility and limited documentation with no collateral. The ease of accessibility to funds is worthy of mention, as this solves one of the key issues facing small and medium scale businesses in Nigeria which is access to adequate funding. The temporary overdraft provides financial credits to both new and existing customers within 24 hours, with a maximum loan repayment duration of 90 days.\n\nThe loan solution offers speedy, robust funds to prospective customers, including entrepreneurs, who are seeking urgent funds or temporary overdrafts to cater to their commercial needs.\n\nStanbic IBTC is positioning itself to support SMEs to enable aspiring and emerging entrepreneurs in Nigeria sustain their businesses while also facilitating the development of an enabling business environment and thriving ecosystem.

          "text": "The Federal Government has said it has digitalised payments for Nigerian Passports, advising citizens to avoid patronising touts and unscrupulous officials when applying for the documents.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, during the rollout of the Enhanced e-Passport with Polycarbonate Data Page and other security features in Ibadan, Oyo State on Monday.\n\n\u201cPart of the reforms is the migration of passport application and payments to digital platforms. But we regret to observe that applicants still patronise touts and unscrupulous officials in the hope to beat the system and get expedited services. When they were disappointed, they come to report to us. Of course, we have zero tolerance for corruption and subversion of due process. We, therefore, take seriously any such report and invoke the necessary disciplinary measures.\n\n\u201cBut I will implore applicants to stop patronising touts and our officials directly. Follow the process we put in place. Apply for passports and pay online. The only engagement with our staff is the enrolment of your biometrics. Patronising touts and passport office officials doesn\u2019t always end well, but rather serves to defeat our purpose of eliminating corruption and infusing integrity to the passport administration process,\u201d the minister stated.\n\nSpeaking on the new application process, the minister noted that a new timeline has been set for fresh passport application and reissue.\n\n\u201cOur template stipulates maximum of six weeks for obtaining new passports and maximum of three weeks for renewal. We work within this schedule to enable us to investigate any claims made by applicants and verify them, for the final document we issue them to have integrity. If there are challenges, wait. Eventually, you will get your passport before your due date of travel, if you apply early enough. You will still have long enough time to apply for visa and other travel documents.\n\n\u201cNowhere in the world is passport administration done on a wait-and-get basis except in extreme emergencies. The only wait-and-get passport is passport photograph,\u201d the minister stated.\n\nOn the new enhanced passport being rolled out in Ibadan, the minister noted that the passport is an improved document with high-security features.\n\n\u201cThe Enhanced e-Passport is a great improvement on the Biometric Passport technology which Nigeria adopted in 2007 as a deliberate step towards curbing forgery, impersonation and other forms of travel document fraud associated with the old Machine-Readable Passport regime.\n\n\u201cIt is the latest technology in passport making anywhere in the world and only a few countries have it. It is the most secure identity document ever produced. We are proud to make it available to Nigerians,\u201d Aregbesola concluded.\n\nSpeaking during the event, the Acting Comptroller General of the Nigeria Immigration Service, CG Isah Jere, reiterated the call by the minister for citizens to stop patronising touts.\n\n\u201cAs you have heard from the Minister, we expect that the only time citizens will have contact with our officers is during the biometric capturing. You are to apply and pay only,\u201d CG Isah Jere revealed.\n\nAlso speaking, the Governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, who was represented by his Chief of Staff, Mr Segun Ogunbiyi, lauded the efforts of the Nigeria Immigration Service saying the state will continue to support the service in performing its statutory duty.\n\nAlso at the event were the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III; Olubadan of Ibadan who was represented, service chiefs of all the paramilitary services in the state amongst others.

          "title": "Nigerian Army Set To Penalise Detained Female Soldier For Accepting Corper\u2019s Proposal",
          "text": "The Nigerian Army has said that a female soldier who became romantically involved with a male corps member at the National Youth Service Corps Orientation Camp in Yikpata, Kwara State, will be punished for breaking military norms and regulations.\n\nThe Director of Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, in an exclusive chat with The PUNCH on Sunday, said the female officer violated military laws by getting involved in a public display of amorous relationship with a paramilitary trainee \u2013 a corps member.\n\nVideo clips showing a male corps member proposing to a female soldier at the Kwara NYSC camp hit the internet days ago eliciting pleasant reactions from many social media users.\n\nOne of the video clips apparently recorded on the camp\u2019s parade ground showed the yet-to-be-identified corps member holding a ring as he knelt to ask the female soldier to marry him.\n\nM\n\nThe visibly excited spinster, in military uniform, accepted the young graduate\u2019s proposal and the latter went on to insert the ring in his love interest\u2019s finger. The lovebirds later locked themselves in a warm embrace and kissed to the cheery applause of other corps members.\n\nHowever, speaking with The PUNCH on Sunday, the Army spokesman said the female soldier violated the Nigerian Army\u2019s rules and regulations guiding the codes of conduct of military personnel when deployed for duty.\n\nNwachukwu said the female soldier\u2019s action amounted to taking advantage of her trainee, noting that the public would have been outraged and accused the Army of coercion had a male soldier proposed to a female corper during NYSC parade.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe female soldier in question violated the following rules of the NA: fraternisation while on official duty at the NYSC camp. That is, indulging in an amorous relationship with a trainee.\n\n\u201cPersonnel must have served for three years before he/she can qualify for marriage.\n\n\u201cShe disobeyed the Armed Forces of Nigeria standing guidelines and directives for the use of Social Media. Indulging in romance while in uniform.\n\n\u201cHer conduct was prejudicial to good order and military discipline.\n\n\u201cAll the above, if proven are in violation of extant laws with attendant disciplinary and penal implications.\n\n\u201cAs a personnel, her task was to train the Youth Corps members and not to indulge in amorous relationship with any of them. These rules were put in place for the purpose of proper administration and discipline in the Army. If I may ask, what if the soldier was a male? How would the public have perceived his action? Definitely, it would have been perceived as taking advantage of a female Corper, a trainee, put in his care for training.\u201d\n\nThe Army spokesman, however, declined comments on the likely punishment the female soldier might get but said \u201cthe Nigerian Military like all others, has its disciplinary codes, distinct from that of the general society. All personnel have voluntarily undertaken to be bound by this code.\u201d\n\nSome activists including Omoyele Sowore, who shared photos of military officers proposing to their love interests in uniform on Facebook, have since called for the release of the female soldier.\n\nThe Kwara incident occurred some three months after a female soldier, Lt. Chika Anele, dehumanised a female corps member, Ifenyinwa Ezeiruaku, at the 13 Brigade headquarters, Calabar, Cross River State, in September 2021.\n\nIn a viral video, Anele ordered the corps member, who was in her uniform to kneel down as she used a bowl to scoop muddy water from a bucket and poured same on her.\n\nThe Army had condemned the action and said the soldier would be tried for unprofessional conduct but it had yet to make the conclusion of the trial public.\n\nThe NYSC scheme was created in May 1973 by former head of state, Yakubu Gowon, as a tool for healing, reconciliation and nation-building after the horrific experience of the civil war between the Biafran side and the Nigerian State.\n\nThe scheme encourages the posting of graduates to states other than their state of origin as they are expected to mix with people from different ethnic groups, social and family backgrounds, and learn the culture of the indigenes in the location they are posted to.\n\nThe young graduates are camped for three weeks and are drilled in paramilitary skills by soldiers before they are deployed to their places of primary assignments.",

COVID-19 continues to threaten the lives and the livelihoods of Nigerians therefore we must not let our guards down this festive season. We urge Nigerians to take all precautions necessary to ensure we and our loved ones live to celebrate many more events and festivities.\n\n\u201cThe campaign includes the production of key messages, audio and visual materials for wide dissemination. The NCDC urges all individuals, traditional and religious leaders, business owners, the media, transport workers and other institutions and sectors to join the campaign by adopting the key messages and sharing within their networks.\n\n\u201cThe Celebrate Responsibly campaign calls on all Nigerians to take all necessary precautions for a safe and healthy Christmas and New Year celebration.\u201d",

It is hoped that as the economy of these customers improves post-covid 19 lockdown they will resume the settlement of their bills in full,\u201d the report read in parts.\n\nREAD ALSO: Buhari Has No Excuse For Not Signing Electoral Act Amendment Bill, Says Wike\n\nThe Commission further stated that it has through the applicable orders set a minimum remittance threshold (MRTs) for each Disco having adjusted for their tariff shortfall.\n\nAdding that the inadequacies recorded within the period show that DisCos need to improve on their performance as none of them met the minimum remittance threshold.\n\n\u201cWhereas the Discos were expected to remit \u20a6130.66billion (62.99%) to NBET in line with the minimum remittance threshold order, they remitted only \u20a6 91.31billion (44.02%) out of \u20a6207.43billion invoice from NBET.\n\n\u201cTherefore, DisCos\u2019 remittance level, regardless of the prevailing tariff shortfall, was still below the expected MRT.\n\n\u201cNecessary mechanism must be used to nudge the Disco into compliance with the MRT order to avoid a relapse to days of zero remittance from some Discos,\u201d the NERC stated.\n\nThe commission further disclosed that during the second quarter of 2021, a total invoice of \u20a6259.70billion was issued to the eleven (11) DisCos for energy received from the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (\u201cNBET\u201d) and for service charge by MO, out of which a sum of \u20a6130.11billion was settled, representing remittance performance of 50.11%.\n\nThis according to the NERC represents a 1.78 percentage point decrease from the final settlement rate recorded in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nApart from Eko Disco, none of the other DisCos met their expected minimum remittance thresholds (\u201cMRTs\u201d) to NBET in the quarter under review.\n\nOverall, the total Disco remittance to NBET was 76% of the expected total for the quarter.\n\nAs part of its inferences regarding the development, the NERC noted that one of the contributory factors to high ATC&C losses, and hence poor liquidity, is the non-settlement of energy bills by MDAs across the three tiers of government (i.e., Federal, State, and Local Government).\n\nIn the commission\u2019s opinion, an urgent resolution of the MDA debt challenge will improve the Disco liquidity and capacity to settle market invoices.",

          "title": "Fact check: What Court really said about Ikoyi Marriage Registry -",
          "text": "Contrary to misconceptions and misinterpretations, the Federal High Court in Lagos did not bar Federal marriage registries in Ikoyi, Lagos and Abuja from further contracting marriages under the Marriage Act, 2004 in Nigeria.\n\nThis is the correct version of the latest judgment of the Federal High Court delivered by Justice Daniel Osiagor on December 8, 2021, on a suit filed by four local governments in four states who were seeking to stop the federal government from further contracting, celebrating, registering marriages as well as issuing licences to authorise intending parties to marry and issuing marriage certificates, under the Marriage Act.\n\nEti Osa Local Government Council in Lagos State is the first Plaintiff. The three others are the local government areas, where the Federal Government established Federal Marriage Registries \u2013 Egor local LG Council in Edo State, Owerri Municipal LG Council in Imo State and Port Harcourt City LG Council in Rivers State.\n\nIn the case instituted in 2018, the applicants sued the Minister of Interior and the Attorney-General of the Federation. A firm, Anchor Dataware Solutions Limited, was later joined as a third defendant, by an Order of the Court in 2019.\n\nThe reliefs sought included an Order directing the Minister of Interior to transmit or return all marriage certificates issued within the Plaintiffs\u2019 Local Government Councils subsequently after the delivery of a 2004 judgment of Justice Oyindamola Olomojobi of the same Federal High Court, which gave Local Government Registrars exclusive authority to register marriages.\n\nThe Plaintiffs\u2019 6th and 7th prayers also sought an Order for the 1st defendant to return all monies paid by couples since the 2004 judgment to the Plaintiffs\u2019 Marriage Registries for re-issuance, and for the Court to seal all Federal Marriage Registries established in the aforementioned four local governments, or to alternatively restrict Federal Marriage Registries to only issue Licenses to places of public worship for the celebration of marriages.\n\nBut in their legal arguments, the Federal Government through the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation contended that no law either under the Constitution or under the Marriage Act that regulates marriages in Nigeria, gives exclusive authority to a Local Government registrar to contract and celebrate marriages in Nigeria. It added that parties have the option of where to celebrate and contract their marriage.\n\nRESOLUTION\n\nFirst, Justice Osiagor condemned the steps taken by the Interior Minister to enter into a Public Private Partnership Agreement with Anchor Dataware, \u201cwith the primary purpose of establishing marriage registries across states of the Federation.\u201d\n\nThe ministry was also found to have directed the Nigeria Immigration Service to make federal marriage certificates an inclusive eligibility requirement for all married applicants for international passports.\n\nIt also directed marriage registries in the local governments to obtain approval from federal marriage registries so as to continue to conduct marriages in accordance with the marriage act.\n\nThe court described these steps as a complete abuse of power that undermines the constitutional recognition of the three tiers of government in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBy this agreement, the first respondent (ministry of interior) literally outlawed any marriage conducted by the local government (Marriage District) registrars.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first defendant combining with its private partners (third defendant) are metamorphosing from a regulatory agency into a revenue-driven agency in establishing marriage registry to conduct marriages all over the federation within the marriage district (local government areas) reserved for the registrars of marriages in these districts\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is highly condemnable and I so condemn it. The stealthy manner in arrogating marriage territories beyond the statutorily delineated Central Licensing place of worship and undermining the local governments (Marriage Districts) is illegal. Let no minister stealthily and surreptitiously do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cVOYAGE IN FUTILITY\u201d\n\nThe judge said that any Federal marriage registry established by the interior ministry outside the former Federal Capital Territory of Lagos and the present Federal Capital Territory of Abuja is a \u201cvoyage in futility.\u201d\n\nBut, the court issued a perpetual injunction restraining the Interior Minister and his agents from further contracting, celebrating, granting certificates of marriage and registering marriages under the Marriage Act within the plaintiffs\u2019 local government areas, EXCEPT marriages conducted in the registries in Ikoyi and Abuja.\n\nHe, however, refused to grant an Order for the ministry of interior to return marriage certificates it had earlier issued and to also refund the fees paid by couples.\n\nOn the last relief sought seeking the sealing of all federal Marriage registries, the court says, \u201cthere shall be no Federal Marriage Registry in the Marriage Districts (Local Government Councils) save Ikoyi and Abuja Federal Marriage Registry predating the 1999 Constitution, without prejudice to the 1st Defendant\u2019s exclusive powers to issue license to places of public worship to celebrate marriages all over the Federation.\u201d\n\nBut, the Ministry of Interior, says it will appeal the \u201cconflicting and confusing\u201d decision. Dr. Shuaib Belgore, who is the Permanent Secretary/Principal Registrar of Marriages at the Ministry, also appealed to \u201cthe general public, the international community, to couples who had hitherto had their marriages solemnized at Federal Marriage Registries by duly licensed places of worship and to all intending couples to be calm and continue transacting their normal businesses at all Federal Marriage Registries subsisting throughout the federation in line with statutory and constitutional provisions.\u201d\n\nNote:\n\n-Justice Osiagor slams FG for \u201cundermining powers of LGs to conduct marriages\u201d\n\n\u2013 Interior ministry to appeal decision, says federal marriage registries established throughout federation subsists",

The Nigerians, who were traveling on Ethiopian Airlines from the United States to Lagos were told that their connecting flight was full and that they could not continue the trip, promting some of the travellers to protest.\n\nThey were then manhandled, with some handcuffed by Togolese security.\n\nIn another development, a video surfaced online over the weekend, where a woman was heard accusing Ghanaian officials of extortion. The woman claimed that she and other Nigerians held up at quarantine hotel were made to repeat their Covid tests even after they had tested negative; in order to extort money from them..\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter over the weekend, reportedly deleted Nigeria Vice President Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s Tweet, following complaints by the team managing multiple award winning artiste Beyonce Knowles.\n\nOsinbajo had posted a video on March 8th, featuring Beyonce\u2019s song \u2018Run the World\u2019 to mark the 2021 International Women\u2019s Day celebratio\n\nThe tweet, however, did not attribute it\u2019s content to Beyonce, thereby violating twitter\u2019s copyright regulation. The tweet sparked backlash from Nigerians who believed that the vice president should have been more concerned about other pressing issues plaguing the country, prompting them to report the tweet.\n\nFinally, the Nigerian Army has confirmed the detention of a female soldier Private Hanna Sofait, who got romantically entangled with a youth corps member at the National Youth Service Corps orientation camp in Kwara State. Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu said the female soldier\u2019s action amounted to taking advantage of her trainee, noting that the public would have been outraged and would have accused the Army of coercion had a male soldier proposed to a female corper during NYSC parade.\n\nIn a related development, a video of an unidentified soldier proposing to his girlfriend that is now making the rounds on social media.",
