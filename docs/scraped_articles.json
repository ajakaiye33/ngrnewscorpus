          "title": "Climate change: Africa cheated, oppressed, lied to by rich nations \u2014Buhari",
          "text": "The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), speaking at the opening plenary of the COP-26 climate change summit in Glasgow, Scotland said Africa is being cheated, oppressed and lied to by rich nations.\n\nHe said this is despite the continent almost being non-emitters, stressing that it is responsible for a mere five per cent of global emissions.\n\nReminding the developed countries of the pledge to provide at least $100 billion yearly to developing countries, Buhari said Africa has heard enough of the talk from rich nations, saying \u201cit\u2019s high time they walked their talk.\u201d\n\nHe expressed disappointment that some of the world\u2019s biggest emitters, China, with 11 per cent contribution to global warming, and Russia did not attend the summit in person.\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu disclosed this in a statement titled, \u2018@COP26, Nigeria Sends Powerful Message To Rich Nations,\u2019 on Tuesday.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cPresident Buhari\u2019s speech which centred on a number of issues agitating Africa and the developing countries, criticised the rich countries, the major emitters which brought the world\u2019s climate to this sorry state for making promises toward climate finance that till date, have remained hollow.\n\n\u201cThe President told world leaders that the goal of transitioning from fossil fuel to clean energy, reaching a Net zero ambition for green house emission would require critical infrastructure to be in place in developing countries.\n\nShehu quoted Buhari as saying, \u201cParties to the Paris Agreement are expected to transition from fossil fuel to clean energy and reach a Net Zero ambition for greenhouse gases emission.\n\n\u201cWe agree that Net Zero ambition can lead to economic transformation across all sectors. It is a good ambition, but it requires critical infrastructure in place, including for renewable energy. Therefore, in Nigeria, it will take us longer time to get to Net Zero.\u201d\n\nMaking a case for financial support, the President stated that attaining national and global climate change goals would require adequate and sustained technical and financial support to developing countries.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cHe added that greater efforts should be channeled towards assisting developing countries to meet their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) commitments through the pledges made by the developed countries to provide at least $100 billion yearly.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian leader noted that easier access to climate finance had become imperative because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which really battered the economies of developing countries.\n\n\u201cThe USD 100 billion every year to developing countries signed onto from the Paris 2016 climate change accords, as a promise made by the developed countries, has so far proved to be hollow.\u201d\n\nShehu said without coming out to bluntly say so, Buhari pointed out the hypocrisy of the developed world for imposing standards that would clearly stunt development in developing countries.\n\n\u201cMay I recall that the phenomenal growth of industrial economies has been driven by access to stable and abundant supply of relatively cheap energy,\u201d Buhari was quoted as saying.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission has said there is a new android malware gaining access to smartphones and taking control of infected phones.\n\nIn a statement signed by the commission\u2019s Director, Public Affairs, Ikechukwu Adinde, the NCC said the malware is called AbstractEmu and can gain access to smartphones, take complete control of infected smartphones and silently modify device settings while simultaneously taking steps to evade detection.\n\nAccording to the NCC, this discovery was made by the Nigerian Computer Emergency Response Team. The commission claimed that the malware is distributed through Google Play Store and other third-party stores.\n\nThe commission said, \u201cAbstractEmu is distributed via Google Play Store and third-party stores such as the Amazon Appstore and the Samsung Galaxy Store, as well as other lesser-known marketplaces like Aptoide and APKPure.\n\n\u201cThe advisory stated that a total of 19 Android applications that posed as utility apps and system tools like password managers, money managers, app launchers, and data saving apps have been reported to contain the rooting functionality of the malware.\n\n\u201cThe apps are said to have been prominently distributed via the third-party stores and the apps include All Passwords, Anti-ads Browser, Data Saver, Lite Launcher, My Phone, Night Light and Phone Plus, among others.\u201d\n\nAccording to the commission, rooting malware is very dangerous, and uses the rooting process to gain privileged access to an android operating system.\n\nThe NCC added that once installed, the attack chain is designed to leverage one of five exploits for older Android security flaws that would allow it to gain root permissions.\n\nThe NCC said the malware will take over the device, install additional malware, extract sensitive data, and transmit to a remote attack-controlled server.\n\nThe commission said, \u201cAdditionally, the malware can modify the phone settings to give app ability to reset the device password, or lock the device, through device admin; draw over other windows; install other packages; access accessibility services; ignore battery optimisation; monitor notifications; capture screenshots; record device screen; disable Google Play Protect; as well as modify permissions that grant access to contacts, call logs, Short Messaging Service (SMS), Geographic Positioning System (GPS), camera, and microphone.\u201d\n\nThe NCC said ngCERT advises users to be wary of installing unknown or unusual apps, and look out for different behaviours as they use their phones. It added that users should reset their phones to factory settings when there is suspicion of unusual behaviours.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

He got missing on October 13.\n\nDisturbed by the ugly development, the House upon resumption of plenary from its three weeks budget defence session break, through a motion by the minority leader, Ndudi Elumelu, asked the security agencies to do more to find Salem.\n\n\u2018He is professional\u2019\n\nMoving the motion, Elumelu said the sore point for him in the matter was hearing Salem\u2019s daughter saying she needed to wish her father happy birthday.\n\nHe said: \u201cTordue Salem is a member of House of Representatives Press Corps.\n\n\u201cHe works for Vanguard.

The Chairman, Grace raised an alarm and alerted the House leadership.\n\n\u201cMr. Speaker, you also called the IGP and many other security agencies. I remember when I represented you at an event, you asked us to pray for him.\n\n\u201cThe daughter on his birthday was crying to wish his father happy birthday. I was very emotional.\n\n\u201cMr. Speaker, it could happen to anybody.\n\n\u201cRight now, we are guessing. We don\u2019t know what has happened. For me, it is a very disturbing issue.\n\n\u201cIt is a sober issue. We commend people when they do well. But today, we should all rise and call the security men to wake up.\n\n\u201cSo, Mr. Speaker, I want to support that this House pass this resolution and commit to the Service Chiefs to urgently investigate his whereabouts.\u201d\n\n\u2018We will continue to pray\u2019\n\nIn his remarks, the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, said: \u201cThis is something of concern to all of us.\n\n\u201cI have been in touch with the security and will continue.

          "title": "Extortion, intimidation mar COVID-19 vaccination at Lagos centres",
          "text": "We will deal with persons indicted \u2015 LASG\n\nBy Chioma Obinna\n\nMonths after the world had achieved the incredible feat of development of COVID-19 vaccines to stem the tide of the deadly coronavirus infection, the assuming actions of vaccinators in some vaccination centres in Nigeria is however frustrating the nation\u2019s efforts to attain the target of vaccinating 70 percent of eligible citizens by the end of 2022.\n\nThis is because, despite assurances of the State and Federal government that the vaccines should be given at no cost, cost is gradually being attached to it at some centres in Lagos.\n\nBesides the financial extortions being perpetrated at some of the centres, queue-jumping, bad internet, shortage of Green cards is rampant.\n\nAlso, the quest by the health providers to satisfy friends, relatives and top government officials and allies, are gradually marring the process.\n\nSadly, the happenings are not expected in a state like Lagos as the epicentre of the pandemic.\n\nIt is no longer news that the past 12 months have been rough for the country in all aspects of life.\n\nAs of 7th of November 2021, 212,713 cases have been recorded in Nigeria with 2,906 deaths.\n\nIn Lagos, a total of 77, 896 has been recorded with 754 deaths.\n\nNigeria, like many African countries may have been spared the worst of the pandemic, but critical health watchers say any life lost remains tragic.\n\nAccording to statistics from the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, NPHCDA, the Federal Ministry of health, Nigeria needs to vaccinate almost 112 million eligible persons to attain herd immunity against COVID-19.\n\nLooming danger\n\nHowever, a visit to some vaccination centres in Lagos amid growing cases of vaccine apathy among Nigerians was a revelation.\n\nFindings by Good Health Weekly revealed that unsuspecting Lagos residents are being forced to pay to receive the vaccines by unscrupulous government health officials who demand money in the guise of fast-tracking the services.\n\nA visit to some vaccination centres revealed that unwholesome practices were going on. It was discovered that charges from as low as N500 to as much as N10,000 were being demanded from those who wanted to be jabbed. The payments are not receipted.\n\nAt the centres visited, there were no uniform charges and the attitude of some of the officials were unsavoury. Several exhibited a lackadaisical approach to their duties, either reporting late or being impolite to clients.\n\nAt some of the centres visited, the processes were marred by irregularities of sorts, ranging from the internet server being down, out-of-stock for vaccination (green) cards, etc.\n\nCritical stakeholders expressed fears that these sharp practices may further deepen vaccine apathy in the country. They say plans by the Lagos state government to vaccinate at least four million residents by December 2021, may be thwarted by the extortion and unnecessary delays by service providers at some of the vaccinating centres.\n\nA case in point is the Ikate Primary Health Centre in Eti-Osa Local Government Area of Lagos where the norm is that the highest payer gets vaccinated first.\n\nA visit to the vaccination centre was a revelation. Extortion is the order of the day.\n\nAnyone willing to play ball is quickly attended to at the expense of others that are forced to wait on the queue for hours.\n\n\n\nSometimes, residents are forced go back home after waiting for almost a whole day under the guise that they have exhausted the vaccines or serve is down.\n\nNo one is spared. Both the young and the elderly who, against all odds, came to be jabbed are forced to go back home in frustration.\n\nSome of the eligible persons who had visited the centre narrated their experiences to Sunday Vanguard.\n\nSunday 29th of August, 2021, will remain evergreen in the hearts of many residents of the area who besieged the centre to get jabbed.\n\nThese residents stayed away from Sunday worship unfortunately, they were disappointed.\n\nNarrating her experience, one of the residents who simply identified herself as Bola described her experience as a nightmare.\n\n\u201cI was booked for an afternoon session through the online platform to be vaccinated but was not attended to even though she was at the centre an hour before 12:00 noon.\n\n\u201cI struggled to put down my name on the list since I had booked the previous day but I was not even allowed in and eventually, by 12.00pm, we were told that none of those registered for the afternoon session could be vaccinated because the doses had been exhausted. We were told to return the next day being Monday.\u201d\n\nBut what baffled Bola and the others who were still hanging around was that some persons were walking freely into the facility beyond the open areas where the other residents where and were vaccinated right inside the facility.\n\n\u201cWhen I asked one of them after she came out, her exact words were: \u2018Stop begging and find a way to sort them out.\u2019 But I refused, I was disappointed and decided, alongside 28 others, to return the next day, the 30th of August.\n\nHowever, Bola and the others arrived between 6.00- 6:30 am the next day but got the shock of their lives when one of the officials told them they won\u2019t be attended to that morning.\n\n\u201cWe shouted and pleaded because most of us were dressed for work but our pleas fell on deaf ears.\n\n\u201cEventually they started with the Monday list and stopped at number 15 and the others had to wait under the scorching sun to be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bola, there was apprehension and many people resorted to paying the vaccinators sums ranging between N5,000 and N10, 000 in order to be vaccinated that morning.\n\nMost of the illegal transactions were being done through the centre\u2019s perimeter fence.\n\n\u201cOne of the ladies wearing a brown dress who also sells drinks goes through the fence and a nurse too.\n\nI can still remember a woman in blue scrubs who writes the card \u2013 she wears glasses. She is the key negotiator for the woman that is called the big madam who wore pink scrubs. She was said to be the coordinator.\n\nAccording to Bola, some of people who went Sunday and returned Monday morning left by afternoon to report for work out of frustration and the fact that many of us couldn\u2019t afford to pay the exorbitant tips they were demanding for vaccines that are supposed to be free. Meanwhile fresh arrivals had gained access from nowhere.\n\nAnother, resident who pleaded anonymity told Sunday Vanguard that most of the cards were carefully sneaked out from inside already filled and two young men will leave others and stylishly update them and they are vaccinated without a minute\u2019s wait.\u201d\n\nFor her, it was two days of unnecessary torment. She said keeping a large number of people together for a long time without vaccinating them could also aid the spread of the virus the people have come to prevent.\n\n\u201cExcept the government is not prepared for this process, the situation will discourage others.\u201d\n\nThe situation is not different at the Alimosho General Hospital as people were forced to part with N500 to N1000 to quicken their chances of being vaccinated early.\n\nHowever, pandemonium broke out when a woman who reportedly arrived around 6:30 am protested the frustration and humiliation of her and other Lagosians who left their homes early to get vaccinated and have also refused to fall victims of extortion by officials of the vaccination centre.\n\nAround 2:00 PM on 21st October 2021, when Good Health Weekly arrived at the centre, vaccination officers had divide the people present for vaccination into two groups \u2013 one for AstraZeneca, the other for Mordena.\n\nPeople were meant to write their names according to the specific vaccine they received as the firdt dose, while newcomers were also advised to put down their names too.\n\nWhen our correspondent arrived the venue, 27 persons had been administered with Astrazeneca and 20 for Mordena.\n\nEverything went fine until, without explanation, the names of late comers were being called before those that arrived early.\n\nThere was no explanation for this development and protests soon broke out. A middleaged woman who was among the early arrivals who identified herself as Alhaja, angrily challenged the health workers.\n\nShe accused them of collecting money to favour late comers at the expense of the early callers. Alhaja\u2019s outburst caused an uproar at the centre and sparked other allegations.\n\nAll explanations by the workers that the delay was caused by the poor internet server, fell on deaf ears.\n\nIt became a free for all. The environment was tense. Hot exchanges continued between two health workers, Alhaja and another of the waiting women.\n\nThere was confusion amid attempts by the others to settle the discord between the aggreived parties. The vaccination exercise ended abruptly as the vaccinators said everyone should leave the centre. the excuse was that the medical director of the hospital ordered stoppage of the exercise.\n\nAn aggreived client, Amos, told Good Health Weekly that the situation was shameful.\n\n\u201cI came here for my second jab and luckily I was attended to before trouble started. This is a show of shame.\n\nIt will further discourage other Lagosians who would want to come for vaccination and doubts about the vaccines will persist.\u201d\n\nThe situation at other centres was similar. At the Gbagada General Hospital centre, there were no observed cases of financial exploitation, however, the issue of \u2018who knows who\u2019 remained a challenge.\n\nPrecisely on September 29th 2021 when our correspondent visited this centre for her second jab, it was rowdy and there were claims that the server was again down.\n\nOur correspondent observed that some of the vaccination cards of those receiving their second jab were not screened or signed before their owners were vaccinated.\n\nDue to the rowdiness and poor arrangements early callers were left waiting for several hours before being attended to even as some persons were told to return by afternoon.\n\nSlow services\n\nIn several centres visited, the exercise usually begins at 10:00 am rasther than the official time of 8:00 am announced by the state government\n\nAt the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, LUTH, one thing prominent is bad interent. Most people who spoke to our correspondent also complained about late commencement of vaccination.\n\nHowever, it is not all gloomy as more Lagosians have picked the courage to get vaccinated against the early doubts and fears occasioned by conspiracy theories.\n\nAt the Mother & Child Hospital, Festac by 1st Gate, the process was an epitome of orderliness. Both vaccinators and residents organised themselves in an orderly way. There was no case of extortion or other sharp practices but one complain is the fact that they stop vaccinating before the closing time.\n\nSanwo-Olu promises equity\n\nThe Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu had pledged that the core of the campaign in Lagos was to strengthen vaccine equity to ensure that every Lagos resident has a fair chance to fully access the vaccine regardless of who they are or where they are from which is key to seeing the unbearable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThese Lagosians are worried that with the preferential treatment given to people who part with some money to officials at the centre, Sanwo-Olu\u2019s promise for equity and fairness may have been defeated.\n\nSanwo-Olu had emphasised that the vaccines administered in the state\u2019s public health facilities would remain free.\n\nThe Governor further said while the vaccines remain free as they were contributed by the Federal Government through the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency, NPHCDA, and other donors, except in private facilities where a charge of N6, 000 was approved for the administration of the vaccines.\n\nAccording to him, the fee was to allow the private sector recoup the resources deployed in the process of administering the vaccine doses. He urged all Lagos residents to visit the listed public facilities to receive the vaccines at no cost to them; however, those that wish to receive them in the comfort of a private facility can do so at the administrative cost.\n\nLagos Ministry of Health reacts\n\nWhen Good Health Weekly contacted the Permanent Secretary Primary Health Care Board, Dr. Ibrahim Akinwunmi Mustafa, who acknowledged claims of financial inducement at the beginning of the vaccination exercise said the state government will expel any adhoc staff caught extorting money from Lagosians while staff of the ministry will face the full weight of the law according to civil service rules.\n\nIn a telephone chat, Mustafa said: \u201cWe heard about such claims at the initial stage of the vaccination exercise.\n\nOur investigations then showed that it was miscreants lurking around the entrance of the area, but you know our people don\u2019t want to wait for anything rather they are looking for fast services.\n\nSo unscrupulous people capitalised on it and these are not the people you can get hold of.\n\n\u201cAgain, most of the vaccination officers are not our staff but again we cannot say they are equally innocent.\n\nWe have set up a patrol team that goes around the centres to monitor for such things. We have warned them that anyone caught will be dealt with.\n\n\u201cThese are adhoc staff they were just engaged for a short time to do the vaccination exercise. Those once, if we get them we will expel them immediately.\u201d\n\n1.2m Lagosians vaccinated\n\nHowever, a total of 1.2 million Lagosians have been vaccinated with the first dose of either AstraZeneca or Mordena while 550,000 have been fully vaccinated accounting for just about four per cent of the target population.\n\nHowever, the implication according to medical experts is that vaccine hesitancy will not only threaten COVID-19 response but prevent Nigeria from achieving herd immunity.\n\nStakeholders are of the view that for the Campaign which commenced Wednesday 27th October 2021 through December 25th, 2021 to be successful, the government needs to monitor the process and ensure that corrupt officials at the centres are brought to book and stopped from pulling down the process.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

One of them coked his gun and ordered we sat on the floor.\u201d\n\nNwamkpa said they did not lose their valuables.\n\n\u201cI think their concern was simply to enforce the sit-at-home, otherwise, they would have carted away with our laptops, phones, camera and other valuables,\u201d he added.\n\nIn Umuahia, the Abia State capital, shop owners, private schools and other establishments opened for business.\n\nBut in Aba, the commercial centre, government offices, markets, schools, banks and petrol stations did not open for business.\n\nIn Ebonyi State, schools were open within Abakaliki, the state capital.\n\nMarkets and shops at the international market also opened for business, as well as banks.\n\nCourts at the Judiciary Headquarters in Abakaliki opened; civil servants were at their duty posts.\n\nMajor eateries, restaurants and malls in the state capital also opened for business.\n\nBut transport companies did not provide service to states like Enugu, Imo and Anambra.\n\nIn Imo, normal activities returned. At the state secretariat along Owerri-Port Harcourt, workers were at their duty posts.\n\nMajor markets in Owerri metropolis resumed trading activities unlike last Monday when they were closed.\n\nSome traders were seen at the Ekeukwu market in Owerri.\n\nIn Enugu, residents went about their businesses, but some shops did not open until about 3.00 pm.\n\nSome markets, such as Afia Nine, Mayor Market and a few others were open.\n\nHowever, schools, banks and malls were shut, while those that opened had no customers.",

          "text": "The row between governors and Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami (SAN) over the $418 million Paris Club refund debt deepened yesterday.\n\nThe governors under the aegis of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) accused Malami of bias in his handling of the disputed debt allegedly owed private contractors and firms by the 36 states and 774 local governments.\n\nThe consultants were mandated by the Federal Government to negotiate the Paris Club refund with creditor nations.\n\nThe NGF wondered why the AGF was eager to ensure that public funds were transferred to private individuals and entities when the alleged debt was being disputed and is currently a subject of litigation.\n\nLast month, governors had threatened to reject the September allocations to states to protest what they described as unjust proposed deductions from the Federation Account.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFears were rife that states may not be able to pay salaries if the rift with the Federal Government was not resolved.\n\nNGF said the contractors should wait until all appeals and litigations in court are concluded.\n\nThe forum complained that \u201cstate resources needed for critical development should not under any guise be frittered away as payments for contracts, whose veracity and authenticity is still a subject of litigation and disputation\u201d.\n\nAccording to the governors, \u201cthese contractors are impecunious and cannot restitute the states/LGAs if the appeals or other litigation are determined against them\u201d.\n\nNGF added: \u201cWe call on the general public to be alert and vigilant. The debt relief granted to Nigeria by the Paris Club in 2005 was meant to enable her to have a respite and use the resources saved for meaningful development.\n\n\u201cIt was not for distribution to private persons to fund their luxurious lives; neither can Nigeria justify her borrowing funds all over the world to fund capital projects and turn round to disburse state resources to individuals in a manner that offends all public sensibilities.\n\n\u201cWe urge all those appointed as gatekeepers to our laws to ensure that the laws of our land are respected and protected. Let professionalism, reasonable caution and due diligence prevail on this matter.\u201d\n\nAGF\u2019s claims\n\nIn a statement by its Head, Media and Public Affairs, Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, the NGF faulted Malami\u2019s claim that it was lawful for the Federal Government to deduct $418million from the accounts of the 36 states to settle the alleged debt.\n\nThe NGF, while faulting some payments already made to some individuals and entities, argued that the AGF, being a public officer, ought to be driven by the need to protect the public interest and ensure that public funds are not unjustly transferred to private interests with doubtful claims.\n\nThe Forum was reacting to a statement issued at the weekend by the AGF\u2019s media aide, Umar Gwandu, to justify the Federal Government\u2019s planned deduction from states\u2019 accounts to settle private contractors and/or consultants for alleged work done in relation to the Paris Club refunds.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cThe decision by the HAGF to throw his weight behind these consultants who have been battling desperately to grab $418million from the accounts of states and local governments raises questions of propriety and the spirit of justice.\n\n\u201cThe HAGF is supposed to be the chief arbiter in all matters concerning Nigerians, especially the poor masses of this country. It is incumbent upon him to, not just ensure that justice is done, but that justice is seen to have been done.\n\n\u201cThe undue haste, with which the statement was issued, even before the service on the AGF of the court processes and the order dated 5th November, 2021restraining the Federal Government, seems to suggest that there is a special relationship between the Office of the HAGF and the consultants over and above Nigerian citizens, whose interest the AGF as the Chief Law Officer of the Federation is statutorily bound to always protect.\n\n\u201cThe statement also suggests that the restraining order issued last Friday unsettled preconceived plans and angered the unnamed \u2018government officers\u2019 referred to by the media aide.\n\n\u201cThe media aide to the AGF justifies the deductions on the basis that they are made pursuant to four court judgments; two of which are consent judgments and/or that the NGF/States and LGAs consented, expressed no objection to the payments and had already paid part of the debts to the said contractors and consultants.\n\n\u201cThe statement by the media aide to the HAGF however, conveniently and deliberately failed to name the judgments under reference and whether they are on appeal or challenged in any other way.\n\n\u201cHe also failed to specify which of the four judgments authorised payments and in what proportion to each of the contractors.\n\n\u201cWhile it is very easy to argue as the AGF does, that the NGF and ALGON took no early steps to appeal as they should have done, it is important to inform the Nigerian public that State governors have since appealed and are challenging the judgments in various courts.\n\nConstitutional provision\n\n\u201cInterestingly the AGF has been served all these processes, nevertheless, this was ignored and payment was authorized to be made and has been processed with unprecedented speed not common in the public service.\n\n\u201cIt must be stated that between the NGF and AGF, the latter is in more vantage constitutional position and has legal responsibility and burden to defend public interest.\n\n\u201cThe AGF should have, therefore, initiated appeals against the said judgments once his attention was drawn to them because public interest was at stake involving huge sums of money meant for the provision of public services.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that the state governments were not parties to any of the said judgments. It should be further stated that the Office of the AGF failed to professionally defend the cases leading to those judgments and the courts commented on that unprofessional attitude.\n\n\u201cWhile we are constrained not to comment on a subject which is sub-judice, we have a responsibility to the public to respond in some detail to the statement issued by the Office of the AGF in order to put the records straight.\n\n\u201cAny discerning legal mind would find no difficulty in concluding that the so-called judgments under reference are dripping with too many irregularities bordering on competence and lack of jurisdiction which are the bases why some of them are being challenged on appeal and in other courts. No diligent public officer would act on such judgments by recommending payment.\n\nDisputed constultants:\n\n\u201cIt is even more curious that the AGF also recommended payments to some contractors allegedly based on Judgments that did not make any monetary award or on claims that were struck out.\n\n\u201cThe AGF may need to explain to Nigerians why these particular judgment debts are given unusual attention and priority and processed with supersonic speed over and above all others; some of which preceded these so-called judgments and have been pending for settlement by the AGF for several years.\n\n\u201cWhile it is convenient to say that part of these judgment debts have been paid with the release of USD$86,546,526.65 and N19,439,225,871.11 in 2016 and $100m in 2018 to the contractors with the concurrence of the NGF; that does not detract from the fact that they were payments wrongly made which ought not to have been made even if they were products of consent Judgments. States can still go after the contractors to recover the funds wrongly made.\n\n\u201cIt should concern the AGF that ALGON disowned the contracts claimed by RIOK and the same was duly communicated to him requesting him to prevent the use of LG funds to \u201csettle dubious and illegal claims\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cWas the AGF not concerned that several contractors are laying claim to legal fees for the same Paris Club Refund? Was it lost on the AGF on the detailed procedure available under the law how legal fees can be claimed in deserving cases?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the strange payments made is that of USD$47,831,920 million to Panic Alert Security Systems Ltd/George Uboh for allegedly reviewing a 16-page judgment for the then factional NGF. Can the Office of the AGF point to any consent judgment awarding that sum to PANIC Alert? Did the NGF\u2019s letter of 20th January 2020 relied upon by the HAGF ever recommend the payment of any sum?\u201d",

Bashir Magashi (retd) has decried the prevalence of various security issues, which he said were adversely affected food security and posing new dimension of threats to the country.\n\nHe spoke at the opening of a retreat for Defence Advisers/Attaches Conference, organised by the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\nHe said the attacks by Boko Haram Terrorists and Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) in the North East as well as banditry and herder/militia in the North West and Central had continued to pose serious security threats.\n\nAccording to him, the littoral states in the South-South region are plagued with illegal oil bunkering, piracy and militancy while the South-East is challenged with secessionist activities of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nHe added that the South-West region is equally faced with secessionist inclination driven by ethnic agitators as well as occasional tension between herders and farmers.\n\n\u201cThe threats currently facing Nigeria and understanding their socio-geographic context is pivotal for adapting appropriate and lasting counter-measures.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, the prevalence of these threats has continued to endanger not only national security and economic growth, but also food security.\n\n\u201cIn particular, food security has been adversely affected with the attendant rise in the prices of food stuff across the country which portends a new dimension of threat.\n\n\u201cThis makes it imperative for the various security agencies in the country to continue to collaborate to tackle these menaces in order to create an enabling atmosphere for economic activities to thrive and to attract Foreign Direct Investment.\n\n\u201cIt also means that the security agencies must explore all avenues within their respective systems to come up with innovative ways of identifying and confronting the challenges facing us as a nation,\u201d he said.\n\nMagashi said the Defence Advisers/Attach\u00e9s system had crucial roles to play by forging understanding and cooperation with the security and defence architectures in their respective countries of accreditation.\n\nHe said the conference, which theme was \u201cAdvancing Counterterrorism Efforts through Enhanced Inter-Agency Cooperation: A Whole of Government Approach\u201d would provide participants the opportunity to appraise the shared vision of stemming the tide of insecurity through the integrated efforts of all government entities, the objectives of the government approach.\n\nNational Security Adviser (NSA), Maj.-Gen.

Abubakar Ndalolo, said Nigeria had been adopting both kinetic and non-kinetic approaches in dealing with security challenges, adding that both approaches had been yielding results.\n\nHe said that the government also laid emphasis on the integrated approach, which recognised the roles of ministries, departments and agencies as well as the entire society in \u201ctackling our security challenges\u201d.\n\nChief of Defence Intelligence (CDI), Maj.-Gen. Samuel Adebayo, said the conference was an annual event which affords DIA a medium to assiduously review the activities of all its defence sections.\n\nHe noted that the armed forces had made tremendous progress in confronting the nation\u2019s security challenges as evident from the massive surrendering of terrorists in the North East and intensified operations against bandits in the North West and North Central regions. He said the fluid nature of the threats posed by the enemies had reinforced the need for collaborative efforts, be it government to government, within the security Services and even through foreign diplomats and Defence Attach\u00e9s System (DAS).\n\nChairman, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig.-Gen. Buba Marwa (retd) said there was a strong connection between drug and insecurity, saying taking drugs out of the hands of peddlers would reduce the effects on security.\n\nHe said the recent seizure made by the agency revealed that large quantities of drugs used by criminals are finding their ways into the country.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Live Updates: Anambra Governorship Election",
          "text": "TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 2021\n\n10:30am\n\nAll Eyes on Ihiala as INEC Concludes Anambra Governorship Election\n\n\u2022Adjusts voting timeline for supplementary poll \u2022APC alleges rigging, to contest result in Supreme Court \u2022State govt assures Ihiala people of security as billionaire sons, daughters mobilise indigenes in diaspora \u2022CLEEN Foundation seeks improvement in BVAS technology Chuks Okocha in Abuja and David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka With the supplementary poll in the Anambra State governorship election holding today in Ihiala Local Government Area, attention has shifted to the council area, just as interests have heightened among the various stakeholders. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has, in line with extant rules and regulations, announced a slight adjustment to the commencement and closing time for the supplementary election. INEC said polling would now commence at 10am and end at 4pm. The commission had on Sunday declared the November 6 off-time governorship election in Anambra State inconclusive owing to the suspension of voting in Ihiala Local Government Area on account of alleged irregularities. But the All Progressives Congress (APC) accused the candidate of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Professor Chukwuma Soludo, and fellow party man and incumbent governor of the state, Willie Obiano, of rigging the election. However, the state government appealed to the people of Ihiala to come out en masse today to cast their votes, assuring them of adequate security. Meanwhile, CLEEN Foundation said there was need for INEC to improve on logistics and operational challenges associated with the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) to deliver more transparent and credible elections. Ahead of today\u2019s voting, prominent sons and daughters of Ihiala had mobilise indigenes of the area at home and in the diaspora to vote in today\u2019s supplementary election. Last Saturday\u2019s governorship election was declared inconclusive after the exercise was cancelled in Ihiala. Though, Soludo had crossed the threshold requirement for victory after winning 18 out of the 21 local governments areas in the state. Despite the fact that Soludo was in apparent victory, the situation in Ihiala necessitated a supplementary poll to avoid disenfranchising the area\u2019s huge voting population of over 148, 000. Announcing the adjustment to the voting timeline for Ihiala, INEC said, in a statement by its National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, \u201cWe urge political parties, voters, election duty officials, election observers, the media and the general public to note this slight modification. We also appeal to citizens to conduct themselves in an orderly manner to ensure that the election is brought to a peaceful conclusion.\u201d However, Chairman of APC in the state, Basil Ejidike, accused Soludo and Obiano of rigging while rejecting the results so far declared by INEC. It vowed to contest the results to the Supreme Court, if INEC went ahead to declare Soludo winner of the election. Ejidike said APC would never accept the election\u2019s outcome. He called for cancellation of the election. He stated, \u201cWe want the whole world to hear our voice that we will never accept the outcome of the Anambra gubernatorial election. The candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and the sitting Governor, Willie Obiano, manipulated the whole electoral system and we will stand to resist it. \u201cWe virtually won in all the local governments, but Willie Obiano and Charles Soludo, through instrumentality, corrupt-minded INEC officers, subverted the whole process in favour of APGA. \u201cBut if INEC goes ahead to announce the results, we will definitely challenge the election process at the court of law, up to Supreme Court. Nobody can intimidate us.\u201d Ejidike also addressed a press conference in Awka. He said despite the party\u2019s protests, there were no truth in some press statements attributed to the party, and being circulated in the media. He said, \u201cThere have been too many information ascribed to us that is not true. Some people wrote whatever they liked and credited it to the party, when it didn\u2019t come from the party. One of them was the one that said APC has denounced the exercise, and called for cancellation, and the other was that we said we were heading to court to challenge the election. \u201cThere is another one that said that I collapsed, after hearing the result of my ward, where they claimed I lost. I want to make it clear that they were false information. None of them emanated from us. \u201cThe picture saying that I collapsed is false. My polling unit 002 bridgehead market, Onitsha, was won by APC. I had 95 per cent in the unit and even in my ward. If you look at the picture they are circulating, you will know that it has no resemblance of my person at all. Please, discard the information.\u201d But the state government assured the people of security through a public announcement by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Solo Chukwulobelu. Chukwulobelu announced, \u201cThis is to inform the public, particularly, residents and voters in Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed Tuesday, 9th November, 2021 as the date for the 2021 Anambra Gubernatorial supplementary election for Ihiala local government area only. \u201cAnambra State Government, working with relevant security agencies, hereby assure Ndi Ihiala that adequate security arrangements have been made to protect life and property during the election. All are encouraged to come out and vote for the candidate of their choice. \u201cAs Ndi Ihiala may have observed, elections were successfully and peacefully held in the other 20 local government areas of Anambra State and INEC has duly announced the results. No incidence of violence or voter molestation was recorded in the Anambra gubernatorial election, which held on Saturday, 6th November 2021. \u201cAs a reminder, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) had previously cancelled the sit-at-home order earlier announced and encouraged Ndi Anambra to come out and vote. Anambra will continue to remain the light of the nation.\u201d CLEEN Foundation said there was need for INEC to improve logistics and address operational challenges associated with the BVAS. The Non-governmental Organisation (NGO) noted that the election was visibly marred by logistics and operational challenges with regard to the distribution of election materials and late arrival of INEC officials at many of the polling units. The foundation stated that the challenges led to late opening of polling in some units, the extension of the polls from 2.30pm to 4.30pm, and subsequent disenfranchisement of some eligible voters due to unavailability of election materials and INEC officials. In a statement by Acting Executive Director, CLEEN Foundation, Ruth Olofin, the foundation recommended that INEC should conduct more voter awareness on the BVAS machine. CLEEN said, \u201cINEC result portal should be improved for more transparency and accountability through automation of the sum of votes received by political parties at the polling units; INEC should prosecute electoral offenders to serve as deterrent to others; \u201cINEC should provide enough sensitive materials, such as Braille for voters with visual impairment; the commission should train and retrain electoral officers and ad-hoc staff to enable them meet with the changing needs of the electorate in Nigeria.\u201d In related development, THISDAY gathered that prominent indigenes of Ihiala, who began mobilising to ensure large turn out of voters on Tuesday included Mr. Ernest Obiejesi, popularly known as Obijackson; chairman of Air Peace Airline, Allen Onyema; and Chairman of Seplat Oil, Dr. ABC Orjiakor, among others. Ihiala is reputed as the local government with the highest concentration of billionaires in Anambra State, after Nnewi, and it also boasts the second largest voting strength in the state, after Idemili North Local Government Area. The local government will today decide the fate of the major candidates in the governorship race, as 148,000 voters in the area go to the poll. Sources told THISDAY that the major candidates in the Anambra governorship election had shifted their attention to Ihiala, pressing to mobilise voters for themselves. It was further gathered that many voters from Ihiala, who resided in other towns, had been coming home since noon yesterday, in preparation for today\u2019s poll. \u201cSome of our brothers, who live in Lagos and Abuja, have already arrived by air, on the sponsorship of some of our billionaires,\u201d a source said. Obiano, too, was alleged to be pressing some of the notable figures in the state to work for APGA and ensure that Soludo won the election. Soludo is currently leading with about 45,000 votes, but with 148,000 votes still up for grabs, if the Ihiala people decide to favour PDP\u2019s candidate, Mr. Valentine Ozigbo or APC\u2019s Senator Andy Uba, they could comfortably make anyone of them the next governor of the state. But a source said Onyema was already working hard to ensure Soludo emerged victorious. Not unexpectedly, the governorship candidate of African Democratic Congress (ADC), Nze Akachukwu Nwankpo, has withdrawn from the race and thrown his weight behind Soludo. Nwankpo, after allegedly consulting with his party leadership, elected to support Soludo. The ADC candidate said, \u201cToday, by 18.46 pm, I and my wife, Bar. Obiageli Nwankpo, spoke with Prof. Chukwuma Charles Soludo, the gubernatorial candidate of APGA and congratulated him for a hard fought election and, in fact, conceded to him the title of the next governor of Anambra State. \u201cMy dear friend and brother, I have studied the trend of this election and seen clearly that the people of Anambra State want you to lead a deep seated effort to reform and rebuild our state. Anambra State must now become a state run on the basis of the will and desire of our people. I add my voice in calling the people of Ihiala Local Government to rise up and resoundingly end this election by massively voting for Soludo. \u201cLet there be no doubt that Ihiala LGA stands where the rest of Anambra State stands. I further advise you to mount the horse of great leadership and reach out to other candidates with humility and respect so that together we can all stop pressure-cooking Anambra State and start rebuilding. \u201cReach to Val Ozigbo, who is much loved, and to Dr. Andy Uba, who has equally fought a hard campaign. Let us, together, build a state, where all men of faith can find comfort and partnership in Christ. \u201cCongratulations, Odenigbo. I will vote APGA tomorrow and be assured Ihiala will massively vote APGA tomorrow.\u201d\n\nMONDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2021\n\n12:50AM\n\nBreaking: INEC Declares Anambra Election Inconclusive, Poll Holds in Ihiala Tuesday\n\nBy David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC has declared the Anambra governorship election inconclusive.\n\nThis is because of the inability of the commission to deploy staff and materials to Ihiala local government area, as a result of security threat.\n\nReturning officer in the election, Prof. Florence Obi said the election would now hold on November 9, to complement the 20 local government areas election result, already announced.\n\nObi said: \u201cwe have collated results for 20 local government areas, and Ihiala is still outstanding as the commission was unable to deploy to the area.\n\n\u201cBased on constitutional provision, supplementary election will be held in Ihiala.

(NAN)\n\n7:03PM\n\nAnambra Election: Counting of Votes Under way Counting of votes has started in some polling units in Awka township after Saturday governorship election in Anambra. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that though voting began late in some polling units in Awka, the exercise was concluded about 3.30pm.

The Resident Electoral Commissioner. Nkwachukwu Orji said that this revised closing time applies to areas where Polling Units opened after the commencement period of 8.30am. In line with existing regulations and guidelines of the Commission, adding that any intending voter who is on the queue by 4.00 pm shall be allowed to vote. He said all Polling Unit staff must comply with this directive. According to him, \u201cThe extension of time arose out of several field reports that voters have had problems with accreditation. The Commission is currently investigating the reason the accreditation devices, Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), have worked perfectly in some Polling Units, but not in others. In some of the cases, it would seem that this resulted from software glitches. Our technicians have already built an update to the device software to prevent further challenges. The update is currently being installed in the concerned BVAS and we request voters, candidates and agents to be patient and allow our technical staff to solve the problem. \u201cThe Commission wishes to reiterate that in cases of sustained malfunction of the BVAS, the Presiding Officer must inform the voters and polling agents that accreditation and voting for the affected Polling Unit shall continue tomorrow or at another time determined by the Commission. With this extension of time and the recommencement of accreditation where the BVAS consistently malfunctions, the Commission assures that no voter will be disenfranchised. \u201cOur deployment has also been adversely affected by transportation challenges in some locations. It must be noted that on account of security concerns, some of the transporters that were mobilized and collected 50% of their sign on fee backed out at the last moment, leaving some of our ad-hoc staff stranded. Also, some of the trained ad-hoc staff backed out at the last moment. \u201cThe Commission is on top of these challenges and extant regulations and guidelines will be applied on a case by case bases. Consequently, we are harvesting areas where voting will realistically no longer take place today, including places where substantial disruption has occurred, to enable a possible recommencement of voting at another time, in line with extant laws and the regulations and guidelines of the Commission. \u201cWe appeal to all voters, candidates, stakeholders communities and political parties to remain calm and law abiding. We assure you that the Commission is determined to make all votes count.\u201d, he stated.\n\n3:43PM\n\nAnambra Guber: INEC Extends Voting by One Hour Voting continues Sunday David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has extended voting in the Anambra governorship election.

          "text": "\u2022Adjusts voting timeline for supplementary poll\n\n\u2022APC alleges rigging, to contest result in Supreme Court\n\n\u2022State govt assures Ihiala people of security as billionaire sons, daughters mobilise indigenes in diaspora\n\n\u2022CLEEN Foundation seeks improvement in BVAS technology\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nWith the supplementary poll in the Anambra State governorship election holding today in Ihiala Local Government Area, attention has shifted to the council area, just as interests have heightened among the various stakeholders.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has, in line with extant rules and regulations, announced a slight adjustment to the commencement and closing time for the supplementary election. INEC said polling would now commence at 10am and end at 4pm.\n\nThe commission had on Sunday declared the November 6 off-time governorship election in Anambra State inconclusive owing to the suspension of voting in Ihiala Local Government Area on account of alleged irregularities.\n\nBut the All Progressives Congress (APC) accused the candidate of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Professor Chukwuma Soludo, and fellow party man and incumbent governor of the state, Willie Obiano, of rigging the election.\n\nHowever, the state government appealed to the people of Ihiala to come out en masse today to cast their votes, assuring them of adequate security.\n\nMeanwhile, CLEEN Foundation said there was need for INEC to improve on logistics and operational challenges associated with the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) to deliver more transparent and credible elections.\n\nAhead of today\u2019s voting, prominent sons and daughters of Ihiala had mobilise indigenes of the area at home and in the diaspora to vote in today\u2019s supplementary election.\n\nLast Saturday\u2019s governorship election was declared inconclusive after the exercise was cancelled in Ihiala. Though, Soludo had crossed the threshold requirement for victory after winning 18 out of the 21 local governments areas in the state.\n\nDespite the fact that Soludo was in apparent victory, the situation in Ihiala necessitated a supplementary poll to avoid disenfranchising the area\u2019s huge voting population of over 148, 000.\n\nAnnouncing the adjustment to the voting timeline for Ihiala, INEC said, in a statement by its National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, \u201cWe urge political parties, voters, election duty officials, election observers, the media and the general public to note this slight modification. We also appeal to citizens to conduct themselves in an orderly manner to ensure that the election is brought to a peaceful conclusion.\u201d\n\nHowever, Chairman of APC in the state, Basil Ejidike, accused Soludo and Obiano of rigging while rejecting the results so far declared by INEC. It vowed to contest the results to the Supreme Court, if INEC went ahead to declare Soludo winner of the election.\n\nEjidike said APC would never accept the election\u2019s outcome. He called for cancellation of the election.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe want the whole world to hear our voice that we will never accept the outcome of the Anambra gubernatorial election. The candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and the sitting Governor, Willie Obiano, manipulated the whole electoral system and we will stand to resist it.\n\n\u201cWe virtually won in all the local governments, but Willie Obiano and Charles Soludo, through instrumentality, corrupt-minded INEC officers, subverted the whole process in favour of APGA.\n\n\u201cBut if INEC goes ahead to announce the results, we will definitely challenge the election process at the court of law, up to Supreme Court. Nobody can intimidate us.\u201d\n\nEjidike also addressed a press conference in Awka. He said despite the party\u2019s protests, there were no truth in some press statements attributed to the party, and being circulated in the media.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere have been too many information ascribed to us that is not true. Some people wrote whatever they liked and credited it to the party, when it didn\u2019t come from the party. One of them was the one that said APC has denounced the exercise, and called for cancellation, and the other was that we said we were heading to court to challenge the election.\n\n\u201cThere is another one that said that I collapsed, after hearing the result of my ward, where they claimed I lost. I want to make it clear that they were false information. None of them emanated from us.\n\n\u201cThe picture saying that I collapsed is false. My polling unit 002 bridgehead market, Onitsha, was won by APC. I had 95 per cent in the unit and even in my ward. If you look at the picture they are circulating, you will know that it has no resemblance of my person at all. Please, discard the information.\u201d\n\nBut the state government assured the people of security through a public announcement by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Solo Chukwulobelu.\n\nChukwulobelu announced, \u201cThis is to inform the public, particularly, residents and voters in Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed Tuesday, 9th November, 2021 as the date for the 2021 Anambra Gubernatorial supplementary election for Ihiala local government area only.\n\n\u201cAnambra State Government, working with relevant security agencies, hereby assure Ndi Ihiala that adequate security arrangements have been made to protect life and property during the election. All are encouraged to come out and vote for the candidate of their choice.\n\n\u201cAs Ndi Ihiala may have observed, elections were successfully and peacefully held in the other 20 local government areas of Anambra State and INEC has duly announced the results. No incidence of violence or voter molestation was recorded in the Anambra gubernatorial election, which held on Saturday, 6th November 2021.\n\n\u201cAs a reminder, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) had previously cancelled the sit-at-home order earlier announced and encouraged Ndi Anambra to come out and vote. Anambra will continue to remain the light of the nation.\u201d\n\nCLEEN Foundation said there was need for INEC to improve logistics and address operational challenges associated with the BVAS. The Non-governmental Organisation (NGO) noted that the election was visibly marred by logistics and operational challenges with regard to the distribution of election materials and late arrival of INEC officials at many of the polling units.\n\nThe foundation stated that the challenges led to late opening of polling in some units, the extension of the polls from 2.30pm to 4.30pm, and subsequent disenfranchisement of some eligible voters due to unavailability of election materials and INEC officials.\n\nIn a statement by Acting Executive Director, CLEEN Foundation, Ruth Olofin, the foundation recommended that INEC should conduct more voter awareness on the BVAS machine.\n\nCLEEN said, \u201cINEC result portal should be improved for more transparency and accountability through automation of the sum of votes received by political parties at the polling units; INEC should prosecute electoral offenders to serve as deterrent to others;\n\n\u201cINEC should provide enough sensitive materials, such as Braille for voters with visual impairment; the commission should train and retrain electoral officers and ad-hoc staff to enable them meet with the changing needs of the electorate in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn related development, THISDAY gathered that prominent indigenes of Ihiala, who began mobilising to ensure large turn out of voters on Tuesday included Mr. Ernest Obiejesi, popularly known as Obijackson; chairman of Air Peace Airline, Allen Onyema; and Chairman of Seplat Oil, Dr. ABC Orjiakor, among others.\n\nIhiala is reputed as the local government with the highest concentration of billionaires in Anambra State, after Nnewi, and it also boasts the second largest voting strength in the state, after Idemili North Local Government Area.\n\nThe local government will today decide the fate of the major candidates in the governorship race, as 148,000 voters in the area go to the poll.\n\nSources told THISDAY that the major candidates in the Anambra governorship election had shifted their attention to Ihiala, pressing to mobilise voters for themselves. It was further gathered that many voters from Ihiala, who resided in other towns, had been coming home since noon yesterday, in preparation for today\u2019s poll.\n\n\u201cSome of our brothers, who live in Lagos and Abuja, have already arrived by air, on the sponsorship of some of our billionaires,\u201d a source said.\n\nObiano, too, was alleged to be pressing some of the notable figures in the state to work for APGA and ensure that Soludo won the election.\n\nSoludo is currently leading with about 45,000 votes, but with 148,000 votes still up for grabs, if the Ihiala people decide to favour PDP\u2019s candidate, Mr. Valentine Ozigbo or APC\u2019s Senator Andy Uba, they could comfortably make anyone of them the next governor of the state.\n\nBut a source said Onyema was already working hard to ensure Soludo emerged victorious.\n\nNot unexpectedly, the governorship candidate of African Democratic Congress (ADC), Nze Akachukwu Nwankpo, has withdrawn from the race and thrown his weight behind Soludo. Nwankpo, after allegedly consulting with his party leadership, elected to support Soludo.\n\nThe ADC candidate said, \u201cToday, by 18.46 pm, I and my wife, Bar. Obiageli Nwankpo, spoke with Prof. Chukwuma Charles Soludo, the gubernatorial candidate of APGA and congratulated him for a hard fought election and, in fact, conceded to him the title of the next governor of Anambra State.\n\n\u201cMy dear friend and brother, I have studied the trend of this election and seen clearly that the people of Anambra State want you to lead a deep seated effort to reform and rebuild our state. Anambra State must now become a state run on the basis of the will and desire of our people. I add my voice in calling the people of Ihiala Local Government to rise up and resoundingly end this election by massively voting for Soludo.\n\n\u201cLet there be no doubt that Ihiala LGA stands where the rest of Anambra State stands. I further advise you to mount the horse of great leadership and reach out to other candidates with humility and respect so that together we can all stop pressure-cooking Anambra State and start rebuilding.\n\n\u201cReach to Val Ozigbo, who is much loved, and to Dr. Andy Uba, who has equally fought a hard campaign. Let us, together, build a state, where all men of faith can find comfort and partnership in Christ.\n\n\u201cCongratulations, Odenigbo. I will vote APGA tomorrow and be assured Ihiala will massively vote APGA tomorrow.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Allege special relationship exists between AGF, consultants above Nigeria\u2019s interest\n\n\u2022Say payment authorised, processed with unprecedented speed not common in public service\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe 36 State Governors under the umbrella of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) have strongly chastised the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami over his directive to pay the Paris Club Consultants, even when the matter was still in the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe governors stated this in reaction to the directive by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation in a statement yesterday, by the Head, Media and Public Affairs, NGF, Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, insisting that the mere fact that Malami directed the Minister of Finance to pay was very suspicious.\n\nMalami had in a statement at the weekend issued by his Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, Dr. Umar Jibrin Gwandu, faulted the insinuation that he was acting without due process in the settlement of certain judgment debts arising from the deduction and refunds due to the states and local governments from the Paris Club loan refunds, insisting that at the onset, the deductions were on account of four judgments in contention which were delivered at various times in 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2019.\n\nHowever, the governors in their statement stressed that the directive by Malami was against public morality and the interest of the Nigerians, while describing some of the claims by the consultants as dubious.\n\nIn the statement, the governors argued that the decision by Malami to throw his weight behind the consultants that had been battling desperately to grab $418 million from the accounts of states and local governments raises questions of propriety and the spirit of justice.\n\nThe governors explained: \u201cThe AGF is supposed to be the chief arbiter in all matters concerning Nigerians, especially the poor masses of this country. It is incumbent upon him to, not just ensure that justice is done, but that justice is seen to have been done.\n\n\u201cThe undue haste, with which the statement was issued even before the service on the AGF of the court processes and the order dated November 5, 2021, restraining the federal government, seems to suggest that there is a special relationship between the Office of the AGF and the consultants over and above Nigerian citizens, whose interest the AGF as the chief law officer of the federation is statutorily bound to always protect.\n\n\u201cThe statement also suggests that the restraining order issued last Friday, not only unsettled preconceived plans and angered the unnamed \u2018government officers\u2019 referred to by the media aide.\u201d\n\nThey added: \u201cThe media aide to the AGF justifies the deductions on the basis that they are made pursuant to four court judgments; two of which are consent judgments and/or that the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum/States and LGAs consented, expressed no objection to the payments and had already paid part of the debts to the said contractors and consultants.\u201d\n\nIt also noted that the statement by the media aide to the AGF failed to name the judgments under reference and whether they were going to appeal or challenge it in any way.\n\n\u201cHe also failed to specify which of the four judgments authorised payments and in what proportion to each of the contractors,\u201d the governors stated.\n\nThe governors pointed out that while it was easy to argue as the AGF did, that the NGF and ALGON took no early steps to appeal as they should have done, adding that it was important to inform the Nigerian public that state governors have since appealed and are presently challenging the judgments in various courts.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the AGF has been served all these processes. Nevertheless, this was ignored and payment was authorised to be made and has been processed with unprecedented speed not common in the public service. It must be stated that between the NGF and AGF, the latter was in more vantage constitutional position and has a legal responsibility and burden to defend public interest,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe governors stated that the AGF should have initiated appeals against the said judgments once his attention was drawn to them, because public interest was at stake involving huge sums of money meant for the provision of public services.\n\nAlso, they pointed out that the state governments were not parties to any of the said judgments.\n\nAccording to the NGF: \u201cIt should be further stated that the Office of the AGF failed to professionally defend the cases leading to those judgments and the courts commented on that unprofessional attitude.\n\n\u201cWhile we are constrained not to comment on a subject which is subjudice, we have a responsibility to the public to respond in some details to the statement issued by the Office of the AGF in order to put the records straight.\n\n\u201cAny discerning legal mind would find no difficulty in concluding that the so-called judgments under reference are dripping with too many irregularities bordering on competence and lack of jurisdiction which are the bases why some of them are being challenged on appeal and in other courts. No diligent public officer would act on such judgments by recommending payment.\n\n\u201cIt is even more curious that the AGF also recommended payments to some contractors allegedly based on judgments that did not make any monetary award or on claims that were struck out.\n\n\u201cThe AGF may need to explain to Nigerians why these particular judgment debts are given unusual attention and priority and processed with supersonic speed over and above all others; some of which preceded these so-called judgments and have been pending for settlement by the AGF for several years\u201d, the governors declared.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, they stated: \u201cWhile it is convenient to say that part of these judgment debts have been paid with the release of $86,546,526.65 and N19, 439,225,871.11 in 2016 and $100 million in 2018, to the contractors with the concurrence of the NGF; that does not detract from the fact that they were payments wrongly made which ought not to have been made even if they were products of consent judgments.\u201d\n\nQuerying the order to pay, the governors also stated: \u201cStates can still go after the contractors to recover the funds wrongly made. It should concern the AGF that ALGON disowned the contracts claimed by RIOK and the same was duly communicated to him requesting him to prevent the use of LG funds to \u201csettle dubious and illegal claims\u2019\u2019\n\nThe governors therefore queried: \u201cWas the AGF not concerned that several contractors are laying claim to legal fees for the same Paris Club Refund? Was it lost on the AGF on the detailed procedure available under the law how legal fees can be claimed in deserving cases?\u201d\n\nThe governors further noted that, \u201cone of the strange payments made is that of $47,831,920 million to Panic Alert Security Systems Ltd/George Uboh for allegedly reviewing a 16-page judgment for the then factional NGF.\n\n\u201cCan the Office of the AGF point to any consent judgment awarding that sum to Panic Alert? Did the NGF\u2019s letter of 20th January, 2020, relied upon by the AGF ever recommend the payment of any sum?\n\nThe statement added: \u201cLINAS and NED Nwoko in this scheme are walking away with $68,658,193.83 state funds allegedly for legal consultancy services,\u201d asking therefore. \u201cIs the AGF not aware that the work alleged to have been done by him was already contained in a FAAC Reconciliation Committee Report constituted in 2005 submitted in 2007 with recommendations on how states and LGAs should be refunded the over charges from the Paris Club Refunds.\u201d\n\nThe NGF alleged: \u201cDr. Ted Iseghohi-Edwards has been paid the sum of $159 million in promissory notes, yet he had his matter in Suit No FCT/HC/CV/1353/18 struck out on November 10th, 2020.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the legal basis for his claim is rooted in Suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/130/13: LINAS International Limited & 235 ORS V FGN which clearly stated that he cannot benefit under the judgment because he was not a party in the case and cannot enforce the terms of the judgment. Contrary to the representation of the AGF, the EFCC\u2019s report on TED was negative.\n\n\u201cThe report not only recommended his arrest but a forfeiture of any of his assets associated with the Paris Club Refund. The AGF ignored these recommendations.\u201d\n\nThe governors further disputed the payments to RIOK to whom the AGF supports and recommended the payment of $142,028,941.95.\n\nAccordingly, the governors stated: \u201cThis was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Appeal No CA/558/2017. That is the appeal now before the Supreme Court (SC). Which Judgment then is the basis of the AGF recommendation that RIOK be paid the sum of $142,028,941.95.\n\n\u201cThere is also no evidence of execution of any contract by RIOK. Curiously, the Department of State Security (DSS) is alleged to have confirmed 50 per cent execution. The Court and EFCC stated clearly that it is not the responsibility of the DSS to ascertain the execution of contracts as they do not have the expertise.\n\n\u201cALGON disowned the contracts. Why will the AGF insist on them? It is not true that the EFCC in its report recommended payment to the contractors. It did not.\n\n\u201cIn the case of payments recommended and paid to Prince Orji Nwafor Orizu $1,219,440.45, and Olaitan Bello \u2013 $215,195.36, it remains a mystery. These two lawyers are alleged to have performed legal services for RIOK and its associated companies and not for the states or LGAs. Why they are paid from State resources is only imagined.\n\n\u201cThe AGF also claims he intervened to pay the contractors to avoid execution of the judgments against the federal government resources. That is absolutely not true at all. Assets of the FGN were not at any time threatened. The NGF is not aware that there is any existing mandamus issued by any court in favour of the contractors against the federal government.\n\n\u201cThe only application for mandamus by Panic Alert is pending for hearing at the Federal High Court and parties have since joined issues.\n\n\u201cThe AGF also says that the NGF and LGAs seek to transfer their liability to the FGN. That is not true. There is no liability to transfer in the first place and none exists; neither has the NGF provided any undertaking or indemnity to the FGN to act on its behalf as represented by the AGF.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Malami maintained that two of the judgments were Consent Judgments based on Terms of Settlement entered into by the NGF in 2017 and 2019.\n\nHe noted that two of the four judgments were based on an earlier judgment delivered by the Federal High Court in 2013.\n\n\u201cIt is, however, amazing that from 2013 \u2013 2021 neither NGF nor ALGON deemed it fit to either challenge or fully comply with any of these judgments. In furtherance of the consent and settlement the NGF itself made payments in billions to the consultants based on the same judgment it is deriding now.\n\n\u201cBy various letters addressed to the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Finance, both NGF and ALGON expressed no objection and actually recommended the same set of consultants for payment. Indeed, the judgment debts were much higher than the above figure, but these officers ensured that the Consultants granted consistent concessional offer,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, his office had subjected the claims of the consultants/contractors to investigations by both the DSS and EFCC in order to further ascertain its veracity, adding that recommendations for payment were made based on the positive outcomes of the investigations.\n\nMalami maintained that since both the NGF and ALGON that had entered into judicial settlement on account of which consent judgment was entered refused to comply with the judgments, \u201cit became pertinent for the federal government to take the initiative in order to prevent a situation where the debt liability of NGF and ALGON would be transferred to the Federal Government and eventually excluded against its assets and interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe interest of the federal government to intervene in the negotiated settlement was borne out of the fact that the consultants made the federal government a party to the action against NGF and ALGON the implication of which was that the judgment may be executed against the interest and assets of the federal government over liability that was incurred exclusively by NGF and ALGON in respect of which the federal government is not responsible.\n\n\u201cIt is curious to note that both NGF and ALGON who had actual knowledge of these judgments between 2013 and 2019, consented to their partial compliance and also undertook in 2019 to settle them from their FAAC Allocations, only turned around in 2021 to take steps to challenge the judgments.\n\n\u201cThe federal government acted on the Undertaking/Indemnity provided by NGF. More so the judgment creditors also obtained orders of mandamus compelling the issuance of the promissory notes.\u201d\n\nThe statement added: \u201cIt is remarkable to note that the NGF at various times in 2016 and 2018 received payments from the federal government under the guise of legal and consultancy fees related to the same Paris Club refunds. Specifically, NGF was paid US$86,546,526.65 and N19,439,225,871.11 in 2016 and US$100,000,000.00 in 2018. It was however, convenient at that time not to complain about payment of consultants.\n\n\u201cThus, the federal government did not act in vacuum before the decision to comply with the existing judgments was taken. The federal government could not fold its arms and watch while the consultants/contractors had already obtained garnishee order absolute attaching the funds of the Federal Government in the Central Bank of Nigeria on account of the fact that the refunds of the Paris Club loans were made by the federal government to the states and local governments in contempt of an existing court judgments procured against NGF and ALGON by consent.\u201d\n\nHe argued that the federal government did not resort to arbitrary deductions of funds belonging to states and local governments, saying it was rather in furtherance of the need to settle judgment debts judiciously consented to by NGF and ALGON that were incurred but in respect of which they are seeking to transfer the liability of same to the federal government.\n\n\u201cThus, the media onslaught on what played out at FAAC October meeting that states won\u2019t be able to pay salaries on account of the deductions is far from the truth as the problem is self-induced being a product of contractual negotiation in respect of which NGF and ALGON submitted to judicial decision legitimately entered by their consent.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney General of the Federation denies any wrongdoing in the steps that have been taken so far to comply with the various court judgments and is also not party or privy to any of the sinister agenda or plots being insinuated in the malicious publications, but maintains that he has a responsibility to protect Federal Government from bearing liability of a judgments debt incurred by Nigerian Governor\u2019s Forum and ALGON which is mischievously being transferred to the federal government,\u201d it added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "Nevertheless, this was ignored and payment was authorised to be made and has been processed with unprecedented speed not common in the public service.\n\u201cThe report not only recommended his arrest but a forfeiture of any of his assets associated with the Paris Club Refund.\n\u201cThe AGF also claims he intervened to pay the contractors to avoid execution of the judgments against the federal government resources.\nHe noted that two of the four judgments were based on an earlier judgment delivered by the Federal High Court in 2013.\n\u201cThus, the federal government did not act in vacuum before the decision to comply with the existing judgments was taken.",

          "text": "With the adoption of blockchain and the tech it creates, crypto has given rise to exciting innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFT), decentralised finance (DeFi) and decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs).\n\nEmerging economies have experienced an explosion in the adoption of crypto and blockchain technology, but a new startup wants to bring more people into the fold by lowering the barrier for entry.\n\nThe brainchild of Taiwo Orilogbon and Yele Bademosi, Nestcoin is a parent company that wants to create crypto-native products beyond trading and investments, with a focus on driving the adoption of crypto in Africa.\n\nImage source: Nestcoin\n\nNestcoin wants to help Nigerians first, then other Africans, \u201cexit the status quo\u201d by offering them access to wealth using crypto technology or elements of web 3.0 like NFT, DAOs and DeFi.\n\nIt wants to do this through its media publication, Breach, and other products that use crypto technology\u2014spanning across DeFi, media, digital art and gaming.\n\n\u201cThe products we build are tools of individual freedom and creative expression,\u201d said Bademosi in a call with TechCabal.\n\nTapping into Africa\u2019s deepening crypto culture\n\nBademosi and Taiwo\u2019s ambition is rooted in their rich history in Africa\u2019s crypto space. While Taiwo is a former Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Bundle Africa, a Nigerian crypto exchange, Bademosi has been investing in crypto companies since 2017. He was among the earliest investors in Nigerian crypto exchange, Buycoins, which is now under a new parent company, called Helicarrier.\n\nBefore Nestcoin, Bademosi was a former director at Binance\u2019s venture capital programme. In 2019, he got seed funding from the same programme to launch a payment app in Nigeria, Bundle.\n\nAt Bundle, Bademosi said he realised the entry point is the same as the ceiling when interacting with crypto in Nigeria: trading it. So, he set out to create innovative products beyond this ceiling.\n\nBut before Binance Labs, he\u2019d begun his career in venture capital as the founding partner at Microtraction, one of the most active investors in African early-stage startups now.\n\nUsing education to drive up crypto adoption\n\nAfrica is the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency among the regions, according to a survey by Chainalysis, a US-based research institute. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. This represents a 1,200% growth. Despite this, however, Africa is still the smallest crypto economy of all the regions, the institute studied. Africa received just 3% of the total value of crypto in the world.\n\nCiting data from crypto exchange, Luno, that 55% of Nigerians do not use crypto because they don\u2019t understand it, Bademosi admitted that crypto is still confusing to a lot of people.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re trying to close that information gap in terms of trying to make crypto more relatable and familiar,\u201d Bademosi said.\n\nImage source: Nestcoin\n\nAs part of efforts to drive crypto adoption using education, Nestcoin is setting up Breach to create content that explains complex crypto topics like DeFi, Blockchain, DAOs, DApps, NFTs and more to novices.\n\nBreach, officially launched today, is a platform that uses newsletters and blog posts to make easily digestible content that will help everyone make sense of the crypto world. Spearheaded by media analyst and former head of communications at Eko Atlantic City, David Adeleke, who will now be managing editor for Breach and communication lead for Nestcoin, Breach intends to make crypto mainstream and help people jumpstart their crypto careers.\n\nIncentivising the crypto community\n\nNestcoin wants to create a community of users that understands crypto, as a way to make their lives easier. Nestcoin will then harness the power of this community to create new products and embark on projects that can generate revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s a community that we want to incentivise and reward for their participation,\u201d Bademosi said.\n\nNestcoin is also creating avenues for users to make money by getting them to play games on the blockchain and invest in digital art.\n\n\u201cThe community will be able to play crypto games that have the potential of helping them earn more than in their day jobs,\u201d Bademosi said.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "South Africa-based MTN Group has announced plans to sell 575 million shares of its most profitable subsidiary MTN Nigeria, which went public in Lagos in 2019.\n\n\u201cToday we announce our intention to proceed with a public offer for sale of up to 575 million shares in MTN Nigeria, by way of a bookbuild to institutional investors and fixed price to retail investors,\u201d the company said in a notice filed with the Nigerian Stock Exchange.\n\n\u201cThe offer is anticipated to open in November 2021 with a bookbuild to institutional investors, after which a fixed price is expected to be announced for retail investors also in November 2021. The offer is expected to close in December 2021.\u201d\n\nThe transaction will see MTN Group rake in proceeds of about \u20a6101 billion ($245 million), based on MTN Nigeria\u2019s (MTNN) current share price of \u20a6175.60. Hours after the announcement, the stock rose around 8% to \u20a6191.\n\nA Bit of History\n\nThe planned sell-off is part of a broader intention, announced by MTN Group earlier, to sell down 14% of its current shareholding in the Nigerian unit. That will see its holdings in MTNN reduce from 76% to 62%.\n\nWhile MTN Nigeria is the group\u2019s largest and most profitable subsidiary, the telecom giant has had to deal with a number of billion-dollar disputes with the Nigerian government as well as faced significant macroeconomic challenges.\n\nLast year, the Johannesburg-based group was unable to repatriate its $280 million dividend from its Nigerian subsidiary due to the challenges of securing foreign currency, amid the country\u2019s forex liquidity crisis.\n\nThe share sale thus raises questions about the group\u2019s intentions as it appears to be a gradual exit from the Nigerian market due to a lack of confidence.\n\nAlthough the divestment helps the South African giant slightly reduce its exposure to headwinds in the Nigerian economy, the sell-down does not signal an exit from Nigeria, according to Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer.\n\n\u201cSince its 2019 listing by introduction, the group has planned to sell part of its stake but held on due to market conditions,\u201d Omole told TechCabal. \u201cThe sale is part of its asset realisation programme (ARP) meant to simplify its portfolio, focus on its pan-Africa strategy, and free up capital for improved allocation.\u201d\n\nBetween January and September 2021, MTN Group saw its revenue grow to $8.2 billion, driven by success in some of its main markets, including Nigeria.\n\nDespite the domestic challenges, MTN Nigeria has shown resilience. Within the same period, the local unit grew its profit after tax by 53% to \u20a6220 billion ($385 million).\n\n\u201cMTN Nigeria remains an important part of the Group and its fundamentals remain solid,\u201d Omole said, adding that the share sale \u201cgives local retail and institutional investors an opportunity to tap into MTN Nigeria\u2019s growth.\u201d\n\nAs part of its ARP, MTN Group is in the process of finalising a sale-and-leaseback of its South African telecom mast portfolio as well as list shares in the Uganda operation in Kampala.\n\nThe company recently raked in some proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) of telecom infrastructure company, IHS Towers, in New York last month.\n\nShare this article",

Their intention appears to be the targeting of small industries and traders seeking cross-border opportunities in new African markets.\n\nKenyan based Asante Financial Services Group, focused on supporting the growth of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME\u2019s), has raised 7.5 million US dollars in series A funding to scale business credit offering to small businesses in Kenya and Uganda access to new markets across Africa.\n\n\u201cThe investment enables Asante to scale its credit offerings to the underserved segment of MSMEs in Kenya and Uganda, and expand to Nigeria and Rwanda,\u201d the start-up said in a statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTala, with African Operations in Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania has begun a \u2018Rebuild Fund Business Program\u2019 targeting Kenya\u2019s hard-hit micro, small and medium-sized enterprises it say will help them build back better post-COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe program comes barely a month after Tala raised 145 million dollars in equity, hinting that part of the growth funds would go toward supporting its geographical expansion.\n\nThe World Bank puts the annual SME credit gap in Sub Saharan Africa at about 330 million US dollars, with traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d lenders turning a blind eye to small traders on account of lack of \u2013 among others \u2013 collateral, high costs of due diligence, customer acquisition, distribution and servicing.\n\n\u201cMSMEs\u2014particularly those in the informal sector\u2014are being held back by a lack of responsible lending from traditional financial services providers who are unable to run accurate credit checks and offer profitable loans to this segment of the market,\u201d said Bitta Wycliffe, Senior Investment Associate at Goodwell Investments.\n\nPan-Africa fintech firm, MFS Africa is also making inroads in Nigeria through the acquisition of Baxi, a Nigerian start-up with a 90,000-agent network. The October move gives Nigerian SME\u2019s listed on Baxi access to MFS Africa\u2019s multiple mobile money payment wallets, currently serving up to 320 million customers in more than 35 African countries.\n\nAnother Pan-African fintech venture, Yabx, with a presence in 12 African countries recently tapped a telecoms industry expert with over 15 years in experience as a new director for its business.\n\nEunice R. Gatama, who has worked for, among others, Kenya\u2019s Safaricom, in its mobile money (M-Pesa) division, as well as NCBA bank, has been tasked with pushing the growth of Yabx digital lending services in new African markets.\n\nUntil recently, a lack of local knowledge and access to trade and market information has been linked to low trade volumes and value. With more money pouring into the hiring of top regional talent, that scenario, too, is likely to change.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "There\u2019s a new exciting trend in the African tech ecosystem: African founders backing fellow founders especially in pre-seed and seed funding, which is an indication that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Payhippo, a fintech startup providing capital for small businesses in Nigeria, was another example of the existence of this trend when it announced that it has closed $3 million in seed funding led by a number of African tech founders.\n\nThe round was led by Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, co-founders Chipper Cash; Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola, founder Flutterwave; Bolaji Balogun, CEO Chapel Hill Denham; and Hakeem Belo-Osagie, founder Metis Capital Partners.\n\nAngel investors from Paystack, Brex and Tala also participated in the round. TEN13, VentureSouq, and Prodigio Capital were the only institutional ventures that wrote a check for this round.\n\nThis investment comes barely 5 months after the startup raised a $1 million institutional pre-seed. Besides the earlier undisclosed capital raised from friends and family, the company\u2019s total fundraised is now at $4 million.\n\nCapital is a lifeline of business\n\nThere are over 40 million small and medium businesses (SMEs) in Nigeria. These businesses account for 96% of its total companies, 84% of employment, and 48% of the national GDP. But only a few of these businesses have access to capital, mostly due to heavy collateral requirements and long time of loan processing.\n\nPayhippo is at the forefront of solving this problem. Founded by Zach Bijesse, CEO, Chioma Okotcha, COO, and Uche Nnadi, CTO, Payhippo provides small businesses with short-term working capital with average loan amounts of $1300. The company also allows SMEs to build their credit score based on their track record of repaying their loans on time. SMEs even become eligible for higher amounts of capital as their credit score goes up.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIf capital is a lifeline of a business, then it\u2019s safe to say Payhippo is guarding the lifeline of Nigerian SMEs.\n\n\u201cThis funding will allow us to invest in hiring more engineers and data scientists. We aim to improve our technology and enhance our lending offerings as we continue to address the persistent financing gap for small businesses in Nigeria,\u201d Okotcha, COO at Payhippo, said. \u201cAt Payhippo, our vision is to provide millions of small businesses with sufficient and available capital to run and grow their businesses.\u201d\n\nThe company said it has disbursed 5000 loans to SMEs since it launched in January 2020. In September 2021, the Payhippo reportedly earned $64,000 in revenue from $900,000 disbursed, experiencing 25% monthly growth with a 97% repayment rate on loans.\n\nCommenting on his investment in Payhippo, Bolaji Balogun, founder/CEO at Chapel Hill Denham said: \u201cWe\u2019re excited at how Payhippo is using technology to provide SMEs in Africa with access to finance required to run their business needs. By lending to small businesses, Payhippo is allowing business owners access to much-needed working capital to grow their businesses and create jobs in the economy.\u201d\n\nFor Serunjogi and Moujaled, the two co-founders of Chipper Cash, the African fintech which attained a unicorn status on Tuesday, they are bullish on supporting new financial technologies being developed and implemented to change the competitive landscape in the financial sector in Africa.\n\n\u201cAccess to credit is a critical necessity for small businesses to manage their daily challenges. Payhippo helps address this need through its innovative approach that provides loans to small businesses in less than three hours, enabling them to access sufficient working capital to grow.\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nPayhippo plans to use the new funding to improve its technology capabilities and expand its talent pool.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service).

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe uninitiated usually think of Bitcoin whenever the word blockchain is mentioned.\n\nAnd they can be excused. After all, Bitcoin popularised blockchain technology. But there\u2019s more to it; blockchain has evolved, creating opportunities that are accessible to anyone in the world.\n\nBut it\u2019s complicated, and only the few who can find their way around the blockchain space are harnessing these opportunities.\n\nYele Bademosi, Founder and former CEO of crypto and cash payments company, Bundle Africa, wants to change this with his new company, Nestcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, the company is also launching its first product, a crypto media platform \u2014 Breach.\n\nNestcoin wants to expose Africans to the benefits and possibilities of Blockchain.\n\nHowever, the idea for Nestcoin was in the works for a while and can be traced to a time when Bademosi knew next to nothing about crypto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYele Bademosi, CEO and Co-Founder, Nestcoin\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he revealed that his first contact with cryptocurrencies was in 2014. He met someone who had gotten Bitcoin as a gift, and he wanted to know what it was.\n\nBademosi did some research but still didn\u2019t give it much thought until 2017, when his Twitter feed was agog with this money-making phenomenon \u2014 Bitcoin.\n\nAdmittedly, his interest in Bitcoin was sparked by the possibility of making a lot of money, but that changed when he started reading tweets by AngelList Founder, Naval Ravikant, who explained the core of Bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\n\u201cNaval described it as coordination, this idea that you could, without the need for a centralised authority, organise and coordinate millions of individuals and organisations at scale.\u201d\n\nBademosi realised crypto and blockchain are beyond trading and hodling. Bademosi sees it as a technology that could positively transform several sectors of the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been driven personally to try to understand or figure out how we could kind of create alternative systems for economic coordination in Africa.\u201d\n\nBademosi (Netcoin CEO) and Taiwo Orilogbon (Netcoin CTO) are on a mission to make crypto accessible to Africans and transition Africa to a sustainable economy through crypto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaiwo Orilogbon, CTO, Netcoin\n\nWhat is Nestcoin?\n\nAccording to Bademosi, Nestcoin is an umbrella company with several blockchain and crypto products. He added that it could also make investments in companies with a similar cause.\n\nEssentially, the goal of every Nestcoin product is to create simple platforms where Africans can interact with all things crypto as a way of creating economic value for themselves.\n\nWhat\u2019s the business model?\n\nNestcoin will have varying products with different business models, but most will have native tokens, which will serve as a means of revenue generation.\n\nBademosi explained that in the decentralised world, there isn\u2019t really a need to charge a fee for services like traditional organisations.\n\nHe said incentives can be designed \u201cthrough the tokens that allows one to still benefit from the value created.\n\n\u201cNow, it doesn\u2019t mean that we wouldn\u2019t have products that take a percentage or a fee, but generally, that\u2019s how we would like to design a lot of the products that we create.\n\n\u201cIt gives as much value to users in the ecosystem and keeps our fees or any spreads as low as possible.\u201d\n\nThe same model can be found in decentralised platforms such as Uniswap, an exchange on the Ethereum blockchain helping users swap tokens using the ERC-20 token standard.\n\nAlthough Uniswap takes fees from every transaction, it also generates revenue by issuing its own tokens.\n\nIs crypto secure enough?\n\nWhile the idea of decentralised autonomous organisations (DAO) or decentralised finance (DeFi) could provide Africans unfettered access to financial opportunities, there\u2019s still the question of safety.\n\nThe first DAO suffered a $150 million hack in 2016 due to loopholes in its infrastructure. Recently, Cream Finance, a DeFi platform, lost to a hack $130 million.\n\nTo assure safety, Bademosi said Nestcoin would only expose users to platforms that conduct regular security audits.\n\nHowever, the threat to crypto products or platforms doesn\u2019t end with security concerns; regulations also play an important role in their survival. In Nigeria, for example, the Central Bank restricted banks from facilitating crypto-based transactions.\n\nGodwin Emefiele, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, describes crypto as \u201cmoney out of thin air,\u201d expressing his distrust in the technology.\n\n\u201cFor us, we take regulation and compliance quite seriously,\u201d Bademosi said. He pointed out that there are crypto companies, such as Coinbase and FTX, that have shown that the crypto business can be regulatory-compliant.\n\nNevertheless, he holds the notion that governments should be pro-innovation.\n\n\u201cOur belief is that over time, people realise that crypto is a positive innovation for the world.\u201d\n\nNestcoin leads the way with Breach\n\nNestcoin is starting its mission with Breach, a globally-focused media platform that\u2019ll simplify crypto and blockchain concepts.\n\nAccording to Breach Product Manager, Chinny Eze, \u201cIt\u2019s a platform that breaks crypto concepts down into digestible bite-sized pieces for anyone to understand.\u201d\n\nShe says Breach will set itself apart from other crypto media platforms, with a new level of simplicity geared towards millennials and Gen Zs.\n\nA Breach Community platform is also in the works. More than creating content for consumption, the Breach Community will be a space for creators to have direct contact with audiences, fostering a better understanding of the concepts.\n\nLeading the Breach team as Managing Editor is David Adeleke, who doubles as Nestcoin\u2019s Communications Lead.\n\nAdeleke has held roles at media companies such as TechCabal, Techpoint Africa, and Ventures Africa.\n\nInterestingly, Breach will also have its native token \u2014 Breach token. Eze says the token is currently in the product roadmap, and the community will play an important role in its use.\n\nMore Nestcoin products?\n\nWhile Breach leads the way as the first in several products, Nestcoin will roll out more products with time.\n\nSome exciting products include a gaming platform where gamers earn in cryptocurrency and an NFT platform.\n\nFinancial products could also be in the works, as Bademosi said that when it comes to crypto, he truly cares about economic opportunities.\n\nHe believes that a person\u2019s geographical location should not determine access or the quality of financial services they get, a problem he\u2019s sure crypto will solve.\n\n\u201cI really believe that making crypto accessible for everybody in Africa and frontier markets is a worthy goal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "What MTN, Airtel PSB licence approval could mean for financial inclusion in Nigeria",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, November 8, 2021, telecom giants MTN and Airtel, in separate statements, revealed that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had granted them approval in principle to operate payment service banks (PSBs).\n\nSubject to meeting specific requirements over the next six months, the telecom operators would receive approval to operate PSBs. As expected, the announcements were greeted with support by Nigerians and hailed as an essential step in deepening financial inclusion in the country.\n\nSo what does this mean for financial inclusion in Nigeria? This article provides some answers but first, what are PSBs?\n\nAccording to Mondaq, payment service banks accept deposits from individuals and small businesses, carry out payment and remittance services within Nigeria, issue debit and prepaid cards, operate electronic purses, and other activities prescribed by the CBN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, MTN and Airtel would provide these services if they get the final approval. In doing so, they would be joining the likes of OPay and Paga in that space.\n\nSince 2012, an often-stated goal of the CBN has been to deepen financial inclusion in the country.\n\nThe World Bank defines financial inclusion as access to valuable and affordable financial products and services delivered responsibly and sustainably. These services include payments, savings, credit, insurance, and transactions.\n\nIt goes on to say that having a transaction account is the first step towards financial inclusion, as it provides individuals and businesses with a way to receive, send, and store money.\n\nConsequently, while the telcos would not offer a full suite of financial services, they would be able to provide users with an entry into the financial system.\n\nA significant reason for the optimism shown is the potential of telcos to fast-track the CBN\u2019s financial inclusion goal. This is mainly due to their comprehensive coverage of the country, especially in rural areas that house most of the unbanked population.\n\nWith the infrastructural cost of setting up branches and security, banks are not opening branches in new locations and, in some cases, are shutting down operations. According to the International Monetary Fund, Nigerian banks closed 234 branches and 649 Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) in 2020, bringing the number of banks in Nigeria to 5,158 in 2020 from 5,392 in 2019.\n\nFurthermore, MTN and Airtel have the largest and third-largest subscribers at 67.5 million and 42 million, respectively. Even accounting for multiple SIM cards as is common in the country, those figures are significantly higher than the top three Nigerian banks by customer base. According to data from the GSM Association, there were 97.5 million unique mobile subscribers in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nData from the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) puts the number of bank accounts in Nigeria at 160 million as of May 2021. At the same time, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) reports 190,854,069 active lines as of September 2021.\n\nHowever, the total BVN count as of October 31 was 50,728,469. Given that no one can have more than one BVN, it is safe to assume that the number of bank account holders in Nigeria is around the 50 million mark.\n\nWith the World Population Review putting the population of Nigerians over the age of 18 at 105,841,979, we could infer that there are about 55 million adult Nigerians without a bank account. This presents a huge opportunity for the new entrants and the millions of unbanked Nigerians.\n\nHaving successfully set up mobile money services in other parts of Africa, MTN and Airtel could replicate the success in Nigeria. This development bodes well for Nigeria\u2019s unbanked population as it would serve as a gateway into the financial services sector. While the PSBs cannot give loans, having a transaction account enables their users to access loans for their businesses and education.\n\nGranting PSB licences to the telcos is, however, just one step towards achieving financial inclusion. As we argued in a previous article, financial inclusion entails more than having a bank account.\n\nChallenges such as a lack of a unified identification system and increasing poverty rates remain. Opening an account is one thing but consistently funding that account is another. Admittedly, this is not a task for the telcos but is one they are bound to encounter.\n\nThere is no doubt that granting these telcos a PSB licence would boost the CBN\u2019s financial inclusion goals. However, for it to be truly impactful, it must go beyond adding numbers to the financial system to create tangible value for existing customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Banks\u2019 private sector credit up 32.81% in 3yrs",
          "text": "Nigerian Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) gave out the most credit worth N33.84 trillion to the private sector in September 2021, driven by the loan policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThis represents an increase of 32.81 percent compared with N25.48 trillion in September 2019 after the introduction of the loan rule known as the Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR).\n\nIn July 2019, the CBN introduced the policy requirement that targeted LDR at a minimum of 60 percent by the end of September 2019 and later increased it to 65 percent by the end of December 2019.\n\nThe banking sector regulator increased the LDR to spur growth to the real sector of the economy.\n\n\u201cThe LDR was a major push for the growth in credit to the private sector as it came with some punitive measures should bank default,\u201d said Abiodun Keripe, managing director, Afrinvest Research & Consulting.\n\nFrom the high compliance level earlier witnessed, he said this had moderated as the elevated risks in the business environment weighed-in on banks.\n\n\u201cIn terms of sector exposure, we are seeing a reshuffling of loan creation in line with the dynamics in the economy,\u201d Keripe said.\n\nRead Also: How CBN\u2019s loan to deposit ratio policy spurred bank credit growth\n\nIn any case, oil and gas accounted for 25.4 percent in 2020, down from 26.6 percent in 2019. Increased credit was recorded in manufacturing, consumer credit, general commerce, information and communication and agriculture.\n\nThe credit growth was driven by LDR policy, the extension of regulatory forbearance and other macro-prudential measures, Kingsley Obiora, deputy governor, CBN, said.\n\nAliyu Ahmed, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, noted that the increase in banks credit to the private sector was due largely to the increase in industry funding base as well as the CBN\u2019s directive on LDR.\n\n\u201cAlso, the declining lending rates, although marginally, provide some assurance of improvement in lending to the private sector in the near term,\u201d he said in his personal statement at the past MPC meeting.\n\nOn a year-on-year basis, a report by FBNQuest notes total lending to the private sector increased by 13.8 percent to N33.84 trillion ($81.9bn) in September. It notes also that private-sector credit extension (PSCE) covers lending from all sources including the CBN and the state-owned development banks.\n\n\u201cThis is a reasonable rate of y/y growth: however, we should note that the trend is gently downwards, and that Nigeria is underbanked. Among the DMBs, the larger institutions are guiding to loan book growth of around 10 percent this year, and the smaller operations closer to 15 percent,\u201d analysts at the FBNQuest say.\n\nIt may be that some banks would rather pay the CBN\u2019s penalties for falling short on the minimum loans-to-deposits ratio of 65 percent than disburse new credits that might in their view turn sour, notes FBNQuest.\n\nEarly this, the CBN deducted N1.2 trillion Cash Reserve Ratio from 24 banks. On December 2, 2020, the regulator introduced a special 90-day tenor bill with zero coupons as part of efforts to deepen the financial markets.\n\nSubsequently, on December 11, 2020, the CBN conducted the first Special Bill, offering N4.1 trillion for 81-day tenor to banks from the excess CRR.\n\nAccording to FBNQuest, one factor behind the increased loan books of the DMBs is currency weakness, which adds to the naira equivalent of the industry\u2019s FX denominated loans, but we assume that the oil and gas segment is the principal beneficiary of these loans. Banks\u2019 loans to the segment amounted to N5.29 trillion at end-March.\n\nThe expanding role of the development finance institutions, led by the recapitalised Bank of Industry (BoI), plays a part, the report states. The BoI concluded a $1bn syndicated loan in December 2020 and plans to raise another \u20ac750m from the sale of global bonds. Funds raised are on-lent to Nigerian firms out to 10 years at single-digit interest rates.\n\nAs at the end of September 2021, the CBN had released N800bn under the Anchor Borrowers Programme, N710bn under the commercial agriculture credit scheme and N340bn within the targeted credit facility and N1trn under the real sector facility. The MPC communiqu\u00e9 lists an additional eight smaller interventions.

          "text": "Today in the United State of America there have been reported cases of protracted port congestion, especially in key hubs such as Los Angeles, Long Beach, and New York. The situation has become such that ships are stuck outside the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California, which handle 40 percent of all containers entering the country.\n\nThe alarming congestion in US biggest ports has been having a great impact on the global supply chain, as there is serious crisis experts have predicted would likely last for several months, even into 2022.\n\nBefore COVID-19, it was unusual for more than one ship to wait in a berth, and the backlog is linked to surging demand for imports as the US economy has reopened after lockdown. This resulted in a global container shortage where importers had to wait for weeks to secure a space onboard a ship.\n\nJust recently, it was reported that drone captures 80,000 containers clogged in US ports. This is in addition to the long queue of vessels on US waters that are waiting for berthing.\n\nBBC once reported that about 65 cargo ships were forced to queue outside two of America\u2019s biggest ports due to the supply chain disruption that is hitting the US.\n\nRead Also: Heifer to lift 10m Nigerian households, cut food imports\n\nNigeria, the world\u2019s sixth-biggest exporter of crude oil, according to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which depends largely on importation to bring in raw materials to serve as a critical input for the local manufacturers and finished products for its 200 million populations, has been facing serious difficulties due to the supply chain crisis.\n\nHere are four ways disruption in the supply chain caused by congestion in US ports affect Nigerians:\n\nHigh freight rate\n\nWith the congestion in the US ports that trapped container carriers and thousands of containers, the cost of the freighting container from Far East Asia, particularly China and India, to Nigeria has increased dramatically.\n\n\u201cToday, moving a 40-foot container from India to Nigeria and China to Nigeria now costs $15,000 instead of $3,000 plus charges by shipping companies in the past,\u201d says Tony Anakebe, a maritime analyst.\n\nOn his part, Fidelis Ayabae, managing director/ CEO of Fidson Healthcare plc, notes that freight charges have been going up ever since China revived its export operations after the lockdown caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cOn an average, shipping cost from China where the majority of the inputs in terms of raw materials for local manufacturing in Nigeria come from, to Nigeria ports has increased by 400 to 500 percent compared to August last year,\u201d says Ayabae, who doubles as the chairman \u2013 PMG, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN).\n\nThis was why reports have established that the majority of shipping lines have benefitted from high freight rates and increased container demand. And most of them have been reporting record financial results and strong forecasts for the upcoming period.\n\nShipment delay\n\nCurrently, Nigerian shippers now wait a long time to secure containers to load their imports in the country of origin into Nigeria. Check shows that it now takes between two and three weeks for Nigerian importers to secure containers from shipping companies.\n\nAccording to Sea-Intelligence, almost all trades have been impacted by bottlenecks in the global supply chain.\n\nIt states that while there was an initial pandemic increase in delays during the first half of 2020, after a brief period of improvement in summer 2020, the delays then escalated significantly in late 2020 and early 2021.\n\nSea-Intelligence further states in another report that the schedule reliability of international carriers was still very poor in September 2021 and that the average delay for late vessel arrivals also dropped to 7.27 days, which has been a theme throughout 2021.\n\nThis means that even when Nigerian shippers manage to secure containers to load their goods at the port of origin, it does not mean that the vessel that is supposed to lift the container comes as scheduled. In most cases, it takes an average of seven to eight days for the vessel to arrive at the port to lift the container.\n\nAt the moment, there is a backlog of Nigerian-bound goods awaiting shipment from Europe, America, China, and India due to the scarcity of containers to load the goods. With this, goods that ought to spend three weeks before getting to the destination port may take longer than one month.\n\n\u201cThe shipment time from China to Nigeria ports has significantly increased from what used to be two months to about four to five months, depending on the efficiency of the shipping lines. Delay in transit time has made many manufacturing companies in Nigeria increase their inventory holding and this has put a lot of pressure on the working capital,\u201d Ayabae states.\n\nFred Agu, an Italian-based importer, says he has not been able to secure a container to ship his imports into Nigeria since the past three weeks, noting, \u201cI was given a two-week schedule to get a container to load my goods that are met for Nigeria, but three weeks down the line, I am still hoping to secure a container.\u201d\n\nThe skyrocketing cost of production\n\nThe congestion in US ports, which has resulted in a global scarcity of containers, has begun to have high-cost implications for businesses in Nigeria, particularly those that depend on imports for critical inputs.\n\nAccording to Ayabae, the cost of running manufacturing operations in Nigeria that depend largely on imported materials for their production has become so high.\n\nThis, he says, has got to the point that small and medium manufacturing companies are struggling to survive while others have closed shops, waiting till when the current situation will possibly change.\n\nContinuous inflation\n\nThe market prices of goods in Nigeria, particularly food and other household consumables have continued to increase. This can be attributed to two factors including the increasing exchange rate of naira to dollar and the high cost of production, which is as a result of a delay in sourcing raw material and high cost of freight.\n\nAnakebe notes that the development would seriously affect the prices of goods, especially now that the Nigerian economy is dealing with high inflation.\n\nThe importer, he says, must increase prices to recoup the invested capital through high prices of goods.",

Looking around today, you see the traffic along Sakponba Road is hectic. Those buses will come here so that we can relieve the city of the terrible traffic situation we are currently experiencing because of the lack of a central park.\n\n\u201cWe have acquired all the other properties on Oba Market Road for expansion of this park. Currently, this park will take 370 buses at any point in time. We are expecting that by the time we expand this facility, it will take over 1000 buses, which is almost twice the capacity we are experiencing today across the city.\u201d\n\nResponding to concerns on maintenance of the facilities by transporters, he said, \u201cThere is nothing wrong in trying to make these people get to international standard. They are human beings; they can learn. Our responsibility is to provide the facilities, train and upgrade them. You don\u2019t say they are down and leave them there.\n\n\u201cYour responsibility as a leader is to pull them up and get them to experience what their mates everywhere in the world are experiencing.\u201d\n\nObaseki added, \u201cThe Central Park is going to be connected to the Ossiomo Power Plant with 24/7 hours of electricity. It\u2019s going to have Wifi and a supermarket; it is just going to be like any other ultra-modern transport terminus in the world.\n\n\u201cWe are working with Edo State Public Building Agency and they are currently working out a maintenance agreement like a private-public partnership agreement for most of the government buildings and facilities.\u201d\n\nThe park, located along the Obakhavbaye axis of Ring Road, is expected to accommodate both Edo City Transport Service and minibusses.\n\n...",

          "text": "Ihiala, one of the 21 local government areas in Anambra, is almost on everyone\u2019s lips as far as the 2021 governorship election in the South-east state is concerned.\n\nAfter Saturday\u2019s election, Charles Soludo, the candidate of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), was at the threshold of victory, almost, when the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) suspended the collation of results and announced that election would be held in Ihiala on Tuesday, November 9 as required by law.\n\nINEC said it could not conduct an election in Ihiala on Saturday because of a security threat.\n\nMr Soludo won in 18 out of the 20 local government areas where results have been announced. He scored a total of 103,946 votes.\n\nHis closest rival, Valentine Ozigbo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), won in only one local government area and scored a total of 51,322 votes.\n\nThe margin between Messrs Soludo and Ozigbo is 52,624 votes but there are 148,407 registered voters in Ihiala, according to INEC.\n\nIn the eyes of the law, PDP can get enough votes in Ihiala to secure more votes overall than APGA in the governorship election.\n\nThat is why INEC insisted that the election must be held in Ihiala.\n\nIf this happens and PDP is also able to secure at least 25 per cent of votes cast in two-thirds of the 21 local government areas, Mr Ozigbo will leapfrog his APGA opponent and win the Anambra governorship election.\n\nBut in reality, can this happen? Can Mr Ozigbo beat Mr Soludo in Ihiala? Most unlikely, it appears.\n\nConsidering the history of poor voter turnout in Anambra, it is unlikely to have up to 40,000 voters coming out to vote in the election in Ihiala.\n\nEven if PDP puts in its very best and achieves an excellent job in mobilising voters, it is improbable that all the voters will vote for one party.\n\nAdded to that is that Ihiala is an APGA stronghold, judging from the results of the three previous governorship elections.\n\nIn the 2010 election which APGA candidate, Peter Obi won, the party scored 5,996 votes in Ihiala, while PDP had 4,945 votes.\n\nIn 2013, another APGA candidate, Willie Obiano, the current governor of Anambra, scored 10,274 votes in Ihiala, against PDP\u2019s 5,520 votes.\n\nMr Obiano won re-election in 2017. In that election, APGA scored 14,379 votes against PDP\u2019s 4,706 votes.\n\nSoludo waiting to be declared winner\n\nHaving performed poorly during Saturday\u2019s election, APC appears to have given up. And there is no likelihood of the party joining forces with PDP in today\u2019s election in Ihiala since both parties traditionally do not work together.\n\nPDP is going to put up a strong fight in Ihiala, but it is unlikely for them to beat APGA in the area.\n\nMr Soludo is just waiting to be declared the winner, obviously.\n\nVoting in Ihiala ends by 4 p.m., according to INEC. Nigerians should definitely know who is the next governor of Anambra later today.",

          "text": "Nigerian governors under the aegis of Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), have accused the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), of misrepresentation of facts with respect to the controversial $418m refund request by consultants on to the Paris Club refund.\n\nThe umbrella body of governors of the 36 states of the federation made the accusation in a statement titled, \u2018Re: Paris Club Refund: FG counters states, insists deduction lawful, NGF: Deduction not only unlawful, but it is also contrary to public policy and morality\u2019, signed by the NGF\u2019s Head of Media and Public Affairs, Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, in Abuja on Monday.\n\nA Federal High Court sitting in Abuja had on Friday barred the Federal Government from deducting $418m from the bank accounts of the 36 states of the federation, PUNCH reported.\n\nThe amount allegedly owed the consultants for services rendered during negotiations for the refund, has been a source of dispute between the three tiers of government.\n\nBello-Barkindo noted that the position of the AGF as contained in a statement signed by his Media Adviser, Dr Umar Gwandu, on Friday, in which he displayed open support for the consultants against the states \u201craises questions of propriety and the spirit of justice.\u201d\n\nThe NGF spokesman noted that the payment in question was made in favour of private contractors and/or consultants for the alleged work done for the states and local governments on the Paris Club refund.\n\n\u201cWe need to state quickly that when we first read this press release, we had to double-check to be sure that it was not authored by a lawyer representing either one or all the promissory notes\u2019 recipients,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe AGF is supposed to be the chief arbiter in all matters concerning Nigerians, especially the poor masses of this country. It is incumbent upon him to, not just ensure that justice is done, but that justice is seen to have been done.\n\n\u201cThe undue haste with which the statement was issued even before the service on the AGF of the court processes and the order dated November 5, 2021, restraining the Federal Government, seems to suggest that there is a special relationship between the office of the AGF and the consultants over and above Nigerian citizens, whose interest the AGF as the Chief Law Officer of the Federation, is statutorily bound to always protect.\n\n\u201cThe statement also suggests that the restraining order issued last Friday not only unsettled preconceived plans and angered the unnamed \u2018government officers\u2019 referred to by the media aide.\u201d\n\nBello-Barkindo described Malami\u2019s claim that he intervened to pay the contractors to avoid the execution of judgments against the Federal Government\u2019s resources as false.\n\nHe also countered claims that the NGF and the local government were seeking to transfer their liability to the Federal Government, saying there was no liability to transfer in the first place.\n\nAccording to him, the NGF has not provided any undertaking or indemnity to the Federal Government to act on its behalf as represented by the AGF.\n\nBello-Barkindo advised Malami to remain neutral and protect scarce public resources.\n\n\u201cLet him (Malami) advise the contractors to wait until all appeals and litigation in court are concluded. That is the true test of observing the rule of law. There is no other way, uncomfortable as that would appear,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cState resources needed for critical development should not under any guise be frittered away as payments for contracts, whose veracity and authenticity is still a subject of litigation and disputation.\n\n\u201cThese contractors are impecunious and cannot pay restitution to the states/LGAs if the appeals or other litigation are determined against them.\n\n\u201cWe call on the general public to be alert and vigilant. The debt relief granted to Nigeria by the Paris Club in 2005 was meant to enable her to have a respite and use the resources saved for meaningful development.\n\n\u201cIt was not for distribution to private persons to fund their luxurious lives; neither can Nigeria justify her borrowing funds all over the world to fund capital projects and turn round to disburse state resources to individuals in a manner that offends all public sensibilities.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NGF, the media aide to the AGF justified the deductions on the basis that they were made pursuant to four court judgments, two of which were consent judgments and/or that the NGF/states and local government areas consented, expressed no objection to the payments and had already paid part of the debts to the said contractors and consultants.\n\nBello-Barkindo stated, \u201cThe statement by the media aide to the AGF conveniently and deliberately failed to name the judgments, which he claimed were relied upon by his principal to justify the payments and whether or not the cases in question are on appeal or challenged in any other way.\n\n\u201cAny discerning legal mind will find no difficulty in concluding that the so-called judgments under reference are dripping with too many irregularities bordering on competence and lack of jurisdiction, which are the bases why some of them are being challenged on appeal in other courts.\n\n\u201cNo diligent public officer would act on such judgments by recommending payment.\n\n\u201cIt is even more curious that the AGF also recommended payments to some contractors allegedly based on judgments that did not make any monetary award on claims that were struck out.\n\n\u201cThe AGF may need to explain to Nigerians why these particular judgment debts are given unusual attention and priority, and processed with supersonic speed over and above all others; some of which preceded these so-called judgments and have been pending for settlement by the AGF for several years.\n\n\u201cWhile it is convenient to say that parts of these judgment debts have been paid with the release of USD$86,546,526.65 and N19,439,225,871.11 in 2016 and $100m in 2018 to the contractors with the concurrence of the NGF, that does not detract from the fact that they were payments wrongly made, which ought not to have been made even if they were products of consent judgments.\n\n\u201cStates can still go after the contractors to recover the funds wrongly made.\u201d",

          "text": "Senator Gbenga Obadara, a close supporter of former Governor Olusegun Osoba of Ogun State, has stated that the All Progressives Congress (APC) leaders did not desert him in London following his knee replacement surgery.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with DAILY POST, Obadara, who represented Ogun Central Senatorial District from 2011 to 2015, said, \u201cNobody abandoned Chief Osoba.\u201d\n\nMany politicians, according to the former Senator, have traveled to the United Kingdom to see the former governor after his surgery.\n\nBut, unlike when his colleague, Chief Bola Tinubu, was visited by politicians in London, Obadara said Osoba did not want the visits to be documented on social media.\n\n\u201cNobody abandoned Chief Osoba, Akinrogun is an enigma that cannot be abandoned. He is a father to many. He is not a loud man, he\u2019s not a man that encourages publicity about himself, though he\u2019s a father in the industry. Chief Osoba is an enigma, as we all know he\u2019s a national man. To say that he was abandoned is not a correct statement and we take exception to that, because I can tell you how many people that have gone to Chief Osoba. But, it is not when they take photographs and start posting on social media that we start celebrating that.\n\n\u201cOur governor was with him in London, and I know Senators have been there, and I know how many members of the House of Representatives have been there, and I know for sure that almost every other day, people talk to Chief Osoba.\n\n\u201cSo, Osoba is not somebody that you just go there and start posting. That is not his character. I can tell you that he\u2019s recuperating very well, he\u2019s in high spirit and that he has been abandoned is not a correct statement. I tell you, Chief Osoba is in high spirit and if you look at the COVID-19 variant that is still ravaging, one has to be extremely careful. This is an 83-year-old man. Having to turn the place to Mecca does not make any sense. He has done well as a two-term governor and he is the father of all in the State. I can tell you many people have been to him, calling him daily,\u201d Sen. Obadara said.\n\nThe former lawmaker told DAILY POST that Osoba should be expected back in the country in two or three months times after he must have fully recovered.\n\n\u201cFor a knee surgery, for proper recuperation and looking at his age, we are looking at about two to three months. It\u2019s only in our clime here that we see knee surgery as a life-threatening procedure. It is a thing that can happen by the time one begins to age,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, Obadara refused to tell our correspondent whether or not he has visited the elder statesman in London, as he also declined comments on who and who have been to the foreign country to show solidarity with him.\n\n\u201cI would not like to start mentioning names of those who have gone to see him and those who have not. But I am in contact with Chief Osoba. If I tell you whether I have gone or not, it means I will have to tell you those who have gone. I don\u2019t need to start reeling out names because Chief Osoba would not want that. He\u2019s a private man.\n\n\u201cThose insinuating that he has been abandoned should just leave the man to rest. They should allow the man to recuperate well and leave the man in the hands of God, which we know he\u2019s really enjoying his rest in England. This is a man that goes to London one month, two months, even without having surgery done. So, I can tell you nobody abandoned Chief Osoba and he does not feel like that,\u201d Obadara submitted.",

          "title": "Govs tackle Malami over planned $418m Paris Club refund deduction",
          "text": "The Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) has accused Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami of bias in his handling of the disputed $418 million allegedly owed private contractors and firms by the 36 States and Local Governments in relation to the Paris Club refund.\n\nThe NGF wondered why as a public officer, Malami was eager to ensure public funds were transferred to private individuals and entities even when the alleged debt was being disputed and currently subject of pending litigations.\n\nNGF Head, Media and Public Affairs, Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, said this in a statement Monday in Abuja.\n\nThe governors faulted Malami\u2019s claim that the federal government was right to have deducted the $418million from the accounts of the 36 states to settle the alleged debt.\n\nThe governors, who faulted some payments already made to some individuals and entities, further argued that the AGF, being a public officer ought to be driven by the need to protect public interest and ensure that public funds are not unjustly transferred to private individuals and interests with doubtful claims.\n\nThe governors\u2019 reaction followed a statement last Friday by the AGF\u2019s media aide, Umar Gwandu, where he attempted justifying the federal government\u2019s planned deduction of the sum to settle private contractors and/or consultants for alleged work done in relation to the Paris Club Refunds to the States and Local Governments.\n\nThe governors said: \u201cThe decision by the HAGF to throw his weight behind these consultants who have been battling desperately to grab $418m from the accounts of states and local governments raises questions of propriety and the spirit of justice.\n\n\u201cThe HAGF is supposed to be the chief arbiter in all matters concerning Nigerians, especially the poor masses of this country. It is incumbent upon him to, not just ensure that justice is done, but that justice is seen to have been done.\n\n\u201cThe undue haste, with which the statement was issued even before the service on the AGF of the court processes and the order dated 5th November, 2021restraining the Federal Government, seems to suggest that there is a special relationship between the Office of the HAGF and the consultants over and above Nigerian citizens, whose interest the HAGF as the Chief Law Officer of the Federation is statutorily bound to always protect.\n\n\u201cThe statement also suggests that the restraining order issued last Friday not only unsettled preconceived plans and angered the unnamed \u2018government officers\u2019 referred to by the media aide.\n\n\u201cThe media aide to the HAGF justifies the deductions on the basis that they are made pursuant to four court judgments; two of which are consent judgments and/or that the NGF/States and LGAs consented, expressed no objection to the payments and had already paid part of the debts to the said contractors and consultants.\n\n\u201cThe statement by the media aide to the HAGF however conveniently and deliberately failed to name the judgments under reference and whether they are on appeal or challenged in any other way.\n\n\u201cHe also failed to specify which of the four judgments authorized payments and in what proportion to each of the contractors.\n\n\u201cWhile it is very easy to argue as the AGF does, that the NGF and ALGON took no early steps to appeal as they should have done, it is important to inform the Nigerian public that State governors have since appealed and are challenging the judgments in various courts.\n\n\u201cInterestingly the AGF has been served all these processes, nevertheless, this was ignored and payment was authorized to be made and has been processed with unprecedented speed not common in the public service.\n\n\u201cIt must be stated that between the NGF and AGF, the latter is in more vantage constitutional position and has a legal responsibility and burden to defend public interest.\n\n\u201cThe AGF should have therefore initiated appeals against the said judgments once his attention was drawn to them, because public interest was at stake involving huge sums of money meant for the provision of public services.\u201d\n\nThey further said: \u201cIt must be noted that the state governments were not parties to any of the said judgments. It should be further stated that the Office of the AGF failed to professionally defend the cases leading to those judgments and the courts commented on that unprofessional attitude.\n\n\u201cWhile we are constrained not to comment on a subject which is sub-judice, we have a responsibility to the public to respond in some detail to the statement issued by the Office of the AGF in order to put the records straight.\n\n\u201cAny discerning legal mind would find no difficulty in concluding that the so-called judgments under reference are dripping with too many irregularities bordering on competence and lack of jurisdiction which are the bases why some of them are being challenged on appeal and in other courts. No diligent public officer would act on such judgments by recommending payment.\n\n\u201cIt is even more curious that the AGF also recommended payments to some contractors allegedly based on Judgments that did not make any monetary award or on claims that were struck out.\n\n\u201cThe AGF may need to explain to Nigerians why these particular judgment debts are given unusual attention and priority and processed with supersonic speed over and above all others; some of which preceded these so-called judgments and have been pending for settlement by the AGF for several years.\n\n\u201cWhile it is convenient to say that part of these judgment debts have been paid with the release of USD$86,546, 526.65 and N19, 439,225,871.11 in 2016 and $100m in 2018 to the contractors with the concurrence of the NGF; that does not detract from the fact that they were payments wrongly made which ought not to have been made even if they were products of consent Judgments. States can still go after the contractors to recover the funds wrongly made.\n\n\u201cIt should concern the HAGF that ALGON disowned the contracts claimed by RIOK and the same was duly communicated to him requesting him to prevent the use of LG funds to \u201csettle dubious and illegal claims\u201d\n\nThe statement further asked: \u201cWas the AGF not concerned that several contractors are laying claim to legal fees for the same Paris Club Refund? Was it lost on the AGF on the detailed procedure available under the law how legal fees can be claimed in deserving cases?\n\n\u201cOne of the strange payments made is that of USD$47,831,920 million to Panic Alert Security Systems Ltd/George Uboh for allegedly reviewing a 16-page judgment for the then factional NGF. Can the Office of the HAGF point to any consent judgment awarding that sum to PANIC Alert? Did the NGF\u2019s letter of 20th January, 2020 relied upon by the HAGF ever recommend the payment of any sum?\n\n\u201cLINAS and NED Nwoko in this scheme are walking away with US$68,658,193.83 state funds allegedly for legal consultancy services. Is the AGF not aware that the work alleged to have been done by him was already contained in a FAAC Reconciliation Committee Report constituted in 2005 submitted in 2007 with recommendations on how states and LGAs should be refunded the over charges from the Paris Club Refunds.\n\n\u201cDr. Ted Iseghohi-Edwards has been paid the sum of USD$159m in promissory notes, yet he had his matter in Suit No FCT/HC/CV/1353/18 struck out on November 10th, 2020.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the legal basis for his claim is rooted in SUIT NO FHC/ABJ/CS/130/13: LINAS INTERNATIONAL LTD & 235 ORS V FGN which clearly stated that he cannot benefit under the judgment because he was not a party in the case and cannot enforce the terms of the judgment. Contrary to the representation of the AGF, the EFCC\u2019s report on TED was negative.\n\n\u201cThe report not only recommended his arrest but a forfeiture of any of his assets associated with the Paris Club Refund. The AGF ignored these recommendations.\n\n\u201cRIOK to whom the AGF supports and recommends the payment of USD$142,028,941.95 was also excluded by Justice Ademola in the Judgment in the LINAS case. This was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Appeal No CA/558/2017.\n\n\u201cThat is the appeal now before the Supreme Court (SC). Which Judgment then is the basis of the AGF recommendation that RIOK be paid the sum of $142, 028,941.95. There is also no evidence of execution of any contract by RIOK. Curiously, the Department of State Security (DSS) is alleged to have confirmed 50% execution.\n\n\u201cThe Court and EFCC stated clearly that it is not the responsibility of the DSS to ascertain the execution of contracts as they do not have the expertise. ALGON disowned the contracts. Why will the AGF insist on them? It is not true that the EFCC in its report recommended payment to the contractors. It did not.\n\n\u201cIn the case of payments recommended and paid to Prince Orji Nwafor Orizu US$1,219,440.45, and Olaitan Bello \u2013 US$215,195.36, it remains a mystery. These two lawyers are alleged to have performed legal services for RIOK and its associated companies and not for the states or LGAs. Why they are paid from State resources is only imagined.\n\n\u201cThe AGF also claims he intervened to pay the contractors to avoid execution of the judgments against the federal government resources. That is absolutely not true at all. Assets of the FGN were not at any time threatened.\n\n\u201cThe NGF is not aware that there is any existing mandamus issued by any court in favour of the contractors against the Federal Government. The only application for mandamus by PANIC Alert is pending for hearing at the Federal High Court and parties have since joined issues.\n\n\u201cThe AGF also says that the NGF and LGAs seek to transfer their liability to the FGN. That is not true. There is no liability to transfer in the first place and none exists; neither has the NGF provided any undertaking or indemnity to the FGN to act on its behalf as represented by the AGF.\n\n\u201cThe AGF has consistently stated that this administration is an avid respecter of the rule of law. This is one case in which this commitment should be fully and completely demonstrated. Let the AGF remain neutral and protect scarce public resources.\n\n\u201cLet him advise the contractors to wait until all appeals and litigations in court are concluded. That is the true test of observing the rule of law. There is no other way, uncomfortable as that would appear.\n\n\u201cState resources needed for critical development should not under any guise be frittered away as payments for contracts whose veracity and authenticity is still a subject of litigation and disputation.\n\n\u201cThese contractors are impecunious and cannot restitute the states/LGAs if the appeals or other litigation are determined against them.\n\n\u201cWe call on the general public to be alert and vigilant. The debt relief granted Nigeria by the Paris Club in 2005 was meant to enable her have a respite and use the resources saved for meaningful development.\n\n\u201cIt was not for distribution to private persons to fund their luxurious lives; neither can Nigeria justify her borrowing funds all over the world to fund capital projects and turn round to disburse state resources to individuals in a manner that offends all public sensibilities.\n\n\u201cWe urge all those appointed as gatekeepers to our laws to ensure that the laws of our land are respected and protected. Let professionalism, reasonable caution and due diligence prevail on this matter, please.\u201d",

          "text": "The federal government Monday declared planned investigation into contracts allegedly signed by previous administrations with Process and Industrial Development Limited (P&ID).\n\nThe contracts put at $10 billion, it said, were in breach of due process and procedure and capable of undermining the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nMinister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation Abubakar Malami (SAN) stated this while appearing before the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters for 2022 budget defence session.\n\nIn January 2017, an independent London tribunal found that Nigeria was liable for $6.6 billion in damages against P&ID after it failed to deliver on terms agreed in a 2010 gas facility contract.\n\nAnd in a bid to get the ruling enforced three years later, P&ID got another ruling from a United Kingdom (U.K.) court that Nigeria\u2019s state-owned assets could be seized if the country refused to settle its bill which had risen to $9.6 billion because of accrued interest.\n\nNigeria was however in 2020 granted the right to appeal the judgement but asked to pay $200 million in the meantime.\n\nWhile responding to questions from members of the committee chaired by Senator Opeyemi Bamidele by (APC Ekiti Central) on the case, Malami said P&ID contract was never allowed to pass through the office of the Attorney General and that the contract clauses were inimical to Nigeria\u2019s interest.\n\nAccording to him, a taskforce already set up for thorough findings on the contracts signed against the interest of the country by previous administrations, would spend N1.1 billion in 2022.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is the taskforce that is intended to review the existing problematic contracts that have the capacity to undermine the economy as far as the P&ID is concerned.\n\n\u201cIn the office of the Attorney General, there exists two fundamental departments relating to vetting of contracts. Solicitor Department is charged with vetting any governmental contract and they have lived up to expectations over time.\n\n\u201cBut the major problem with P&ID is that contract was never ever allowed to pass through the Office of the Attorney General for vetting. So, on account of that, there are clauses embedded in the contract that are inimical to the interest of the nation.\n\n\u201cBecause of the fact\n\nthat there is a preliminary conspiracy among the key promoters of the contract, the contract was never allowed to pass through the Federal Executive Council (FEC) for its approval, neither was it allowed to pass through the Federal Ministry of Justice for vetting.\n\n\u201cThe existing structures are there, but they can only act in respect of contracts that are referred to the department.\n\n\u201cFor example, as it is now, even though in respect of government contracts, arising from the fact that China is involving certain clauses regarding immunity which some ministries and departments are willing to compromise, they are not allowed to pass.\n\n\u201cWe have developed need for other circulars that these are intended clauses that could be tolerated in public interest and the interest of the nation in mind were attached. What I\u2019m saying in essence is that the taskforce is poised at looking at it.\n\n\u201cIn respect of P&ID, there were about nine contracts that were signed at the same time in breach of due processes and procedures.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the committee chairman, Senator Bamidele lamented soaring judgement debts which, according to him, had become national embarrassment, and called for urgent action to arrest the situation. .\n\nBamidele said: \u201cIt is also pertinent to state that the judgement debt profile of the country keeps soaring without corresponding response from government in order to address the situation.\n\n\u201cThis development is now viewed as a national embarrassment and necessary action must be taken to ensure that the image of the country is protected.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, I implore you prioritise your budget and make a case for legislative intervention where necessary, in order to ensure that this area of concern is critically looked into, with a view to proffering the much needed solution.\u201d\n\nThe ministry proposed N11.8 billion for 2022 budget with personnel cost taking N3.9 billion, overhead cost (exclusive of legal services) \u2013 N2.4billion, legal services \u2013 N2 billion and capital budget- N3.5 billion.",

For example, in Ekwusigo LGA, Ward 3, Units 3, 4, 5 and 6, and Ward 5 Units 1 and 2, CDD\u2019s observers reported the seamless deployment of the BVAS.\n\n\u201cCDD believes that the intention behind the introduction of the BVAS is laudable,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking on the device\u2019s success, Senior Fellow at CDD Jibrin Ibrahim said it showed the importance of technology in preventing election misconduct.\n\n\u201cIts successful deployment in many areas demonstrates the lingering benefit of integrating technology to prevent electoral malpractice,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the centre also noted that the BVAS device had failed in some areas and called on the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC to address and improve the infrastructure supporting the BVAS ahead of subsequent elections.\n\n\u201cPersistent glitches with the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System BVAS have raised important questions about adapting technology to local environments.\n\n\u201cOur message to INEC is that they have to improve on technical capacity and skills.

Perhaps the biggest one was the narrative which appeared in several different iterations claiming that the APC had already written results in advance in 10LGAs.\n\n\u201cThis narrative was attributed to Governor Willie Obiano. The CDD fact-checkers found this to be false. These demonstrate the need for info-vigilance with respect to elections,\u201d Amadi said.\n\nThe centre recommended that Ihiala LGA elections be conducted according to electoral guidelines and called on the Nigerian government to address the worsening security situation across the country against the 2023 elections.\n\nINEC was also urged to resolve its logistics challenges and increase the pace of results transmission to assure citizens of the integrity of the process.",

Ayuba Abok.\n\nThe coalition which is an umbrella body of about 74 civil society organisations, expressed concern at the turn of events in the aftermath of impeachment of the former Speaker, which it said was unhealthy for the much-needed peaceful atmosphere in the state.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Abuja yesterday, the Convener of the coalition, Comrade James Dauda who was flanked by other members maintained that attempt to whip up sentiment through spurious allegation that Governor Lalong was behind the impeachment of the former Speaker was not only condemnable but unacceptable in a democratic setting.\n\nThe group noted that the governor, who is the chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, NGF , was the first to grant judicial and legislative autonomy in Nigeria which the former Speaker enjoyed the privilege.\n\nIt wondered how members of the State House of Assembly, which is independent of the executive arm of government in the state, turned out to impeach its Speaker for reasons best known to them, yet the governor is being accused of \u2018behind the scene\u2019 role.\n\n\u201cGentlemen of the press, we are aware that Plateau State House of Assembly was the first out of 36 States of the Federation to enjoy legislative and judicial autonomy, even when Hon.

Akpabio noted that the preparation of the ministry\u2019s budget was conceived in line with the Federal Government\u2018s2022 Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability premised on repositioning the economy on the path of growth and resilience.\n\nWhile presenting a total budgetary proposal of the sum of N28,131,295,396 allocated to the Ministry comprising, personal (N1,692,591,184) overhead (N877,089,120) and capital (N25,561,615,092), the minister noted that, \u201cthe Ministry ensured that core projects were consistent with the Administrations Agenda Policies/strategies contained in the Medium Term National Development Plan (MTNDP), 2021-2025, according priority to on-going projects\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe 2022 Budgetary Allocation is meagre and significantly inadequate in the face of the mandate and goals of the Ministry to meet the yearnings and aspirations of the people. The volume of the outstanding liabilities with underfunding has affected ongoing projects/programmes of the Ministry across the region and this is gradually contributing to the resurgence of problems in some areas of the region,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking earlier, during the budget presentation the Chairman House of Representative Committee on Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs Hon. Essien Ekpeyong, assured that the Legislature is committed to the security of lives and investment in the Niger Delta region and for economic and social activities to strive. Therefore, he said, the budget proposal of N25.56 billion would be given due attention in line with the 2021 budgetary review.\n\nHe explained that there was need for the Executive and Legislature to work together to ensure that thousands of uncompleted projects scattered across the region are completed for the betterment of the life of the people.\n\nHe also noted that the House would also consider if there were challenges that would require legislative intervention, particularly in the area of funding in respect of the East-West Road by setting up committee to work with the ministry in this regard.",

          "text": "Sokoto state governor Aminu Tambuwal has responded to false allegations made by the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its protagonists that his administration\u2019s recent approval to borrow N28.7 billion will further entail the state becoming one of the country\u2019s most indebted states.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth, he claims, as his administration only borrows to fund capital projects due to a lack of funds from federal appropriations and little revenue generated internally (IGR).\n\nThe governor stated this at a stakeholders town hall meeting on the implementation of the 2021 budget and public inputs into the making of the 2022 budget held at the International Conference Center, Kasarawa in the state capital.\n\nIn statement signed by the governor\u2019s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity Mohammed Bello, said issues discussed during the more than three hours gathering include: demand for the increasing of budget for health, training of doctors, family (spacing) planning, shelter for victims of sexual abuse, support for accreditation of health institutions, implementation of capital projects and payments of salary.\n\nOther matters discussed at the meeting included giving the state board of internal revenue autonomy, improving the Sokoto state Geographic Information System (SOGIS), upgrading the Lugu dam in the Wurno local government area, an undisclosed firm building, operating, and transferring a new onion market to the state government, cattle breeding, and consolidating gains made thus far.\n\nGovernor Tambuwal was cited in the statement as adding, \u2018Someone, somewhere, sitting in the corner of his chamber, by name Dr Abubakar Alkali.\u2019 He went on to add that Sokoto is heavily indebted, which I believe he is an indigene of this state.\n\n\u201cAnd, I don\u2019t know where he got his figures. He muddled everything and make it sound as if Sokoto is the worst state that is debt bedeviled,\u201d\n\nIn addition, contrary to Alkali\u2019s assertion, a participant at Monday\u2019s stakeholders meeting stated that Sokoto state\u2019s internal debt profile as of June 2021 places it as the country\u2019s 21st most indebted state out of 36.\n\nFor this reason, the participant suggested that the state government should avail itself of the opportunities available in the global economic platforms through acquisition of bilateral loans so as to enable it complete many of the laudable legacy projects it has started.\n\n\u201cI know they (APC and its supporters like Dr Alkali) cannot be happy,\u201d noted the Governor, who said: \u201cI know him. He was a CPC member, now an APC member. He is trying so politicize the issue of borrowing for development.\n\n\u201cEven America is borrowing. They are borrowing till today. So, what are you talking about? What is important is that do you really apply the money you borrowed to the development of your people or are you doing as some people are doing-they borrow money from China and neighboring Ghana will borrow less amount of money for a better project; and then, here in Nigeria we borrow higher money for lesser projects.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing that in Sokoto state. We borrow and we implement. It is not everybody that you go to the Assembly and seek for approval, that you actually have a draw down. Some of the approvals that we have are still there. No draw down has been actually done. We are not borrowing for personnel cost. We are not borrowing for recurrent expenditure. We are borrowing for capital expenditure, which allowed and healthy globally,\u201d he added.\n\nHe appealed to the APC to tone down its virulent \u201cdosage of partisanship when it comes to issues of security and development. If people are doing well, say it,\u201d he stated, citing the commendation of the Majority Leader of the House of Representatives, Hon. Alhassan Ado Doguwa, who commended the accomplishments of the state government when he visited recently.\n\n\u201cAre you more APC than him? He came and saw what we were doing and he commended the government of Sokoto state,\u201d the Governor pointed out, emphasizing that: \u201cFor goodness sake, those in APC in Sokoto should calm down. Let them be fair and fair minded; and, accept the fact that the government of Sokoto state, by the special grace of God, is doing well.",

          "text": "UN political chief Rosemary DiCarlo has said the risk of Ethiopia \u201cdescending into widening civil war is only too real\u201d, adding that the political repercussions of \u201cintensifying violence in the wider region would be immense, compounding the many crises besetting the Horn of Africa\u201d.\n\nAddressing the Security Council on Monday, the UN under-secretary-general for political and peacebuilding affairs said, despite much speculation on how the Ethiopian crisis will unfold in the coming weeks, \u201cin a country of over 110 million people, over 90 different ethnic groups and 80 languages, no one can predict what continued fighting and insecurity will bring\u201d.\n\nShe said more than seven million people needed humanitarian assistance in northern Ethiopia alone, with an estimated 400,000 people in Tigray living in famine-like conditions.\n\nShe said, while some emergency supplies have been moved, it has been four months since the last big shipment of medicines and health supplies into Tigray which is home to about six million people.\n\nThe UN official said the report of the Joint Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights or OHCHR-Ethiopian Human Rights Commission investigation into the conflict in Tigray released last week shed light on the horrific suffering civilians have endured.\n\nThe report concluded that there are reasonable grounds to believe that all parties to the conflict \u2013 including the Ethiopian National Defence Force, Eritrean Defence Force, Amhara Special Forces and allied militia on one side and Tigrayan forces on the other \u2013 committed violations of international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law. It also stated that war crimes and crimes against humanity may have been also committed.\n\nDiCarlo said there must be an immediate cessation of hostilities, as called for by the UN secretary-general, African Union Commission chair, Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) executive secretary, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, and the UN Security Council.\n\nShe said, \u201cEthiopia, a founding member of the United Nations, needs our support. We urge Ethiopians to come together to build a shared, prosperous future before it is too late.\u201d\n\nThe Ethiopian government\u2019s conflict with the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) began a year ago and has accelerated in recent days, with a nationwide state of emergency declared last week and residents of the capital told to be ready to take up arms to defend residential areas.\n\nThousands have been killed and more than two million have fled their homes since last November, when Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed launched a military offensive against the TPLF, which had long run Tigray and was a main player in Ethiopia\u2019s national politics.\n\nTensions began to simmer when Abiy came to power in 2018 and sought to reduce its influence.\n\nSince the beginning of August, the conflict has spread from Tigray to the neighbouring regions of Afar and Amhara. Together with rebels of the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), the TPLF has threatened to advance towards the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.\n\nTens of thousands of people have rallied in Addis Ababa in solidarity with the Abiy-led government.\n\nThe pleas for peace come as a new round of deadly attacks and forced conscription began against ethnic Tigrayans in an area of the country now controlled by Amhara regional authorities in collaboration with soldiers from neighbouring Eritrea, people fleeing over the border to Sudan told The Associated Press news agency.\n\nMeanwhile, the African Union High Representative for the Horn of Africa, Olusegun Obasanjo, said the crisis situation in northern Ethiopia had continued to drastically deteriorate in recent weeks, leading to a serious escalation of the situation.\n\nObasanjo, who is currently in Ethiopia, said he has been engaging with all stakeholders, including the prime minister and president of Ethiopia, in an effort to de-escalate the situation.\n\nObasanjo said the time is now for collective action in finding lasting solutions to avoid further escalation which may have a direct effect on the strategic security of the Horn of Africa region as a whole.\n\nHe urged the Council to consider strongly urging and encouraging the Federal Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray rebels to engage in political dialogue without any conditions.\n\nOn Monday, the US State Department said Washington believes there is a small window to work with the African Union to further efforts to peacefully resolve the conflict.\n\nUS Special Envoy Jeffrey Feltman visited Addis Ababa on Monday as part of diplomatic efforts to end the conflict.",

          "text": "Warsaw accuses Minsk of trying to trigger a major confrontation along the frontier as months-long border crisis escalates.\n\nPoland says it has repelled an attempt by hundreds of migrants and refugees to enter the country from its eastern neighbour, Belarus, and said thousands of others were on the way.\n\nWarsaw said it had deployed additional soldiers, border guards and police in response to the situation along its eastern border, while video clips shared on social media purportedly showed people walking towards the frontier and some trying to breach a barbed-wire border fence using spades and other items.\n\nThe developments appeared to signal an escalation of a crisis that has been rumbling for months.\n\nThe European Union has accused Minsk of encouraging migrants from the Middle East and Africa to cross into the bloc via member states Poland, Lithuania and Latvia from Belarus as a form of hybrid warfare in revenge for Western sanctions on longtime President Alexander Lukashenko\u2019s government.\n\nLukashenko, who launched a crackdown on dissent in Belarus after winning a sixth term in a disputed presidential election held in August last year, has repeatedly denied those accusations.\n\nPoland said it had withstood the first attempts on Monday by those gathered along its border to force their way across the frontier.\n\nA video distributed by Polish authorities showed one man cutting part of a barbed-wire fence, another attacking the fence with a spade, while a Polish soldier sprayed an unidentified substance from a can.\n\n\u201cInterior ministry forces and soldiers managed to stop the first mass attempt to breach the border,\u201d Poland\u2019s defence ministry tweeted.\n\n\u201cMigrants have set up a camp in the Kuznica region. They are constantly guarded by Belarusian services.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier video, shared by the Belarusian blogging service NEXTA, people carrying rucksacks and wearing winter clothing were seen walking on the side of a highway. Other videos showed large groups sitting by the road and being escorted by armed men dressed in khaki.\n\nPolish government spokesman Piotr Muller told reporters that 3,000-4,000 migrants were near the Polish border.\n\n\u201cWe expect that there may be an escalation of this type of action on the Polish border in the near future, which will be of an armed nature,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Belarusian state border committee confirmed on Monday that many migrants and refugees were moving towards the Polish border. It also said Warsaw, which has stationed more than 12,000 troops in the region, was taking an \u201cinhumane attitude\u201d.\n\nLithuania, meanwhile, said it was moving additional troops to its border with Belarus to prepare for a possible surge in attempted crossings from the latter, while Latvia described the situation as \u201calarming\u201d.\n\nThe EU vowed action in the face of what it said was a \u201chybrid threat\u201d.\n\nIn a statement later on Monday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called on member states to impose new sanctions against Belarus.\n\nThe use \u201cof migrants for political purposes is unacceptable\u201d, she said in a statement. Brussels would also look at how to sanction \u201cthird-country airlines\u201d that brought migrants to Belarus, she added.\n\nA statement from the US State Department called on the government in Belarus to \u201cimmediately halt its campaign of orchestrating and coercing irregular migrant flows across its borders into Europe\u201d.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Dominic Kane, reporting from the German city of Frankfurt an der Oder, on the country\u2019s border with Poland, said the developments at the Polish-Belarus border were of significance for the EU on two fronts.\n\n\u201cIt represents the two border issues with which the EU has to wrestle \u2013 the first one, its inner borders within member states, and the second one its outer borders, between member states and non-EU countries,\u201d Kane said.\n\n\u201cThe EU wants to keep its borders within its member states wide open, but some of its borders, particularly with Belarus, very much more firmly under control,\u201d he added.\n\nExiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, meanwhile, urged a strong response from the EU and United Nations.\n\n\u201cBelarus\u2019 regime escalates the border crisis \u2013 migrants are pushed to EU border by armed men,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cThe migrant smuggling, violence & ill-treatment must stop.\u201d\n\nThe EU, the United States and United Kingdom all imposed sanctions on Belarus after Lukashenko unleashed a violent crackdown on mass protests following last year\u2019s presidential vote. All of Belarus\u2019s top opposition leaders are now either in prison or have fled the country.\n\nBut the 67-year-old, who has accused Western governments of having instigated the protests against him in the hope of fomenting a revolution, has so far withstood the penalties with the backing of ally and creditor Russia.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday defended Minsk\u2019s handling of the border crisis, saying Belarus was taking all necessary measures to act legally.\n\nBut human rights groups have criticised both Poland and Belarus for their treatment of migrants and refugees, who face freezing weather conditions and a lack of food and medical attention.\n\nWarsaw has said at least seven people have died in the region since August, when the border crisis erupted. There have also been reports of more deaths on the Belarusian side of the frontier.",

Many of them have come from the Middle East and Asia.\n\nGovernment spokesman Piotr Muller said up to 4,000 migrants had gathered near Poland\u2019s eastern border and told reporters that at some point they expected \u201can escalation\u2026 which will be of an armed nature\u201d.\n\nLocal TV said many of the migrants gathering near Kuznica were accompanied by armed individuals with dogs.\n\nThe head of Poland\u2019s national security department, Stanislaw Zaryn, said the migrants were under the control of Belarusian armed units. \u201cBelarus wants to cause a major incident, preferably with shots fired and casualties,\u201d deputy foreign minister Piotr Wawrzyk said earlier.\n\nOvernight temperatures at the border have slumped below zero and several migrants have already died. Activists say the migrants \u2013 many of them young men but also women and children \u2013 are being used as pawns in a political game between Belarus and its neighbours.\n\nThe EU alleges Belarus\u2019 authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko is provoking the influx in retaliation against the bloc\u2019s sanctions.\n\nIt imposed the measures after Mr Lukashenko\u2019s crackdown on mass protests following last year\u2019s widely discredited presidential election, and the arrest of a dissident journalist on board a Ryanair flight that was forced to land in Minsk.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would look at extending sanctions to include \u201cthird-country airlines\u201d involved in flying migrants to Belarus.\n\nMr Lukashenko has repeatedly warned his government will no longer stop the crowds, accusing border guards in the neighbouring EU nations of being violent towards migrants.\n\nGermany on Tuesday urged the EU to \u201ctake action\u201d to help Poland secure its borders, while the Nato military alliance said the Belarusian authorities were using migrants as political pawns.\n\nLithuania has also moved troops to its border with Belarus to prepare for a possible influx of migrants.\n\nMeanwhile, the US urged Mr Lukashenko to \u201cimmediately halt [his] campaign of orchestrating and coercing\u201d the illegal flow of migrants.\n\nPoland, which has been criticised for pushing back migrants and refugees at its border, has responded to the large number of people arriving in recent times by building a razor-wire fence.\n\nAs they are summarily expelled from Poland and Belarus refuses to allow them back in, people are finding themselves stranded and freezing in Poland\u2019s forests. Several have died of hypothermia.\n\nThe BBC\u2019s Paul Adams spoke to Barwa Nusreddine Ahmed, the brother of one Iraqi migrant who was at the border with his wife and three children. They arrived in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, last month.\n\nWith little to eat or drink, the people stuck at the border were suffering, Mr Ahmed said.\n\nHe said Monday\u2019s move to the border post was planned on social media by the migrants themselves, but suggested Belarus was pushing them.\n\n\u201cPeople know they\u2019re being used [by Mr Lukashenko], but they have no future,\u201d Mr Ahmed said.\n\nTensions intensified on Monday when videos posted on social media showed a column of people, including women and children, walking towards the Polish border in Belarus.\n\nOther videos showed large numbers of migrants being escorted by armed men dressed in khaki.\n\nIn other footage shared on social media, crowds of migrants can be seen attempting to breach a razor wire fence at the border, but being prevented from passing through by Polish border guards.\n\nThe Belarusian border guard agency earlier told state media that more than 2,000 \u201crefugees\u201d had amassed in front of Polish barriers. They were heading for the EU \u201cwhere they want to apply for protection\u201d, the agency said.",
