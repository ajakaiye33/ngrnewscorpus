Look at the people agitating, look at their antecedents. Some Yoruba leaders were some of those behind the advisors of the government against their own people.\n\n\u201cEven your governor here disowned Igboho who is agitating for Yoruba nation. Look at Chief M.K.O. Abiola before he was executed through the conspiracy theory, Babangida ensured that Yoruba people were used against him. They rose against him (Abiola). So, the Yoruba people are not prepared for self determination.\u201d\n\nOlagoke, who lamented the rate of insecurity in the country, said most of the uneducated youths have become armed bandits, kidnappers and killer herdsmen because of institutionalized hunger and poverty.\n\nOlagoke while speaking further wondered why Nigerian government has failed to fund the education sector.\n\n\u201cEducation in Nigeria is not functional. You can\u2019t give what you don\u2019t have. UNESCO says you must allocate 22 percent to fund education.\n\n\u201cBut the profile data we have in the last 15 years is 5percent, 7percent, 10 percent maximum. However, in Ghana, the data showed that about 32 percent were allocated to education and that has been so for the past 15 years .\n\n\u201cThat explains why many Nigerians are flying their children to Ghana for quality education.\u201d",

The song generally reflects on party life, fun and winding up at night. It\u2019s also a resonance of hope which tends to convene a message that you live now, enjoy the moment and trust that tomorrow will be better\u201d\n\nDiamond\u2019s successful career has seen him collaborate with notable singers around the world.

He said his abductors disclosed to him that they abducted him at the behest of the Nigerian government.\u2019\n\nOn whether Kanu had a hint of why he was abducted, the lawyer said that \u2018the people never said much on that except that they were told he was a Nigerian terrorist linked to the Islamic terrorists in Kenya. But after several days when they discovered his true identity, they tended to treat him less badly.\u2019\n\nContinuing, Barrister Ejimakor said that no warrant of arrest \u2018was shown to Kanu or even mentioned to him. And for the eight days, he was held incommunicado, nothing of presenting him before a Court or transferring him to an official detention facility was ever mentioned. He was held in a nondescript private facility and chained to a bare floor.\u2019\n\nAt the DSS, \u2018Kanu was interviewed for the first time in my presence by three DSS officers. The interview was revealing as it contained certain new allegations that were never heard of before. But they all relate to his status as the leader of IPOB,\u2019 Ejimakor said.\n\nThe lawyer added that \u2018despite what he has passed through, he was in high spirits and looked forward to overcoming the extraordinary rendition that brought him to Nigeria.\u2019\n\nThe lawyer stated that \u2018in my opinion, before any court can subject Kanu to trial, it has to first conduct a trial within a trial on the grievous incident that forced Kanu to leave Nigeria and the equally grievous incident that forced him back to Nigeria.

Yakubu Shehu Abdullahi, while moving the motion also prayed that the House should mandate the Committee on Petroleum Resources (Upstream) to invite the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation to give comprehensive representation on the level of work in the oil exploration currently being undertaken in Alkaleri Local Government Area of Bauchi and the successes recorded.\n\nHe recalled that on February, 2019 President Muhamadu Buhari flagged off the spud-in of kolmani river well drilling in Bauchi and directed NNPC to extend\n\nits exploration to six basins in the country.\n\nHe opined that it had become imperative to ascertain the fortunes at the disposal of the federal government in Alkaleri Local Government Area so as to hasten the process of giving effect to the\n\nprovisions of the new Petroleum Industry Bill, 2021 just passed by the National Assembly in terms of the\n\neconomic benefit the host communities stand to gain.\n\nHe said he was aware that any community from where oil was discovered or produced was entitled to\n\nseveral extra revenues for the sake of its environment, infrastructure and health impact.\n\nAccording to him, it\u2019s important for the people of Bauchi to start benefiting from the 13 percent derivation being the host\n\ncommunity incentives provided for by the law.\n\nWhen put to a voice vote by the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, majority of the lawmakers screamed, \u201cNay\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Why food-on-demand can be Gokada\u2019s ticket to super app stardom",
          "text": "Gokada\u2019s motorcycle-hailing business in Nigeria did not hibernate because there was no demand.\n\nThe evidence is on the streets of Lagos today where motorcycle transport has returned. If GRide had a death certificate, the cause of death would be head-on collision with sudden government policy. It was a near-death experience but Gokada scrapped itself for parts and started a rebirth in March 2020.\n\nIt has now been 18 months since the company pivoted from being a ride-hailing provider to a logistics company.\n\nGRide became GSend to help businesses and individuals in Lagos with intra-city deliveries. Since this pivot, delivery volume has increased by a hundred fold, revenue has increased 10 times and $100 million has been realised in annualized transaction value, according to the company.\n\nBut in its boldest step since it was founded in January 2018 by Fahim Saleh, Gokada now identifies as a super app. In addition to other items that can be packaged in a motorcyclist\u2019s delivery box, food is taking the centre stage.\n\nGokada\u2019s super app is entering the market at a time when Lagos residents are consuming \u20a65 trillion ($12 billion) worth of food annually. \u201cIf the population is to grow to about 30 million by 2030, Lagos will likely need food worth \u20a66.3 trillion on an annual basis,\u2019\u2019 the state\u2019s commissioner for Agriculture said in May.\n\nDika Oha, a former manager at Andela and Konga, who leads Gokada\u2019s product development says Gokada delivers more food than any other delivery service in Nigeria.\n\nDika Oha, VP of Product at Gokada. Image credit: Gokada\n\nThe claim is hard to verify without numbers from other players. But Gokada\u2019s evolution from transport provider to food aggregator could help ecosystem players understand the future of super apps in Africa.\n\nA standing fleet is an asset in emergencies\n\nIn August 2019, Gokada took a two-week break to readjust its business strategy following OPay\u2019s sensational entry into Nigeria\u2019s ride-hailing market.\n\nA new fleet of 200cc motorcycles were fitted with new tracking features. A higher standard of quality was demanded of drivers who, in many users\u2019 eyes, looked rather unkempt for a technology business.\n\nPerhaps not anticipated at inception, but these changes would serve the company effectively six months later.\n\nFacing existential questions about its future, Gokada repurposed the tracking feature from the ride-hailing business to begin winning customers over to GSend. \u201cWe decided we could not launch without that ability for customers to track,\u201d Victor Daminabo, Gokada\u2019s head of operations, tells me.\n\nBuilding on that foundation, Gokada set an audacious target: have drivers pick-up and complete every delivery in Lagos within two hours. They set up a goods-in-transit insurance policy to cover cases of damage or loss of items in their custody, Daminabo explains.\n\nStarting off as a service for sending individual packages, Gokada iterated to enable one driver to book and fulfill multiple deliveries. That iteration birthed \u2018Gokada for business\u2019 which helps enterprises create different user profiles for staff in various branches. The organisation uses one Gokada account but each unit can monitor deliveries separately.\n\nThis was how Gokada acquired Fan Milk and Jumia Foods as enterprise customers. Rather than invest in their own assets, these companies readily adopted Gokada\u2019s logistics fleet of over 1,000 motorcycles which is already integrated with payments systems like Paystack and Flutterwave.\n\nEating into other verticals\n\nAs the ghosts of GRide gave way to a thriving GSend, the data showed something interesting: Gokada says it has recorded over 1 million deliveries so far in 2021 and about 40% have been food deliveries.\n\nThis volume was driven by formal partnerships, like with Jumia Foods. But small and medium restaurants downloaded the app and used it to find drivers who would deliver food to customers.\n\nImage credit: Rotimi Daramola\n\nSusan*, who lives in the Surulere area of Lagos, tells me the food she ordered directly from a restaurant in her neighborhood in May was delivered by a Gokada driver.\n\nWith this happening frequently, it encouraged Gokada to float GShop, a service that aggregated restaurants, opening the door for the company to bundle all it offers onto one app.\n\nSo why a super app? On one level, it is a practical decision.\n\nUsers enter the company\u2019s ecosystem of services through one channel. That singular funnel makes it easier for the company\u2019s developers to manage updates. Growth and sales teams focus resources on selling one app.\n\nBut Oha, Gokada\u2019s VP of product, explains their motivation is also to take advantage of Nigerians\u2019 increasing familiarity with ecommerce as more businesses \u2013 food, fashion and furniture outlets \u2013 use Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to find and sell to customers.\n\nSocial media platforms grow through network effects \u2013 the presence of more users doing more things improves the quality and usefulness of the platforms.

WeChat and Alibaba serve 2 billion users a month across China and parts of Southeast Asia; but can Gokada find a market that large and homogenous?\n\nFrom food, back to ride-hailing\n\nThe only way to reach those exalted heights, then, is by aggressively focusing on customer satisfaction for high-demand products, making the app sticky and top of mind.\n\nOr as Oha puts it, ensuring Gokada is the first thought a user has when they need to order food \u2013 arguably a bigger need than sending parcels.\n\nTo assure users, Gokada is sticking with the simplicity and transparency that has made ride-hailing platforms universal: tap to order, input destination and track your order in real time as it arrives.\n\nGokada\u2019s food service notifies the user of each step along the delivery process to maintain engagement and offer assurance.\n\nAnd yes, pay on delivery.\n\nPerfecting this cycle also means paying attention to renowned global food delivery services like Doordash, Grubhub, UberEats and Deliveroo. The reward is that perfecting a time, quality and culture-sensitive business like food delivery in Africa can be a springboard for getting people to trust and use other products en masse.\n\nThose other products, according to Oha, could be groceries, fashion and electronics. And in cities that permit, motorcycle-taxi \u2013 the company\u2019s first love.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "With the increasing adoption of renewable energy use globally, a new player has emerged in the solar photovoltaic (PV) market for commercial and industrial (C&I) customers in Africa.\n\nWesta.Solar was recently launched as a joint venture between Oolu Solar, a solar home systems provider and RP Global, a renewable energy investment company.\n\nThe new company offers solar systems that range from 50kW to 5MW and has commenced operations in Nigeria. Last month, it deployed its first rooftop plant at Kano-based Petrichor Industries, a packaging products manufacturing company and subsidiary of the Petrichor Group.\n\nJointly financed by Westa.Solar and the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Development Office, the 500 Kilowatts peak (kWp is the peak power of a PV system) solar power plant provides Petrichor with, significantly, almost a quarter of its electricity needs in a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Westa.Solar.\n\nA solar PPA is an arrangement in which a third-party developer owns, operates, and maintains a PV system that is located on an industrial customer\u2019s property. The latter then buys the electric output from the solar system for a predetermined period and at a set price.\n\nPetrichor\u2019s massive 500kWp rooftop solar plant was installed by Westa.Solar in Kano, Nigeria.\n\nThe plant at Petrichor represents a perfect start to life for Westa.Solar, a company that has its sights set on the larger West African market. But its debut project was not without challenges, no thanks to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that continues to disrupt business operations.\n\n\u201cWe started the project at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, which wasn\u2019t the best time for procuring and shipping from anywhere in the world. Getting the equipment out of China, shipping, and then clearing them at the port was challenging. We also experienced tough delays at the port in Lagos,\u201d Westa.Solar\u2019s Country Manager in Nigeria, Kolawole Akinboye, told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nThings kicked into overdrive once the logistics component of the project was resolved and the equipment got to the site in Kano. By then, Westa.Solar could manage the construction process, enabled by its technical know-how ability and the partner it was working with.\n\nHelping businesses save cost and hedge energy prices\n\nMany businesses in Africa grapple with expensive electricity tariffs, frequent power outages, and load shedding. These issues limit production and increase operating and maintenance costs, thereby hindering growth. In Nigeria, enterprises rely on diesel generators to make up for the significant lapse in power supply.\n\nWesta.Solar\u2019s customised solutions for commercial and industrial businesses can help overcome some of the power-related challenges businesses face and in the process, provide direct savings and a hedge on energy prices for its clients.\n\nThe decreasing costs of solar systems, relative to either grid or diesel generators, have helped on-site solar microgrids become economically viable alternatives for commercial and industrial use.\n\nAccording to a 2017 Bloomberg New Energy Finance report, on-site solar power is cheaper than the electricity tariffs paid by C&I companies in seven of the 15 Sub-Saharan Africa markets studied. While electricity tariffs ranged from $0.028/kWh in Ethiopia to over $0.232/kWh in Senegal, a 250kW solar project cost between $0.10-0.14/kWh in the countries assessed.\n\nThe report predicts that the cost of on-site solar will decline further to about $0.05/kWh by 2030, which will only add to its appeal to commercial users.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the cheaper rates paid for solar, as an industrial company, coming into a long-term agreement with us allows you to predict what your energy cost would be over the next few years instead of having to face rising diesel prices at some point in the future. So yes, our plants serve as a hedge for energy costs for companies,\u201d Akinboye said.\n\nThe power deal with Westa.Solar is expected to see Petrichor reduce dependence on Nigeria\u2019s unstable national grid, save money \u2013 as much as \u20a6235 million over the next 10 years \u2013 on electricity bills, as well as minimise its carbon footprint by cutting its use of diesel.\n\nMore projects and expansion\n\nOn the back of its successful installation of the massive 500kWp plant in Nigeria, Westa.Solar plans to develop and implement a large pipeline of C&I solar projects across West Africa.\n\nThe company currently has no fewer than 30 companies that it has opened discussions with and is in advanced negotiations with at least seven of them. The country manager expects to announce more partnerships within the next few months.\n\n\u201cThis is the first of what we hope will be many solar power projects for C&I companies,\u201d Akinboye said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been getting calls from various people because of the Petrichor project, because of how successful it was. We have people that are already calling to say, \u2018Wait, can you look at my own facility? What can you do with us?\u2019 So it is a door-opener because it opens the door for more success.\u201d\n\nBut for now, Westa.Solar is focused on establishing itself in Nigeria, a market that is saturated but offers many opportunities for solar energy providers.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a huge unmet need, so we are focusing on conquering the market. Then in the next year or two, we start our expansion plans across West Africa.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfrica is rich in renewable resources but has an unmet demand for power. Many providers are currently moving to fill this gap and, in the process, help to diversify sources for generating electricity in Africa away from environmentally harmful fossil fuels.\n\nThrough its on-site grids, Westa.Solar expects to support the business of its clients while increasing the penetration of renewable energies across the region, which is yet to reach an inflection point.\n\nWesta.Solar is well-positioned to seize the opportunities that will come its way as the market in Africa expands, helped by Akinboye and his team\u2019s efforts to develop resilient microgrid projects across West Africa.\n\nOver the next five to ten years, the company aims to become the leading commercial and industrial renewable energy provider in the region. \u201cThat is our goal and that is where we are going. We\u2019re changing the narrative of commercial and industrial projects in Africa.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

This partnership will enable Somalians to enjoy both global and local cashless payment opportunities.\n\n\u201cFor Visa to come to Somalia, it means that we are on the right path of growth and progress. We will continue to make partnerships and bring convenient and innovative financial solutions to the people,\u201d said Mahat Mohamed, the CEO of IBS Bank.\n\nSomalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headways in reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nIn 2014, 47 years after the Automated Teller Machine was invented and 25 years after it was introduced in Nigeria and Kenya, Salaam Bank installed the first-ever ATM in Somalia in Mogadishu, the capital state. The ATM was to facilitate cash withdrawals (dollars) for only diaspora returnees and foreigners.\n\nThen a year later in June 2015, MasterCard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market in partnership with Premier Bank and issued 5,000 debit cards to be used by Premier Bank account holders, for domestic transactions.\n\n\u201cNew players are coming on board now. Two years ago, we had about five licensed banks, and today we are talking of 13 licensed commercial banks. That goes to demonstrate the appetite that is there.\u201d Mohamed added.\n\nAccording to Somalia\u2019s Central Bank Governor, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, the Visa partnership will connect Somalia to the global financial system and show the growing confidence in the country\u2019s banking and finance sector.\n\nThe presence of both Mastercard and Visa in Somalia will help position its market as arable land ready to receive seed and produce a bounty harvest.\n\n\u201cWe plan to install an electronic verification system that will ease biometric identification of customers opening bank accounts or transacting in Somalia. We believe this will help to build international trust and confidence in transactions originating from Somalia to other financial markets,\u201d Abdullahi said.\n\nWith more partnerships like this, popular conversations around Somalia can increasingly focus on innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "With cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, central banks across the world have been working towards developing digital currencies of their own.\n\nOnly two countries have officially launched digital fiat currency. The Bahamas became the first in 2020 followed by China, which began issuing its digital yuan about three months ago.\n\nOther countries where trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden, and South Korea. In Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Morocco, and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nNigeria and Ghana plan to pilot an official digital currency (e-naira and e-cedi respectively) later this year.\n\nWhat are CBDCs and how do they work?\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. Instead of paper money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government.\n\nCBDCs are similar to existing cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) in the sense that both are transferred electronically and blockchain-based. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology.\n\nHowever, one of the major differences is that while cryptocurrencies are designed to be decentralised (that is, not regulated), digital fiat currencies are deployed on centralised and private blockchain networks that are supervised by a central bank.\n\nThe digital fiat currency will be issued by the banking regulator to banks, which in turn will make it available to their customers. Every bank will be connected to the government-run blockchain system. Through the system, banks can aggregate transaction data that will be relayed to the central bank.\n\nWhether traditional bank accounts will work for a digital naira, for instance, is unknown. Users may be required to open special accounts similar to mobile money wallets currently being used for cryptocurrencies, which will enable seamless transactions.\n\nThere is also a difference in currency value and volatility. An e-naira, for instance, will be pegged to the paper naira at \u20a61 : \u20a61. Compared to the extreme volatility associated with cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are relatively stable. With their values pegged, a digital currency will fall and rise in line with general swings in the value of the national currency.\n\nOn paper, the transition to digital currency is an exciting prospect and should help reduce cash dominance but it won\u2019t be an easy one, especially in African countries. This is down to the same challenges that have slowed down the full adoption of digital technologies.\n\nIn Nigeria, for instance, smartphone penetration remains low, estimated at less than 20% of the population in 2019 compared to almost 60% in China, according to a Newzoo report.\n\nThe CBN and banks will have to consider feature phone users and make transacting with the digital naira accessible via USSD codes, which would also help advance financial inclusion goals.\n\nThere are also cybersecurity risks to be taken into account as well as internet penetration.\n\nMeanwhile, it remains to be seen if the launch of digital currencies will see regulators attempt to phase out cryptos entirely as China has done.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "How technology is helping African youths gain skills for employment and entrepreneurship",
          "text": "Tessi Obasa is a young marine/offshore engineer in Nigeria who does video editing and special effects for fun. His first experience of online learning came in 2016 with a Udemy course on Android programming using Android studio. Since then, he\u2019s taken several other courses to learn new skills.\n\nIt was immediately evident during our chat that he loved learning and picking up new skills.\n\nHe\u2019s had his fair share of challenges in his learning journey, having to battle unreliable Internet connection, power challenges, and inadequate tools to practice with. Once, while taking a course on VFX special effects, the camera he needed for a project cost \u20a6800,000 ($4,000), which he couldn\u2019t afford.\n\nFor context, Nigeria\u2019s minimum wage at the time (2016) was \u20a618,000 ($90). But he soldiered on, saying to himself, \u201cMy Tecno phone camera will have to suffice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObasa\u2019s story is not an isolated one, with youth across Africa unable to get the education they need in their country. They turn to edtech platforms to improve their chances of getting a job but are met with waves of problems.\n\nA sore thumb\n\nIt\u2019s an open secret that Africa is facing an unemployment crisis. A large number of Africa\u2019s youth have no jobs or are under-employed.\n\nStudents undergoing training in creative designs at Root Hub, Uyo\n\nWhile the phrase \u201cAfrica rising\u201d may have become hackneyed, one thing is not in doubt, Africa\u2019s young population is growing. According to data from the UN World Population Prospects (PDF), of the 2.4 billion new people that would be added to the current population by 2050, over half (1.3 billion) will come from Africa.\n\nAccording to analysts at the World Bank, this army of youths would join the working population and could potentially drive between 11% and 15% GDP growth on the continent. While these are optimistic outlooks, with a history of not taking advantage of opportunities, even the most optimistic person would have a hard time believing that this population growth is a good development.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2007, the working-age population in Africa grew at 2.6% annually, resulting in 96 million new members of the continent\u2019s workforce. However, only 63 million jobs were created during that period \u2014 a shortfall of 33 million jobs.\n\nAccording to data from the African Development Bank (AfDB) data, between 12 million and 15 million young people enter the job market annually. By 2035, Africa\u2019s working-age population is expected to grow by 450 million people.\n\nHowever, a combination of a private sector incapable of absorbing them and the inability of governments to create suitable environments for them to thrive could mean that most of these youths could either be unemployed or underemployed.\n\nFaced with the prospect of joblessness, young people are taking their destinies into their hands by gaining skills that would enable them to thrive in the workplace. For example, a report (PDF) by Google and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) shows that 31% of software developers in Africa were self-taught. This is a theme that plays out for most digital skills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow youths are gaining skills\n\nA training class\n\nWith no help forthcoming, African youths are taking their destinies into their hands. There are four major channels through which the skills gap in Africa is being closed:\n\nFormal education\n\nWhether through private schools, public schools, or vocational and technical training schools, formal education remains the best bet for most African youths to gain skills.\n\nHowever, even that comes with its challenges. One-third of youths between the ages of 12 and 14 are out of school, while almost 60% of youths between the ages of 15 and 17 are out of school.\n\nBringing gender into the equation paints a more depressing picture \u2014 9 million girls between the ages of 6 and 11 will never go to school, setting them up for a lifetime of exclusion; those who might be able to afford an education face the challenge of access.\n\nAccording to Quartz Africa, 10 of the most populous countries in Africa have 740 universities serving more than 600 million people. Compare that to Latin America, where 1,834 universities serve a population of 434 million people.\n\nThat means that without the ability to leave their countries for education, many African youths will not get a university education.\n\nEdtech\n\nEdtech platforms have seen increased patronage as smartphone penetration has increased across Africa. The coronavirus pandemic further accelerated its adoption as educational institutions across the continent were shut down. However, there are still two major problems with using edtech platforms: affordability and accessibility.\n\nAccording to Blessing Abeng, Director of Communications at Ingressive for Good, high data costs, unreliable Internet connection, inconsistent or non-existent power supply, and lack of tech tools for practice are some of the challenges African youths face in gaining tech skills.\n\nThis is a view shared by Obasa, who says, \u201cGadgets are expensive due to inflation. If you have the required gadgets, learning online will be much smoother and easier,\u201d he says.\n\nGodwin, another learner, adds, \u201cI once had to take a course on edX but could not afford the certificate even though I finished the course.\u201d A certificate on edX could range from $99 (\u20a640,687) to $149 (\u20a661,237).\n\nPrivate sector\n\nThe private sector is involved in providing African youths with skills, especially those required by the organisation. For example, with African tech talents being poached by companies from the West, some African startups are having to train talents in-house to have any chance of competing.\n\nHotels.ng, a hospitality startup in Nigeria, runs the HNG Internship, a three-month programme that aims to make newbie programmers professionals capable of getting a job. Cowrywise also has a design fund aimed at helping more women get into design.\n\nPeer/self-learning\n\nThis channel has been heavily influenced by technology. With many youths unable to afford to pay for an education, self-learning is often the only route left. Through YouTube videos or edtech platforms that provide some of their content for free, many African youths have acquired the skills that have enabled them to get jobs.\n\nA multi-pronged approach to upskilling Africa\u2019s youth\n\nIf you\u2019ve read up to this point, it is clear that the task of helping African youths gain the right skills is a huge one and cannot be achieved by any one person or group. Instead, it will require collaboration between all relevant stakeholders.\n\nRevamp the education sector\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the education system in Africa needs a massive overhaul. In 2021, only 14 universities from Africa made it into the top 1,000 universities globally, according to a ranking by The Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) \u2014 only 4 schools have been added since it released its 2016 rankings. This shows that Africa\u2019s educational sector is inadequate to serve the needs of a rapidly evolving world.\n\nFor significant progress to be made, an overhaul of the entire curriculum at all levels is required. Digital and technical skills that are valuable in the digital economy must be taught, beginning at the primary level if African youths are to compete globally.\n\nAfrican countries can take a cue from Kenya\u2019s DigiSchool Programme and Rwanda\u2019s mission to have more smart classrooms.\n\nExpand digital infrastructure\n\nFor technology to play any role in upskilling Africa\u2019s youths, the necessary infrastructure must be provided. This could be in the form of expanding broadband coverage and providing access to laptops or hubs where young people can access these devices.\n\nData connectivity is also a major requirement. Most African countries have some of the highest data costs globally and are out of reach for most young people.\n\nPublic-private partnerships\n\nWhile governments have a major role to play, the reality is that they cannot solve this problem alone, and so public-private partnerships should be utilised to provide African youths with skills.\n\nCollaboration between governments, multinational development banks, and the private sector will create room for innovative financial models which promote upskilling among Africa\u2019s youths.\n\n\u201cThe government can work with power providers to make sure that we have power for a specific time. That way, we can plan. They can also partner with edtech companies to subsidise the cost of these courses,\u201d Godwin remarks.\n\nPartnerships between the government and the private sector can provide coworking spaces, libraries or give power to people in rural areas often overlooked by traditional energy solutions.\n\nThe Edo State Government of Nigeria recently partnered with Decagon to build a tech park to train 15,000 software engineering talents by 2025. Likewise, the Lagos State Parks and Gardens Agency (LASPARK) has partnered with private organisations to convert recreational parks into makeshift innovation centres.\n\nAnother area for public-private partnerships is job placement. Learning a skill is no guarantee that you will get a job, so governments can partner with private organisations to help them with jobs or internships.\n\n\u201cPlacement helps, not just learning skills but channelling the skills into usefulness,\u201d Collins notes.\n\nUtilising technology to upskill Africa\u2019s youth\n\nA training class\n\n\u201cTech has a multiplier effect, and the lockdown made it very obvious that so much can be done with technology, especially online,\u201d says Ingressive for Good\u2019s Abeng.\n\nThis multiplier effect is why Africa needs to harness technology to provide skills for its youth. Without the need to be physically present, technology can provide technical and vocational skills to African youths.\n\nAbeng reveals that during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ingressive for Good partnered with Coursera to give scholarships to 5,000 people and help them learn skills to increase their earning power. The response was massive.\n\n\u201cWe expected only 2,500 to take it seriously, but 20,000+ people applied, over 5,000 were enrolled, and over 4,000 completed courses,\u201d she claims.\n\nThe organisation also has partnerships with DataCamp, Facebook, Jobberman, Geneza, Zuri, and HNG to train almost 100,000 people in digital skills. The same can be applied to virtually any skill.\n\nAfrica\u2019s population boom could become a curse if there are no plans to take advantage of it. However, it could drive progress on the continent if managed well and technology could play a massive role in that.\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "Kenya-based influencer marketing platform, AIfluence has announced its seed funding round of $1 million. The round was led by Dubai-based EQ2 Ventures, Antler East Africa, Oui Capital, ArabyAds, and an unnamed European family office.\n\nWith this funding, the startup plans to expand to the rest of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia by the end of 2021.\n\nFounded in 2019 by Nelson Aseka, George Issaias, Ankit Jindal, and Lamusia Anzaya, the startup is a product of Antler East Africa\u2019s drive to produce more African startups by drawing on the experience of professionals in various fields. It is also the company builder and VC firm\u2019s first startup to raise up to $1 million in funding.\n\nAIfluence uses artificial intelligence to match influencers to brands, run end-to-end influencer marketing campaigns, and bring transparency to the process of determining return on investment (ROI) for influencer marketing campaigns.\n\nTo properly serve its customers, the startup gains deep insights into a target market and identifies influencers that will suit those target markets.\n\nIn a statement, Melalite Ayenew, Antler East Africa\u2019s partner commented, \u201cWe are excited to see local founders with deep expertise in the African market take a global problem head-on, and in a short time demonstrate a tech solution that is fast attracting demand in Africa and beyond.\u201d\n\nPer TechCrunch, CEO, Aseka revealed in a statement, \u201cWe are on the cusp of a revelation. Globally the way marketing works is changing. We find ourselves at an intersection of advanced technology and the fastest-growing region in the world in terms of digital and social media penetration. It\u2019s an exciting place to be. Africa\u2019s rich tradition for storytelling is alive and kicking.\u201d\n\nAseka points out that they had faced challenges in finding a practical problem in the past but confirms that they have identified a partner with whom they would grow.\n\nCEO of EQ2 Ventures expressed delight with the startup. \u201cPeople are the new media in today\u2019s digital world, and AIfluence is uniquely positioned to turn this reality into tangible results for advertisers. We\u2019re looking forward to AIfluence\u2019s journey ahead.\u201d\n\nWith the increasing popularity of social media marketing, advertisers now understand that the key to connecting with their target audiences lies in using people they trust. This has led to a rise in micro-influencers and one that Africa\u2019s youths have quickly keyed into. By providing advertisers with good value for their money, AIfluence plans to unlock immense value on the continent.\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "title": "A deep dive into the activities of PoS agents in Nigeria",
          "text": "Emmanuel travelled to Osun State from Lagos State on a busy Friday afternoon and made a stop at Ibadan, the capital city of Oyo State, where it was raining heavily.\n\nWith the cost of transportation sometimes increasing with torrential downpours, his situation worsened because he travelled cashless. The irony is that despite the push for a cashless society by bank mobile apps, digital banks, and other industry players, Nigeria\u2019s economy remains predominantly cash-based.\n\nIn need of cash to continue his journey and with no ATM in sight, a point of sale (POS) kiosk \u2014 from which he promptly withdrew money \u2014 caught his attention.\n\nRecounting his experience on his WhatsApp status later in the day, he called POS agents \u201cSuper Agents who swoop in and save the day.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I were to hazard a guess, I\u2019d say six out of ten everyday Nigerians have been in Emmanuel\u2019s shoes.\n\nBut conjecture aside, how did Nigeria\u2019s Emmanuels handle similar situations before 2017 when commercial banks keyed into what first entrants into the Nigerian fintech space \u2014 like Paga \u2014 were doing with agent banking?\n\nI vividly remember being stranded after work hours while in the university. Yes, there were ATMs, but as is still common today, they were either empty or full with \u201cOut of Service\u201d boldly written on their screens.\n\nPoS: A need\n\nThere is at least one kiosk on many Nigerian streets in urban and rural areas, with most of them having variations of \u201cPoS is Available\u201d written on them. But, whatever the terminology, the message is the same \u2014 you can withdraw and send money here.\n\nAnd expectedly, understanding the present-day reality demands that real-time payments and banking services be available on request, and wherever required, banks and other financial institutions have waded in.\n\nAgent banking \u2014 owning a PoS (Point of Sale) outlet \u2014 is probably one of the most lucrative businesses in Nigeria currently. While some people focus on it as a primary source of income \u2014 having several outlets \u2014 it is an additional source of income for others.\n\nThese outlets provide banking services, including cash deposits and withdrawals, fund transfers, utility bill payments, airtime recharge, and other related services.\n\nApart from shops specifically set up to provide these services, other goods and service providers play the role of banking agents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd they have become more popular with the increase in the number of fintechs \u2014 digital banks and mobile money operators \u2014 in the country.\n\nAlthough the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) data shows that there are about 307,000 PoS machines in Nigeria as of March 2021, only 167,000 were active. While agent banking promotes financial inclusion, it might not usher the nation into a cashless economy.\n\nIronically, a random survey of several PoS points shows that cash withdrawals make up 90% of their daily transactions.\n\nImpressive data to show\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) introduced the PoS system and agent banking in 2013 to achieve financial inclusion and develop a cashless economy.\n\nApart from commercial banks with agent banking arms \u2014 like FirstMonie by First Bank Nigeria and Access CLOSA by Access Bank \u2014 fintechs like Paga, Interswitch, Quickteller, TeamApt, OPay, and Kuda Bank also play in the field.\n\nA recent stat \u2014 exclusive to industry players \u2014 from the Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities (SANEF), a CBN initiative to oversee agency banking in Nigeria and promote financial inclusion, reportedly depicts an impressive year for the sector. Besides, data released showed an 859% surge in the volume of PoS transactions during the lockdown between March and April 2020.\n\nData from Nairametrics for Statista shows that the number of PoS payments increased significantly from 34 million in 2015 to 438.6 million in 2019. On the other hand, in 2020, NIBSS recorded that Nigerian merchants and mobile money operators (MMOs) processed over 655 million PoS transactions valued at \u20a64.7 trillion ($13 billion), a 50% increase from 2019.\n\nAgency banking contributes significantly to banks\u2019 revenue growth driven by charges from electronic banking services.\n\nWhat agents and users think\n\nTypically, a PoS terminal helps customers pay for goods and services in person or online, with receipts printed immediately. As we\u2019ve come to see, they are found in stores and used for debit card purchases.\n\nPer users\n\nFor many Nigerians like Emmanuel, PoS merchants are lifesavers for apparent reasons.\n\nOlive, a young Nigerian living in Benin City, who often patronises PoS agents and hasn\u2019t visited the bank in the past two to five months, says they are closer to the house than banks and can be found everywhere. Micheal, a Lagos State resident, corroborates this, stating that they are the only option available in Ikorodu, where he resides.\n\nOf the 33 respondents who took part in a survey covering different states in Nigeria, 21 prefer to use banks.\n\nIronically, 23 people often or always use a PoS agent, while 19 of them haven\u2019t visited their bank in the last two to five months.\n\nThis leaves one wondering what could be influencing the choice of PoS agents when banks clearly have the higher preference. 12 respondents prioritise the convenience of agent banking over visiting their banks or ATMs, which often have long queues, 20 say that the absence of nearby banks leaves them no choice.\n\nUnderstandably, banks, fintechs, and MMOs have agent banking as integral parts of their service offerings.\n\nPer operators\n\nMr Olaniyi, a PoS terminal operator, residing in Ile-Ife, Osun State, explains to Techpoint Africa how he got into the business.\n\n\u201cI started this business in April 2018. Before then, what I did was help people to subscribe to their cable TVs, but Kudi, the company I was dealing with then, approached me and asked if I\u2019d be interested in having a PoS machine. It was sold for \u20a675,000 (~$207)*, which I couldn\u2019t afford. But I was told that I could pay in instalments, to which I agreed.\u201d\n\nHe narrates how he took a loan from a microfinance bank to add to what he had and how, within two months of running the business, he could repay the loan.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that paint a picture of profitability? Olaniyi started the business at what turned out to be a perfect time, as he had a monopoly, being the only agent in the area. Consequently, he could charge as high as \u20a6200 on every \u20a65,000 withdrawn.\n\nWith seven outlets to his name across the town, he admits it is a profitable business. On a good day, one of his outlets \u2014 which has three other PoS shops close by \u2014 can do up to 22 transactions, dispensing up to \u20a6400,000 (~$971).\n\nHow agents charge for their services\n\nFrom all indications, customers do not mind paying to use the PoS service. And while this gives room for exploitative fees, a comparison of competitive markets across Lagos, Ogun, Osun, and Edo states reveals a uniform transfer fee and commission per withdrawal \u2014 \u20a6100 increments on every \u20a65,000.\n\n\u20a6100 to \u20a65,000 \u2014 \u20a6100\n\n\u20a65,001 to \u20a610,000 \u2014 \u20a6200\n\n\u20a610,001 to \u20a615,000 \u2014 \u20a6300\n\nHowever, with higher amounts of money, there appears to be room for negotiation even for the inexperienced haggler; I successfully negotiated for a \u20a650 deduction on a withdrawal of \u20a615,000.\n\nWith more customers like me, the agents won\u2019t make as much money as they currently do, and this isn\u2019t because of my negotiation abilities. The charges system only benefits the agents when customers request small amounts of money.\n\nSteps to running a PoS business in Nigeria\n\nSecure a location\n\nPositioning an outlet in a noticeable location with limited banks and a large population \u2014 students\u2019 residences, for instance \u2014 is key to the success of a PoS business. It is also important for the proprietor to make arrangements for security because of the cash handling involved.\n\nAcquire a PoS terminal\n\nSometimes, agents sort out how to get equipment before searching for a location. There are currently three ways to get a PoS machine or terminal in Nigeria: MMOs, banks, and online marketplaces. It should, however, be noted that terminals purchased from online marketplaces still need the services of banks and MMOs to be operational.\n\nInterestingly, their processes are similar.\n\nMMOs\n\nThe processes involved with MMOs are pretty straightforward.\n\nApply online to get the machine at a fee : Application is made on the chosen bank\u2019s mobile app, and the customer is expected to meet specific KYC requirements \u2014 including providing their BVN, a valid means of identification, a utility bill, and a photo \u2014 to register as an agent and request for a device.\n\n: Application is made on the chosen bank\u2019s mobile app, and the customer is expected to meet specific KYC requirements \u2014 including providing their BVN, a valid means of identification, a utility bill, and a photo \u2014 to register as an agent and request for a device. Decide the type of PoS you want: Depending on the provider\u2019s policy and functions of a machine, it can cost between \u20a62,000 and \u20a635,000 when gotten from a bank or MMO. But it costs more on online marketplaces.\n\nBanks\n\nCommercial banks exercise extra care before giving out a PoS device \u2014 at no cost \u2014 because the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is particular about the conditions people must meet to become agents.\n\nOne of such requirements is that the person applying must have a current account being used to run a profitable business, and that holds a minimum of \u20a650,000 ($121). If all requirements are met, the bank gives the applicant a terminal; however, the user will need a bank app to monitor transactions.\n\nBecause Olawale \u2014 an Abeokuta-based PoS agent \u2014 could not meet these requirements, he borrowed a friend\u2019s terminal in 2019 to start the business until he got his.\n\nUltimately, people choose where to get a terminal based on the perceived ease each option provides.\n\nTypes of PoS terminals\n\nCustomers typically use their debit cards on PoS machines for services like withdrawals, transfers, utility bill payments, etc. Before inserting a debit card into a machine and asking a customer to enter their four-digit PIN, an agent enters information about the transaction on the terminal.\n\nIf the terminal completes the transaction \u2014 using mobile data \u2014 it immediately prints a confirmation receipt; it also prints out a \u2018Transaction Declined\u2019 receipt when unable to complete the transaction.\n\nA cardless transaction can also be done without debit cards via direct transfers to the designated account.\n\nThere are three types of PoS machines with varying physical features and functions.\n\nMini PoS device: This PoS machine looks like a calculator, with a few function buttons and a narrow display screen. It can perform basic PoS functions, but it cannot work without being connected to an Internet-enabled smartphone via Bluetooth. It does not have a printer. After inserting a debit card, transaction details are entered through a mobile PoS (mPoS) app, on which the transaction is also activated. However, the user enters their four-digit PIN on the machine.\n\nTraditional PoS machine: This is the most common type as they were the first to be introduced to the Nigerian market. More function keys and a wider square display screen allow transaction entry and activation as long as it is connected to the Internet. It automatically prints out a receipt at the end of every transaction.\n\nAndroid PoS: This type is designed to look and act like a 7-inch smartphone. The device can perform all traditional PoS machine functions, show notifications, allow app installation, and scan barcodes, among others. It processes transactions faster because it runs on a robust OS, can connect to WiFi, and has 4G network capability.\n\nWhat does a PoS terminal cost\n\nWhile some companies receive outright payments \u2014 which are usually higher \u2014 from people for the machines, others collect a caution fee refundable upon returning the machine.\n\nFor context, on OPay, PoS machines cost \u20a62,000, \u20a610,000, and \u20a620,000 for mini, traditional, and Android terminals. For Kudi, on the other hand, the conventional PoS machine cost \u20a620,000.\n\nNote that all these payments are refundable.\n\nBanks, MMOs, agents: How they make a profit\n\nNow, here\u2019s where it gets controversial. I stumbled on a conversation about the profitability of the PoS business in Nigeria, with many contributors saying that it is a function of how soon an agent can open other outlets.\n\nWhile Olaniyi and Olawale\u2019s stories support this claim, they are quick to state that running such a business model successfully requires a certain volume of transactions.\n\nHowever, a large volume doesn\u2019t always convert to more profit.\n\nOlawale explains that an agent would typically charge \u20a6400 to withdraw \u20a620,000; but if the request came in smaller units, like \u20a62,000, for instance, the charges would add up to \u20a61,000 \u2014 \u20a6100 for each withdrawal.\n\nBack to the commissions, from which banks, MMOs, and agents make their profits.\n\nFor context, Olawale explains that the bank takes 0.75% of his charges per transaction. So, on a \u20a6100 charge, he keeps \u20a699.25 while the bank takes \u20a60.75.\n\nBut it is not that straightforward. Recall CBN\u2019s directive to deduct \u20a650 stamp duty on every PoS transaction and a follow-up order that agents are to bear the cost? Well, Olawale mentions that the stamp duty eats further into his profits.\n\nIn some stores, this charge is only excused for purchases below \u20a610,000 made with a card.\n\nOn the other hand, Olaniyi boasts of escaping the stamp duty charge with MMOs. He shares his charges with them in a 70:30 ratio; for every \u20a6100, he keeps \u20a670.\n\nComparing these two scenarios, Olaniyi would only gain more than Olawale on lower commissions. For a \u20a6500 commission, for instance, Olawale gains \u20a6446.25 while Olaniyi\u2019s gain is \u20a6350.\n\nIf anything, Olawale\u2019s earlier comment on how volume doesn\u2019t guarantee gains speaks more to Olaniyi\u2019s condition.\n\nApart from these charges, agents also spend money on Internet data and printing paper for receipts.\n\nThe Nigeria effect\n\nGodwin Emefiele, CBN Governor\n\nOn the associated risks, Olaniyi says using a bank PoS can be restrictive because they monitor how many transactions are generated from your account daily\u2014adding that doing below capacity could result in sanctions or retrieval of the PoS machine.\n\nOn the other hand, Olawale expresses his reservations about MMOs giving out PoS machines to anybody who can afford them without the due diligence noticed with banks.\n\nThey both have common concerns, with unstable Internet connections and network issues \u2014 either from NIBSS or banks \u2014 disrupting withdrawals and transfers, resulting in many disgruntled customers.\n\nWhile they have to incur costs of security and other risks due to location, these agents recommend that banks consider the charges on the withdrawal of large amounts because they complement their services.\n\nWhile their decision to stick with either banks or MMOs is made considering the less predatory alternative in mind, their opinions might not be representative of the thousands of agents across the country. But whatever the position of other agents, maintaining a reasonable profit margin despite these charges is key to succeeding in the agent banking business.\n\n* \u2013 Dollar equivalent of the year under consideration\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster",
          "summary": "Agent banking \u2014 owning a PoS (Point of Sale) outlet \u2014 is probably one of the most lucrative businesses in Nigeria currently.\nApart from shops specifically set up to provide these services, other goods and service providers play the role of banking agents.\nThis leaves one wondering what could be influencing the choice of PoS agents when banks clearly have the higher preference.\nThere are currently three ways to get a PoS machine or terminal in Nigeria: MMOs, banks, and online marketplaces.\nBanks, MMOs, agents: How they make a profitNow, here\u2019s where it gets controversial.",

A total of 28 senators were absent during the voting process.\n\nThe decision to vote individually was followed by a Point of Order raised by the Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe \u2013 shortly after the lawmakers returned from an executive session, which was called after a rowdy session.\n\nThe floor had became rowdy after lawmakers disagreed on the amendment of Section 52(3) of the bill that deals with electronic transmission of results during elections.\n\nIt states \u201cThe Commission may transmit results of elections by electronic means where and when practicable.\u201d\n\nBut the Senate Deputy Whip, Sabi Abdullahi, had moved that the section be amended to read:\n\n\u201cThe commission may consider electronic transmission provided the national network coverage is adjudged to be adequate and secure by the Nigerian Communications Commission and approved by the National Assembly,\u201d he proposed.\n\nLoud arguments and chaos followed when lawmakers who disagreed with the provision began to complain loudly.

          "text": "The Nnamdi Azikiwe International airport Abuja was agog Thursday as the Cross River State commercial airliner, Cally Air, made its maiden landing.\n\nGovernor of Cross River State, Sir Ben Ayade, who was at the tarmac for the historic touchdown of the aircraft expressed excitement over the flight which earlier left the Murtala Mohammed International airport Lagos for Abuja.\n\nAyade who boarded the plane upon landing, for inspection, said he was happy that the CallY Air dream which started in 2016 was a reality without any borrowing by the government, adding that intellectual money made procurement of the aircrafts possible.\n\nThe governor while congratulating the people of Cross River state for the feat said: \u201cThis is the beginning of Cross River state\u2019s emancipation and complete decoupling from dependence on the federal government. My strong conviction is that Cally Air is the beginning of the privatization process of actually creating a private sector that never existed before. It is also the beginning of creating an alternative economy that never existed in Cross River state\u201d.\n\nAyade further said that the Cally Air reality was a strong message that sub-nationals could actually become fully independent, observing that the Airliner was going to increase passenger traffic to Cross River state and the Obudu international airport which he disclosed would be completed by December, 2021.\n\n\u201cLet the people know today that anything your mind conceives can be achieved. Cally Air will also be flying Obudu and Obudu cattle ranch will have its huge traffic.\u201d\n\nAccording to the governor, Cally Air involvement in the Nigeria\u2019s aviation industry would increase the industry standards for other aviators to follow while ensuring safety and punctuality remained paramount.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHis words: \u201cEven if I, as the governor, is late for boarding by one minute, the planes have to shut their doors and leave me on the ground. It is a commitment that I give that no one single Cross Riverian will have the right to keep this aircraft on the ground for one second. Leave as soon as its due.

          "title": "Opinion: Some prophets see nothing \u2013 By FEMI ADESINA",
          "text": "There he goes again. Troublemaker. He wants to abuse our prophets, the vessels of God Almighty.\n\nNot so. Let me state from the beginning that I believe in prophecies and prophets. Good, sincere, genuine ones. \u201cBelieve in the Lord your God, so shall you be established. Believe His prophets, so shall you prosper,\u201d says the Good Book in 2 Chronicles 20:20.\n\nBut when prophets play to the gallery, claim God has said, when God has said nothing, then they expose themselves to ridicule. From such, run away. Show clean pairs of heels.\n\nOn Sunday July 11, the final match of Euro 2020 was played between England and Italy at Wembley Stadium in London. The English team had a lot to play for. Since they last won the World Cup in 1966, also on home soil, they had won nothing again. Not even 5-a-Side Felele competition.\n\nGetting to the final of Euro 2020 was thus big deal. Football was coming home, lovers of English soccer, home of the beautiful game, kept chanting. For those who supported Italy, they chanted that football was going Rome. Who would carry the day? Home or Rome?\n\nThere is this video that has been making the rounds on social media. Whether genuine or apocryphal, I do not know. But we see a Pastor (or is it Prophet) declaring magisterially on the pulpit that England was going to win the trophy that night. To the applause of his fawning congregation, he repeated the so-called prophecy many times. Lori iro.\n\nSunday evening came, England scored in the very second minute of the game. They were looking good for the first major soccer diadem since 1966. Till about the 67th minute, when Italy drew blood. Heartbreak.\n\nThe match ended a goal apiece in regulation time. An extra 30 minutes produced no further goals. Penalty shootout ensued. Italy scored three of its five kicks, England could tuck in only two. Sadly, the three spot kicks were missed by Black English footballers, who had done so much for the team. Miserable. Dolorous.\n\nWhere did it leave our prophet? Blind as a bat. Why did he speak supposedly in the name of the Lord, when he saw nothing, and heard nothing? He just exposed an elevated calling to odium and opprobrium.\n\nThe Good Book tells us about the five-fold ministries. Apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. Prophets rank high in the hierarchy. They hear from God, and tell the people. And when it is from God, He watches over His own word to perform it. Only He can change it, no man.\n\nAlso last Sunday, a newspaper published on the front page a so-called prophecy that Nigeria would disintegrate, and there\u2019s nothing anybody could do about it. The foretelling was credited to Primate Elijah Ayodele of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, in Lagos.\n\nThe Prophet gave the date and time of Nigeria\u2019s unraveling as between 2035 and 2040. A person who wants to give you a fib would say his witness is in Heaven. How many people living now would still be alive in 2035 or 2040? Are we even sure of tomorrow, next week, next month, or next year, except by the mercies of God?\n\nAnd then, why is it always negative, negative, negative prophecies all the time? We are admonished not to despise prophesying (1 Thessalonians 5:20) but then, \u201cby a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was preserved.\u201d (Hosea 12:13). Prophecies are for our comfort, edification, preservation, not something to frighten the living daylights out of us, and have us on tenterhooks all the days of our life. When you see someone indulging in negatives, run far. To thy tents oh Israel.\n\nI know Primate Ayodele. I have been a special guest in his church when I was Managing Director/Editor-in-Chief of The Sun Newspapers. He does great things in terms of welfare for his flock. He empowers them wish cash and materials they can use to set up themselves gainfully. I was impressed with that. But the prophetic aspect?\n\nLet\u2019s look at all these facts: in the build up to 2015 presidential elections, Primate Ayodele said Goodluck Jonathan would win. The man lost. He said the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) would take Kaduna by a narrow margin. Nasir el-Rufai of the All Progressives Congress (APC) won. Again, he said Yobe, Gombe, Benue, Delta, and Akwa Ibom States would be won by PDP. The APC won three of those States. Who hit the crossbar? You know the answer.\n\nPDP will shock APC in Lagos. It didn\u2019t happen. Boko Haram would bomb South West. Mercifully, it didn\u2019t happen. APC would break, Buhari won\u2019t do second term. You know the truth. And in 2017, when the President was on medical vacation abroad for many months, he said the seat was vacant, and the man would never return. You now know who didn\u2019t speak the truth, who didn\u2019t hear from God.\n\nThe Book, that Good Book, tells us how we know a false prophet from a genuine one. The false says something, and it does not come to pass. And he continues to strut and fret his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more. His tales are full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\n\nProphet Jonah was told to speak against Nineveh, that the city would be sacked, overthrown, because of their evil acts. Jonah fled to Tarshish instead, because he didn\u2019t want to deliver a doomsday message. He ended in the belly of a whale, which vomited him at the shores of Nineveh. He made his pronouncements, and the people took warning. They repented in ashes and sackcloth, and God had mercy. He spared the city.\n\nWhat did Jonah do next? He asked God to kill him, because he knew the gravity of failed prophecies. But our modern day prophets? They hit the crossbar severally, yet no compunction. No remorse.

          "text": "There he goes again. Troublemaker. He wants to abuse our prophets, the vessels of God Almighty.\n\nNot so. Let me state from the beginning that I believe in prophecies and prophets. Good, sincere, genuine ones. \u201cBelieve in the Lord your God, so shall you be established. Believe His prophets, so shall you prosper,\u201d says the Good Book in 2 Chronicles 20:20.\n\nBut when prophets play to the gallery, claim God has said, when God has said nothing, then they expose themselves to ridicule. From such, run away. Show clean pairs of heels.\n\nOn Sunday July 11, the final match of Euro 2020 was played between England and Italy at Wembley Stadium in London. The English team had a lot to play for. Since they last won the World Cup in 1966, also on home soil, they had won nothing again. Not even 5-a-Side Felele competition.\n\nGetting to the final of Euro 2020 was thus big deal. Football was coming home, lovers of English soccer, home of the beautiful game, kept chanting. For those who supported Italy, they chanted that football was going Rome. Who would carry the day? Home or Rome?\n\nThere is this video that has been making the rounds on social media. Whether genuine or apocryphal, I do not know. But we see a Pastor (or is it Prophet) declaring magisterially on the pulpit that England was going to win the trophy that night. To the applause of his fawning congregation, he repeated the so-called prophecy many times. Lori iro.\n\nSunday evening came, England scored in the very second minute of the game. They were looking good for the first major soccer diadem since 1966. Till about the 67th minute, when Italy drew blood. Heartbreak.\n\nThe match ended a goal apiece in regulation time. An extra 30 minutes produced no further goals. Penalty shootout ensued. Italy scored three of its five kicks, England could tuck in only two. Sadly, the three spot kicks were missed by Black English footballers, who had done so much for the team. Miserable. Dolorous.\n\nWhere did it leave our prophet? Blind as a bat. Why did he speak supposedly in the name of the Lord, when he saw nothing, and heard nothing? He just exposed an elevated calling to odium and opprobrium.\n\nThe Good Book tells us about the five-fold ministries. Apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. Prophets rank high in the hierarchy. They hear from God, and tell the people. And when it is from God, He watches over His own word to perform it. Only He can change it, no man.\n\nAlso last Sunday, a newspaper published on the front page a so-called prophecy that Nigeria would disintegrate, and there\u2019s nothing anybody could do about it. The foretelling was credited to Primate Elijah Ayodele of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, in Lagos.\n\nThe Prophet gave the date and time of Nigeria\u2019s unraveling as between 2035 and 2040. A person who wants to give you a fib would say his witness is in Heaven. How many people living now would still be alive in 2035 or 2040? Are we even sure of tomorrow, next week, next month, or next year, except by the mercies of God?\n\nAnd then, why is it always negative, negative, negative prophecies all the time? We are admonished not to despise prophesying (1 Thessalonians 5:20) but then, \u201cby a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was preserved.\u201d (Hosea 12:13). Prophecies are for our comfort, edification, preservation, not something to frighten the living daylights out of us, and have us on tenterhooks all the days of our life. When you see someone indulging in negatives, run far. To thy tents oh Israel.\n\nI know Primate Ayodele. I have been a special guest in his church when I was Managing Director/Editor-in-Chief of The Sun Newspapers. He does great things in terms of welfare for his flock. He empowers them wish cash and materials they can use to set up themselves gainfully. I was impressed with that. But the prophetic aspect?\n\nLet\u2019s look at all these facts: in the build up to 2015 presidential elections, Primate Ayodele said Goodluck Jonathan would win. The man lost. He said the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) would take Kaduna by a narrow margin. Nasir el-Rufai of the All Progressives Congress (APC) won. Again, he said Yobe, Gombe, Benue, Delta, and Akwa Ibom States would be won by PDP. The APC won three of those States. Who hit the crossbar? You know the answer.\n\nPDP will shock APC in Lagos. It didn\u2019t happen. Boko Haram would bomb South West. Mercifully, it didn\u2019t happen. APC would break, Buhari won\u2019t do second term. You know the truth. And in 2017, when the President was on medical vacation abroad for many months, he said the seat was vacant, and the man would never return. You now know who didn\u2019t speak the truth, who didn\u2019t hear from God.\n\nThe Book, that Good Book, tells us how we know a false prophet from a genuine one. The false says something, and it does not come to pass. And he continues to strut and fret his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more. His tales are full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\n\nProphet Jonah was told to speak against Nineveh, that the city would be sacked, overthrown, because of their evil acts. Jonah fled to Tarshish instead, because he didn\u2019t want to deliver a doomsday message. He ended in the belly of a whale, which vomited him at the shores of Nineveh. He made his pronouncements, and the people took warning. They repented in ashes and sackcloth, and God had mercy. He spared the city.\n\nWhat did Jonah do next? He asked God to kill him, because he knew the gravity of failed prophecies. But our modern day prophets? They hit the crossbar severally, yet no compunction. No remorse. And worse still, some people continue to believe them.\n\nNigeria will survive, as long as people continue to call on the living God. Nineveh prayed, and God changed His mind about destroying the city. President Buhari has said those of them who were on the frontlines for 30 months during the Civil War would never fold their hands, and see Nigeria break. Rather than allow it, they would speak to the troublemakers \u201cin the language they understand.\u201d Former President Olusegun Obasanjo also says those advocating the country\u2019s break-up are \u201cidiotic.\u201d Yes, we will always have people like Buhari and Obasanjo around. Nigeria will survive.\n\nWhat am I saying? Don\u2019t nations break? Where is the old Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and many others? Yes, those countries broke into splinters, but as for Nigeria, it would survive. Beyond 2035 and 2040, whether we are still here or not. And as long as patriots continue to lead the country.\n\nBut for Primate Ayodele, let him focus on touching lives through preaching the gospel, and empowering of many people. It has great gains now and in eternity.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

The Constitution further provides that INEC operations shall not be subject to the direction of anybody or authority.\n\n\u201cUnquestionably, the mode of election and transmission are critical parts of the conduct, supervision, undertaking, and organization of elections in Nigeria. Of course, the National Assembly has the power to flesh out the legal framework, but that has to be consistent with the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThese constitutional powers have been solely and exclusively prescribed by the Constitution to INEC, and cannot be shared with the NCC, or any other Authority, and certainly not a body unknown to the Constitution. The Senate decision to subject INECs constitutional power to conduct elections to NCC is consequently patently VOID, unconstitutional, and unlawful.\n\n\u201cWe had earlier counseled that the mode of conducting elections and in particular the transmission of votes be left with INEC who would monitor developments and determine at every election the type of technology to be deployed to ensure free, fair, and credible elections. INEC also has constitutional power backed by the Electoral Act to make rules and guidelines to ensure that every vote is counted and that every vote counts.\n\nHon Tambuwal added that if INEC determines that in any part of the country, electronic transmission is not possible, it would by regulations determine the appropriate thing to do.\n\n\u201cThe decision of the House of Representatives to call on INEC to address the House and nation on its readiness by 2023 to deploy electronic transmission technology for our elections, seems to be a wise one, I, therefore, commend the Leadership and Hon Members of the House for this decision and further admonish them to remain on the path of patriotism and deepening of our democracy by engendering and strengthening the free and fair electoral process\n\n\u201cIn any case, I still believe that the best option is to leave this matter in the hands of INEC.\n\n\u201cWe admonish INEC to be solely guided by the National interest and the desire of all Nigerians for a credible, free and fair elections in using its constitutional powers and in the deployment of error-free technology.\u201d",

It states \u201d The Commission may transmit results of elections by electronic means where and when practicable.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Deputy Whip, Sabi Abdullahi had moved to amend the section to read, \u201cThe commission may consider electronic transmission provided the national network coverage is adjudged to be adequate and secure by the Nigerian Communications Commission and approved by the National Assembly,\u201d he proposed.\n\nHis opinion however stirred grumbling in the chamber but the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, moved that they vote on the amendment.\n\nWhen put to vote, the resounding \u201cnays\u201d were louder than the \u201cayes\u201d but Mr Lawan ruled in favour of the amendment.\n\nAkwa Ibom senator, Bassey Akpan, moved that the clause be re-amended to the initial section as contained in the bill.\n\nAnother vote was done and Mr Lawan again ruled in favour of Mr Abdullahi\u2019s amendment.\n\nLoud arguments and chaos followed as unsatisfied lawmakers were seen leaving their seats and shouting \u2013 making it unable for either the chief whip or Senate President to control the lawmakers.\n\nWhile the yelling lasted for more than 15 minutes Mr Lawan called for an executive session.\n\nThe issue of electronic transmission of election results has been a major recommendation from Nigerians and the lawmakers at some point, attempted to omit that section from the legislation.\n\nShortly after the executive session, Senators voted on the mode of transmission of results by the Independent National Electoral Commission on election day.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of how the lawmakers voted::\n\nA COMPILATION OF SENATORS VOTE FOR OR AGAINST ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF ELECTION RESULTS (A few names still missing)\n\nRobert Ajayi Boroffice YES\n\nSurajudeen Basiru NO\n\nAdenugba Fadahunsi YES\n\nClifford Ordia YES\n\nMatthew Urhoghide YES\n\nFrancis Alimikhena NO\n\nKola Balogun YES\n\nEzekiel Ayuba NO\n\nAbubakar Kyari NO\n\nGyang Istifanus YES\n\nSenator Gyagung Ladi NO\n\nGeorge Sekibo YES\n\nAli Ndume NO\n\nOpeyemi Bamidele NO\n\nBiodun Olujimi YES\n\nMpigi Barinada YES\n\nBetty Apiafi YES\n\nGobir Abdullahi NO\n\nAbdullahi Danbaba NO\n\nPhilip Aduda YES\n\nChukwuka Utazi YES\n\nMohammed Goje NO\n\nDanbaba YES\n\nYusuf Yusuf NO\n\nIsa Shuaibu Lau NO\n\nMohammed Goje NO\n\nBomai Ibrahim Mohammed NO\n\nFrancis Onyewuchi YES\n\nYau Sahabi NO\n\nUba Sani NO\n\nDanjuma La\u2019ah YES\n\nKabiru Gaya NO\n\nIshaku Elisha Abo NO\n\nBaba Kaita NO\n\nAdamu Aliero NO\n\nYahaya Abdullahi NO\n\nYakubu Oseni NO\n\nIsa Jibrin NO\n\nSmart Adeyemi NO\n\nIbrahim Oloriegbe NO\n\nOluremi Tinubu NO\n\nSolomon Adeola NO\n\nTanko Al-Makura NO\n\nGodiya Akwashiki NO\n\nAbdullahi Adamu NO\n\nMusa Mohammed Sani NO\n\nAliyu Sabi Abdullahi NO\n\nBima Enagi NO\n\nPatrick Akinyelure YES\n\nFINAL VOTE FIGURES ON ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION\n\nAYES: 28\n\nNAYS: 52\n\nABSENT: 28\n\nABSTAIN: 0\n\nTOTAL VOTES: 80\n\nTOTAL NO.

          "text": "Uncertainty continues to shroud the report of the National Assembly\u2019s conference committee on the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), with the House of Representatives stepping down the report.\n\nThe situation is even more complicated with lawmakers set to go on their annual recess.\n\nThe report of the parliament\u2019s conference was stepped down during Thursday\u2019s plenary session after lawmakers emerged from an executive session that lasted over an hour.\n\nEarlier, the House was thrown into a boisterous session before the commencement of plenary. At the centre of the confusion was the conference report of the PIB.\n\nThe report, which was on the Order paper, was stepped down upon resumption by the Chairman of the ad hoc committee on PIB, Mohammed Monguno.\n\nThe Host Communities Development Fund remains the most controversial issue. On July 1, while passing the PIB, the House of Representatives had pegged contributions to the host communities development trust fund at five per cent, and the Senate had pegged it\u2019s at five per cent.\n\nAt the time, Mr Monguno had promised that the House of Representatives committee will insist on the five per cent as passed by the lower chamber. However, the conference committee adopted the Senate\u2019s version of three per cent.\n\nThe Senate on Thursday also adopted the report of the conference committee despite protests from some South-south lawmakers.\n\nWhile they had protested the percentage allotted to the host communities, Senate President Ahmad Lawan put the report to a voice vote and it passed despite strong \u201cnays.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
