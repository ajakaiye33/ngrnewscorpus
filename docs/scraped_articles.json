          "text": "Renowned Nigerian author, Chimamanda Adichie, has received an honorary doctorate degree from the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium.\n\nOne of the world\u2019s oldest Catholic universities, the Catholic University of Louvain, conferred the honorary degree to Adichie at their main campus on Friday.\n\nThis was announced in a statement made available to The PUNCH on Saturday.\n\nAccording to the Rector of the University, Vincent Blondel, Adichie \u201cdevelops a discourse on gender equality rooted in singular experience and is universal in scope.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe focuses on the experience of differences and makes us feel the fragility of what we sometimes hold to be true without having questioned it,\u201d he added.\n\nDescribing Adichie as one of her generation\u2019s most gifted writers, Professor of English Literature at the UCL, Daria Tunica added that the writer was very frank in her views and in her writings.\n\n\u201cAdiche\u2019s work is filled with love and warmth, so it shows us our good sides, but also confronts us with our darker sides\u201d, she added.\n\nThis latest achievement is Adichie\u2019s 16th honorary degree award, as she has also received the same from some of the world\u2019s notable universities, including Yale University, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Edinburgh, Duke University, Georgetown University, and Johns Hopkins University.\n\nIn her acceptance speech, Adichie appreciated the school and the management for the award.\n\nSpeaking on the theme of the ceremony, \u201cThe Fragility of Truth\u201d she said, \u201cThere is mounting disinformation all over the world with severe consequences for all of us, and today it is easy to dress up a lie so nicely that it starts to take on the glow of the truth. It is time for us to seek truth and to insist on measures that make it possible for truth to prevail\u201d.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that, in recent times, Adichie has decried the attitude of Catholic priests, pertaining to her parents\u2019 funeral.\n\nIn an essay last year, the \u201cPurple Hibiscus\u201d writer gave an insight as to why she separated herself from Catholicism.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We should be proud of the talents we have produced at Delta State University Abraka and use them in solving some of our problems in Abraka, Delta State, and Nigeria at large.\n\n\u201cAs Africans, we should learn to consume what we cultivate than depending on consuming imported foods. It\u2019s the right time for us Africans to rely on African talents to solve some of the problems we have here in Africa.\n\n\u201cBut if we continue to worry about Africa, we will continue to make mistakes of giving up. We must remember the efforts of our past heroes of Nigeria who fought for the independence of Nigeria to liberate us from the slavery of the colonial masters and changed the continent of Africa through Education.\n\n\u201cAnd we should not forget the sacrifices and voices of our past heroes who used their education to fight for the independence of some countries in Africa\u201d.\n\nProf. Lumumba submitted that \u201cDelta State University at 30 has made enormous contributions to the development of Abraka, Delta, Nigeria, and Africa\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs we celebrate Delta State University Abraka\u2019s 30 years of existence and some of the notable achievements of the university over the past years.

I believe more that the people we met at the FCT deserve more recognition.\n\n\u201cI am not insisting that FCT should be a state but you appoint ministers, sometimes two from a state.

He is a man who rewards loyalty, who ensures that people who work are also taken care of. He will ensure that employment opportunities are better off, the issue of strike will be a thing of the past.

          "text": "Consumers of bread in parts of Cross River State have lamented the ever-increasing price of bread and have appealed to master bakers not to carry out their threat to further increase product prices.\n\nDAILY POST held random interviews with consumers, Saturday morning following a radio programme where a general manager of a bakery hinted that the association may soon increase the price of bread by another 50% as a result of the high costs of baking.\n\nA respondent, Itam Inang said \u201cWe strongly appeal to them to appreciate our plights. We appreciate theirs. We understand what they go through during these hyperinflation times. But for many of us, our buying power is very low having not had any appreciable increase in our incomes.\n\n\u201cWe need to eat bread. Presently, a family-sized loaf which goes for N800/N900 cannot go round my family of four. My children love eating bread. This is why I appeal to them not to increase the prices of bread again.\u201d\n\nMadam Esther Fidel, a teacher, similarly lamented that bread is now luxury food for the rich.\n\nShe appealed to the government to look at the inflation in the country for the sake of the common people.\n\n\u201cGovernment should pay attention to the ever-increasing prices of food items. We need their deliberate intervention to put down prices so that we can also eat bread.\u201d\n\nAn official of the bakery association in the state, Fred Williams said that many bakers might reduce the quality of their bread products.\n\n\u201cPrice of bread might likely increase very soon in Cross River State by 50%. This is owing to high costs of diesel to power our generators, high cost of bags of flour, sugar, oil etc.\n\n\u201cBefore now, we used to buy power than N500 but now it is N700 per litre. Flour used to be N20,000 now it is N22,000 per bag. When you add transportation and other logistics, you cannot afford to bear such costs alone otherwise you will close shops.\u201d",

Yabagi Yusuf Sani said: \u201cIt is reprehensible and unacceptable. IPAC demands an apology from NDLEA and strongly warn the anti-narcotic agency to desist from impugning on the character and integrity of politicians including those contesting for president who are patriotic, highly respected, well accomplished statesmen and women with proven integrity. There should be limit to rascality in the discharge of public duties.\n\n\u201cIt is amazing that Brigadier General Buba Marwa (rtd) who lacks the audacity to make similar proposal to the nation\u2019s armed forces that have on several occasions \u201caccidentally bombed\u201d civilian settlements killing innocent citizens including children in the course of military operations to get ride of terrorists, insurgents, militants and bandits should target politicians who are working assiduously along with fellow compatriots to build a strong, virile, united, progressive, egalitarian and decent democratic nation. It is high time we begin to show regard for the nation\u2019s political leaders as obtainable in other democracies.\n\n\u201cIPAC strongly condemns drug abuse by misguided citizens and urges NDLEA to discharge its duties in tandem with the law establishing it. A nation is governed by the rule of law, not by impunity.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that political parties\u2019 activities are guided by the 1999 constitution as amended, the Electoral Act 2022, INEC guidelines/regulations and respective parties\u2019 guidelines\u201d.\n\nSani said there is no justification whatsoever for extra constitutional requirements as proposed by the NDLEA boss.\n\n\u201cThis is the position of the Supreme Court ahead of the contentious 2003 general election where it held that INEC had no power to impose nomination fees on aspirants vying for elective offices outside the requirements provided by the constitution. This is the clear position of the law and the position of IPAC for aspirants seeking political offices in the 2023 general election.\n\nPolitical parties will not be distracted by this absurdity,\u201d he said.\n\nSani said IPAC will continue to uphold democratic ideals ethics and ethos as: \u201cwe jointly build a better, greater and prosperous democratic society\u201d.",

          "text": "By Doris Obinna\n\nThe dynamics of the 2023 presidential race in the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) may change next week, with the expected surprise entry of President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan.\n\nUntil now, majority of the presidential aspirants in APC are from the South, with the exception of Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, from the North. Some of the southern aspirants include Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo; leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; Ekiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi; Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi; former governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunke Amosun; former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha; Minister of Transportation, Hon Chibuike Amaechi; Minister of Labour & Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, and Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, among others.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nCompetent sources told Saturday Sun that some northern elders, who are desirous of having the APC retain power, looking at what is happening in the opposition political party, the Peoples Democratic Party, are working to draft Lawan, from Yobe in North East, into the presidential race.\n\nIt was gathered that the Senate President has been under immense pressure to join the race, since the northern elders mooted the idea and may succumb after the Ed-el-Fitr celebration, following a decisive meeting in Saudi Arabia by northerner powerbrokers, who had gone for hajj. He is likely to formally declare his intension to contest after the Sallah holiday.\n\nSources revealed that Lawan might become the dark horse who will become the consensus candidate of the APC in next year\u2019s presidential race. Afraid that the APC might field a presidential candidate from the South and be disadvantaged, the northern elders rooting for Lawan fear that in the event that PDP also succumbs to pressure and settles for a southern presidential candidate or opts for former Vice President Atiku Abubakar or one of the consensus candidate their counterpart in the PDP chose, former Kano State Governor, Musa Kwankwaso, who recently dumped the PDP and joined the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), would become a formidable force that could topple the apple cart.\n\nSpecifically afraid that Kwankwaso may become the favourite bride of northern voters, in the event of the above scenario, northern elders wants to draft Lawan as their own consensus candidate in the APC. It was gathered that the northern elders would set out to brief and get President Buhari\u2019s buy-in this weekend, before Lawan would be persuaded to formally join the presidential race.\n\nOne of the points the northern elders have marshalled out to convince Buhari, who, it was learnt, is tilting towards having a South East presidential candidate for the APC, include telling him that fielding a southern candidate when Kwankwaso is in the race or when the PDP could pick a northern candidate, would place APC at a disadvantage. Also, the group wants to tell Buhari that having Kwankwaso as a major northern candidate, in the expectation that APC and PDP could field southern presidential candidates, would give him an advantage and could lead to having a president who would emerge outside the scope of northern powerbrokers. The group also wants to tell Buhari that it would be disastrous for the APC to lose next year\u2019s election, as a president from another political party would cause the decimation and possible death of the governing political party.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nSaturday Sun gathered that the northern elders planning to draft Lawan are proposing a vice president from the South East or South West. Whichever geopolitical zone, between the South East and South West that does not get the vice presidential slot would produce the next Senate President, it was gathered.\n\nAlso, in the arrangement, the position of the Speaker, House of Representatives would be zoned to the North-West, while North Central would produce the Deputy Senate President. Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives will go to South South. The plan is to have all major positions shared among the six geopolitical zones as a way of having a government of inclusion.\n\nAccording to the northern elders\u2019 proposal, if Lawan is supported to become the president on the APC platform, he would do only one term, to allow South East take over thereafter. His coming is expected to consolidate the hold of the APC and also work for the political party\u2019s penetration to the South East, in order to make the transition of power to the zone after four years seamless and easy.\n\nSources say the pro-Lawan group is not sure how President Buhari would take the proposal, giving the fact that the President wants to surprise the South East with the APC presidential ticket. A South East senator has been consistent in saying that President Buhari may surprise the Igbo before leaving office, apparently referring to the President\u2019s disposition to have someone from the South East fly the APC presidential flag next year.\n\nEfforts to get the reaction of Lawan on the emerging succession plot proved abortive. He and his aides refused to make comments. Lawan has been a supporter of Tinubu, in the expectation that the APC would concede the presidential ticket to the South, it was gathered. With the development, his support would shift, in the overall interest of the APC.\n\nOwing to the fact that northerners were not joining the presidential race in APC, there has been an assumption that the governing party would zone the presidential ticket to the South.\n\nThere has been agitation and pressure that power should shift to the South after President Buhari. Southern governors, in both APC and PDP, have severally stated that power should shift to the zone next year. The demand has been high in PDP until recently when pro-South presidency voices started coming up in APC.",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu and Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nThe Ohanaeze Ndigbo, residents of South East and groups in the area have condemned the heavy presence of the military and personnel of other security agencies on South East roads.\n\nThey lamented that the numerous tortuous and vicious illegal checkpoints on the dilapidated roads had made life unbearable for their people.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nSaturday Sun learnt that the issue would be slated for discussion on May 5, as the Imeobi Ohanaeze deliberates on the 2023 Presidency and the security situation in the South East.\n\nA report released by a rights group, the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law (Intersociety) alleged that a whopping sum of N306bn had been paid at gunpoint in the past 50 months covering August 2015 and October 2019 by citizens of Eastern Nigeria to estimated 600 military and 6,300 police roadblocks in the South East and South-South regions.\n\nA 2018 report by the group said the security agencies made over N100billion in three years by extorting road users in those Southeast checkpoints.\n\nDisturbed by the ugly trend, President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, George Obiozor, recently hosted the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 82 Division, Maj-Gen. Taoreed Lagbaja, at the National Secretariat of the body.\n\nDuring their meeting, Ohanaeze Ndigbo explained to the Commandant the inhuman treatments the civilians undergo under the very armed forces whose primary duty was to protect them.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nObiozor lamented various forms of indignities that the people of South East encounter in the hands of the security operatives and demanded from the GOC, a security network that conformed to the best global practices. National Publicity Secretary of the group, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, yesterday, said the situation appeared to have further aggravated with checkpoints seen in every two kilometres in the region.\n\nAccording to him, this was at variance with what was obtainable in other parts of the country. Ogbonnia gave instance of Ohanaeze Ndigbo leadership\u2019s recent visit to Abeokuta, Ogun State to celebrate with former President Olusegun Obasanjo at his 85th birthday.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe travelled by road from Lagos to Abeokuta, Ogun State, to celebrate Chief Olusegun Obasanjo at 85. To my chagrin, there was no single roadblock from Lagos to Abeokuta. In contra-distinction, every two kilometers in the South East has a roadblock. You would see an army roadblock, police roadblock, Federal Road Safety Corps roadblock, Vehicle Inspection Officers (VIO) roadblock, NDLEA roadblock or a combination of all, etc. Most disturbingly, each of the checkpoints extorts money, openly and shamelessly, from the road users.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nSaturday Sun gathered that highly placed Nigerians had, on various occasions, drawn the attention of the GOC and the Commissioners of Police in the South East to the illicit activities of soldiers and policemen, whom they said had turned the highways and rural roads into a cash cow by extorting heavy fees from motorists passing through the roads.\n\nSeveral Igbo leaders who passed through the road to Igboukwu in Aguata L.G.A, Anambra State, for the burial of former Governor Chukwuemeka Ezeife\u2019s wife, Njideka, recently, had unpalatable stories to tell.\n\nAn elder statesman who attended a programme from Owerri, Imo State, recounted how they stood in traffic for more than one hour at a checkpoint in Ihiala, on the Onitsha/Owerri Expressway. \u201cThe traffic ground to a complete halt as there was no movement from Owerri to the Onitsha end. All the vehicles going to Owerri from Onitsha and verse versa all had their engines switched off. When a driver asked one of the hawkers selling water and snacks what caused the gridlock she said that it had been shut down till 8pm because the military men at the checkpoint had gone to pray and to break their fast. Therefore, the road had to be shut down. She said it was normal.\u201d\n\nAnother told the story of how he spent about four hours on his way to a burial at Oba. \u201cWhen we eventually got to the checkpoint after the road was opened I noticed that the military men were collecting N100 from every bus. The collection went on boldly without shame or care. The traffic jam stretched for over five kilometres either way. Governors Uzodimma and Soludo should intervene on this matter. This is unacceptable.\u201d In their reaction, Ohanaeze further stated that one of the worst things that can happen to any country is the populace, including children to watch the security operatives openly and shamelessly collect bribes from or rob motorists with arrogance and bravado.\n\nThe recurring confusion, it said, is how to draw a distinction between the notorious armed robbers with unlicensed guns and the government security operatives with licensed guns. The apex Igbo body said the illicit toll gate phenomenon has brought excruciating pains as a journey of less than an hour now takes over two hours because of gridlock mostly occasioned by these roadblocks and checkpoints.\n\nTwo other groups, the Igbo National Council (INC) and the Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL), have joined the call for the immediate dismantling of the various military checkpoints in the zone. Reacting to the development, the groups in their separate statements frowned at the alleged extra-judicial killings of youths in the zone as well as extortion by the military.\n\nPresident General of INC, Chilos Godsent accused the security agents of criminal extortion of motorists on checkpoints, maltreatment of travellers, adding that the joint military task force had on many occasions been procured and used illegally by civilians as debts collectors and tools to intimidate the people. President General of COSEYL, Goodluck Ibem, noted that the militarisation of the South-East is a further confirmation of the fact that Nigeria is a failed state.\n\nGodsent mentioned the military checkpoints at Ukwu Orji in Mbaitoli L.G.A, Akachi Junction along Aba Road in Naze, Imo State and Ihiala axis in Anambra State as the most notorious when it comes to the issue of extortion.\n\nAccording to him, the military personnel at these locations act with reckless impunity in maltreatment of travellers. Ibem declared: \u201cWe view the militarization of the South East as an insult and an affront on the sensibility and integrity of the people of the South-East and we vehemently condemn it and call for immediate dismantling of all military and police checkpoints because they have out-served their purposes.\u201d",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan and Lukman Olabiyi, Lagos\n\nLeading socio-political groups in the South-West are singing discordant tunes on the 2023 Presidential election and zoning of candidates.\n\nThe Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere; Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE), Agbekoya Farmers\u2019 Society (AFS) and the apex Yoruba self-determination group, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO), are divided over the zone that should produce the next president for Nigeria in 2023. They are also not in agreement over the conduct of the election.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nLeader of Afenifere, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, has been consistent in demanding that the Igbo should be allowed to produce the next president of Nigeria in the spirit of justice, equity and fairness. He has also suggested that all the presidential aspirants from the South West should withdraw for the presidential aspirants from the South East.\n\n\u201cI was taught politics of fairness, justice and equity. Have the Yoruba not produced the president and the vice president? Have the South-East got it? If you were in the shoes of the Igbo and the presidency is coming to the South and it is going back to the Yoruba, is that fairness and how would you feel? I love Nigeria to be one. Anything short of that; you are pushing the South-East out of Nigeria,\u201d he said in an interview with Saturday Sun.\n\nMeanwhile, Afenifere, on Wednesday called for a government of national unity to midwife a new democratic government in the country. The organisation in a communiqu\u00e9 signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Comrade Jare Ajayi, after a meeting held at country home of its Acting National Leader, Pa. Ayo Adebanjo, said such government would salvage the country from the issue of insecurity among others.\n\nThe group noted that for Nigeria to progress, it must first be restructured before the 2023 general elections. But to the Ilana Omo Oodua under the leadership of an Emeritus Professor of History, Banji Akintoye, Pa Ayo Adebanjo of Afenifere only expressed his opinion on the 2023 presidency. Communication Secretary of the organisation, Mr Maxwell Adeleye, told Saturday Sun that IOO does not even want the 2023 general election to hold, let alone arguing on the zoning of the presidential position to the South West, South East or South South.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cWe in Ilana Omo Oodua have made our position known a long time ago that we don\u2019t want the general election to hold in 2023. If the election will not hold, what is the argument about zoning all about? We are working to stop it legally and we pray it will never hold,\u201d he said.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nSecretary-General of YCE, Dr Kunle Olajide, said he was opposed to the position of Pa Adebanjo. He stated: \u201cThe office of the presidency of Nigeria is political. In other words, a president of Nigeria must play his politics right with people from all parts of the country.\n\n\u201cWhoever wants to be president must play his politics right with all parts of this country. He must be able to reach all parts of the country and fulfil additional requirements to be president.\u201d\n\nAlso, Agbekoya Farmers Society (AFS), a union of Yoruba farmers, said the call by Pa Adebanjo for candidates from the South-West to withdraw from the presidential race was a personal opinion.\n\nNational Secretary of AFS, Prince Adegbenro Ogunlana, told Saturday Sun that the call was not binding on any Yoruba person or group. He said it was not logical for Yoruba to abandon their own sons or daughters contesting for highest office in the land and support someone else.\n\n\u201cTo us Agbekoya, what we care for is restructuring of the country and that is what we have been agitating for. But if there is going to be election in 2023, I do not subscribe to the fact that everybody else should withdraw and leave the presidency to only one part of this country. I don\u2019t support Pa Ayo Adebanjo\u2019s position on that matter,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "\n\n* Says no regret over N100m presidential forms \u2018aimed at hindering unserious aspirants, moles\u2019\n\n* Party\u2019s presidential aspirants lengthen to 13, Fayemi joins race, 5 pick forms\n\n* PDP screens Atiku, Obi, Saraki, 14 others, disqualifies Nwachukwu Anakwenze, Cosmas Ndukwe\n\n\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThe ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday declared that it had not taken a decision on where to zone its presidential ticket in the 2023 elections.\n\n\n\nOn the same day, the number of presidential aspirants on the platform of the party jumped to 13, with the Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, sending out a notice that he would formally declare for president next Wednesday in Abuja.\n\n\n\nThe PDP likewise screened all its 17 presidential aspirants yesterday and disqualified two aspirants \u2013 Dr. Nwachukwu Anakwenze and Cosmas Ndukwe.\n\n\n\nThe National Chairman of the APC, Abdullahi Adamu, who spoke on the controversial zoning issue after presenting the party\u2019s candidate in the forthcoming Ekiti State governorship election, Biodun Oyebanji, to President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja, said such decision would be the job of the entire party, which he said was bigger than himself as Chairman.\n\n\n\nAdamu, who was accompanied by Ekiti State Governor and Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Kayode Fayemi; Kebbi State Governor and Chairman of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Atiku Bagudu; and the National Secretary of the APC, Senator Iyiola Omisore, said he could not preempt what the party\u2019s decision would be on the issue.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cI am today privileged to be the Chairman of the party. The party is greater than me. The party has not made a decision and I cannot preempt what the party\u2019s decision will be.\u201d\n\nGovernor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State had, just before the party\u2019s National Convention, said even though the APC had not decided on zoning the presidential ticket, the swapping of national offices was an indication of where its presidential candidate would come from.\n\n\n\nThe APC swapped its national offices between North and South, leading to the emergence of Adamu from the North-central as the National Chairman in March.\n\n\n\nResponding to the issue of when political appointees who intend to contest in the election are expected to resign, especially in the light of the party\u2019s recently issued guidelines for people in that category, Adamu declined comment, saying \u201cthe matter is currently in court.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cOur luck on this end is that I happen to be a lawyer and the issue you are raising is in court right now. So, it will be subjudice for me to discuss it at all.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the issue of the cost of the party\u2019s nomination and expression of interest forms, which many considered rather high, the Chairman said the party had no regret setting the prices at the current rate, citing the need to protect the party from unserious aspirants, moles, as well as the need to generate money to run the election processes.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been listening, with rapt attention, to the hues and cries from our lovers and from our adversaries. We have no regrets whatsoever. We did some homework, we know what it takes to go through primaries, go through presidential campaigns, go through election for the President. We know what it takes.\n\n\u201cWe also do know that there are citizens who are qualified to contest, but who are not serious contenders, who will just want to take anything cheap by the roadside, and assert what they call their rights and create problems for our party.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also aware that some parties that have no chance whatsoever to win the presidential election in Nigeria, they will sponsor people into parties that have prospects for winning the election, to create problems for us, to divert our attention.\n\n\n\n\u201cOver and above that, yes, we are the ruling party. Yes, we need to set examples in what we do, but I ask you, I don\u2019t know which part of the country you come from. If, God forbid, your traditional ruler dies today, contestants to that office will go for more than N100 million, it\u2019s no news.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I contested for the Senate, all I paid was just a token; N5 million, N10 million, including the expression (of interest). When my colleague wanted to be chairman of the party, in the days of Adams Oshimhole, it cost him N500,000. Today, for me, just as an example, to contest the national chairman of our party, I had to pay N20 million.\n\n\u201cAlright, and even the enormity of work that has to be done, and this work will be done with money. We don\u2019t want to continue begging.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, I want to say that we\u2019re able to mobilise sufficient funds to support our efforts to win the election. Some protests may be well founded, I have no quarrel with that, but the propensity of this, that people just assume \u2018it\u2019s the ruling party\u2019, is quick\u2026 in our democracy.\n\n\u201cI will not quarrel with that, everyone of us has the right to express himself, and I\u2019m in full support of these obligations, but we wear the shoes for our party and we know where it pinches us the most.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn reports that the process of settling for a presidential candidate could tear the party apart, if not carefully handled, Adamu said: \u201cGod will not allow that to happen to us. We will come out, by the grace of God, at the appropriate time, our great party will choose the candidate at the convention.\n\n\n\n\u201cI do not want to speculate, but my duty as chairman is to listen to party men, party leaders, stakeholders, to see what is going to be best when the time comes and I\u2019ve always found it easier and more noble to get a bridge before I jump to cross it. We are not there yet.\u201d\n\nAPC\u2019s Presidential Aspirants Lengthen to 13\n\n\n\nThe number of presidential aspirants on the platform of the APC jumped to 13 yesterday as the Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, sent out a notice that he would formally declare for president next Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nFayemi joins a long list that includes Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu; former governor of Abia State, Orji Kalu; ex-governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha; Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State; Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige; Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba; former president of the Senate, Ken Nnamani; Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State and Senator Ibikunle Amosun.\n\nFive of the presidential aspirants have so far paid N100 million and picked up their forms. Those who did were Tinubu, Umahi, Bello, Nwajiuba and Okorocha.\n\n\n\nNnamani, while declaring his intention to run for president yesterday, promised to improve on the legacy of President Buhari, while also demanding for the reduction of the cost of interest and nomination forms for aspirants seeking elective posts under the APC.\n\n\n\nHe said compared with other aspirants, he was the most suited for the job of the President.\n\nNnamani said his pedigree as the President of the Senate and Chairman of the Presidential Committee on Constitutional and Electoral Reform make him the right candidate.\n\n\n\nOkorocha picked his presidential expression of interest and nomination forms yesterday, insisting that Nigeria\u2019s biggest challenge remains the inability to create wealth.\n\nOkorocha, who was presented the documents by \u201cThe New Nigeria Team\u201d, in his Unity House office in Abuja, maintained that he remained the right candidate to take over from Buhari, promising that his government would be pro-people.\n\nTinubu Support Groups (TSG) yesterday picked the N100 million Expression of Interest and nomination forms on behalf of Tinubu.\n\n\n\nThe TSG team was led by a member representing Ikeja Federal constituency in the House of Representatives and the Chairman House Committee on Finance, Hon. James Faleke.\n\nFaleke said Tinubu paid for his form personally but asked them to pick it up on his behalf because he was out of the country.\n\nThe lawmaker stressed that Tinubu was the candidate to beat, no matter the mode of primaries adopted by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\n\n\u201cAsiwaju at the appropriate time will deliver his address to us, but I know that this country under Tinubu will be better off. Economy will be better off because he is an economist, he is not a lawyer, he is an economist. He will deal with the economic situation of this country. He did it in Lagos, the security challenges in Lagos were solved by him. He will solve the same security challenges. He is a man who rewards loyalty, who ensures that people who work are also taken care of.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn his part, the former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Babachir Lawal said Tinubu is a branded product, adding that every Nigerian knows that he is the man to beat.\n\n\n\nOn his chances, he noted, \u201cIf we were not sure we have chances to win this election we would not waste our N100 million. Everybody\u2019s free to buy the forms if he has N100 million. The choice is his own. He has the money. But as far as we are concerned, we are only fulfilling the constitutional requirement of campaigning and going for election. We don\u2019t foresee any opposition in the contest.\u201d\n\nPDP Screens Presidential Aspirants\n\n\n\nThe PDP yesterday screened all its presidential aspirants ahead of its National Convention slated for May 30.\n\nFormer senate president, David Mark headed the presidential screening committee.\n\nAll the presidential aspirants like the former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, former Senate President Bukola Saraki, former secretary to the government of federation Anyim Pius Anyim, Chief Dele Momodu, Peter Obi, Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, Governor Emmanuel Udom, Governor Aminu Tambuwal, Mohammed Hayatu-deen and Ayo Fayose, were at the screening.\n\n\n\nThe committee at the end of the sitting disqualified two aspirants.\n\nMark confirmed this after the conclusion of the exercise at Legacy House, Abuja, at 7pm yesterday.\n\nHe, however, refused to disclose the identities of the disqualified aspirants or the reasons for their disqualification.\n\nMark simply noted that the aspirants did not meet the requirements.\n\n\n\nBut sources told THISDAY that the likely disqualified aspirants were Dr. Nwachukwu Anakwenze and Cosmas Ndukwe. Ndukwe took the party to court over zoning.\n\nMark also affirmed that the report of the screening will be transmitted to the PDP National Working Committee for consideration Friday night.\n\n\n\nAnyim, who spoke to reporters after screening, described the process as simple, explaining that they were asked about their financial capabilities for campaigns, when they became members of the party and their tax papers.\n\nAlso speaking after screening, former governor of Ekiti State, Ayo Fayose warned the party against jettisoning zoning \u201cas it will hurt the PDP in the future.\u201d\n\nBut Governor Emmanuel disagreed saying, \u201cany decision taken by the PDP on zoning is supreme and must be obeyed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso Peter Obi who described the screening exercise as perfect said that he would respect the position of the party on zoning.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Germany to return 1,130 looted Benin bronzes to Nigeria\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday backed the planned ultramodern international standard Benin Royal Museum that would house the Benin Bronzes and other artefacts being returned to Nigeria, for the purpose of preserving history, tourism and education.\n\n\n\nThe President announced his support while receiving in audience at the State House, Abuja, the Oba of Benin, H.R.M. Omo N\u2019Oba Uku Akpolokpolo Ewuare II, accompanied by members of the Royal Court of Benin and the Board of Trustees of the Benin Royal Museum.\n\n\n\nThe Royal Majesty was at the State House to thank the President on the recent return of two important Benin Bronzes to its original place of abode by the University of Cambridge and the University of Aberdeen, both in the United Kingdom, after 125 years.\n\n\n\nThe Royal Museum, to be housed in the palace of the Oba of Benin, is in conjunction with the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM).\n\n\n\nThe Oba of Benin told the President: \u201cWe want to reassure Mr. President that the Royal Court of Benin and NCMM are working closely to ensure safe custody, preservation and enhancement of these Benin Bronzes and artefacts, not only for their cultural and economic benefits, but more importantly towards the promotion of the tourism industry in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Royal Majesty reassured Nigerians that the Benin Bronzes and artefacts represent the country\u2019s cultural heritage in particular and Africa in general, saying \u201cwe hold these objects in trust as the original owners in conjunction with NCMM for the benefit of all.\u201d\n\n\n\nEarlier, the President declared that the federal government would continue to vigorously pursue the repatriation of Nigeria\u2019s looted artefacts from abroad, including 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums and Ife terracotta/bronze heads in Netherlands and United States museums.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the returned artefacts, Buhari expressed delight that it had brought immense goodwill and acclaim to Nigeria, the ancient Benin Kingdom, as well as happiness to the Oba of Benin.\n\n\n\nHe noted that while it was widely acknowledged around the world that some of the best ancient arts belong to Nigeria, including those from Benin, Ife, Nok and Igbo-Ukwu, many of these beautiful works were illicitly taken away, particularly during the colonial period.\n\n\n\nAffirming that these great cultural and artistic works were records of history, the President vowed that Nigeria would not permit these great works to become properties of others, adding that this administration had made it an important task to ensure the return of the artefacts.\n\n\n\nThe President, therefore, assured the first-class traditional ruler that the federal Government would continue in this great cause with his support and that of other traditional rulers.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cIn furtherance to these efforts, an agreement between Nigeria and Germany is currently being prepared. When concluded, it will signify the return to Nigeria by Germany of all the 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums. This will be a monumental achievement.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018Furthermore, on the 7th of this month, the Glasgow City Council agreed to return 17 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria. The legal issues are in the process of being sorted out.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018Other success stories include the return by the Netherlands in October 2020 of a 600-year-old Ife Terracotta; the return in April 2021 of a bronze piece from Mexico; as well as the repatriation, in November 2021, of two Benin Bronzes and an Ife Bronze head from the Metropolitan Museum, New York.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Buhari announced that because of the determined efforts of this administration, \u201cNigeria is now regarded to be in the forefront globally in the struggle to repatriate illicitly-exported artefacts to their countries of origin.\u201d\n\nThe President acknowledged the efforts of officials of the NCMM currently working with the Oxford University, the Great North Museum of Newcastle University, Rhode Island School and numerous other places on the modalities for the return of Nigerian antiquities, particularly the Benin Bronzes.\n\n\n\nHe expressed optimism that with careful planning and management, Nigeria could generate revenue from the repatriated antiquities.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cWe look forward to a future when these returned antiquities and our arts and culture shall be deployed in generating revenue for the nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am glad to hear that the Ministry of Information and Culture and the NCMM are already working towards this by reaching out to other nations and cultural institutions on travelling exhibitions to showcase the rich culture of Nigeria through these antiquities.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis can happen if officials in charge of these priceless artefacts take due care to maintain and preserve these treasures in good condition at all times.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso speaking, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, affirmed that Nigeria would continue to assert its rights over all its antiquities around the world.\n\n\n\nHe added that the country would not hesitate to implore nations, institutions, men and women of goodwill to see the unfairness in the affairs of one body holding on to the cultural property fashioned by the genius of another.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* Discloses Ife terracotta, bronze heads due from Netherlands, US *Says repatriated antiquities potential revenue earners\n\n\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari Friday declared that the Federal Government would continue to vigorously pursue the repatriation of looted Nigeria\u2019s artefacts from abroad, including 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums and Ife terracotta and bronze heads in Netherlands and United States museums. The President gave the assurance while receiving in audience at the State House, Abuja, the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, accompanied by members of the Royal Court of Benin and the Board of Trustees of the Benin Royal Museum.\n\nThe Royal Majesty was at State House to thank the President on the recent return of two important Benin Bronzes to its original place of abode by the University of Cambridge and the University of Aberdeen, both in the United Kingdom, after 125 years.\n\nSpeaking on the return of the artefacts, President Buhari expressed delight that it had brought immense goodwill and acclaim to Nigeria, the ancient Benin Kingdom as well as happiness to the Oba of Benin. He noted that while it was widely acknowledged around the world that some of the best ancient arts belong to Nigeria, including those from Benin, Ife, Nok and Igbo-Ukwu, many of these beautiful works were illicitly taken away, particularly during the colonial period.\n\nAffirming that these great cultural and artistic works are records of history, the President vowed that Nigeria cannot permit these great works to become properties of others, adding that this administration has made it an important task to ensure the return of the artefacts. The President, therefore, assured the first-class traditional ruler that the Federal Government will continue in this great cause with his support and that of other traditional rulers.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2018In furtherance to these efforts, an agreement between Nigeria and Germany is currently being prepared. When concluded, it will signify the return to Nigeria by Germany of all the 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums. This will be a monumental achievement.\u2018\u2018Furthermore, on the 7th of this month, the Glasgow City Council agreed to return 17 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria.\n\nThe legal issues are in the process of being sorted out.\u2018\u2018Other success stories include the return by the Netherlands in October 2020 of a 600-year-old Ife Terracotta; the return in April 2021 of a bronze piece from Mexico; as well as the repatriation, in November 2021, of two Benin Bronzes and an Ife Bronze head from the Metropolitan Museum, New York\u201d. President Buhari announced that because of the determined efforts of this administration, Nigeria is now regarded to be in the forefront globally in the struggle to repatriate illicitly-exported artefacts back to their countries of origin.\n\nThe President acknowledged the efforts of officials of the National Commission for Museums and Monuments currently working with the Oxford University, the Great North Museum of Newcastle University, Rhode Island School and numerous other places on the modalities for the return of Nigerian antiquities, particularly the Benin Bronzes. He expressed optimism that with careful planning and management, Nigeria can generate revenue from the repatriated antiquities.\n\nAccording to him: \u2018\u2018We look forward to a future when these returned antiquities and our arts and culture shall be deployed in generating revenue for the nation.\u2018\u2018I am glad to hear that the Ministry of Information and Culture and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) are already working towards this by reaching out to other nations and cultural institutions on traveling exhibitions to showcase the rich culture of Nigeria through these antiquities.\u2018\u2018This can happen if officials in charge of these priceless artefacts take due care to maintain and preserve these treasures in good condition at all times\u201d\n\nEarlier in his speech, the Oba of Benin informed the President that his Royal Court had concluded plans with the NCMM to establish an ultramodern international standard Benin Royal Museum to house the Benin Bronzes and other artefacts for the purpose of preserving history, tourism and education.\n\nHe said:\u2018\u2018We want to reassure Mr President that the Royal Court of Benin and NCMM are working closely to ensure safe custody, preservation and enhancement of these Benin bronzes and artefacts not only for their cultural and economic benefits, but more importantly towards the promotion of the tourism industry in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe Royal Majesty reassured Nigerians that the Benin Bronzes and artefacts represent the country\u2019s cultural heritage in particular and Africa in general, saying \u2018\u2018we hold these objects in trust as the original owners in conjunction with NCMM for the benefit of all.\u2019\u2019Also speaking, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, affirmed that Nigeria would continue to assert its rights over all its antiquities around the world.\n\nHe added that the country would not hesitate to implore nations, institutions, men and women of goodwill to see the unfairness in the affairs of one body holding on to the cultural property fashioned by the genius of another.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u201cIf Nigerians can devote as much energy as possible to addressing issues of poor governance and leadership crises, weak economy, increased insecurity and conflict, farmer-pastoral violence, etc. If they could spend their time resolving regional divisions, armed bandits, Boko Haram insurgents, and electoral fraud, we would have long had a more productive society that competes with other nations.\"\n\n\n\nSocial media platforms have decisively influenced our society. Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat are considered the most used sources of information worldwide. The less expensive access to these platforms, ease to use and the presence of a higher number of users make them one of the easiest and most effective methods to disseminate information.\n\n\n\nOver the past decade and a half, social media usage has skyrocketed. For example, about three billion people (40% of the world's population) spend up to two hours a day sharing, liking, tweeting and using these platforms. This percentage breaks down to roughly half a million tweets or Snapchat photos shared every minute. The impact of social media has far tripled in recent years on various strata of society. On the brighter side, social media has spread much awareness by publishing news and providing entertainment on several platforms, enabling more people to familiarise themselves with opinions they otherwise would not have known. On the opposite side, people have unfortunately used social media to provoke, instigate or stifle public anger towards specific instances or persons. In Nigeria, for example, social media has continued to play a toxic role in destroying marriages. It has also spread hoax news and unnecessary panic among families, giving false information and misleading the public.\n\n\n\nAlthough there are no official statistics to know how social media is destroying marriages in Nigeria, many examples of celebrity marriages have gone sour because of the influence of social media in-laws. In 2019, news of a controversial romance between Nollywood actress Regina Daniels and billionaire businessman Prince Ned Nwoko went viral online. Following this news was a series of mixed reactions from social media in-laws. They criticised the marriage based on the 38-year age gap between the couple. Just as we were trying to understand the marriage between Ned and Regina, news of divorce between Anita and Paul Okoye (AKA Rudeboy) appeared on the Internet. The leaked court document states that Anita Okoye was seeking dissolution of marriage from Paul Okoye due to irreconcilable differences.\n\n\n\nConsidering recent events on social media, I have concluded that most people in Nigeria care much more about the failures in celebrity marriages than anything of substance that will impact our nation. For example, in 2021, the admired Nigerian actress Annie Idibia, in a now-deleted Instagram story, accused her husband, Tuface, of infidelity. In the post, the Nollywood actress accused 2Baba of sleeping with his ex-girlfriend, Pero Adeniyi, using the visitation of his children as an excuse. Annie also claimed that Tuface\u2019s family never found her worthy of him despite all her efforts. Shortly after Annie Idibia took to her Instagram Story in a now-deleted post to accuse her husband, Tuface, of infidelity, some Nigerians on Twitter have taken to their various accounts to air their opinion on the situation. Some social media in-laws, who commented on the issue, faulted the actress for expressing her marital problems on social media. Many argued that bringing her marital issues to social media would exacerbate the fire.\n\n\n\nIn 2022, social media came up with fresh news about Ibiere, the wife of a comedian Julius Agwu, who reportedly abandoned her matrimonial home after 14 years of marriage. Some social media in-laws reported that the couple had been going through trying times for years because of Agwu\u2019s ill health. Recall that in 2015, the comedian, singer, and writer was diagnosed with a brain tumor. According to some unsubstantiated reports on the Internet, Ibiere had reverted to her maiden name Maclayton and traveled abroad with their kids. Although it was not clear what led to the breakdown of the marriage, there were several speculations from some social media in-laws that the couple was going through a financial crisis occasioned by Agwu\u2019s ill health.\n\n\n\nThis year, Nollywood actor, Yul Edochie, caused a stir on social media when he announced his second marriage to fellow actress Judy Austin. In his announcement, Yul also revealed that he welcomed a son with his second wife. Several social media influencers reacted to the news of Yul\u2019s second marriage calling on the judgment and wrath of God over him. The Internet went berserk. In one day, I saw four different Twitter moments of his post. I received several notifications about it. Specifically, on social media, I saw more uproar about Yul Edochie than comments on our tattered democracy, not just from the people I follow but from the trending tabs and headlines news.\n\n\n\nThese issues have led to a realisation that people tend to care more about celebrity marriages than the challenges affecting politics and governance in Nigeria. My frustration comes from the fact that if Nigerians can devote as much energy as possible to addressing issues of poor governance and leadership crisis, the weak economy, increased insecurity and conflict, and farmer-pastoral violence. If they could spend their time resolving regional divisions, armed bandits, Boko Haram insurgents, and electoral fraud, we would have long had a more productive society that competes with other nations. There is nothing inherently wrong with paying attention to celebrities and their families. I openly follow celebrities on social media too. But I have my opinion and caution in my judgment about their personal lives on social media. I am not (in any way) supporting the actions of these celebrities or justifying cheating in marriages. Neither am I supporting polygamy as it is against my religion.\n\n\n\nHowever, I am emphasising that something is unsettling when people place too much energy into the personal lives of celebrities when Nigeria is facing an acute crisis in democracy. Nigeria's problem is not celebrities. Our problems are more than the lives of those we call our mentors. For example, there is a widespread perception that our democracy has failed to address Nigeria's most pressing problems and that elected representatives are inaccessible to those, who elected them. Besides the failure of democracy, Nigerians feel disconnected from politicians, who make decisions that affect their lives. The news dominating Nigeria often seems to hold little relevance to people\u2019s day-to-day lives.\n\n\n\nToday, our democracy is in urgent need of repair. We need to seize this opportunity to move beyond celebrity problems to strengthen the foundation of Nigerian democracy. Failure to fix our democracy can lead to protest or extremism, both of which further harm democratic performance. Thus, it would be wrong to say social media is universally bad because it clearly brings myriad benefits to our lives. However, if there is no little effort from us to control the margin of information we consume online, we are dooming ourselves to become cyberbullies instead of cyber influencers.\n\n\n\n\n\nRev.

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

How are you doing? How do you intend to spend your weekend? If you don\u2019t know, you can still use my tips. I think I\u2019m down for enjoyment this weekend. And I guess you know what to do. Haha! Again, nobody will know.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore information on Flutterwave\u2019s CEO\n\nFinancial literacy for startup founders\n\nEden Life\u2019s expansion and acquisition\n\nOnePort 365\u2019s $5m seed\n\nQuick update on the Flutterwave CEO story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, April 12, 2022, David Hundeyin, an investigative journalist, accused Flutterwave Founder and CEO, Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola of impersonation, inappropriate behaviour, and insider trading in an article.\n\nFollowing that article, various stories were published. However, an article was published yesterday, Thursday, April 28, 2022, that provided some interesting points to the story.\n\nI\u2019m not going to bore you with epistles. Here are some key points:\n\nAccording to Rest of World, in 2019, Iyin Aboyeji, former CEO of Flutterwave, who resigned from the board in 2018, was arrested by the Nigerian police and spent the night in jail.\n\nWhy? The company was accused of fraud at the time, per the police, after failing to refund a customer card transaction. The company had failed to remove Aboyeji\u2019s name from official documentation, hence, his arrest. Nonetheless, he was eventually released without charge.\n\nOver the last two years, Agboola has backed at least 25 startups, typically investing between $25,000 and $150,000. Among his investments are stock trading app, Bamboo; fintechs, Mono and Sudo Africa; and the media company Big Cabal Media, publisher of Zikoko and TechCabal.\n\nDue to the recent allegations, an acquisition deal has come to a halt. It is unclear who is acquiring who. The concern is that Flutterwave may be unable to raise a series E.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that we still don\u2019t know, but I simply want justice to be served. What do you think?\n\nWell, since you are here, I think you\u2019ll find this story enlightening: Analysing 2 major allegations against Olugbenga Agboola\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nFrom forging a career in blockchain to learning how to make money with NFTs, the Web3 space can be very tricky.

The main character, Zuri, appeared to be financially successful but suffered a series of misfortunes that made her realise she was in financial trouble and needed to make sound financial decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough she was sound, educated, had an amazing job, and was literate, Zuri was financially illiterate but soon understood that she had to learn to make good financial decisions.\n\nHow was she financially illiterate? She couldn\u2019t read and write matters related to money. \ud83d\ude02 Hey, I\u2019m kidding. Scratch that. She was financially illiterate because she couldn\u2019t stick to a budget, manage her debt, or make wise financial decisions.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re checking yourself to see if you\u2019re financially literate. To be honest, I can\u2019t answer that question because it\u2019s a little tricky. This time, I\u2019m not going to give you the gist. \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut, be honest, do you believe you are financially illiterate as an individual, entrepreneur, or startup founder?\n\nDo you believe that startup founders, regardless of their background, should embrace financial literacy? Is financial literacy necessary?\n\nRemember we had a Twitter Space titled Do startups need financial literacy? a few weeks ago. We had Olumide Adesina and Kalu Aja speak to us about the concept and what it means for startups.\n\nConsequently, Chimgozirim took his time to give us an interesting overview of the conversation. I believe you\u2019ll learn something from it, whether you\u2019re a startup founder or not. You can find it here: \u201cAll startup founders must be financially literate.\u201d \u2013 Olumide Adesina\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

Also, the company has acquired Lynk, a technology company that connects unemployed Kenyans to job opportunities in Kenya.\n\nWhy the expansion? Building on its success in Lagos, Nigeria, Eden says it intends to remove obstacles to discovering dependable household services in Nairobi.\n\nWhat\u2019s its success rate in Lagos? The company claims that the service has had an 80% retention rate since 2021, with a 15% MoM growth rate. Since its launch, Eden Life has provided over 150,000 services in Nigeria.\n\nNadayar Enegesi, Prosper Otemuyiwa, and Silm Momoh co-founded the company in Nigeria in 2019. It connects busy professionals with concierge services, and a subscription service that delivers high-quality chef-prepared meals, laundry services, and house cleaning.\n\nComing in with a twist: Unlike Lagos, Nairobi users get an additional service: a beauty and wellness service.\n\nWhat you should know about Lynk: The platform was launched in 2015, and it facilitated over 150,000 jobs, transferring $4.5 million to over 2,000 workers across four major verticals: beauty & wellness, cleaning & care, installation, repair & maintenance, and furniture & decor.\n\nOnePort 365\u2019s $5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnePort 365, an African digital freight forwarding company, has raised $5 million in seed funding to drive end-to-end digitisation of freight management in Africa and support its expansion into new markets.\n\nLed by Mobility 54 \u2014 VC arm of Toyota Tsusho and CFAO Group \u2014 SBI Investment, Flexport, ODX, a Singaporean syndicate fund, Samurai Incubate, and other angel investors participated.\n\nWhat exactly does the company do? Launched in 2019 by Hio Sola-Usidame (CEO), the platform covers air freight, ocean freight, inland haulage (trucking, barge, and rail), and Pay-As-You-Go warehousing, marine insurance, customs brokerage, and more.\n\nCurrently, OnePort 365 is creating an operating system for African cross-border trade, assisting traders in managing their freight processes via a digital platform that enables seamless freight forwarding and other value-added services.\n\nAccording to OnePort 365, traders no longer have to wait up to two weeks to compare the best rates from various service providers. They can explore competitive offers on the platform and book freights in 30 seconds or less using pre-negotiated rates.\n\nIt currently operates in Nigeria and Ghana, and is exploring other markets. The platform also makes use of advancements in payment technology and the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) to enable instant payments.\n\nThe funds will be used to improve efficiency and lower overheads in cross-border trading across the continent, and to launch several new services that will boost overall profitability.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge is sourcing ventures building or interested in leveraging the Cardano blockchain platform and community.

If you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019re probably wondering why startups have to be financially literate, especially when much of the conversation around financial literacy has been about personal finance.\n\nAs surprising as it is, even businesses need financial literacy. Most African tech startups are founded by individuals with more technical than financial skills. However, building a business requires more than just technical skills; you have to create a budget, pay salaries, deal with taxes, and allocate scarce financial resources.\n\nWith this in mind, on Friday, April 15, 2022, we had Olumide Adesina, a financial market analyst and Kalu Aja share their thoughts on financial literacy on a Twitter Space titled \u201cDo startups need financial literacy?\u201d\n\nAccording to Investopedia, financial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinancial literacy is the application of financial knowledge to processes in our personal lives or businesses. For Adesina, everyone, from companies to individuals, needs financial literacy. However, he pointed out that knowing about financial issues does not equate to financial literacy.\n\nStartup founders, he said, must have some form of financial literacy, especially in the early stages when they may not be able to afford to hire professionals to handle their financial matters. Understanding budgetary processes and knowing how to read a business\u2019 balance sheet are two skills that he advises startup founders to have.\n\n\u201cYou need to understand budgetary processes, for example, how to read balance sheets. You can\u2019t be a founder in today\u2019s world, understand your product, but can\u2019t relay that to investors. Founders who don\u2019t have these skills can always learn the basics within six months.\u201d\n\nKnowing how to allocate resources is another skill that he believes startup founders should have, and he advises that founders should separate their personal finances from business finances.\n\nLearning how to manage a business\u2019 finances and running the business might sound like a daunting task for anyone. Adesina pointed out that startups can hire a chief financial officer (CFO) once they can afford one. Where this is not possible, he advised that startups outsource that aspect of their business but not before mentioning its disadvantages, including the inability to get complete buy-in.\n\nFor Kalu Aja, financial literacy for startups is really about cash management and how a startup can utilise financial resources like debt and equity to build a sustainable business.\n\n\u201cThe first thing you want to do when you\u2019re starting is have a money guy on the team. This could be an accountant or CFO, but you need someone to watch how you invest and use your money. A business can survive with bad ideas, bad sales, and a bad CEO, but a business cannot survive without cash.\u201d\n\nStartups need skilled individuals to build great products. However, they need to be paid, and early-stage startups may be unable to afford them. Fortunately, there are creative solutions, such as giving out employee stock option plans (ESOP).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmployee stock option plans allow an employee to purchase a certain number of shares in a company at no charge, a nominal value, or a price below the fair market value after a specified period during their employment.\n\nThis way, startups can compete favourably with more established companies. Founders also need to be paid, and Adesina advises that they can make money from consulting or other business ventures to take some pressure off the business.\n\nWith many startups opting for venture capital investments, Adesina observed that founders need to be careful while deciding what kind of investment they accept.\n\n\u201cAre you raising money just for the fun of raising money? Are you raising money to scale or to acquire another company? These are fundamental questions to ask before going out to raise money. Also, statistics have shown that companies with significant traction get better valuations when raising from VCs,\u201d he added.\n\nAlthough local banks are not known for providing funds to startups, Aja and Adesina believe that they can give a lot of value to startups. However, they advise that startups identify ways that banks can provide value besides providing financing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nMy day didn\u2019t start well for me yesterday. A few minutes after eating my usual breakfast of bread and beverage, I began to feel ill \u2013 a dizzying sensation that improves with rest. So I knew I needed to rest because I wouldn\u2019t have been able to write today\u2019s newsletter.\n\nIn some workplaces, taking a nap in the morning is frowned upon. But isn\u2019t one\u2019s health and safety important at work?\n\nToday, April 28, 2022, is World Day for Safety and Health at Work. The day raises awareness about the global prevention of workplace injuries, illnesses, and deaths and the pain and financial hardship these events can cause for workers, their families, and employers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople\u2019s ability to perform their jobs in the least harmful way to their health \u2013 known as occupational health \u2013 is just as important as their physical, mental, and sexual health. So, as an employer, put your employees\u2019 occupational health first, and as an employee, prioritise your employer\u2019s occupational health.\n\nToday, while you stay safe and healthy at work or home, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nUnderstanding the Web3 hype\n\nThe Digital Service Act\n\nAnother phishing scheme\n\nUnderstanding the Web3 hype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an Internet user, I\u2019m sure you know that the term, Web3, is quite popular these days. Plus, you\u2019re probably asking, \u201cVictoria, what exactly does Web3 mean?\u201d Well, I believe by the end of this piece, you should get a fair idea.\n\nThe web has evolved from a tool used only by academics and computer geeks to a necessity we can\u2019t live without over the last two decades. That development has come at a cost, with some tech behemoths dominating the platforms we rely on.\n\nAnd blockchain enthusiasts believe that Web3 will change all of that. But what exactly is Web3? Before we get there, I think it\u2019s critical we understand Web 1 and 2.\n\nWhat\u2019s Web1? Tim Berners-Lee released Web 1.0 \u2013 the first browser \u2013 in 1993, and it provided a new way for people all over the world to access information. But navigation and design were difficult.\n\nSo, tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Amazon, and Facebook sprung up and began to facilitate navigation and design. They gathered data and made searching a breeze. This epoch is known as Web 2.0. That is the era we are currently living in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, you\u2019re asking, \u201cWhy Web3 when searching is easy?\u201d Well, many people today are concerned these tech giants facilitating navigation and design wield too much power. So, Web3 was created to return this control to the end-user.\n\nBilled as the next generation of the web, Web3 focuses on decentralisation using decentralised blockchains. Maybe, your next question is how is Web3 decentralised? Well, the link provides answers to that.\n\nRemember our Twitter Space, Making Sense of the Web3 Buzz? Bolu, our go-to Blockchain person, crafted a brilliant story from the discussion. Don\u2019t forget that we had an investor, a designer, and a founder on that Space who shared their perspectives.\n\nDon\u2019t you think it will be interesting to read their points of view? Catch up on the story here: Making sense of the Web3 buzz through the eyes of an African investor, founder, and designer\n\nAgain, you\u2019re possibly asking, \u201cVictoria, how can I get involved?\u201d Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve got you covered. Please take a look at it in the next story.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nFrom forging a career in blockchain to learning how to make money with NFTs, the Web3 space can be very tricky. That\u2019s why we have created an entire event dedicated to Web3.\n\nLet NFT artists and blockchain devs show you the ropes at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit. Register and get your early bird tickets here.\n\nThe Digital Service Act\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly on Saturday, April 23, 2022, I was at home, relaxing and watching a movie. But the European Commission was in a different mood.\n\nWhat happened? That Saturday, the European Commission announced a political agreement between the European Parliament and European Union (EU) member states on the Commission\u2019s proposal for the Digital Services Act (DSA).\n\nKeep in mind that the DSA was proposed alongside the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in December 2020.\n\nWhy the DSA? The Act will protect against the spread of illegal content and includes additional measures to protect European citizens\u2019 fundamental rights.\n\nAlthough the legislation only applies to EU citizens, the impact will undoubtedly be felt worldwide. But who is subject to the DSA\u2019s regulations?\n\nThe rules of the DSA primarily apply to online intermediaries and platforms like online marketplaces, social networks, content-sharing platforms, app stores, and online travel and accommodation platforms.\n\nIs there a penalty? Noncompliance can result in fines of up to 6% of a company\u2019s annual revenue.\n\nBut what\u2019s the DSA all about? The DSA includes specific requirements for minors, online marketplaces, online platforms, and search engines, with stricter requirements implemented proportionally for very large online platforms\u2019 (VLOPs) and very large online search engines\u2019 (VLOSEs).\n\nIt also contains guidelines for using deceptive interfaces, like Dark Patterns, and for the transparency of recommender systems.\n\nChimgozirim explained how it could work in today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, and how it may affect the Internet in the future. You can listen here.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

Before they were stolen, those NFTs were worth $2.7 million.\n\nSound familiar? Yeah. The official Bored Ape Yacht Club Discord channel, and several NFTs Discords, were hacked earlier this month as part of a phishing scam. The hacker tricked users into clicking a link to \u201cmint\u201d a bogus NFT by sending Ethereum (eth) and, in some cases, an NFT to wrap into a token.\n\nHowever, it is still unclear how the hacker gained access to the BAYC Instagram account. In an official tweet, BAYC says, \u201ctwo-factor authentication was enabled and security surrounding the IG account followed best practices.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nEverything You Need to Know About Sleep Terrors\n\nADHD and Hypersexuality: What\u2019s the Connection?\n\nHow mindfulness changes the emotional life of our brains\n\nGen Z\u2019s mental wellness harmed by need to be perfect teen\n\nSleep is your superpower.\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge is sourcing ventures building or interested in leveraging the Cardano blockchain platform and community.

Bekonta is taking major moves to implement this awareness stage. In a Festival of culture \u2013 an event put together by the Dance and Drama Community Development Service of the FCT National Youth Corps Members at Merit House Maitama FCT Abuja, and driven by the need to encourage blockchain\n\nadoption mainstream, Bekonta is so pleased to announce her honor as sponsor to the Festival of Culture \u2013 an event which staged an aesthetic showcase of the Nigerian cultural heritage in drama, dance, music, poetry and, pageantry.\n\nAs a Cryptocurrency Exchange, Bekonta provides an easy payment gateway for blockchain transactions. You can make direct deposit and withdrawals from and to your Naira wallet as the case may be, from your Bekonta\n\naccount. Being part of the Fintech industry and seeing the sporadic growth recorded overtime, we believe that events such as was organized by the FCT Dance and Drama NYSC CDS, presents an opportunity to sensitize youths about the current stage of the global Fintech which includes:-\n\nExposing Corps Members to the several opportunities in the global Fintech\n\nPromoting the adoption of these opportunities mainstream\n\nFunding new subscribers\u2019 wallet with initial capital\n\nIn a one thousand capacity auditorium, the event was graced with positive turn-ups and top NYSC officials. The presence of the Director Press and Public Relations NYSC, Mr Eddy Magwa, a highly detribalized official and a host of other officials, and corps members in the 6/7 regalia dignified the event with honor and color.\n\nOur involvement as Sponsor to the event was more comely than we expected as Corps members and indeed the audience got engaged in a unique way. Branded items such as the Bekonta caps and stickers were handed out as a token in addition to cash funding of $10- $20 to our first 20 subscribers for an on spot activation bonus.\n\nThe feedback is the part of the narrative we are so excited to share. we almost ran out of gift items plus Bekonta was met with highly active sign-ups. Our Q&A / Red carpet session lit up the event as Corps Members stopped at nothing to engage with positive vibes, taking photos, commentaries as in the pictures below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Festival of Culture with the Bekonta presence engaged Youth Corps Members in a unique way. The Festival emphasized the uniqueness in the Nigerian cultural diversity without leaving a doubt. It also presented an avenue to recognise the similarities the Nigerian ethnic groups share largely in common. Bekonta identifies with the uniqueness in the Nigerian ethic diversities, especially our payment gateway that presents zero regional tolerance and our team members springing from across different regions.\n\nHowever the event drew the team\u2019s attention to notable concerns which could require a plan for a larger event setup. Such cases are quite common but this is unique because cryptocurrency adoption is a future that Fintech can hardly deny, and we see the many opportunities that saccompany its adoption mainstream. Our major concern lies in the need for new subscribers to recognise these opportunities and their use cases.\n\nThe regulatory gap that keeps cryptocurrency and its adoption apart globally, is such that feeds us with much less worries when compared to the level of grounds to be covered in spotlighting the opportunities in the current fintech phase.\n\nNevertheless, Bekonta will continue to make deliberate efforts in this regard through sensitization and sponsorship.\n\nWant to get started on your cryptocurrency journey?

          "text": "The recent hike in food prices has caused many Nigerians to rethink their food consumption pattern. Some have adjusted it according to their budget realities while others have overhauled their diet completely to fit their income.\n\nFood items such as turkey, fish, beef, sausage, milk and other animal protein sources are fast becoming exempted from families\u2019 diets due to the surge in their prices.\n\nA Twitter user expressed his disdain for the current situation and how he copes with it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy how Nigeria\u2019s food inflation simply forces you to forgo some food items and move on with your life. I haven\u2019t bought turkey since it cost N3200 per Kg. I stopped buying sardine when it became N380.\u201d he said.\n\nOthers expressed anxiety they feel each time they go to the markets as the prices of food always exceed their budget.\n\n\u201cInflation has forced me to stop buying noodles, yam, sardines, spaghetti, eggs, etc. The list is endless. Sometimes I am even scared of going to the market.\u201d said a Twitter user @fynest_fine .\n\nThe table below shows the increase in the average food prices according to the National Bureau of statistics.\n\nQuoting the NBS reports on selected food prices, FBN Quest capital, an investment firm, noted that all 43 food items surveyed increased by about 28.8% year on year average. On a month on month basis, the average price increase was 2.5%.\n\nThe popular food franchise Chicken Republic recently added a new combo \u201cEgg star\u201d to its menu. This new combo contains rice or spaghetti, with stew and boiled egg and it is priced at N500. This was a surprise to Nigerians as the franchise is known to be a strictly chicken menu.\n\nRead also: Inflation is biggest risk to overall political stability in Nigeria says EIU\n\nIn 2020 their \u201cRefuel spaghetti with a spicy peppered sauce and delicious chicken\u201d was N500, the same price as the \u201cEgg star\u201d menu in 2022. This menu belongs to the franchise\u2019s everyday affordable meal, which consists of other affordable meals but the \u201cEgg star\u201d is their most affordable. This is so everyone can afford a meal and so they can stay in business.\n\n\u201cInflation is at work here. The business owners have to constantly improvise. Either they increase the price of their commodity or they substitute. Imagine the cost of chicken 2 years ago to what is now obtainable,\u201d @owolabibosun tweeted on the issue.\n\nPeople now cope with the rise in food inflation by either foregoing a particular food item for a cheaper one or skipping a meal a day all to meet their budget.\n\nGlory Fadipe, head of research FCMB during a conversation with BusinessDay said, \u201cMany families skip meals or take lesser portions, they get the cheaper stuff irrespective of quality they just have to break even and there\u2019s nothing that can be done about it.\u201d\n\nShe spoke of how some food items are fast becoming meals consumed only once in a while.\n\n\u201cStaples are now becoming once-in-a-blue-moon things. Chicken, fishes like Titus are now expensive,\u201d Fadipe said.\n\n\u201cEven for the common man staples have become expensive. I do not even buy snails again and I earn so much.\u201d\n\nOne of the causes of the increase in food prices as indicated in the report by FBNQuest is the increase in insecurity in northern Nigerian states where many agricultural produce comes from.\n\nThe report revealed that another major factor is the pass-through effect from imported food prices due to the Russian-Ukraine war which is being felt globally by way of increasing fuel and soft commodity prices. This is likely to be felt more in the coming months if the war persists. Imported food inflation increased by about 8bps to 17.56%.",

These reserves are used to back liabilities and influence monetary policy. They include foreign banknotes, deposits, bonds, treasury bills and other foreign government securities.\n\nNigeria is considering a bond sale targeted at its citizens overseas to raise funds to help Africa\u2019s biggest economy narrow its budget deficit, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nPatience Oniha, director-general of the Debt Management Office, said the Federal Government might sell the debt after it repays $300 million of diaspora bonds maturing in June.\n\n\u201cWe are doing both an analysis of a recent research report on diaspora remittances and reviewing offshore regulations for changes that may be supportive of offering products to retail investors,\u201d Oniha was quoted to have said in a text message on Thursday.\n\nIn March 2022, Nigeria issued $1.25bn Eurobond, which was expected to boost its buffers but the reverse was the case due to low oil production.\n\nNigeria\u2019s gross official reserves declined by $317 million (0.8 percent) month/month to $39.5 billion in March 2022, according to a report by FBNQuest, an investment banking and asset management business of FBN Holdings Plc.\n\nThe drop was the fifth in a row as the reserves have been depleting by roughly $451m on average on a monthly basis since November 2021. The gross reserves are calculated on a 30-day moving average basis.\n\nAt its last meeting in March 2022, the Monetary Policy Committee noted the decrease in the level of gross external reserves to $39.44 billion as of March 17 from $40.21 billion on January 25, indicating a decrease of 1.95 per cent during the review period.\n\n\u201cAlthough an expected boost to the buffer is due from Nigeria\u2019s $1.25 billion Eurobond issue in March 2022, we expect this to be properly reflected in the reserves in coming days,\u201d analysts at FBNQuest had said.\n\nThe external reserves rose to $39.811 billion as of April 21, 2022 from $39.537 billion in April 1, 2022, but declined to $39.64 billion as of April 27, latest data from the CBN showed.\n\nNigeria\u2019s external reserves is estimated to grow to about $40 billion by the end of the year, following the latest Eurobond issuance of $1.25 billion in March 2022, according to a report by the FBNQuest.\n\nNigeria\u2019s need for borrowing has increased following additional spending to help the economy recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. The government expects this year\u2019s deficit will widen by an extra N965 billion ($2.3 billion) to N7.35 trillion naira, amounting to about 4 percent of gross domestic product, according to Bloomberg.",

The statement quoted Akinwumi Adesina, president of the AfDB, to have said this when the secretary of the United States Treasury, Janet Yellen hosted G-7 ministers and heads of multilateral development banks.\n\nAdesina said the bank, which was the premier financier of infrastructure in Africa, had committed more than $44 billion to infrastructure across the continent in the last six years.\n\nRead also: Funds, asset managers should invest in digital infrastructure \u2013 Tizeti CEO\n\n\u201cThe $44 billion was channeled toward developing critical areas like transportation, energy, water, and sanitation on the continent.\n\n\u201cI propose eight solutions to bridge Africa\u2019s infrastructure finance gap, which includes project preparation and mobilising institutional investors.\n\n\u201cOther solutions are improving public financing for infrastructure, mobilising financing for green infrastructure, attracting the private sector, and dealing with risks, among others,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe AfDB chief noted that institutional investors including pension funds, Sovereign Wealth Funds, and insurance companies held enough resources to scale up infrastructure financing from billions to trillions of dollars.\n\nAdesina said that collectively, the institutions with commercial banks held 103 trillion dollars of assets under management.\n\n\u201cThis pool of capital is so vast that what is needed is only 0.03 percent or up to 0.04 percent to bridge the infrastructure financing gap for Africa.\n\n\u201cMultilateral development banks should take early-stage investment risks in the project development phase, he said.\n\nHe called on governments to focus more on attracting the private sector to infrastructure financing.\n\nAccording to him, governments must improve the policy, legal, and regulatory environment to support public-private partnership (PPP) investments in infrastructure.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBarely a week after the Edo State Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Hon Andrew Adaze Emwanta was presented with an Award by his Alma Mata, Annunciation Catholic College, Irrua, ACC, the Law students Government of Benson Idahosa University, LAWSA have presented a congratulatory card to him for his well deserved appointment.\n\nThe President of Benson Idahosa University Law student association, Ansa Joshua who led other members of the executive to the office of the Commissioner in Benin City, said they have come to congratulate him for the appointment which was earned due to his dedication and pragmatic approach to duty.\n\n\u201cWhile we were sworn-in, the faculty informed us that an erstwhile President of the Association was sworn in as a Commissioner in Edo state. We were told of your great works in the faculty which includes the accreditation of the faculty during your tenure.\n\n\u201cWe deem it fit and proper to visit you even though belated and to acquaint you of our activities during our law week and to request that our erstwhile President who is the Commissioner of Communication and Orientation embrace this event as the chairman.\n\nAccording to him, the law week is expected to commence from June 13 to June 17 2022 with inter chamber competitions, other competitions, election, grand dinner and lecture which will be on constitutional law taking into consideration the fact that the 2023 elections is drawing near.\n\nThe Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Hon Andrew Adaze Emwanta Esq. in his response said it was a thing of joy to host the LAWSA Government of Benson Idahosa University because it brings back nostalgic feelings\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt was in this manner we visited dignitaries in and out of government soliciting their support during our law week and for me I have always participated in LAWSA activities from the time I got into BIU.\n\n\u201cI was so committed that little did I know I will become President of LAWSA. We started off as Pioneers and we did not have a constitution which was our first task. When I came in I felt for us to have a system there must be a legal basis for that system to operate.\n\n\u201cThe good thing was that I came in as a direct entry student and there was need to put into work our constitutional knowledge as student of constitutional law. When the time came for election I first indicated interest to run as Vice President.\n\n\u201cI actually won the election but it was rigged because they saw some of us coming in as people who believe in change. We felt Law students should be trained in a manner that they should be able to separate the law and religion.\n\n\u201cWhen we came in, we did not have a good court, a statue of Justice and we fought that there must be a symbol of what the law faculty should be and we were able to garner funds through community development to provide us with that statue of Justice at the time.\n\n\u201cThose were some of the things we did when we were there and eventually I ran for the office of LAWSA President and I won. Before I came on board we had just one democratically elected president and when I came on board I was the second person elected and there after I was elected as the National President of LAWSA for all Private Universities.\n\nHe noted that he would not be sitting as a Commissioner today if he was not a student of BIU because according to him BIU taught him how to see himself as a future leader and the institution also created that professional environment.\n\nIn his words, \u201cthat created a system of playing politics. Even while in LAWSA we were also involve in the National Association of Nigeria Students activities and at some point I was made the liaison Director of zone two.\n\n\u201cIt afforded me the opportunity of mixing with people and that is what I should encourage all of you, try as much as possible to mix with those in other Universities. There are so many benefits you get when you do not limit yourself.\n\n\u201cAs a former LAWSA President, the moment you invite me for an event I am under obligation to attend and that obligation extends to my colleagues who are lawyers. I will assist you in any way you want me to.\u201d\n\nWhile admonishing the law students to take their academics seriously, Hon Emwanta maintained that during his days at BIU, reading was a culture and he took the students down memory lane how he became a Commissioner.\n\n\u201cAs a lecturer at the University of Calabar for over a decade, at some point I said to myself that leadership runs in my vein and I cannot achieve that through lecturing, how can I give back to my state. I had to come back to Edo State.\n\n\u201cFortunately for me I did not go through any godfather, the governor saw competence in me. I made that commitment to represent what is good, what is right and what is just and the Edo 2020 governorship election, you will agree with me was a just cause and it was because I believed in that just cause that I was so rewarded.\n\nAccording to him, none of them cannot achieve what he has achieved but what is required is commitment, first to their academics because nobody just occupy an office from nowhere, there must first be competence.\n\n\u201cThen secondly, the law students must work towards achieving any set target. Any one of you can become the governor of your state, but you must start somewhere, by setting that trajectory,\u201d the Commissioner added.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

That is the reason why we are willing to give the federal government this institution.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe federal government has been helping us through the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND) in developing some of these schools.

Gboyega Oyetola of Osun, within the space of three and half years in office, transcends the excessive seven and half years of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) rule in the state.\n\nAyeni who represents Ijesa South Federal Constituency, said residents of the state could not afford to go back to the era of bad governance where those at the helm of affairs cared much more for their pockets than the welfare of the citizens of the state.\n\nHe stated these on Friday during an Empowerment Programme organised to reduce the menace of unemployment among the youths of his Constituency.\n\nHe noted that Oyetola, within the short period of time, had performed tremendously well despite the meager resources in the state, adding that the governor had brought Osun to the limelight through human and Infrastructural development.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe ruling All Progressives Congress has the blueprint of governance. We cannot compare APC and PDP, the gab is there. During the reign of PDP for seven and half years in Osun State, there was nothing to show for.\n\n\u201cThe achievement of Gov.Gboyega Oyetola within the space of three and half years in office surpassed the wasteful years of the PDP in the state and that is why we are campaigning for the reelection of Oyetola for the continuity of the good work.\u201d\n\nReacting to the comment of the PDP governorship candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke during his visit to Owa palace over the decision of Governor Gboyega Oyetola to update the Ilesa College of education to a full-fledged university, Ayeni said \u201cIjesaland is too sophisticated, educated and well informed to be cajoled, misinformed or misled by an individual without requisite experience, capacity and capability to lead over four million residents and citizens of Osun.\u201d\n\nAyeni, who described Oyetola as a listening and promise kept governor, said men and women, both old and young in Ijesaland have resolved to vote for the continuity of Gboyega Oyetola in office as Governor at the July 16th election.\n\n\u201cOur land have produced great men and women who are very successful in different life endeavours. It is no gain saying that we have produced the highest number of vice chancellors, albeit professors in Nigeria universities.\n\n\u201cSo, how will a land filled with such personalities be ambushed? Our people are progressive minded and enlightened, and they have resolved to vote for the continuity of the administration of Gov. Gboyega Oyetola, for him to successfully pilot the state into an industrial state of economic self sufficiency which he has kick started already,\u201d he said\n\nHe said it is on record that Oyetola has elevated our status in Ilesa to a university land with his proclamation and backed up \u2013 actions that have restored the confidence of Ijesa people, both home and abroad.\n\n\u201cThe governor has been prioritizing the welfare of civil servants and pensioners by prompt payment of salaries despite the paucity of funds.\n\n\u201cHe has reformed the educational system, improved the health indices of Osun by revitalizing every primary Healthcare centres in each of the wards in Osun.\n\n\u201cIjesaland now has the first ever gold refinery plant through the boardroom ingenuity of Oyetola which has provided jobs for our people.\n\n\u201cThe burnt Atakumosa market in Ilesa is wearing a new look. Oyetola deserves a second term to consolidate on all the foundation he has laid, we cannot afford to change a winning, competent, visionary leader like Oyetola.\u201d he ssid\n\nAyeni, however, urged the over 100 beneficiaries of his empowerment programme to make judicious use of the cash and equipments given to them.\n\nSome of the beneficiaries of the Empowerment Programme appreciated the kind gesture of the Lawmaker, urging other Political office holders to emulate him.",

I have a way to attract people here who would invest in Osun. People who would invest in agriculture and mining,\u201d he said.\n\nOgunbiyi assured pensioners of total commitment to their welfare if voted, noting that that misplaced priority by the current administration made it difficult for them to adequately cater for the well-being of the old citizens who toil day and night to see to the growth of the state.\n\nHe said, full concentration would be on agriculture and mining to make the state food basket if not for the nation but the Southwestern region and that he would structure the mining so it can\u2019 get the 13 1/2 derivation for the state.\n\n\u201cToday it\u2019s money that\u2019s being thrown around, that\u2019s being encouraged by the government. But when we get there, we will structure it, to the extent that the entire world will know how much is being produced, so we can lay a claim to that derivation from the Federal Government, and Federal Government in turn, will keep up a plain sheet, so when we create avenues for us to generate income, there will be an opportunity to pay the workers. The arrears and whatever it is,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his speech earlier, the Executive Secretary and Chairman of the union, Comrade Dele Aina and Alhaji Ganiyu Salawu implored the governorship hopeful to priotize payment of gratuities and other emoluments of the members of the union who were unable to cater for their health due to their entitlements not being paid by the government.\n\nComrade Aina who tabled the requests of the union before the Accord Party governorship candidate urged him to take a critical look at the requests and give it necessary consideration if voted in.\n\nAina who applauded the governorship hopeful for the step taken to meet the union said, he would be the first governorship candidate to visit the union ahead of July 16th election in the state.\n\nThe meeting was witnessed by representatives of different groups within the Osun NUP",

It also has a contactless way of making payments unlike the normal ATM cards.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the readiness of Nigerians to embrace the new technology, Ayoola stated that Nigerians are the largest mobile users in Africa.\n\n\u201cWe are already digitizing alot of our platforms.

In other words, the Constitution will not allow anyone to be in office for more than a cumulative period of 8 years.\n\n\u201cIt is not in dispute that Dr. Jonathan became the President of Nigeria in 2010 following the sudden death of President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua. He later contested and won the 2011 presidential election. Having spent 5 years in office as President, Dr. Jonathan is disqualified from contesting the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe reason is that if he wins the election, he will spend an additional term of 4 years. It means that he would spend a cumulative period of 9 years as President of Nigeria in utter breach of Section 137 of the Constitution which provides for a maximum two terms of 8 years.\u201d\n\nOzekhome, also a rights activist like Falana, has now argued that Jonathan is qualified and cannot be stopped by Section 137 (3) of the Constitution.\n\nRead his essay titled Goodluck Jonathan Is Eminently & Constitutionally Qualified",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday gave the assurance that the Federal Government would continue to vigorously pursue the repatriation of looted Nigeria\u2019s artefacts from abroad, including 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums.\n\nThe President gave the assurance while receiving the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, accompanied by members of the Royal Court of Benin and the Board of Trustees of the Benin Royal Museum at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nHis Royal Majesty was at State House to thank the President on the recent return of two important Benin bronzes to its original place of abode by the University of Cambridge and the University of Aberdeen, both in the United Kingdom, after 125 years.\n\nSpeaking on the return of the artefacts, President Buhari expressed delight that it has brought immense goodwill to Nigeria, the ancient Benin Kingdom as well as happiness to the Oba of Benin.\n\nThe President noted that while it is widely acknowledged around the world that some of the best ancient arts belong to Nigeria, including those from Benin, Ife, Nok and Igbo-Ukwu, many of these beautiful works were illicitly taken away, particularly during the colonial period.\n\nAffirming that these great cultural and artistic works are records of history, President Buhari vowed that Nigeria cannot permit these great works to become properties of others, adding that this administration has made it an important task to ensure the return of the artefacts.\n\nHe therefore, assured the first-class traditional ruler that the Federal Government will continue in this great cause with his support and that of other traditional rulers.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn furtherance to these efforts, an agreement between Nigeria and Germany is currently being prepared. When concluded, it will signify the return to Nigeria by Germany of all the 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums. This will be a monumental achievement.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, on the 7th of this month, the Glasgow City Council agreed to return 17 Benin bronzes to Nigeria. The legal issues are in the process of being sorted out.\n\n\u201cOther success stories include the return by the Netherlands in October 2020 of a 600-year-old Ife Terracotta; the return in April 2021 of a bronze piece from Mexico; as well as the repatriation, in November 2021, of two Benin Bronzes and an Ife Bronze head from the Metropolitan Museum, New York,\u201d the President said.\n\nPresident Buhari announced that because of the determined efforts of this administration, Nigeria is now regarded to be in the forefront globally in the struggle to repatriate illicitly-exported artefacts back to their countries of origin.\n\nThe Oba of Benin informed the President that his Royal Court has concluded plans with the NCMM to establish an ultramodern international standard Benin Royal Museum to house the Benin Bronzes and other artefacts for the purpose of preserving history, tourism and education.\n\n\u201cWe want to reassure Mr President that the Royal Court of Benin and NCMM are working closely to ensure safe custody, preservation and enhancement of these Benin bronzes and artefacts not only for their cultural and economic benefits, but more importantly towards the promotion of the tourism industry in Nigeria,\u201d he said",

          "text": "\u2026APC\u2019ll win Ekiti governorship poll, he boasts \u2026Assures of free, fair primaries\n\nThe chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has said the governing party was yet to zone its presidential ticket for the 2023 elections.\n\nSenator Adamu stated this Friday in Abuja while speaking to State House Correspondents after presenting the party\u2019s candidate for the Ekiti state governorship election, Biodun Oyebanji, to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nBlueprint reports that Senator Adamu was accompanied to the Presidential Villa by the Ekiti state governor and chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), Dr. Kayode Fayemi; Kebbi state governor and chairman of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Atiku Bagudu, and the national secretary of the party, Senator Iyiola Omisore.\n\nWhen asked where the governing would be zoning its presidential ticket to, Adamu said taking such a decision would be the job of the entire party which, according to him, is bigger than himself as chairman.\n\n\u201cI am today privileged to be the chairman of the party. The party is greater than me. The party has not made a decision and I cannot preempt what the party decision will be,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Northern Elders\u2019 Forum (NEF) had, on Thursday, asked major political parties to throw the contest for their presidential tickets open to all regions, asserting that the zoning system is no longer desirable.\n\nThe ruling party had swapped its national offices between North and South, leading to the emergence of Adamu from the North Central as the national chairman.\n\nResignation of appointees\n\nOn the intense issue of when political appointees who intend to run for elective offices were expected to resign their current appointments, considering the party\u2019s recently issued guidelines for those in that category, the party\u2019s national chair merely noted that the matter was already in court.\n\n\u201cThank you very much for your question. Our luck on this end is that I happen to be a lawyer and the issue you are raising is in court right now. So, it will be subjudice for me to discuss it at all,\u201d he said.\n\nNomination, EoI forms\n\nWhen asked about the high cost of the party\u2019s nomination and expression of interest forms, he said the party had no regrets setting the prices at the current rate.\n\nHe cited the need to protect the party from non-serious aspirants and moles as well as the need to generate money to run the election processes.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been listening, with rapt attention, to the hues and cries from our lovers and from our adversaries. We have no regrets whatsoever. We did some homework, we know what it takes to go through primaries, go through presidential campaign, and go through election for the President. We know what it takes.\n\n\u201cWe also do know that there are citizens who are qualified to contest, but who are not serious contenders, who will just want to take anything cheap by the roadside, and assert what they call their rights and create problems for our party.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also aware that some parties that have no chance whatsoever to win presidential election in Nigeria; they will sponsor people into parties that have prospects for winning the election, to create problems for us, to divert our attention, whichever party is involved in that.\n\n\u201cOver and above that, yes, we are the ruling party. Yes, we need to set examples in what we do, but I ask you, I don\u2019t know which part of the country you come from, If God forbid, your traditional ruler dies today, contestants to that office will go for more than N100 million; it\u2019s no news.\n\n\u201cWhen I contested for the Senate, all I paid was just a token; N5 million, N10 million, including the expression. When my colleague wanted to be chairman of the party, in the days of Adams Oshimhole, it took him N500, 000. Today, for me, just as an example, to contest the national chairman of our party, I had to pay N20 million to contest.\n\n\u201cAlright, and even the enormity of work that has to be done, and this work will be done with money. We don\u2019t want to continue going a begging.\n\n\u201cSo, I want to say that we\u2019re able to mobilise sufficient funds to support our efforts to win election. Some protests may be well founded, I have no quarrel with that, but the propensity of this, that people just assume \u2018it\u2019s the ruling party,\u2019 is a quick\u2026 in our democracy.\n\n\u201cI will not quarrel with that; everyone of us has the right to express himself, and I\u2019m in full support of these obligations, but we wear the shoes for our party and we know where they pinch us the most one.\u201d\n\nPossible fracas\n\nAllaying the fears that the process of settling for a presidential candidate could tear the party apart, if not carefully handled, Adamu said: \u201cGod will not allow that to happen to us. We will come out by the grace of God.

          "text": "Ahead of next year\u2019s general elections, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has described himself as the most qualified of all the 17 aspirants vying for the 2023 presidential ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nHe also told the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) that he deserved the right of first refusal, given his experience and competence.\n\nBut the NWC replied it would work for all the seventeen aspirants and not him alone, urging the former VP and others in the race to sell themselves to the delegates.\n\nA similar response was given to Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike who asked the NWC to pay him for his support and role in ensuring their emergence, and also provide level playing field for all aspirants.\n\nAnd in his response, the PDP national chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, told the governor to settle for either of the two options, saying he cannot have the two all to himself alone.\n\nThe aspirants\n\nApart from Atiku and Wike, the rest presidential aspirants seeking the party\u2019s ticket at the National Convention slated for 28 and 29 May are: former Senate President Bukola Saraki; former Anambra Governor Peter Obi and Sokoto Governor Aminu Tambuwal.\n\nAlso included are former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Anyim Pius Anyim; Bauchi state Governor Bala Mohammed and Akwa Ibom state Governor Udom Emmanuel.\n\nOthers are renowned industrialist, Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa; Mohammed Hayatu-Deen; a United States-based medical doctor, Nwachukwu Anakwenze, Ovation Magazine publisher, Dele Momodu, former Ekiti state Governor Ayo Fayose; Cosmos Ndukwe, Mr Charles Ugwu, Chikwendu Kalu and Tariele Diana Oliver.\n\nAtiku visits NWC\n\nSpeaking Thursday during his visit to the National Working Committee (NWC) members of the party in Abuja, the 2019 presidential candidate of the PDP also said with the 11 million votes he garnered in the last election, he deserved the right of first refusal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to tell you what I am, what qualifications I have, what experience I have, and what I can do for this party, for this country,\u201d he told the party leaders.\n\nThe Waziri Adamawa pledged that if elected, he would reunite the country, deal decisively with security issues and revamp the economy.\n\n\u201cMr Chairman and members of the National Working Committee, I\u2019m really not here to lecture you, I\u2019m just really here to inform you of my decision to run again, and also to urge you to provide the right kind of leadership so that the best candidate can emerge.\n\n\u201cAnd I dare say Mr Chairman, I am the best candidate. Under normal circumstances Mr Chairman, this is a guy who has already 11 million votes in his kitty. And I think, as a party, you should give me the right of first refusal but we are in a democracy.\n\n\u201cAll I can urge you is to make sure that the way you have started, you also conclude the way you have started by being very fair, very credible, giving every contestant the opportunity to face the electorate,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the performance of the incumbent administration of the All Progressives Congress (APC) led by President Muhammadu Buhari, Atiku said, \u201cevery Nigeria knows that the APC has failed but we should not take Nigerians for granted.\n\n\u201cWe should go all out to let them know APC has failed, it will continue to fail. No matter what gap they have come or they appear to be, they will continue to fail and PDP has not failed on your comparative analysis. If you compare the achievements of PDP and the failure of APC, you know that you have no other choice than PDP,\u201d he stated.\n\nAyu\n\nIn his reaction, the PDP national chairman, Senator Ayu, said he won\u2019t work for Atiku alone, but all the 17 aspirants.\n\n\u201cMr Vice President, I will not work for you as an aspirant. I will work for all the 17 aspirants. It is left to you to convince the delegates of our party that you are the best. You have to market yourself, you have to work hard,\u201d Ayu said.\n\nAyu, who assured that the NWC would not take side with any particular aspirant, urged all aspirants to convince the delegates and market themselves.\n\nThe PDP boss said: \u201cLet me take time to explain to Nigerians that the party has its internal mechanisms of selecting a candidate, whether by consensus or by-election, we will do it transparently.\n\n\u201cThose who love our party more than us should please tarry a little, they should not select candidates for the People\u2019s Democratic Party. They don\u2019t have our mandate and we will not concede that mandate to anybody, young or an elder who chooses by himself to choose a candidate for us.\n\n\u201cOur internal processes will go ahead and we are going ahead with it. At the end of the day, we\u2019ll come up with a candidate chosen by the members of the People\u2019s Democratic Party themselves. It is that candidate that will present to the rest of Nigeria for the forthcoming elections\u201d.\n\nScreening\n\nMeanwhile, there is palpable tension over the screening of the 17 PDP presidential aspirants as the David Mark-led committee meets today (Friday) to evaluate the contestants.\n\nAccording to the schedule of activities released by the National Organising Secretary, Hon. Umar Bature, the national convention is slated for May 28 and 29.\n\nThe screening exercise holds at Legacy House, Abuja, the party\u2019s presidential campaign headquarters.\n\nBlueprint reports that PDP Deputy National Publicity Secretary Ibrahim Abdullahi, who stood in for the national chairman at a function in Abuja recently, had hinted that the party would throw its 2023 presidential ticket open.\n\nHe had said: \u201cWell, for the opportunity that are available, and to provide equal opportunity for Nigerians to bid for the available political offices, those who are interested in pursuing for the presidency, we are opening it for every Nigerians to pursue. What it implies as we speak, every Nigerian is bidding from the south-east, from the south-west, and from the north, no section of Nigeria is denied an opportunity to contest or aspire.\u201d\n\nAnd further to this, the party\u2019s national chairman, last month, said the PDP has a history of rotating offices among various components making up Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo, PDP has a history of rotating our offices. Anybody who doesn\u2019t get it this time should wait after the tenure of whoever will be our next President,\u201d Ayu had said.\n\nOrtom committee\n\nConsequently, the PDP National Executive Committee (NEC) swiftly inaugurated a 37- man zoning committee led by Benue state Governor Samuel Ortom on the 24th of March, 2022.\n\nThe committee was to recommend to the party whether zoning would help it return to power at the centre in 2023 or not, and that which part of the country to zone the presidency to.\n\nAfter 3 consecutive meetings and upon submitting its report 2 weeks ago, controversy continues to trail the committee\u2019s recommendation that the committee recommended that the 2023 ticket be thrown open.\n\nBut Governor Ortom debunked the report, saying their position would be made known by the party\u2019s NEC which gave them the assignment.\n\nConsensus\n\nAnd in their separate but collective efforts, the quartet of Tambuwal, Bala, Saraki and Hayatu-Deen, had traversed the length and breadth of the country championing the consensus arrangement.\n\nHowever, the arrangement collapsed when the duo of Bala and Saraki from the north-east and north-central respectively, were announced by a committee of northern leaders as presidential aspirants within the party.\n\nAs this continues to generate acrimony among the 4 aspirants and other aspirants from the north, many stakeholders have expressed fear that the party\u2019s position on zoning could negatively impact its performance in the general elections.\n\nTension\n\nThe struggle for the ticket is generating tension among party stakeholders, some of whom warned that zoning it to the North would be an injustice against the South and that this would come with some consequences.\n\nAlso, others cautioned that zoning the presidency to the South cannot help the party bounce back to its winning ways in 2023.\n\nPolitical pundits observed that tension is high in the party because whatever decision the party took can make or mar its chances in the forthcoming 2023 election.\n\nOthers also warned that if not well managed, it might lead to an implosion within the PDP.\n\nThe duo of Anyim and former PDP Deputy National Chairman, Chief Olabode George, had warned that any attempt to jettison the zoning arrangement would affect the party\u2019s chances in 2023.\n\nWhile Saraki insisted that it\u2019s the turn of the North Central to produce the next president, Tambuwal said zoning to the South won\u2019t guarantee the PDP victory in the election.\n\nWe\u2018re up to the task \u2013 Ologunagba\n\nIn an interview with Blueprint, PDP National Publicity Secretary Debo Ologunagba dismissed the view that zoning and the contest for the party\u2019s ticket by the 17 aspirants may drag the party into an internal crisis.\n\nOn the party\u2019s position on zoning, he said, the party would make this known at the right time.\n\nThe PDP publicity scribe also assured that the national convention and congresses to elect the party\u2019s candidates for all positions would be free, fair, credible and transparent.\n\nHe said:\u201dPeople are in a hurry and concerned about our party\u2019s position on zoning because the PDP is the hope of Nigerians, the PDP will rescue and rebuild the country. Our position on zoning will be made known through the NEC at the right time.\n\n\u201cThe number of aspirants won\u2019t lead the party into any internal crisis during or even after the national convention. In any case, the PDP has an internal conflict resolution mechanism capable of resolving any issue.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we will ensure the party\u2019s national convention and even congress at all levels to elect party\u2019s candidate for all position is free, fair and credible.\u201d\n\n\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "\u2026Gross profit hits N48.8bn, rising by 122.3%\n\nBy Onu Okorie\n\nSeplat Energy Plc, a leading Nigerian independent energy company listed on both the Nigerian Exchange Limited and the London Stock Exchange, announces its unaudited results for the three months ended 31 March 2022, recording a rise in profit before tax by 197.8 per cent to N34.7bn from N10.6bn year-on-year. The company also generated cash from its operations to the tune of N74.4bn from N1.7bn year-on-year, rising by 197.8 per cent.\n\nThe energy Company\u2019s also grew its revenue by 58.6 per cent to N100.6bn from N57.9bn year-on-year; as its gross profit soars to N48.8bn from N20.1bn year-on-year, rising by 122.3 per cent.\n\nIn its operations, Seplat Energy demonstrated a strong safety record, which extended to 26.1 million hours without LTI from operated assets (2.0 million hours in Q1 2022).\n\nCommenting on the results, Mr. Roger Brown, Chief Executive Officer, Seplat Energy Plc, said:\n\n\u201cSeplat Energy delivered a good quarter that benefited from higher oil pricing, which offset lower production owing to continuing problems with the Trans Forcados Pipeline. However, the alternative Amukpe-Escravos Pipeline is mechanically complete and once we have signed the commercial agreements, we expect Chevron to be lifting our oil through the Escravos Terminal in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cOur proposed acquisition of MPNU remains on course. We are awaiting the necessary approvals from government and regulators and expect the transaction to complete in the second half of this year. The effective date of 1 January 2021 means we will benefit from higher recent oil prices and as we have previously reported, the addition of MPNU will nearly treble our production and double our reserves on a pro forma 2020 basis. The acquisition will reinforce our leadership of Nigeria\u2019s indigenous energy sector and enabling us to generate strong future cash flows that will underpin our investment in Nigeria\u2019s energy transition and improve our overall stakeholder returns. It will also bring a significant undeveloped gas resource base which, alongside our ANOH gas project development, will underpin Nigeria\u2019s energy transition and drive domestic and export revenues when developed.\n\n\u201cWe announce the decision to divest the Group\u2019s interest in the Ubima marginal field for a consideration of $55million, which marginally reduces the company\u2019s 2P reserves by 2 MMboe to 455 MMboe.\n\n\u201cWe have proven we have the financial strength and credibility to attract international finance into Nigeria\u2019s energy sector and this will help us in our aim to deliver energy transition and provide cleaner, more reliable and more affordable energy for Nigeria\u2019s young and growing population.\u201d",

Simbi Kesiye Wabote has said on Wednesday that women entrepreneurs in the Nigerian oil and gas industry should break barriers by taking advantage of the $40m fund created specifically for them under the Nigerian Content Intervention Fund, NCI Fund.\n\nWabote spoke at the annual general meeting of the Oil and Gas Trainers\u2019 Association of Nigeria, OGTAN, held in Abuja with the theme \u201cDiversity & Inclusiveness in Human Capital development for the Energy Sector.\u201d\n\nNoting that that unavailability of funds was one of the key challenges that often hinder the participation of women in the oil and gas activities, the Executive Secretary stated that the Board had addressed the issue through the NCI Fund.\n\n\u201cTo provide a fair chance for women in the oil and gas industry, the Board partnered with the NEXIM Bank to establish a $20 million fund that was matched with an additional $20 million fund by NEXIM bank, making the total pool of funds available to women in oil and gas to be $40 million,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that the Board and its partners have introduced and implemented several initiatives that promote diversity in the oil and gas industry.\n\nSome of those gender-focused interventions were being implemented in partnership with the Bank of Industry, BoI, while others were facilitated by the Nigerian Export-Import Bank, he added.\n\nAccording to the Executive Secretary, another step taken by the Board to drive diversity in oil and gas activities was the setting up of the Diversity Sectorial Group in the Nigerian Content Consultative Forum, NCCF.\n\nHe added that \u201cthe Board has also organized events that were targeted at women and community activities to promote inclusiveness.\n\nHe mentioned that NCDMB\u2019s efforts to lead the womenfolk into the mainstream of the Nigerian oil and gas industry was recognized at the 5th Nigerian International Energy Summit this year when the agency was bestowed with an award of the \u201cBest Gender Support Company in the Energy Space\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on Human Capacity Development, the NCDMB boss explained that it adds significant value to the energy sector, and contributes to developing local content in the energy sector.\n\nHe also confirmed that the Board\u2019s Human Capacity Development model has no gender bias as it was inclusive and provides equal opportunities to all applicants and beneficiaries.\n\nHe hinted that NCDMB had put in place the 60-20-20 training model in which 60 percent of the training resources provided by the Board and the industry are devoted to providing young Nigerians with specialized skills they need to secure employment.\n\nHe stated that \u201cunder this component of the model, beneficiaries are provided with qualitative skills and international certifications that will position them for employment within and outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe also informed that 20 percent of the training spend was geared towards improvement in the productivity of already employed personnel while another 20 percent of spend on training is used for trainings on soft skills.\n\nThe Executive Secretary assured that the Board will continue to develop female members of staff to occupy key positions in preparation for higher leadership roles as well as continue to promote Human Capacity Development across various spheres of the energy sector, including skill development and entrepreneurship programs and STEM development across secondary and tertiary institutions to prepare youths for the future.",

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nTHE Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja in Appeal No. CA/ABJ/CV/269/2022 in the case between the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) vs Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim has ruled that all proceedings including the contempt proceedings initiated by Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim and co at the trial court should be stayed pending the hearing, and determination of the substantive appeal.\n\nThe application for stay was argued on behalf of AMCON by their defence counsel A.U. Mustapha SAN & Co on March 30, 2022, and after listening to the arguments, the Court of Appeal delivered its ruling on Friday April 22, 2022. With that ruling, Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim and Co have been again neutralized from executing the said contempt proceedings order, which he obtained under questionable circumstances.\n\nRecall that Jimoh Ibrahim, NICON Investment Limited, NICON Insurance Limited, Nigerian Reinsurance Corporation owe the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) a whopping N69.4billion with no intention whatsoever to pay. AMCON over the years had tried all reasonable and peaceful resolution strategies to recover the debt from Jimoh Ibrahim to no avail.\n\nAs a responsible debt recovery agency of the Federal Government of Nigeria, AMCON approached the Federal High Court (FHC) in Suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/760/2021 to seek justice, and accordingly received an order of the trial court to take over the businesses of Jimoh Ibrahim. AMCON further received the backing of the trial court to appoint a Receiver/Manager to oversee the businesses on behalf of AMCON.\n\nFollowing the trial court\u2019s ruling, Jimoh Ibrahim, claimed that he was directed by the court on March 9, 2022, to commence contempt proceedings against the Executive Management of AMCON, which led AMCON to challenge the said ruling by filling Notice of Appeal before the Court of Appeal on March 14, 2022.\n\nThe matter between Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim and AMCON has been interminable since the loan was purchased by the government debt recovery agency during the first phase of Eligible Bank Assets (EBA) purchases from Union Bank in the early days of AMCON. AMCON is however not deterred to recover the outstanding N69.4billion debt owed it by Barrister Ibrahim and his companies in the interest of the Nigerian economy and the public in general.",

          "text": "By Asuelimen Osasuyi\n\nNigerian Communications Commission, NCC, has commenced the process of conducting a study to assess the current level of competition in the colocation and infrastructure sharing, CIS, segment of the Nigerian telecommunications sector.\n\nAccording to NCC, seventy-eight licensees are currently operating in that market segment.\n\nThe study is to enable the Commission to have insightful and evidenced-based facts to glean the dynamics at play and ensure the continuous growth of the CIS segment of the telecom market.\n\nThe NCC takes this issue as priority in view of the critical role played by the colocation and infrastructure sharing segment of the telecom ecosystem in ensuring robust services.\n\nAlready, the Commission has engaged the services of Messrs. Price Waterhouse Cooper, PwC, one of the world\u2019s reputable consulting firms, to conduct the study on its behalf, in exercise of NCC\u2019s regulatory functions as provided in the Nigerian Communications Act, NCA, 2003. The study is expected to be concluded between April and July, 2022.\n\nSpeaking at the NCC\u2019s stakeholders\u2019 forum recently organised in Lagos on the commencement of the study, the Director, Policy, Competition and Economy Analysis, PCEA, at NCC, Yetunde Akinloye, who represented the Executive Vice Chairman of the Commission, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, said the forum was hosted to intimate operators in the CIS segment of the telecom market on the study and to secure their buy-in and cooperation with the consultants undertaking the study.\n\nAkinloye reasoned that, in line with its mandate of creating an enabling environment for competition among operators in the industry as well as ensuring the provision of qualitative and efficient telecommunications services, the NCC periodically conducts studies to assess the level of competition in the industry.\n\n\u201cHaving successfully conducted competition assessment studies in 2005, 2010 and 2013, the Commission had issued determinations based on the findings of the studies while outcome of such studies has also enabled the Commission to come up with various regulatory interventions and initiatives to continuously provide a level-playing field for the interplay of market forces. These procedures are emplaced by the Commission to ensure fair, efficient and sustainable competition in the Nigerian telecom industry.\u201d\n\nDespite the measurable progress made by the Commission, Akinloye stated that, since the successful completion of the 2013 study, there had been significant development and activities in some market segments of the industry that had necessitated the conduct of another competition study.\n\nFor instance, at the time the 2013 study was conducted, the CIS market segment was still at embryonic stage and as such, much emphasis was not placed on it. However, \u201cThe CIS segment has recorded significant growth and transformation over the years having about 80 licensees, operating in the segment while its performance and activities continue to impact significantly on other segments of the Nigerian industry. The Director PCEA also informed that activities in the CIS market have also attained the targets set out in the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (2020-2025)\u201d.\n\nAkinloye further declared that the overarching objective of the study is to provide current insights into the level of competition in the CIS market segment and articulate strategies to enhance opportunities in the market, as well as ensure the deepening of competition which will ultimately support the provision of innovative services for the benefits of both market players and the consumers at large.\n\n\u201cTherefore, in line with NCC\u2019s participatory approach to regulation, this initial stakeholders forum has been convened to formally introduce the project and the appointed consultants to the industry\u201d. Akinloye informed participants and asserted that the forum provides opportunities for stakeholders to gain an understanding into the objective, scope and methodology of the study, as well as to ensure that questionnaire or Request for Information (RFI) developed by the consultants to access the level of competition in the market are well understood.\n\nThus, Akinloye rallied the stakeholders to see the forum as an opportunity \u201cto seek and receive clarification based on presentation delivered by the consultant and to make comments on issues relating to the study. She urged all participants to \u201ccommit to the objectives of the study, by providing complete, timely feedback to questionnaires.\u201d\n\nDirector, Technical Standards and Network Integrity at NCC, Bako Wakil, also joined Akinloye in seeking the full cooperation of licensees in the CIS segment of the telecom market whenever they are approached by the consultants for relevant information either through the instrumentality of the RFI or through one-on-one sessions with consultants in the course of the implementation of the study.\n\nAccording to Wakil, the study is in the interest of the CIS licensees, other players and the consumers. It will also provide the Commission with useful and evidenced-based insights necessary to ensure healthy competition and a level-playing ground in the CIS segment and ensure sustainability in the growth of the telecommunication industry.\n\n\u201cAlso, rest assured of the confidentiality of any information provided to the Commission in the course of this study, no matter how sensitive,\u201d Bako said to the enthusiastic audience.\n\nEarlier in her presentation to telecom stakeholders at the event, Partner at PwC, Mary Iwelumo, amplified the voice of the Commission on the objectives of the study and urged them to cooperate with the firm in providing accurate, timely and adequate responses to the RFI or the questionnaire that would be administered. This will ensure that appropriate information are to obtained to address the challenges in the sector.",

          "text": "Human Rights lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Mike Ozekhome has said that former President Goodluck Jonathan, is constitutionally qualified to run for president.\n\nWhile Jonathan has not declared any intention to run, there have been speculations of his plan to join the race for the top job.\n\nQuoting portions of the Constitution, Ozekhome stated on Friday that if the former president decides to join the race, he is constitutionally permitted to do so.\n\nRead Also: VIDEO: Why Jonathan Can\u2019t Run For Presidency \u2013 Falana\n\nSee full statement below.\n\nBY CHIEF MIKE OZEKHOME, SAN, OFR, FCIARB, LL.M, Ph.D, LL.D.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nNigeria is a country of one major news item per day. At times, one scandal per day. The hot issue in the polity currently generating national ruckus, hoopla and bedlam is the presumed intention of Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan to run for the 2023 presidency. I have carefully read the many arguments of those (I call them antagonists) who believe that Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan is disqualified from contesting the 2023 presidential election. According to them, he had already done two terms of 4 years each and will thus be ineligible to contest for a third term. They cite the Fourth Alteration (No 16) Act, which was signed into an Act by President Muhammadu Buhari on the 11th of June, 2018. The section they are relying on is section 137(3) of the said Fourth Alteration to the 1999 Constitution, which provides that \u201ca person who was sworn in to complete the term for which another person was elected as president shall not be elected to such office for more than a single term\u201d.\n\nTHE ANTAGONISTS ARE DEAD WRONG IN THEIR LEGAL POSTULATIONS\n\nThe truth of the matter is that the antagonists of Jonathan running in 2022, in their strange line of argument, are mainly relying on the above section 137(3). They have probably not adverted their minds to the provisions of sections 141 of the Electoral Act, 2010, as amended; and section 285(13) of the same Fourth Alteration to the 1999 Constitution, as amended, the very Alteration they are relying on. More revealing is that these antagonists are probably not aware of an extant and subsisting Court of Appeal decision where Jonathan was frontallly confronted and challenged before the 2015 presidential election, with the same ground of being ineligible to contest the said 2015 election, having allegedly been elected for two previous terms of office. The very section 137(3) being relied upon by the antagonists, was signed into law in 2018, three years after Jonathan had left office; and 7 years after he took the oath of President upon Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s demise. Can Jonathan be caught in the web of section 137(3) retrospectively? We shall see that anon.\n\nThe case of Jonathan running had been challenged in CYRIACUS NJOKU V GOODLUCK EBELE JONATHAN (2015) LPELR-244496 (CA). In that case, the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division, held that President Goodluck Jonathan had only taken the oath of office once and therefore upheld his eligibility to contest the then Nigeria\u2019s presidential election slated for March 28, 2015.\n\nThe intermediate court held that the oath of office President Jonathan took in 2010 was merely to complete the \u201cunexpired tenure\u201d of late President Umar Yar\u2019Adua, who had died while in office as President.\n\nThe appeal had been lodged before the court by one Cyriacus Njoku, who had challenged the ruling of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, which on March 1, 2013, had dismissed the suit he filed to stop President Jonathan from contesting the 2015 polls.\n\nIn the lead judgement delivered by Justice Abubakar Yahaya, the full panel of the court unanimously held that President Jonathan had only spent one term in office as President, going by the provisions of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nRecall that the then Vice President Jonathan had been empowered as Acting President on February 9, 2010, following a motion for operation of the \u201cdoctrine of necessity\u201d, by the Senate, owing to the protracted stay of late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua in Saudi Arabia on medical grounds.\n\nWhen President Yar\u2019Adua eventually died on May 5, 2010, Jonathan was sworn in as president to serve the unexpired residue of office of Yar\u2019Adua. Jonathan was later elected President in 2011 for the first time, on his own merit, after he contested the election.\n\nMr. Njoku had contended in his suit that Jonathan had already taken the oath of office and allegiance twice and therefore, should be disqualified from contesting the 2015 election, as any victory he secured would amount to being sworn in thrice.\n\nHowever, the Court of Appeal held that the oath that Jonathan took in 2010 was merely to complete the unexpired tenure of late Yar\u2019 Adua; adding that by virtue of Section 135 (2)(b) of the 1999 Constitution, Jonathan only took his first oath in May, 2011; and not May 5, 2010, when he succeeded late Yar\u2019 Adua. The Court of Appeal further held that disqualification is through election, not oath-taking.\n\nThe intermediate court\u2019s luminous judgement read in part:\n\n\u201cIn this appeal, it is not controverted by the appellant that the first oath taken by the first defendant (Jonathan) was the oath he took as the Vice President and not as President\u2026 But he took the oath in May 2010 to complete unexpired tenure of late Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua. Section 37(1)(b) disqualifies a person from contesting for president if he had been elected twice. Disqualification is through election and not oath taking. Election is a process of choosing a person to occupy a position by voting. When election is given its literal meaning, it connotes when a voting is employed to choose a person for political office. This did not take place when Jonathan stepped into the shoes of his Principal who went to the great beyond. To say these things were done is to import words not used by the constitution.\u200e Section 146(1) of the constitution cannot be deemed an election for a VP to step into the office of a President. Election involves conducting primaries by party, nomination, election and announcement of results. All these processes were not done. If a VP succeeds a President that dies, that cannot be challenged. It is a mode of stepping into the vacant office provided for by the constitution. When a President dies, the Vice President automatically becomes President as provided for by S130 (1)(2) of the 1999 constitution\u2026 It was not election that produced the first respondent in May 2010, the oath he took then was not an oath of elected President as provided for by Section 180 of the constitution. The process of election was followed in 2011. The oath of office taken in 2011 was the first oath taken by the first respondent as an elected President having fulfilled all the process of election.\u2026 Again, the succession of a Vice-President to the office of a President who died, in accordance with Section 146(1) of the 1999 Constitution, cannot be \u201cdeemed an election\u201d, especially for the purpose of taking away a right that has been vested. As stated earlier, an election under the 1999 Constitution involves primaries, nominations, voting and declaration of results. That is the mode prescribed in electing a President, and once it is so prescribed, it must be followed, and no other method can be employed. All these processes can be challenged in a Court of law and if successful, the election would be annulled. But if a Vice-President succeeds a President who died, that cannot be challenged because it is a Constitutional provision, and the succession cannot be annulled. It is a mode of assumption to the office of the demised President, an \u2018appointment\u2019 by the Constitution, as it were, as no letter of appointment is necessary from anybody. The Vice-President automatically becomes the President, by virtue of his being the Vice-President. An example can be found in Section 130(1) and (2) of the 1999 Constitution.\u201d Per ABUBAKAR DATTI YAHAYA, JCA (Pp 40 \u2013 41 Paras E \u2013 D)\n\nThe Court of Appeal further upheld the decision of the lower court which had dismissed Mr. Njoku\u2019s suit for lack of locus standi. It noted that \u201cit is fundamental that where a party lacks locus, the court cannot assume jurisdiction\u2026.We agree with the lower court that the appellant has no locus to sue\u201d.\n\nOn the question of the cause of action, the court held that the case of the appellant was \u201cspeculative and imaginary as none of the reliefs he sought accrued to him any benefit\u201d.\n\nIndeed, the Court of Appeal had awarded the sum of N50, 000 each as cost to the defendant, President Jonathan.\n\nDID PRESIDENT JONATHAN SATISFY THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE ELECTORAL ACT WHEN HE SUCCEDED YAR\u2019ADUA IN MAY, 2010?\n\nFor a candidate to be declared elected winner, he must have participated in all the stages of the election. These are the words of section 385(13) of the Fourth Alteration to the 1999 Constitution and section 141 of the Electoral Act, 2010, as amended. They provide that \u201can election tribunal or court shall not under any circumstance declare any person a winner at an election in which such a person have not fully participated in all the stages of the said election\u201d.\n\nSurely, when President Jonathan in May, 2010 stepped into the shoes of late President Yar\u2019Adua, he merely fulfilled constitutional provisions. He did not and could not have participated in all stages of the election such as to be deemed to have been a candidate. It was not an election, but the \u201cdoctrine of necessity\u201d, that made him President. In the eye of the law therefore, Jonathan never contested any election. See the cases of MODIBBO V. MUSTAPHA USMAN & ORS (2020) NWLR (Pt 1712)470 (SC); OZOMGBACHI V. AMADI (2028) LPELR-45152 (SC); CPC V. OMBUGADU (2013) LPELR-21007 (SC); PDM & ANOR V. INEC (2020) 17 NWLR (Pt 1753) 303 (SC).\n\nNO ONE IS ASKING FOR TENURE EXTENSION FOR JONATHAN\n\nThe case of SENATOR RASHIDI LADOJA V. INEC (2007) 12 NWLR (Pt 1047)119 (SC) is quite distinguishable from the Jonathan scenario. The Supreme Court held in that case that neither it nor any other court has the power to extend the period of four years prescribed for a Governor of a state beyond the terminal date of either 4 years or cumulative 8 years.\n\nThis also accords with the case of MARWA V. NYAKO (2012) 6 NWLR (Pt 1296) 199 (SC), where the apex court described the time fixed by the Constitution for doing anything as \u201cimmutable, fixed as the rock of gibrata which cannot be extended, elongated, expanded, or stretched beyond what it states\u201d. See also section 180(1),(2) and (3); and section 182 (1)(b) of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nIndeed, in dealing with the amendment of July, 2010, in section 180(2) (2A), the Supreme Court again kicked against retrospectivity in the same MARWA V. NYAKO (supra), when, coram Adekeye, JSC, it declared: \u201cThe amendment of July, 2010, is not meant to be retrospective as the event in this appeal occurred in 2007 and 2008 respectively. The amendment has not changed the law, but is merely a clarification to the existing provision\u201d\n\nRETROSPECTIVITY OF LEGISLATION\n\nAside Jonathan being completely cleansed of the virus of ineligibility to contest the 2023 presidential election by the still extant Court of Appeal decision in Njoku\u2019s case, as Naaman the leper was, after dipping himself in the River Jordan seven times, Jonathan is also aided by the golden canon of interpretation to the effect that an enactment does not operate retrospectively or retroactively to take away from citizens, enured and vested rights.\n\nWe may now ask the question: What is the effect of Buhari signing into law section 137(3) of the Fourth Alteration to the 1999 Constitution in 2018? The answer is found in section 2 of the Interpretation Act which provides that:\n\n\u201c1. An Act is passed when the President assents to the Bill for the Act, whether or not the Act then comes into force;\n\nWhere no other provision is made as to the time when a particular enactment is to come into force, it shall, subject to the following subsection, come into force In the case of an enactment contained in an Act of the National Assembly, on the day when the Act is passed;\n\nIn any other case, on the day when the enactment is made\u201d.\n\nIt is, therefore, clear from section 2 of the Interpretation Act that section 137(3) of the Fourth Alteration to the Constitution took effect from 11th June, 2018, when President Muhammadu Buhari assented to it, and not earlier. Section 137(3) is anchored on section 318(4) of the 1999 Constitution which provides that, \u201cthe Interpretation Act shall apply for the purposes of interpreting (its) provisions\u201d.\n\nSection 137(3) is one piece of legislation that can be termed retrospective or retroactive legislation, and it is frowned upon.\n\nOn retrospectivity of legislation, the apex court, coram Justice Kekere-Ekun, J.S.C, held in the case of SPDC V. ANARO & ORS (2015) LPELR-24750(SC) at (Pp. 64 paras. B), thus:\n\n\u201cThere is a general presumption against retrospective legislation. It is presumed that the legislature does not intend injustice or absurdity. Courts therefore lean against giving certain statutes retrospective operation. Generally, statutes are construed as operating only in cases or on facts, which come into existence after the statutes were passed unless a retrospective effect is clearly intended. It was held inter alia, in: OJOKOLOBO VS ALAMU (1987) 3 NWLR (Pt.61) 377 @ 402 F-H that it is a fundamental rule of Nigerian law that no statute shall be construed to have a retrospective operation unless such a construction appears very clearly in the terms of the Act or Law; or arises by necessary and distinct implication. See also: Udoh Vs O.H.M.B. (1993) 7 NWLR (Pt.304) 39 @ 149 F \u2013 G; ADEGBENRO VS AKINTOLA (1963) All NLR 305 @ 308.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in ALEWA V. SOKOTO STATE INEC (2007) LPELR-8388(CA) (PP. 32 PARAS. A), the Court of Appeal, per Ariwoola JCA (as he then was), held thus:\n\n\u201cIt is however settled law that, unless the law makers expressly state otherwise, a statute operates prospectively but not retrospectively. It is a cardinal principle of English Law that no statute shall be construed to have retrospective operation unless such a construction appears very clearly in the terms of the Act, or arises by necessary and distinct implications. The position is the same in this Country. In OLANIYI VS. AROYEHUN (1991) 5 NWLR (pt 194) 652, the Supreme Court held that:- \u201cA construction like other statutes operates prospectively and not retrospectively, unless it is expressly provided to be otherwise. Such legislation affects only rights which came into existence after it has been passed.\u201d See also; CHIEF C. ODUMEGWU OJUKWU VS. CHIEF OLUSEGUN OBASANJO & ORS. (2004) 7 SCM 53 at 93; AFOLABI & ORS. V. GOVERNOR OF OYO STATE (1985) 2 NWLR (pt 9) 734; OJOKOLOBO VS. AREMU (supra);\n\nADESANOYE V. ADEWOLE (supra) at 147 B-C & D-E; West v. Gwyne (1911) 2 CH 1; A.G. Federation v. A.N.P.P. (2003) 15 NWLR (844) 600 at 648 G -H; SA\u2019AD V. NYAME (2004) All FWLR (201)1678; EGUNJOBI V. FRN (2012) LPELR-15537(SC), (PP. 34-35 PARAS. F); ADEGBENRO V. AKINTOLA (1963) 2 SCNLR 216; ADESHINA V. LEMONU (1965) 1 All NLR 233; THE SWISS AIR TRANSPORT CO. LTD V. AFRICAN CONTINENTAL BANK LTD (1971) 1 All NLR 37; ATTORNEY GENERAL EAST CENTRAL STATE V. UGWUH (1975) 5 SC 13\u2033.\n\nIndeed, section 4(9) of the Constitution strips the NASS \u201cin relation to any criminal offence\u201d, the power to \u201cmake any law which shall have retrospective effect\u201d. Though this section specifically deals with criminal offences, judicial decisions clearly show that it operates with equal force to civil matters.\n\nThus, in MODU V. FRN (2016) LPELR-40471 (CA), the intermediate court held that:\n\n\u201cThe argument that the Interpretation Act applies to civil legislations only is not only untenable but flawed. A legislation is a legislation and there is nothing in the Interpretation Act to indicate that it only applies to civil and not criminal legislations\u201d. Per YARGATA BYENCHIT NIMPAR, JCA (Pp 18-18 Paras C-E)\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor those who were too young to know that Jonathan left office since May 29, 2015, the oath of office and oath of allegiance which he subscribed to in 2015 were taken prior to the enactment of section 137(3) of the Constitution in 2018. Consequently, as held in MODU V. FRN (supra), all rights, duties, obligations and interests created under section 137 (3) are inapplicable to his rights, duties and obligations which had accrued to or enured in him before the said enactment.\n\nThus, the court held in the case of the ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE FEDERATION V. ALL NIGERIAN PEOPLES PARTY (ANPP) & 2 ORS. (2003) 15 NWLR (Pt. 844) 600 @ pages 648-649, paras. E-B, that:\n\n\u201cA statute is deemed to be retrospective where it takes away any vested right acquired under existing laws or creates a new obligation or imposes a new duty or attaches a new disability in respect of transactions or considerations already past\u2026 Based on the presumption that a legislature does not intend what is unjust, the courts have always leaned against giving statutes a retrospective effect and usually regard them as applying to facts or matters which came into existence after the statutes were passed unless it is clearly shown that a retrospective effect was intended by the legislature. In the instant case the constitution came into being on 29th May, 1999 and all rights, liabilities and privileges as contemplated by the circumstance of the arose as of that day. Consequently, its provisions can only be read prospectively.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the court held at page 649, paras. C-D; 661-662, paras. F-C; 665, paras. A-B as follows:\n\n\u201cOne of the cardinal principles of interpretation of statutes is that no rule of construction is that a retrospective operation is not to be given to a statute so as to impair an existing right or obligation otherwise that as regards matters of procedure, unless that effect cannot be avoided without doing violence to the language of the enactment\u2026\u201d.\n\nThe court nailed it when it held at page 667, paras. C-D that:\n\n\u201cA constitution, like other statutes, operates prospectively and not retrospectively unless it is expressly provided to be otherwise. Such legislations affect only rights which came into existence after it has been passed.\u201d\n\nA cursory examination of the various provisions of the Constitution and all the appellate court decisions cited above make it crystal clear that the speculated disqualification of Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan is grossly misconceived by the antagonists, as the Constitution must be progressively and not retrogressively construed; prospectively and not retrospectively interpreted. More significantly, the Alteration Act itself does not make any express provision that the said inserted sub-section 137(3) would operate retrospectively. To that extent, the principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius (the express mention of one thing is the exclusion of others) applies here. See MADUMERE & ANOR V. OKWARA & ANOR (2013) LPELR-20752(SC).\n\nIt is clear that those deliberately or erroneously misinterpreting the clear position of the law may be baying for Jonathan\u2019s blood, possibly as a potential candidate who may subvert the chances of their preferred candidates. I do not view issues from such narrow ad homine prism and blurred binoculars. It will be grossly unfair, unconstitutional, unconscionable and inequitable to deny Jonathan of the right to contest the 2023 presidential election when our extant laws and appellate court decisions permit him to. The question of whether Jonathan really needs to subject his glittering credentials and internationally acclaimed reputation to the muddy waters of a fresh competition with persons, some of whom were his personal appointees as president, is another matter altogether. Only him, and not the present state of the laws in Nigeria, can answer that question and decide his own fate. But, as regards his eligibility to contest, Dr Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan is pre-eminently constitutionally, morally and legally qualified to contest the 2023 presidential election. So, run, run, run, GEJ, if that is your wish and desire. Goodluck to Goodluck.",
          "summary": "Human Rights lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Mike Ozekhome has said that former President Goodluck Jonathan, is constitutionally qualified to run for president.\nThe case of Jonathan running had been challenged in CYRIACUS NJOKU V GOODLUCK EBELE JONATHAN (2015) LPELR-244496 (CA).\nIndeed, the Court of Appeal had awarded the sum of N50, 000 each as cost to the defendant, President Jonathan.\nSurely, when President Jonathan in May, 2010 stepped into the shoes of late President Yar\u2019Adua, he merely fulfilled constitutional provisions.\nBut, as regards his eligibility to contest, Dr Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan is pre-eminently constitutionally, morally and legally qualified to contest the 2023 presidential election.",

          "text": "A former Member of the Federal House of Representatives, Dr. Dakuku Adol Peterside, has issued a 48-hour ultimatum to Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, for the immediate and unconditional release of the Member representing Bonny/Degema Federal Constituency, Hon. Doctor Farah Dagogo, from detention.Peterside, who said Hon. Dagogo\u2019s arrest has no locus standi in any known Nigerian Law or Statue, including the Miscellaneous Offences Act, described Wike as a neo-fascist and dictator desperate to gag free speech and democratic rights of Rivers citizens.\n\nHe challenged the governor to justify his reasons for the arrest of the lawmaker other than his quest to remain a political alpha and omega who would not brood any fair contest. While insisting that the police also erred in executing the arrest without a known court warrant of arrest, Peterside vowed that Rivers State would not allow Wike to prosper in his quest to turn the state into an Italy of Benito Mussolini or Adolf Hitler\u2019s Germany where fascism held sway until the world rallied democracy against them. \u201cRivers State cannot become an Italy of Benito Mussolini, or Adolf Hitler\u2019s Germany where fascism and dictatorship contracted an evil marriage of convenience that bestrode and muzzled free speech and fundamental rights of citizens. What Wike is working at is to annex every independent mind and cow every Rivers citizen into sheepish acquiescence. But what he plays ignorant of is that from the times of Dappa Biriye, Melford Okilo, Obi Wali, TImothy Birabi, all nationalists and Democrats, Rivers had never suffered fools to muzzle them. So, we shall keep to that historic attitude and would never surrender to Wike and his goons.\u201d\n\nPeterside, who is the immediate past Director General, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, NIMASA, queried Gov. Wike on how he obtained evidence linking the lawmaker to an alleged disruption of proceedings at the Rivers State Secretariat of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. \u201cWike had lied at several times such that these days his claims must be subjected to forensic investigation before believed. So, Rivers people need know how he proved Dagogo\u2019s link to whatever happened at their party Secretariat\u201d, he added.\n\nWhile calling on lovers of democracy and free speech to condemn Wike and his fascist style of governance, Peterside reiterated his 48-hour ultimatum to Gov. Wike to order the release of the detailed lawmaker. \u201cWike has 48 hours to ensure that Honourable Farah is set free and allowed to continue to pursue his political aspiration. Nothing short of that shall avail. Wike cannot be junketing in pursuit of his presidential ambition using Rivers State resources while wickedly gagging another\u2019s on the altar of ego. He must let Dagogo go\u201d, , Peterside averted.",

He said on Friday there was a high risk the talks would end because of what he called Russia\u2019s \u201cplaybook on murdering people\u201d.\n\nUkraine accuses Russian troops of atrocities in areas near the capital, Kyiv, that they previously occupied. Moscow denies the claims.\n\nLavrov said that if the United States and other NATO countries were truly interested in resolving the Ukrainian crisis, they should stop sending weapons to Kyiv.\n\nIn Washington, U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s proposed $33 billion aid package for Ukraine, including $20 billion for weapons, has received bipartisan support. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday she hoped Congress would pass the package as soon as possible.\n\n\u2018CANNOT GET THROUGH\u2019\n\nAfter failing to capture Kyiv in a nine-week assault that has turned cities to rubble, killed thousands and forced 5 million Ukrainians to flee abroad, Russia is now focusing on the east and south of Ukraine.\n\nMoscow hopes to take full control of the eastern Donbas region made up of Luhansk and Donetsk, parts of which were already controlled by Russian-backed separatists before the invasion.\n\nMoscow said on Saturday its artillery units had struck 389 Ukrainian targets overnight.\n\nSerhiy Gaidai, governor of Luhansk, told Ukrainian public television that the Russians were shelling all over the region \u201cbut they cannot get through our defence\u201d. He said civilians would continue to be evacuated despite the difficult situation.\n\nGaidai said two schools and 20 houses were destroyed by Russian attacks on Friday in Rubizhne and Popasna, both in Luhansk.\n\nMykola Khanatov, head of military administration in Popasna, said two buses sent to evacuate civilians from the town were fired on by Russian troops on Friday and there was no word from the drivers. He did not say how many people were on the buses.\n\nThere were also reports of attacks on places outside the Donbas.\n\nMykola Lukashuk, head of the Dnipro regional council, said Russian forces had shelled the outskirts of Velyka Kostromka in the Kryvyi Rih area. A village bordering the Zaporizhzhia region was also shelled. Unverified social media posts reported shelling in the northeastern city of Kharkiv.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the reports from either side on what was happening on the ground.\n\nMARIUPOL RESISTANCE\n\nUkraine\u2019s border guard service posted a video on its Facebook page showing about 16 weary-looking soldiers in battle fatigues, most of them helmeted and holding rifles, singing the national anthem in a small basement room. One was a woman, holding a dog.\n\nThe service said the fighters were border guards helping to defend the Azovstal steel works, the last bastion of Ukrainian forces holding out against Russian invaders in the strategic port city of Mariupol, on the Azov Sea.\n\nReuters could not verify the video.\n\nMoscow calls the war a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to disarm and \u201cdenazify\u201d Ukraine, defend Russian-speaking people from persecution and prevent the United States from using the country to threaten Russia.\n\nUkraine dismisses Putin\u2019s claims of persecution and says it is fighting an unprovoked land grab to fully capture Donetsk and Luhansk, which form the Donbas region.\n\nWestern officials said Russia had suffered fewer casualties after narrowing the scale of its invasion but that numbers were still \u201cquite high\u201d.\n\nBritain\u2019s defence ministry said on Saturday: \u201cShortcomings in Russian tactical coordination remain.\u201d Russia had been forced to merge and redeploy depleted and disparate units from failed advances in northeastern Ukraine, it said in a daily bulletin.\n\nReuters",

          "text": "The 68 passengers abducted by terrorists on March 28 after the bombing of an Abuja-Kaduna train are today 34 days old in the prison of the terrorists, with families and relations frustrated by lack of information on the drive to free their loved ones.\n\nDr. Abdulfatai Jimoh, who speaks on behalf of the relatives of the abductees in Kaduna State, told THISDAY Friday night that they are being further traumatised by the fact that there was no contact with them either by the terrorists or the government for almost five weeks.\n\nLast Tuesday, the terrorists released three new photos showing 62 of the abducted passengers, including children and women.\n\nThey followed this up on Thursday by releasing photograph of a new-born baby girl delivered in the terrorists\u2019 den by a mother abducted during the attack on the Kaduna-bound train.\n\nClad in a thick pink dress and a light lemon sweater cap, with her eyes closed, the baby looked healthy, with credible sources saying the terrorists invited a doctor to take the delivery of the infant.\n\nThree weeks back, the terrorists released a two-minute video, showing scores of abductees sitting in a forest, including men, women and children. Behind them was a group of gunmen standing in a line.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe abductees are evidently in anguish with some believed to be carrying bullet wounds.\n\nFamilies and relatives are worried that they are being traumatised in the forest, amid mosquitoes, harsh conditions and many other dangers.\n\nSome of the elderly among the abducted passengers are clearly experiencing deteriorating health conditions.\n\nA disturbed relative told THISDAY last Thursday that his uncle was among the abducted passengers and that his health was worsening.\n\n\u201cHe spoke when the second video was released on the need to hasten their release in view of the fact that his health is deteriorating. He was among the elders in one of the pictures,\u201d he said.\n\nThe released Managing Director of the Bank of Agriculture, BOA, Alwan Hassan, while recounting his ordeal, said 41 women, 22 men, 5 kids were with the terrorists.\n\nThe federal government had assured that it would do everything necessary to ensure the release of those still being held hostage but families and friends of the victims said they had not seen anything concrete being done in this direction.\n\nThe spokesman of the affected families based in Kaduna, Dr. Jimoh, during his interview with THISDAY on Friday reiterated their demand that government must go into negotiation with the terrorists to secure the release of their loved ones alive.\n\nJimoh, lamented that they were yet to establish contact with their loved ones or even the hoodlums since the incident.\n\nHe urged the federal government to open a channel of communication with the terrorists.\n\nJimoh restated that affected families remain in serious anguish in the past 34 days and living like corpses.\n\nThe terrorists insist that they are not after a ransom, but an exchange of the abducted passengers with their commanders, who were in government custody.\n\nThe former military governor of Kaduna State, retired Col. Abubakar Umar has also reiterated his call on the international community to intervene and help free the abductees.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe world must know what is happening. This government is trying to cover up this and we all must keep talking about this. Before you know it, these people would spend 10 years, like the Chibok girls. There are thousands of kidnapped victims in northern Nigeria, but the governments don\u2019t want people to talk about it.\u201d\n\nNo fewer than 362 passengers were onboard the train at the time the terrorists struck on March 28.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday backed the planned ultramodern international standard Benin Royal Museum that would house the Benin Bronzes and other artefacts being returned to Nigeria, for the purpose of preserving history, tourism and education.\n\nThe President announced his support while receiving in audience at the State House, Abuja, the Oba of Benin, H.R.M. Omo N\u2019Oba Uku Akpolokpolo Ewuare II, accompanied by members of the Royal Court of Benin and the Board of Trustees of the Benin Royal Museum.\n\nThe Royal Majesty was at the State House to thank the President on the recent return of two important Benin Bronzes to its original place of abode by the University of Cambridge and the University of Aberdeen, both in the United Kingdom, after 125 years.\n\nThe Royal Museum, to be housed in the palace of the Oba of Benin, is in conjunction with the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM).\n\nThe Oba of Benin told the President: \u201cWe want to reassure Mr. President that the Royal Court of Benin and NCMM are working closely to ensure safe custody, preservation and enhancement of these Benin Bronzes and artefacts, not only for their cultural and economic benefits, but more importantly towards the promotion of the tourism industry in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Royal Majesty reassured Nigerians that the Benin Bronzes and artefacts represent the country\u2019s cultural heritage in particular and Africa in general, saying \u201cwe hold these objects in trust as the original owners in conjunction with NCMM for the benefit of all.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the President declared that the federal government would continue to vigorously pursue the repatriation of Nigeria\u2019s looted artefacts from abroad, including 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums and Ife terracotta/bronze heads in Netherlands and United States museums.\n\nSpeaking on the returned artefacts, Buhari expressed delight that it had brought immense goodwill and acclaim to Nigeria, the ancient Benin Kingdom, as well as happiness to the Oba of Benin.\n\nHe noted that while it was widely acknowledged around the world that some of the best ancient arts belong to Nigeria, including those from Benin, Ife, Nok and Igbo-Ukwu, many of these beautiful works were illicitly taken away, particularly during the colonial period.\n\nAffirming that these great cultural and artistic works were records of history, the President vowed that Nigeria would not permit these great works to become properties of others, adding that this administration had made it an important task to ensure the return of the artefacts.\n\nThe President, therefore, assured the first-class traditional ruler that the federal Government would continue in this great cause with his support and that of other traditional rulers.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn furtherance to these efforts, an agreement between Nigeria and Germany is currently being prepared. When concluded, it will signify the return to Nigeria by Germany of all the 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums. This will be a monumental achievement.\n\n\u2018\u2018Furthermore, on the 7th of this month, the Glasgow City Council agreed to return 17 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria. The legal issues are in the process of being sorted out.\n\n\u2018\u2018Other success stories include the return by the Netherlands in October 2020 of a 600-year-old Ife Terracotta; the return in April 2021 of a bronze piece from Mexico; as well as the repatriation, in November 2021, of two Benin Bronzes and an Ife Bronze head from the Metropolitan Museum, New York.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari announced that because of the determined efforts of this administration, \u201cNigeria is now regarded to be in the forefront globally in the struggle to repatriate illicitly-exported artefacts to their countries of origin.\u201d\n\nThe President acknowledged the efforts of officials of the NCMM currently working with the Oxford University, the Great North Museum of Newcastle University, Rhode Island School and numerous other places on the modalities for the return of Nigerian antiquities, particularly the Benin Bronzes.\n\nHe expressed optimism that with careful planning and management, Nigeria could generate revenue from the repatriated antiquities.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cWe look forward to a future when these returned antiquities and our arts and culture shall be deployed in generating revenue for the nation.\n\n\u201cI am glad to hear that the Ministry of Information and Culture and the NCMM are already working towards this by reaching out to other nations and cultural institutions on travelling exhibitions to showcase the rich culture of Nigeria through these antiquities.\n\n\u201cThis can happen if officials in charge of these priceless artefacts take due care to maintain and preserve these treasures in good condition at all times.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, affirmed that Nigeria would continue to assert its rights over all its antiquities around the world.\n\nHe added that the country would not hesitate to implore nations, institutions, men and women of goodwill to see the unfairness in the affairs of one body holding on to the cultural property fashioned by the genius of another.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",
