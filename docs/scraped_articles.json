The leadership sincerely appreciate the innate desire of Biafrans to sacrifice their time, resources and energy in ensuring that our leader Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is released unconditionally from the illegal custody of the Nigerian State who criminally renditioned him from Kenya to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere is no gain saying the fact that one of the major fundamental guiding principle of IPOB is Command and Control. This simply means that all command from the Supreme leader of the Indigenous people of Biafra will be obeyed and implemented to the latter by the Directorate of State of the Indigenous people of Biafra.\n\n\u201cBearing in mind therefore that this principle has enabled this movement to surpass even the expections of both Biafrans and Non-Biafrans alike, the leadership wish to encourage Biafran to focus on the most pressing issue confronting this great family presently which is ensuring the safety of our leader while still in the illegal custody of the DSS and to secure his unconditional release from detention.\n\n\u201cThe lPOB leadership urge Biafrans worldwide to take note of the next court appearance of our leader which is the 21st of October 2021. If however we have any reason or directive from the IPOB highest command that require us to reactivate the suspended Weekly Sit-At-Home, the leadership will not hesitate to lift the suspension and continue with the our civil action.\n\nThe statement added, \u201cThe leadership once more appreciate all Biafrans and our friends and sympathizers who faithfully observed the Monday August 9 Sit-At-Home which was a huge success throughout Biafra land. May God continue to bless and uphold all those committed to our struggle.\n\n\u201cWe consider Biafra restoration as a sacrosanct call to duty above all else. Any other information regarding Sit-At-Home in Biafraland not emanating from IPOB through our main channels of information dissemination should be disregarded.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Government should heed now to the voice of reason coming from within Nigeria and from outside the shores of Nigeria to unconditionally free our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, and announce a date for Biafra referendum or plebiscite where our people will choose where they wish to belong before it is too late.\u201d",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Abayomi Adeshida, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has been implored to demonstrate more commitment to his willingness to make life easier for people living with disabilities in Nigeria by paying more attention to addressing the historic traumas that have been endemic in every facet of the society and festered a post-traumatic stress disorder that has continually fueled the insecurity, terrorism and social disturbances that have continued to linger in the society.\n\nThe President has therefore been urged to pay some attention to ameliorating the effects of historic traumas among Nigerians to consolidate the gains of establishing the Persons with Disabilities Commission so as to guarantee an enviable legacy for the President after he vacates office for a successor on May 29th, 2023.\n\nIn the same vein, the National Assembly has been advised to wake up to the responsibility of monitoring activities of the officials who run the activities of the Nigerian Disabilities Commission through a vibrant oversight function that would ensure proper implementation of the Nigerians Disability Law as passed by the legislators in 2019.\n\nThese were the views expressed by the President, Equal Rights for Persons with Disabilities International Incorporation, Chief Eric Ufom during a chat with Vanguard from his base in Houston Texas, United States of America when he was speaking on the impact of the laws that established the People with Disabilities Commission, one year after its pioneer Governing Council was constituted by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe appreciate the efforts of President Muhammdu Buhari for not only signing the bill that established the People with Disabilities Commission to the law in 2019, an action that gave a legal instrument to the activities of the body as established with the appointment of members of its Board on August 24th, 2020; but also taking the bold step to name the pioneer members of the Governing Council of the Commission.\n\n\u201cWe were also delighted to see that beyond his naming of the people to run the activities of the Commission, we heard of budgetary allocations to the Commission which was made available to establish a solid foundation for the running of the place in a clear demonstration of his promise not to have any abandoned project in the country under his watch as President.\n\n\u201cIt is regrettable that despite all the President has done to ensure that he leaves an indelible mark on the sands of time, there are self-centred individuals who have seen their appointment to run the Commission as an opportunity to get a fair share of the National cake.\n\n\u201cSuch people have gone way off the guidelines of the laws that established the Commission by taking their own discretions while setting the laws aside and once the foundation is faulty, what can the righteous do?\n\n\u201cIt is not a hopeless situation for the country yet. We would urge President Buhari to take more steps beyond the establishment of the Nigerian Disabilities Commission and pay quality attention to ensuring that those appointed to help the physically challenged in Nigeria do follow a due process according to global best practices because if the due process is not followed in the Commission, everything would fall apart.\n\n\u201cThere are historic traumas in all parts of Nigeria that require proper handling by a Commission that is manned by highly patriotic officials without some dent on their records in their previous activities as public officials who are well-grounded in following the due process in the implementation of the laws that established the Commission,\u201d Chief Ufom maintained.\n\nWhen asked to substantiate his claims on the endemic historic traumas across the country he said, \u201cIn the South East, the historic trauma of the civil war and the post-traumatic stress disorder that came with the war has aggravated an endemic bitterness that would require quality attention to wear off the effects on the larger society.\n\n\u201cIn a similar manner, the cultural and religious practices of the Northern part of the country that breeds the Almajiris is an incubator for historic traumas on its own and the effects of the post-traumatic stress disorder that it also generates would require a deliberate commitment to take away from the society.\n\n\u201cDespite the civilization that seems to have commenced from the South Western part of the country, there are effects of communal clashes across the region like the Ife/Modakeke war as well as the economic imbalance and other challenges that swell the ranks of Area Boys and Out of Schoolchildren in the region which make them become street urchins that cause security challenges for the society.\n\n\u201cThese series of historic traumas that originated from those gory experiences have been passed down from generation to generation and victims of post-traumatic stress disorder are swelling in their ranks daily and the nation is bleeding daily from security challenges across the land.\n\n\u201cIt is regrettable that the President has played his part by doing what should be done to put a structure in place to provide a lasting solution, but when you put money in the place and people are just sharing it without any consideration for the laws that established the Commission, what is the future of the entire country? Chief Ufom lamented.\n\nWhen asked about the visible gaps in the activities of the Commission one year after the members of the Governing Council that are laying the foundation for the Commission got the Presidential appointment, Chief Ufom said there are so many of them but he would only dwell on two valid points that are very significant.\n\nIn his words, \u201cwe are grateful to the President that he signed the bill that established the Commission to the law on January 23, 2019, and followed it with the appointment of the Governing Council members on August 24th, 2020, but it would interest you to note that after a whole year that we crossed that hurdle, those members of the Commission lack individual office spaces from where they operate.\n\n\u201cSecondly, there has not been any orientation course for those who are working in the Commission so as to have them working from an informed point of view that such orientation course would have inculcated into them in order for the Commission to take off on a strong footing through proper implementation of the laws that established it.\n\n\u201cIts is during such training that every officer would be told why he was appointed, the results expected from each member on the Board and who is supposed to be taking orders from the other before certain actions can be taken, however noble the intentions could be for the generality of the Commission.\n\n\u201cHaving been on this struggle for things to be done through the established global standards for over twenty years, it is regrettable that in spite of the achievements so far, Nigeria is yet to start addressing age-long historic traumas and their mysteriously debilitating, physical and psychological effects which is a post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\u201cThe worst effect of this problem is that because their victims are in a society where poverty is endemic, they find a way to inflict the traumas on the larger society by providing an available reservoir for insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cLack of true implementation of the Nigerians with Disabilities Act 2018 by the Executive arm of Government and proper oversight by the Legislative arm destroys excellent historic legacy made by President Buhari for over 31 million Nigerians with disabilities.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari signed the Act into law on January 23, 2019, and followed it up with the establishment of the Commission on August 23, 2020, with the announcement of the membership of the Governing Council of the Commission.\n\n\u201cWhile we watch helplessly as some officials of the Commission are working without any proper reference to the guidelines as stipulated in the laws that established the Commission, the legislative arm of government has also failed to perform an oversight function to see to proper compliance with the laws by the officials in the Commission.\n\n\u201cIt is very surprising for us to see that the legislators who are supposed to supervise the implementation of the laws they passed are more concerned with what has happened during an incident at the airport when someone was boarding a flight.\n\n\u201cAlthough that is equally important because most Nigerians with disabilities cannot afford to join the elitist club of airline passengers, for now, we would plead with those legislators to deploy such energy to the proper implementation of the laws of the Commission so that majority of the people in the country can benefit from the establishment of the Commission.\n\n\u201cWhen established States and Federal Government Disabilities Rights Commission for use in addressing historic traumas have clearly failed to obey and implement the laws used in establishing them, Nigeria\u2019s ongoing epidemic problems of insecurity, insurgency, terrorism, agitation, kidnapping, banditry, armed robbery, age-long community disputes cannot be stopped,\u201d he stressed.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "A non-governmental organization, Actionaid Nigeria, has called on the Federal Government to urgently address the growing unemployment rate in the country to reduce violent extremism.\n\nActionaid Resilience Programme Coordinator, Mr Anicetus Atakpu, made the call on Saturday in Koton- Karfe, Kogi State, while speaking at the 2021 Youth summit on preventing violent extremism in the state with the theme \u201cyouth innovation in peace building through climate change mitigation\u201d.\n\nAtakpu, who described unemployment and marginalization as a critical driver of violent extremism, stressed the need for all stakeholders and policy makers to support the drive for innovative ideas as it comes to issues of food security.\n\nHe said in line with the global theme commemorating the 2021 International youth day, the organization is addressing some key aspects which boils down to solving the issues of unemployment which triggers violent extremism in the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201d the healthiness of the earth is tied to climate change. There is a need to improve innovative ideas of the youth that would enhance security in the country.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about innovative ideas, we are talking about job creation. How can youth get involved more deeply in issues of climate change and how they can get themselves involved on issues of food security. They play an active role in ensuring that the earth is healthy. Currently we have different issues that have really affected the soil fertility. More than 80 percent of our communities are into farming.\n\n\u201cFor example, where we are now in Koton-Karfe, they combine both farming and fishing because of the proximity to the river. When the flood comes, it washes away most of those things they have laboured for, including their farm land.\n\n\u201cIt goes a long way to affect their earnings. One of the effects of climate change is how it has increased poverty. Government and other stakeholders must provide an enabling environment where the youths will be proactive, and innovative as it concerns their farm yields and food security\u201d.\n\nContinuing Atakpu said, \u201d this will create job opportunities that would address unemployment which holistically will deduce violent extremism in the country\u201d.\n\nThe Actionaid Resilience Programme Coordinator however tasked the government to be more proactive in providing seedlings that are necessary for planning saying \u201cif we don\u2019t have a good planting season, there would be hunger next year. When there is hunger next year, it will escalate conflict and violent extremism in all areas in the country\u201d.\n\nWhile tasking on policy makers to be more proactive in proffering policies and solutions and ensure total implementation of the existing ones, Atakpu further called for the improvement on the budgetary allocation for agriculture stressing that some States are doing well in line with the Maputo declaration of 2003 which pegged it at 10% in any budgetary allocation in a State.\n\nIn remarks at the summit, the Council Chairman of Kogi Local Government, Hon. Isah Abdulkareem, described Youth engagement in Agriculture as cardinal if the issues of unemployment gap in the country must be tackled.\n\nSimilarly, the Chairman, National Youth Council, Kogi Local Government Chapter, Comr. Isah Abubakar Adah Abu, lauded the Initiatives of Actionaid Nigeria, expressing optimism that the agricultural sector, with the right environment created, has the propensity to check unemployment, Youth restiveness, and gainfully engage youths of the area.\n\nEarlier, the Resource Person at the Summit, Hajia Zainab Musa, described Kogi LGA as largely an agrarian area in nature, urging the youths to begin to think about farming and fishing as a way out of the unemployment crisis bedeviling the country.\n\nMusa described farming as the most lucrative venture for all time and seasons, urging them to seek for new methods of farming that would seek to protect the environment and the ecosystem.\n\nShe also described farming as the most attractive profession and venture now in view of the need to increase food sufficiency and provide gainful employment to teeming graduates roaming the streets.\n\nDAILY POST reports that the Youth Summit which was organised by ActionAid Nigeria in partnership with Participation Initiative for Behavioural Change in Development (PIBCID) (GCERF) was held simultaneously in all 12 communities in Kogi State, namely: Ugbedomagwu, Ujagba, Tajimi, Ette, Koton-Karfe, Osisi, Osaragada/Aku, Inata, Ukowa, Emekutu and Abache, which are under Lokoja, Okehi, Adavi, Ankpa, Igalamela-Odolu, and Kogi-Koto Local Government Areas.\n\nThe youth summit is part of the implementation of the System and Structure Strengthening Approach Against Radicalization to Violent Extremism Project (SARVE II) aimed at reducing the vulnerability of at-risk young men and women to conflict and radicalization, in 12 communities of 6 LGAs, Kogi State.",

Baba, Celedi, Magaji, Ningi, Jarmai, Turaki, Waziri, Kaldiri, Garkuwa, Badara, Kwagal, Danba, Kawu Moni, Babar and Karofi.\n\nHe described the incident as \u201cvery serious and devastating flood that ravaged many communities\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, the local government had never experienced such level of disaster.\n\n\u201cThe incident was caused by heavy rain which lasted for many hours, it started from around 2pm and lasted till 5am. The water came from unknown sources and couple with the lack of proper drainages in the communities. It was a very terrible situation that that area has never experienced in over 60 years.\n\n\u201cAlthough no life was lost but hundreds of mud houses were totally destroyed and the victims are very devastated and traumatized because of the serious situation they are facing due to lack of places to sleep, no food to eat and many others.\n\n\u201cIn fact, we met a resident who told us that he lost over 30 goats and sheep. Many foodstuffs was destroyed, farmlands were destroyed, many of them are stranded,\u201d he said.\n\nNayola called for immediate assistance from good spirited individuals, local and International Non-Governmental Organizations, Presidential Committee of Flood Relief and Rehabilitation, North-East Development Commission to come in to help in offering assistance and relief to the people.\n\nThe Chairman of Kirfi local council, Garba Musa, said that \u201cthe extent of damage is very devastating\u201d adding that from his on-the-spot assessment of some of the areas, over 600 houses were destroyed.\n\nMusa added that over 100 hectares farmlands of rice, maize, millet and other crops were all destroyed.\n\nHe said: \u201cI visited, the extent of damage is very, very devastating. I\u2019ve seen so many houses that were washed to the ground, I have seen so many animals that died as a result of the impact of the running water.\n\n\u201cI have seen areas that were, before now, roads but are now washed by the flood resulting in very deep gully erosion, I have seen farmlands washed away, the crops all covered with sand, I have seen compounds including the fence, the main building completely washed away.\n\n\u201cI have also seen some houses were the properties could not be salvaged but we\u2019re all destroyed, I have seen foodstuffs submerged in water, they managed to salvage some and put them in the sun to dry, I have seen a we\u2019ll that sank to the ground because it was built on sand, I have seen parts of shops and mosques washed away with some of the properties carried by the rain and lots of others.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, all these happened because our forests are being depleted and as a result, when it rains, the places that used to hold rain in the bushes cannot do so again, so it has to go to the river and the only way is to flow through the houses.\n\n\u201cIn Celedi alone, not less than 150 houses were destroyed and razed to the ground apart from the ones that were soaked.\n\n\u201cThere are many other villages that were affected. I\u2019ll give an estimate of 600 houses destroyed in the local government area.\n\n\u201cI have not yet gone through the whole local government, but not less than 100 hectares of farmlands of rice, maize, millet other crops.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI was opportune to have spoken to many elderly people in those areas, all of them confessed that in all their lifetime, they have never seen such a magnitude of running water in the time like this.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Search and Rescue Officer who is the acting Permanent Secretary, Bala Lame, has said that the Bauchi State Government has immediately approved the release of some relief materials to be given to the people to ameliorate their sufferings.\n\n\u201cWe have a quick response from the state government. We have just been given about three trailers of food items and as I speak with you now, these items are being loaded. The items are 600 bags of maize (100kgs) and 600 bags of rice (50kgs).\n\n\u201cThe governor even directed me to immediately take the items to the people\u201d, he said.",

          "text": "By Vincent Kalu, Oluseye Ojo and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nA proposed plan by the Nigerian Indigenous Nationalities Alliance for Self-Determination (NINAS) to hold a one million-man march at the United Nations in New York, United States next month during the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) 76th session seems to have divided Southern and Middle Belt groups, investigations by Saturday Sun has revealed.\n\nNINAS spokesman, Maxwell Adeleye had earlier in the week announced the proposed march, saying it will be led by NINAS\u2019 chairman, Prof Banji Akintoye among other leaders of the group.\n\nThe march, scheduled for between September 14 and 21 2021, is to protest the socio-political conditions in Nigeria. Among the demands of the group are a referendum on self-determination and abolition of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nBut some of the groups have stated that they are not aware of any planned protest.\n\nMiddle Belt Forum National Publicity Secretary, Dr Dogo Isuwa, told Saturday Sun in a telephone interview that his group did not participate in any meeting where a decision to hold such a protest march was discussed or taken.\n\nHe also said the author of the statement in question is not known to the MBF, neither is the person or his principal the Yoruba leader.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you look at it, the person that was talking, it\u2019s Chief Akintoye, not Chief Ayo Adebanjo, leader of Afenifere. There are also no known leaders of Southern Nigeria mentioned in the statement. So, who did they meet? They did not mention the leader of the South South, Chief Edwin Clark. They did not mention Afenifere leader, Chief Adebanjo, they did not mention Dr Bitrus Pogn, president of MBF. The person that signed the statement also signed on behalf of Akintoye, who is not leader of Afenifere. He is unknown to us, I\u2019ve not heard of him before. If any such thing will take place, they would have called me. So I can\u2019t confirm if any such thing is going to take place.\u201d\n\nAttempts to contact Afenifere last night were unsuccessful, as the group was said to be in a crucial meeting.\n\nIlana Omo Oodua had in a statement titled, \u2018Akintoye, others, lead NINAS one million March to United Nations General Assembly,\u2019 said other prominent leaders of Southern Nigeria, including Prof. Yusuf Turaki; NINAS Secretary-General, Tony Nnadi; former Commissioner for Education in Osun State and National Chairman of Ilana Omo Oodua, Prof. Wale Adeniran, among others will be part of the protest march.\n\n\u201cWhat will be happening at UNGA is that the members of Ilana Omo Oodua, under the leadership of Emeritus Prof. Banji Akintoye, alongside other members of NINAS from the Lower Niger and Middle Belt of Nigeria will be holding a one million march opposite the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the United States from September 14 to 21, 2021 to demand a referendum to decide on the rights to self-determination of the people who want an end to unitary system of Nigeria, which has been turned into an apartheid state.\n\n\u201cWe shall also be demanding the abolition of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria\u2026 All the sons and daughters of the Lower Niger (South-East, South-South, South-West and Middle Belt) living in the United States of America are being mobilised to stand up for their indigenous nationalities by participating in the one-week one million march for the liberation of their people,\u201d the statement said.\n\nMeanwhile the spokesman for NINAS, Maxwell Adeleye said the group had begun mobilization in the United States for the proposed march which he said would be the mother of all marches by Nigerians in America.\n\nHe admitted that Afenifere, Ohanaeze Middle Belt Forum and some other groups were yet unaware of the planned march but said the group would soon reach out to all necessary stakeholders.\n\nMeanwhile Secretary-General of NINAS, Mr. Tony Nnadi, has said that the group does not need the approval of Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEF and Middle Belt Forum (MBF) for proposed march at the UN.\n\nNnadi said is a culmination of a 21-year process.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is something involving the entire alliance fellowship, talking about the East, West and Middle Belt and all of us who are fed up with Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhether they come or not, the constitution would go down; the discussions with world stakeholders have happened, whether they come or not, the consciousness with the three blocs not to continue with the madness is in view; whether they come or not, the UN has already sent a rapporteur that came to the conclusion that our constitution is now a danger to the global community.\n\n\u201c Does it mean that if they don\u2019t come along, the matter will not go to where it is?\n\n\u201cThe proclamation has 127 signatories. There is nobody in Afenifere today that can claim to be more Afenifere than Banji Akintoye. Nwodo signed for Ohanaeze, and the group has not come to tell us they are no more with us. So if a few individuals now go round to say otherwise, they are not speaking for Ohanaeze. The presidents-general of all these groups signed the proclamation. So, why will it become a matter of debate whether they are in or not?\n\n\u201cIn December last year, when we came out, the heads of all the blocs signed \u2013 PANDEF, Middle Belt Forum; Afenifere was having issues at that time, Banji, Akintoye, a confidant of Awolowo signed.\n\n\u201cIf anybody thinks that if these groups are not in, then the person is wrong.

          "title": "Kanu, Igboho: Nothing illegal in agitations for secession \u2013Muiz Banire",
          "text": "A former National Legal Adviser of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr Muiz Banire, has declared that under the Nigerian constitution, there is nothing criminal or illegal in the agitations by the Indigenous People of Biafra, led by Nnamdi Kanu, and Sunday Adeyemo, otherwise known as Sunday Igboho for Biafran Republic and Oduduwa Nation respectively.\n\nIn an interview with VINCENT KALU, the Senior Advocate of Nigeria and former Lagos State commissioner for Environment, noted: \u201cLike I said sometime in an interview, I\u2019m not aware of any law that says the call for secession is illegal or criminal. In fact, as far back as 1951, the North had called for secession first and recently, I saw a newspaper cutting where the president was reported to have called for secession. No law against it.\u201d\n\nBanire, who insisted that restructuring only is not the solution to Nigeria\u2019s challenges, also asserted that there wasn\u2019t any sort of agreement on zoning or power rotation in the APC during the formation of the party. He spoke on a number of other pertinent national issues.\n\nAre you worried about the state of the nation?\n\nI\u2019m very much worried and I think there is nobody who is not concerned about the way things are going on in this country. The president himself is so much worried. Everybody is so much worried about the state of the nation because we all know that we are in a very turbulent and challenging period in the history of this nation. Our currency is nose-diving daily, the economy is dwindling, insecurity is rising unemployment is soaring. So, virtually, in all facets, we are challenged. Any patriotic Nigerian will be worried; even if you are not patriotic in one way or the other, you will be impacted.\n\nWhat solution can you proffer?\n\nThe only solution is credible election, which will lead to credible leadership. This is the only way out of this lockdown; we need people who are round pegs in round holes to take over the mantle of leadership in the country. To get to that destination., we need to have credible elections and to do this, there is an urgent need for the reform of our electoral process, which continues to give us garbage in terms of leaders. If that is done, possibly at the end of the day, we have visionary and missionary leaders that will be able to paddle the affairs of the country into our desired destination.\n\nSome have suggested that restructuring is the way out. Do you share in their view?\n\nIt is not the absolute way out, but I share in the sentiment that there is the need to restructure some aspects of our lives as a nation that we believe are essential and necessary, but restructuring is not the only solution to our challenges.\n\nEven, your party, APC has restructuring in its manifesto and further to that, it set us a committee headed by Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai towards its implementation. But the report is gathering dust somewhere?\n\nLet me make it clear: I\u2019m not a member of APC. I stopped being its member since July 2018, and so I\u2019m not part of the gang. For me, restructuring was part of it, but why they are not doing anything, I don\u2019t know. It is a sort of betrayal of trust. When you make a representation to the people, you must be able to live up to expectations. Integrity is vital, and our words, as human beings, as noble people, must always be our bond. So, the reason it is not being implemented, I don\u2019t know because I don\u2019t belong to the party again and so I don\u2019 know what is going on there.\n\nIt\u2019s only recently that you ceased being a member of APC. You were a foundation member and very instrumental to its formation. There is this argument about zoning or rotation of power in the party. Was there anything like that, whether formal or a gentleman\u2019s agreement?\n\nAt no point did anybody agree on rotation. There was nothing like that; it is just that it has become part of our tradition. If you like, you can call it a convention that when the North uses a particular period, the expectation that it would come to the other side of the nation, the South. It is just a convention, expectation and tradition. Clearly, there was no agreement to that effect.\n\nIt was a tradition in PDP, but under APC\u2026?\n\nAPC was a new party and this is the first litmus test that they are facing after Buhari\u2019s tenure. We don\u2019t know what will happen eventually. Maybe, they will respect that kind of arrangement too or they will overlook it.\n\nYou are talking about electing credible leaders, but the situations in the two parties are palpable. While APC is asphyxiating, PDP is haemorrhaging. Does this have to do with 2023, as everywhere is tensed up?\n\nIt may not be unlikely. But beyond that, I know that APC\u2019s problem is compliance with the rule of law. The challenge APC is always having is the resistance to abide by their rules and regulations. Until they learn how to obey their constitution and follow rules and guidelines that they set for themselves, they will continue to have challenges, which eventually might lead to the party\u2019s demise if they are not careful. For the PDP, there is a formation of mismanagement within their fold, exacerbated by 2023 struggle.\n\nPundits say there is no difference between APC and PDP, as one is the other side of the other. Here you are talking about electing credible leaders as a way out of this quagmire. If both parties are the same, does it not mean that Nigeria will continue to be in a \u2018one chance\u2019 bus in 2023?\n\nI suspect so. I\u2019m of those who subscribe that they are one and the same thing. My position is even deeper than that. I have always believed that we do not have, technically speaking, political parties in Nigeria. What we have in Nigeria are political platforms for people to contest elections. That is why you find people moving from one political party to the other at will because there is not ideological commitments. In fact, I describe all of them as \u2018cut and paste\u2019 political parties, it is just a change of name and some other few things they do there. They are just birds of the same feather; there is nothing significantly different in any one of them.\n\nThen how do we go about getting it better?\n\nGetting it better, like I said initially, was to reform our entire electoral process starting from the issues of political parties. Particularly, there is the need to allow independent candidature, which is very vital and crucial. By the time we assumed that, you would see some sort of checks against the political parties. You know the constitution does not allow you as an individual on your own. Still, you have to rely on one political party or platform or the other. But once we are able to diffuse that and people are able to come out with their personalities, you start seeing people of integrity wining election on their own strength without following the crowd. That is very pertinent to be done. We must reform the electoral process. I\u2019m not satisfied with what is going on now, we still have a long way to go, and it has to be a radical departure from our traditional ways of doing things in the political circle.\n\nYou are talking about reforming the electoral process; recently, the issue of electronic transfer of results by INEC was killed at the Senate. Was it the right thing to do?\n\nI have written a piece on that and my position is clear and simple; it is irrational, reckless and irresponsible for the Senate to have shut it down. It smacks of nothing but rigging. It is something that is doable and INEC has confirmed so, telecommunication firms have confirmed that they have the capacity. Everybody knows that there is the capacity. Even if you don\u2019t want to use telecommunication network, you can use satellite network and get to the same destination. But for anybody to say that it should not be used, it simply means that the person is planning and attempting to rig election. It is as simple as that.\n\nIt is likely that the purported popularity of most of these senators have diminished badly, so they need a short cut out of it. It is a very wrong decision, condemnable and reckless.\n\nMajority of those that voted against the electronic transfer of result are APC members. Could it be that because of the unpalatable state of the nation, the party is not sure of winning 2023 election?\n\nI equally suspect so too, because I understand that it is their party\u2019s decision and some of them were not even convinced on why they voted other than that their party directed that they should do so. They are not sure of their future and I equally suspect so because there is no other explanation to it. They are not sure of what the future holds for them, so they have to prepare. To decline to adopt electronic transfer of result is to start building your rigging infrastructure ahead of the election.\n\nYou said rotation is a tradition, that when power leaves North it goes to South and vice versa. But from its body language, the North is still insisting that power should remain in the region. What is your take on that?\n\nI have always believed in merit, competency and I have always believed that such policies that border on quota system, federal character are regressive and must not be promoted. In fact, it is against patriotism and nationalism. For me, may the best man always win, if the person is a Nigerian. Today, we are all suffering banditry, terrorism, kidnapping and so on. Do these evils tell us where they come from? Is any one of them saying he\u2019s a southerner or northerner? No. It is bad leadership, inept leadership. For me, I need somebody, just like Babangida insinuated, who will bring us out of the quagmire we found ourselves in. I don\u2019t care where you are from, but you must have the desired competence.\n\nBut will Nigerians subscribe to that because of the high illiteracy level? It is very difficult for the voters to differentiate between competency and otherwise. They will vote along ethnic and religious sentiments?\n\nThat is why I said that we need to revisit our electoral process. For example, earlier in the year, I wrote a column saying that we need to revisit the absolute franchise system, that enough of the situation where every Tom, Dick and Harry vote. That we must start allowing people that are informed to vote, because the votes of those who are uninformed are endangering not only themselves but all of us put together. So, we must save them from themselves and that is what I\u2019m canvassing; that we need to revisit our electoral system. Nothing is universal. You do things in accordance with the peculiarity of your nation. Like you said, our people are largely uninformed; people don\u2019t even know why they are voting, not to talk of the candidates they are voting for. And at the end of the day, they continue to endanger all of us. We need to find a solution to it and that is why I consistently say that our electoral system needs overhaul.\n\nLike you pointed out, the environment you find yourself determines the system you run or operate. Nigeria is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious group. Don\u2019t you think the issue of power rotation will help to address the issues of agitation?\n\nAgain, we are seeing this because there is inequity. We are seeing injustice in the land and there is unfairness in the land. If we have a leader that is a just leader and does things equitably, all these agitations would not arise. The question of where you come from won\u2019t even arise. Nigerians don\u2019t care about where any president or governor comes from. What they care about is good roads, good hospitals, jobs, comfort, etc. If everything is working, what is your concern about who is on top there? You won\u2019t remember his name. It is when things are not working that you start asking, who is there? That is the reality. All these agitations will fizzle out the moment we get somebody who can readjust, who can enthrone justice and fairness in the polity,\n\nThese separatist agitations \u2013 Biafra, Oduduwa, Ijaw don\u2019t speak well of the country. What can be done to calm things?\n\nLike I said earlier, there is no justice; there is no equity in the land. In the absence of that, agitations will continue and it will border on secession. Like I said sometime in an interview, I\u2019m not aware of any law that says the call for secession is illegal or criminal. In fact, as far back as 1951, the North called for secession first and recently, I saw a newspaper cutting where the president was reported to have called for secession. No law against it. All these agitations for secession are coming up because of injustice, unfairness in the land, and except we remedy and address them the agitations will continue.\n\nYou left APC. Where is the train heading to?\n\nI\u2019m back to my civil society platform. I have my own group, United Action for Change. I also largely work with the Concerned Professionals \u2013 myself, Femi Falana, Pat Utomi and others. We are trying to do our best.\n\nWhat do Nigerians expect from you people?\n\nWe are doing a lot. We are trying to mobilise the youths to register and get their voter cards. The next is to enlighten them about the need to get involved in the electoral process because they understand issues better than the uneducated. We are doing a lot of active work in terms of civic engagement.\n\nWill it metamorphose into a political party?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t think so.\n\nYou are no longer interested in party politics?\n\nNot in this country. Maybe, until there is sanity in the system. Right now, the people that populate the parties are scavengers largely and we are all classified the same so long as you are inside. If you find yourselves unfortunately in government in Nigeria, there is the presumption that you are a thief. And so why will you want to go with that stigma? So, it is better to distance yourself from the arena.",

          "title": "Trying to conceive? These are things you should and shouldn\u2019t do",
          "text": "By Vivian Onyebukwa\n\nOnce a man and woman start living together as a couple, the next thing that is expected of them by the society is to start having children.\n\nAt times, the babies start coming immediately. But for some, the woman might be having challenges getting pregnant.\n\nIt is believed that there are certain dos and don\u2019ts that women looking forward to conceiving and having their own babies should observe to enable her get pregnant. Some experts highlighted these in separate interviews.\n\nProfessor Solomon Avidime, Chief Consultant of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Ahmadu Bello University (ABU)/ABI Teaching Hospital, Zaria, Kaduna State, said a woman intending to get pregnant should endeavour to seek medical attention to assess her state of health and readiness for pregnancy. This, according to the professor, is called preconception care.\n\nHear him: \u201cPreconception care is a specialised care targeted at women of reproductive age before pregnancy to detect, treat or counsel them about pre-existing medical and social conditions that may have adverse effect on pregnancy outcome. Preconception care will improve, provide counselling on appropriate health behaviours that will help to optimise pregnancy outcomes and prevent maternal mortality.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that preconception care provides an opportunity to evaluate the health status of the women with the understanding that pregnancy is an altered healthy state that can be strenuous for normal women and women that have health challenges. He said preconception care in Nigeria is very necessary in view of the fact that there are many women of pregnancy age with communicable and non-communicable diseases who can potentially benefit from such service. He gave examples of such diseases to include sexually transmitted infections, HIV, hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disease and sickle cell disease among numerous others.\n\n\u201cAlthough, there is no well-defined preconception care services in the health care system for now in Nigeria, preconception care services are however provided in cases where the health workers perceive a need or in cases where the clients outright seek such services\u201d.\n\nHe further gave a list of recommendations.\n\nOne: Decline of fertility\n\nWomen need to be aware that fertility declines with advancing age and should also be aware of their family history.\n\nTwo: Keep a menstrual calendar\n\nIt is recommended that women planning pregnancy should record menstrual cycle frequency and keep a menstrual calendar. This allows for prediction of ovulation date and thus timed sexual contact is planned on every other day during the fertile window.\n\nThree: Avoid stress\n\nWhile trying to get pregnant, it is advisable to get rest, sufficient relaxation and avoid stress.\n\nFour: Take prenatal vitamins\n\nWomen planning pregnancy will have to strive for a healthy body weight and take prenatal vitamin. Folic Acid intake is highly recommended, as it prevents the development of neural tube defects (NTDs), such as anencephaly and spina bifida. Neural tube defects are birth defects of the brain, spine, or spinal cord.\n\nFive: Reduce alcohol intake\n\nWomen planning pregnancy are advised to cut down significantly on alcohol drinking habit and, where possible, to put a stop. Alcohol abuse pre-pregnancy is a preventable cause of birth defects which includes mental retardation and neurodevelopment abnormalities. It is recommended that women are counselled about these effects. It is important to note that even a small quantity of alcohol drinking among pregnant women put the foetus at risk for development of foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Women who are heavy drinkers (five or more drinks on one occasion on five or more days in the past 30 days) have a higher risk of cardiac and hepatic complications.\n\nSix: Stop smoking\n\nThere are numerous health risks associated with the habit of cigarette smoking. Health risks include intrauterine growth restriction, low lying placenta (Placenta Pre-via), and premature separation of placenta (Abruption Placentae). Others are premature rupture of membranes, low birth weight, and perinatal mortality. It is advised that women of reproductive age be counselled about the associated risks of smoking and the negative outcomes associated with pregnancy.\n\nSeven: Drug Abuse\n\nIt is highly recommended that women planning pregnancy should avoid use of illicit drugs during pregnancy. It has adverse effects on the neonate, and the children are at the risk for altered neurodevelopment outcome and poor health status. Only drugs recommended by physicians should be used, and that should be as recommended.\n\nEight: Avoid Toxic Substances and Environmental Contaminants\n\nToxic substances such as synthetic chemicals, metals, fertilizer, bug spray, and cat or rodent faeces around the home and in the workplace are hazardous as they can harm the reproductive systems of both men and women, thus making it more difficult to get pregnant. These are to be avoided.\n\nAnother medical consultant, Dr Uchechukwu Opara, Medical Director, UCCO, Owerri, Imo State, stated that when a couple decides it is time to begin actively trying to start a family, many believe it will be simple. They stop using whatever form of birth control they had been using. He agreed that in many cases, it could be that simple. \u201cIn fact, 80 per cent of couples get pregnant within six months after they begin trying to conceive. For some couples, though, it doesn\u2019t happen right away.\n\nThere is also a list of habits to embrace ot avoid while trying to get pregnant.\n\nOne: Take prenatal vitamins\n\n\u201cIt is a good idea to begin taking prenatal vitamins with folic acid even before you conceive. These vitamins help protect against birth defects such as spina bifida, and they do most of that work in the early part of the pregnancy.\n\nTwo: Get to know your cycle\n\nMost women\u2019s bodies provide clues to their fertile period.\n\nThree: Chart your basal body temperature\n\nAnother clue a woman\u2019s body will give around ovulation is a jump in the basal body temperature.\n\nFour: Take a breather\n\nThough the position in which you and your partner have sex does not have much impact on chances of pregnancy, it is beneficial if you wait ten to 15 minutes after intercourse to get up. This allows enough time for the sperm to travel to the cervix before gravity can have an effect on them.\n\nFive: Make stress relief a priority\n\nAny kind of stress can interfere with ovulation and the conception process.\n\nSix: Stay in shape\n\nA healthy body has an easier time conceiving than one that is either underweight or overweight.\n\nSeven: Visit your doctor\n\nDon\u2019t forget to visit your doctor; A preliminary visit to your OB/GYN or family practitioner can help inform you.\n\nEight: Use water-based lubricants\n\nThese can reduce sperm\u2019s motility by 60 to 100 per cent. Also many lubricants contain spermicide, so there is a need to check labels carefully.\n\nNine: Use OPKS\n\nYou won\u2019t need to break the bank with ovulation predicator kits (OPKS). It can be helpful when trying to conceive.\n\nNine: Limit positions\n\nCertain sexual positions are often thought to be ideal for conception. Find out which and embrace them!",

          "text": "By Rita Okoye\n\nSince it kicked off on Saturday July 24, 2021, the Big Brother Naija reality TV show has been the talk of the town, especially among fun loving Nigerians.\n\nAs viewers get to know the housemates better, more secrets are being spilled, with some contestants entangled in quarrels and others engaged in hot, sizzling romance.\n\nFrom White Money making a mark with his culinary skills to Yousef waxing candid about his personal life, the show is getting hotter by the hour.\n\nPeace as 1st HOH\n\nPeace went on record as the first housemate to emerge the Head of House (HOH) for the Big Brother Naija Shine Ya Eye season 6. She was made the leader after winning the Head of House games. And for her deputy, she chose Yousef. In week 2, Boma Akpore succeeded Peace as the HOH. He picked Jackie B as his deputy.\n\nFirst winnings\n\nJust as Boma became the Head of House in the second week of the show, seven housemates earned their first million-naira prize that same week. Housemates were divided into three groups and given an Airtel challenge, which Group 3 won, smiling home with their first million-naira prize. The lucky ones included White Money, Yerins, Saga, Arin, Angel, Tega, and Beatrice. However, the other housemates were each handed an Airtel mifi as consolation gifts.\n\nAngel: Of mental health and childlessness\n\nAs events continue to unfold, Angel has proved to be the most controversial housemate so far. After going public with her struggles with mental health, she also disclosed her resolve to remain childless.\n\nWhile having a discussion with fellow housemate, Yerins before his eviction, Angel said that mental health is very important to her and there are lots of things she needed to heal from.\n\nWhite Money as viewers\u2019 favourite\n\nIf there is one thing that White Money knows how to do best, it\u2019s to warm his way gradually into the hearts of viewers with humour and remarkable quotes.\n\nWith so many celebrities and fans on social media rooting for him, White Money never ceases to prove he is the content viewers have signed up for.\n\nDespite his continuous clash with Pere, the current Head of House, White Money\u2019s love for cooking is giving him an edge among the housemates. But then, White Money may cease to enjoy his domination of the kitchen for some time, as Pere who emerged the week 3 Head of House sacked him and appointed new \u2018kitchen cabinet members\u2019, saying cooking for the housemates all the time was a strategy being employed by the bearded one to have an edge.\n\nYousef\u2019s open relationship\n\nNot many housemates relish the idea of being in an open relationship, but that is the kind of partnership that Yousef chooses to encourage.\n\nWhile talking with Arin, Yousef revealed that he likes being open and this has fuelled his decision to be in open relataionship.\n\nAnd Liquorose wept\n\nLiquorose wept uncontrollably after last Saturday night party. She became emotional after she got drunk. The professional dancer was seen crying in the toilet. When asked why, she told Tega and Jackie B who came to check up on her that she\u2019s just being emotional. She added that she misses her dad, even as she vowed to make him proud.\n\nOther housemates like Saskay, Cross and Angel also got tipsy aftermath the party.\n\nThe eviction\n\nBeatrice, Yerin and Niyi were last Sunday evicted from the reality show. Beatrice was evicted after Yerins and Niyi were shown the doors. Earlier, the Wildcards, Maria and Pere had nominated Niyi, Whitemoney, Beatrice, Yerins and JayPaul for eviction. However, the Head of House, Boma saved JayPaul and replaced him with Niyi.\n\nFour new housemates\n\nIn between the first eviction, the host, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu introduced four new housemates into the show. They included Michael, Kayvee, Jumoke aka JMK, and Queen.\n\nPere\u2019s regrets\n\nWith Maria refusing his advances, Pere has revealed he regretted picking her as his deputy, and wished he had picked Peace instead.\n\nPere made this known during his conversation with Cross and Boma. He further disclosed that he chose Maria as a deputy with the hope that she would agree to his love advances since they would be sharing the HoH lounge exclusively together.

          "title": "Showdown looms in South- East over sit-at-home order",
          "text": "From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri; Chijioke Agwu, Abakaliki; Okey Sampson, Umuahia; Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu; Obinna Odogwu, Awka, and Aloysius Attah, Onitsha\n\nThe every Monday sit-at-home called by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), to press for the unconditional release of its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, by the Federal Government is eliciting mixed reactions across Igbo land, following its debut, last Monday, August 9. Kanu is facing trial for charges bordering on treason after his rendition from Kenya by Nigerian security agencies. But IPOB has vowed to continue to call for a sit-at-home every Monday until he is released.\n\nReports from our correspondents show that last Monday\u2019s exercise was characterized by loss of lives, destruction of property and disruption of lives, especially the National Examinations Council (NECO) exams in some parts of Igbo land. From Aba to Nnewi, Ohaozara to Enugu-Ezike, Onitsha to Enugu, sad tales continue to roll in as people lick their wounds.\n\nAs Igbo mull the experience, opinions are divided as to the possibility of sustaining the every Monday sit-at-home order. Reports from across the region show that many feel that IPOB should discard the order and come up with a more effective strategy. But if they must go on with the order, some think that they should limit it to the days that Kanu\u2019s case would come up in court while others feel that it should be moved to other days except Monday. We present a state-by-state situation of things as people count their losses after last Monday\u2019s exercise.\n\nENUGU\n\nIn various communities in Enugu-Ezike, Igbo-Eze North Local Government Area, Enugu State, masked men wielding assorted weapons invaded schools, markets, and roadside stalls and left in their trail, tears, sorrows and blood.\n\nRiding on motorcycles, they stormed Community Secondary School, Umuida, and snatched bags containing the day\u2019s question paper and answer sheets from the supervisor, as candidates were getting ready to commence the NECO exams. Teachers and pupils scattered and ran for safety in different directions as soon the gunmen entered the exam hall. At Umuagama Secondary School, they robbed teachers and students of their phones and other valuables at gunpoint, tore the question papers and writing materials before setting the materials ablaze in the school premises.\n\nAt Imufu Secondary School, they unleashed violence on anyone in sight, beat up the Principal, Mrs Cecelia Idoko, and hit another teacher identified as Mr. Ogbonna with an axe, inflicting serious bodily injuries on him. At the time of this report, the teacher was still struggling for his life in an undisclosed hospital.\n\nTraders at Nkwo market, Aji community, lost their wares as the masked men destroyed goods and various food items. The attacks also continued in other communities in the area like Umuogbo-Agu, Okpo, Ogrute and Isiugwu. Though the exercise could be said to have received full compliance in Enugu State, right now some doubts exist as to its weekly continuation. Residents who spoke to Saturday Sun said it will not be in the interest of the region\u2019s economic and social wellbeing.\n\nChuka Ozor, a building material dealer believes that \u201cpeople will not obey this every Monday order thing; it will not work here again.\u201d His reason: \u201cWe are traders in this part of the country and every hour matters a lot to us. Look, my brother\u2019s son could not take the NECO exam last Monday in Anambra. Please, they need to think of a better way of making the Federal Government feel our grievances about Kanu than causing ourselves more hardship and pains.\u201d\n\nA dealer in toilet tissues in Enugu, would want Igbo leaders to meet with the authorities in Abuja and negotiate Kanu\u2019s release. A prominent Igbo man in Enugu who pleaded anonymity for fear of being physically attacked, warned: \u201cWhile I am in support of the struggle for our liberation, I refuse to accept some of their decisions and actions. Just look at that Monday sit-at-home, a day our children were to take a very important paper in the on-going NECO exams, Mathematics. Despite the pleas by our people and the reasonable views of Kanu\u2019s younger brother (Kanunta), they insisted on going ahead with the order and thereby causing their younger brothers and sisters a colossal damage. How do all these affect Aso Rock? Sit-at-home every Monday is a disaster and must not continue. I will suggest that our leaders dialogue with the Presidency to get freedom for Kanu.\u201d\n\nEBONYI\n\nUnconfirmed reports said about eight persons were killed by people suspected to be IPOB enforcers in the Ohaozara-Onicha axis of Ebonyi State during the August 9 sit-at-home. Cars, motorcycles and other property were also destroyed by the attackers. But Saturday Sun investigation shows that while residents of Ebonyi acknowledge the issue of the marginalization of Ndi Igbo, they think that resorting to sitting at home every Monday will amount to self-inflicted economic sabotage.\n\nNdubuisi Anyigor, a commercial bus driver advised the leadership of IPOB to be sensitive to the plight of ordinary people in the region. He noted that there was no wisdom in forcing people to stay at home and be killed by hunger.\n\nMrs. Eunice Ibeh, a petty trader in Abakaliki lamented the killings of Igbo people by their own brothers trying to enforce the sit-at-home orders. She feared that, going by the way Igbo youths are being killed by suspected IPOB sit-at-home enforcers, the zone may soon be devoid of able-bodied youths.\n\nIMO\n\nAt Aboh Mbaise, Imo State, two travellers were said to have burnt to death in a transport company\u2019s bus while two others were allegedly shot dead by gunmen along Nkwogu road, during last Monday\u2019s sit-at-home. Saturday Sun gathered that residents of Imo were not disposed to observing the order until reports of attacks in some other states filtered in.\n\nMany residents are civil servants; so, it was difficult to abide by the directives of IPOB the last time because of earlier warning issued to workers by government on the consequences of not showing up at work. Also, the traders regard Mondays as their peculiar day of sales. Some of them who spoke to our correspondent said they wished the directive were fixed for another day instead of Monday. However, ahead of next sit-at-home exercise, indications are that the people might decide to stay indoors or resist the order.\n\nANAMBRA\n\nIn Anambra, many residents said that they were not happy about the order, stating that it has not added any value to their economy. To them, the frequent lockdowns is like cutting one\u2019s nose to spite one\u2019s face.\u201d\n\nVice President (South East) of National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), Nnonyelu Onyibor, said: \u201cWe can\u2019t be dealing with ourselves believing that we are trying to get at people who don\u2019t like us. \u201cI agree but in a situation where a very small percentage of the people decide to bar people from going out to look for what to feed their children with, is condemnable. We know why we are agitating for Biafa but that is not enough reason to be destroying our own land. The Federal Government may decide not repair what they have destroyed.\u201d He called on the governors of the South East to get the youths actively involved in the discussions of issues affecting them as that, according to him, is the best way to stop their restiveness.\n\nA senior journalist, Achilleus Uchegbu believes that the most ideal thing for IPOB to do is not the destruction of life and property of Igbo people but to secure the services of the best lawyers to work to secure his release.\n\n\u201cIPOB advisers will do very well to help the group to rethink its strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is now very urgent. As it is, the fear of IPOB may not last for too long. Someday, those who fear that their businesses may be attacked by IPOB enforcers may develop a thick skin and decide to face their attackers. Market associations and trade groups may form their own vigilantes to stand up against any IPOB group that comes around to enforce orders. If the situation gets to that point, IPOB may be defeated by the people who will now see it as the enemy of their progress and survival.\u201d\n\nABIA\n\nA public servant, Boniface Igwe said inasmuch as he was not happy with the incarceration of the IPOB leader, he fears the order might be counter-productive. An industrialist who gave his name as Chief Udechukwu said the weekly sit-at-home may force many wealthy Igbo men and women to leave the zone for other places where their businesses can thrive. He, however, suggested that a sit-at-home could be imposed only on the day Kanu will be appearing in court.\n\nA trader, Ifeanyi Madu, said most traders in Aba would prefer to go to market on Mondays and remain at home for the rest of the week because Mondays, according to him, are when customers from outside Igbo land, including neighbouring Cameroun, come to buy goods.\n\nAn importer, Chief Onyebuchi Ikpa, said many of them took loans from banks, noting that the banks would not consider the sit-at-home days when computing days due for repayment.\n\nSome tricycle operators who spoke to Saturday Sun said that they took delivery of them on hire purchase arrangement and would need to recoup their losses. One of them, Eke Igu said they must make remittances for the \u201cGhost Mondays\u201d whether they worked or not. He advised that the sit-at-home order should be streamlined otherwise \u201ceven the enemies of the Igbo would be laughing at us, that we have turned the heat on ourselves.\u201d\n\nFamily of the IPOB leader begs for suspension of sit-at-home order\n\nEmmanuel Kanu, the younger brother to IPOB leader called for the suspension of the sit-at-home order, arguing that doing so will help to give the people a sense of belonging in the march for the actualization of the ideals of the struggle. But IPOB\u2019s spokesman, Emmanuel Powerful said no price was too much for the Igbo to pay in securing their freedom and release of IPOB leader, Kanu. He noted that Biafran children lost education throughout the 30 month of the civil war.",

          "text": "*Buhari: He was a hero; his lofty ideals will continue to motivate all\n\n*Obasanjo: Nigeria would have broken into pieces but for Joda\n\n*An Iroko has fallen, says Atiku\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Deji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha in Abuja and Daji Sani in Yola\n\nElder statesman and former federal \u201cSuper Permanent Secretary\u201d, Ahmed Joda, died yesterday at the age of 91.\n\nIn a swift tribute, President Muhammadu Buhari highlighted Joda\u2019s \u201cmonumental contributions to Nigeria\u2019s unity and progress,\u201d from birth of the nation until his death, saying \u201chis lofty ideals will continue to motivate millions across the nation.\u201d\n\nOne of Joda\u2019s associates, Mohamed Baba told THISDAY that he died in the afternoon at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Yola, after a prolonged illness.\n\nAnother source said Joda had been buried according to Islamic rites.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019m talking to you, the elder statesman has already been taken to the family cemetery for burial,\u201d the source said.\n\nJoda will always be remembered as the chairman of the 18-member transition committee nominated by the President Muhammadu Buhari to receive the handover notes from the Goodluck Jonathan-led administration in 2015.\n\nHe rose through the administrative cadre of the Northern regional government, and then the federal civil service, to retire as Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Industries. During the administration of the youthful General Yakubu Gowon, he was considered to be among a group known as Super Permanent Secretaries.\n\nJoda was born in Girei Local Government Area of Adamawa State in 1930. His great-great-grandfather was Modibbo Raji, a 19th-century Islamic scholar and contemporary of Sheikh Usman Dan Fodio.\n\nHe attended Yola Elementary and Middle schools before proceeding to Barewa College. After completing his secondary education in 1948, he was admitted to Moor Plantation, Ibadan.\n\nHe worked briefly at an agricultural centre in Yola. Then, in the 1950s, he attended Pitman College, London and gained practical experience in journalism while staying in Britain. On his return to Nigeria, he practiced journalism at Gaskiya Corporation, Zaria.\n\nHe later worked with the then Northern Broadcasting Corporation in Kaduna before joining the Northern Nigeria civil service as Chief Information Officer.\n\nJoda became a federal permanent secretary in 1967 in the Ministry of Information and subsequently moved to Lagos.\n\nHe retired into private business during the second Republic, where he served as chairman and board member of various companies, including the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation; Nigerian Communications Commission; SCOA Nigeria; Chagoury Group; Flour Mills of Nigeria, and the Nigerian LNG.\n\nHe was also a member of the 1988 Constituent Assembly which planned the constitutional transition of the Third Republic. In 1999, he was appointed as a member of the Committee to Advise the Presidency on Poverty Alleviation and in 2015, headed the Buhari presidential transition.\n\nBuhari: He was a Hero for all Nigerians\n\nIn his tribute to Joda, who is the last surviving member of Governor Hassan Usman\u2019s Northern Nigeria cabinet, President Buhari highlighted his \u201cmonumental contributions to Nigeria\u2019s unity and progress\u201d, saying \u201chis lofty ideals will continue to motivate millions across the nation.\u201d\n\nThe President, in a release issued by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, noted that the late \u201cSuper Permanent Secretary\u201d, as Joda and some of his colleagues were referred to in the 1970s, \u201cdistinguished himself as a remarkable scholar, journalist, intellectual, public servant and farmer.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari called Joda \u201ca hero for all Nigerians\u201d who, even in death, \u201cwill continue to inspire every generation to move forward with love, brotherhood and harmony.\u201d\n\nHe prayed to Allah to accept his good deeds and grant fortitude to those he left behind in his family, Adamawa Emirate Council and the entire people of the state, to bear the loss, adding, \u201cWe will not forget his sacrifices.\u201d\n\nObasanjo: He was not Just a Nigerian, But, a True and Great Nigerian\n\nEx-President Olusegun Obasanjo described Joda\u2019s death as \u201cheartbreaking\u201d.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, signed by his media aide, Kehinde Akinyemi, Obasanjo said the late Joda was his friend for about 60 years.\n\nThe ex-President explained that the late former Federal Permanent Secretary saved the unity of Nigeria shortly after the 1966 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat when others insisted that Nigeria should collapse.\n\nObasanjo described Joda \u201cas not just a Nigerian, but, a true and great Nigerian, committed to unity, development and progress of the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cOh! What a heartbreaking news, that my friend for well over 60 years has passed to the great beyond. If every Nigerian have the attributes of Joda, Nigeria will have been better than what it is now.\n\n\u201cAhmed Joda by his feature did not need to tell you he is a Fulani man, but, in everything I know he did, he lived not just as a Fulani man, he lived, he worked and he laboured as a true Nigerian. They are not many like him, and that was what strengthens our relationship since 1959,\u201d Obasanjo was quoted to have said.\n\nHe said they met when he was a Second Lieutenant in the Nigeria Army and Joda was a Deputy Chief Information Officer in the Federal Civil service.\n\nObasanjo recalled that the effort of Joda and his other Super Permanent Secretaries as they were fondly called in the then civil service saved Nigeria in 1966.\n\nAccording to the former President, \u201cI know that if not for people like Joda and other Senior Permanent Secretaries, as they were called Super Permanent Secretary as at that time, after the second upheaval of 1966, we would have had Nigeria broken into pieces.\n\n\u201cBut, it was Ahmed Joda and other Super Permanent Secretaries (senior civil servants) like Philip Asiodu, Liman Ciroma, Alison Ayida who prevailed not to have Nigeria broken up.\n\n\u201cWell, Dear Ahmed, you have served your family, your community. You have served your country and indeed humanity, you have done your best, including working for the transition between the Buhari administration and Jonathan administration.\n\n\u201cYou have done your best working with me on the progress and programme of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library. You have done your best on becoming the Chancellor of Bells University. We love you, but God loves you best. Rest permanently in the bosom of Allah,\u201d Obasanjo added.\n\nAn Iroko Has Fallen, Says Atiku\n\nThe former vice president, Atiku Abubakar expressed shock about the death of Joda, saying \u201can iroko tree has fallen.\u201d\n\nIn statement he signed, Atiku said: \u201cToday, our beautiful Adamawa State has lost a colossus. Indeed, an iroko tree has fallen in Nigeria particularly Northern Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe said that the news of the death of Joda, came with some kind of a jolt even though he lived to a prime old age.\n\nThe former vice president said Jorda belonged to the first generation of Adamawa indigenes that put the state and the North in the map of modern Nigeria.\n\nAtiku said: \u201cHis stature as an accomplished administrator was towering and colourful. He was a shining star in the galaxy of Nigeria\u2019s public servants.\n\n\u201cAhmed Joda, with a few of his peers, wrote the rule book of Nigeria\u2019s civil service and his footprints will remain indelible.\n\n\u201cNigeria mourns this great Nigerian with immense contribution to growth of our country, we pray that the Almighty Allah accepts his soul and provide his family with fortitude to bear the loss of a forthright and iconic patriarch.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday admitted the challenges of insecurity bedeviling the country, even as he hailed his government and security agencies\u2019 response to the situation as \u201crobust.\u201d\n\nIn his message at the graduation of Course 29 of the National Defence College (NDC), Abuja, delivered by the Minister of Defence, Maj. Gen. Bashir Magashi (rtd), President Buhari said despite the rising insecurity, his government and the security agencies\u2019 responses had been strong, determined and robust.\n\nHe added that in spite of the challenges, his regime had consolidated the peace in the Niger Delta and recovered vast territories formerly taken over by terrorists in the North East.\n\nThe President said his government was focused on taking the country out of the security challenges.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are making continuous efforts at consolidating the progress made in improving the enabling security environment for peace and development. I commend personnel of the Nigeria Police Force, intelligence and security agencies, as well as local vigilante and community groups for their efforts at securing the nation.\u201d\n\nHe said the government had also focused on non-kinetic actions centred on humanitarian efforts to reduce the distress of the people and improve human conditions.\n\nAccording to him, some of the measures include disarmament, demobilisation and rehabilitation, deradicalisation programmes, political reconciliation measures and instruments of development intervention.\n\nBuhari charged the 96 graduands to \u201cdeploy the eleven months values of knowledge, skills and aptitudes acquired in the college to improving the overall service delivery in the defence of the national security to make the country safer and secured.\u201d\n\nThe president, therefore, renewed his faith in the nation and expressed the determination of his administration to take the country to greater heights by leveraging technological innovations which he said were evident in the profound changes in the national democratic space and policy environment.\n\nIn his remarks, the Commandant of the National Defence College, Rear Admiral Oladele Daji, who had earlier confered the prestigious award of fellow of the NDC on the graduands, appealed for presidential intervention for the speedy completion of projects at the permanent site of the college at Piwoyi, Abuja.\n\nRear Admiral Daji said the completion and relocation of the college to its permanent site would be the icing on the cake of the 30 years anniversary next year since the establishment of the institution.\n\nThe climax of the ceremony was the presentations of certificates and awards to the graduands by the representative of the special guest of honour, who was also led by the commandant to undertake a tour of the college museum.\n\nThe course, which commenced in September 2020, had 22 participants from the Nigerian Army, 25, from Nigerian Navy and 11 from Nigerian Air Force.\n\nThere were 24 participants from Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), comprising six from Nigeria Police, three each from Department of State Service (DSS), National intelligence Agency (NIA) and Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), among others.\n\nThere were also 14 international participants from 10 African countries, Niger, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Mali, Ghana, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Republic of Congo and Chad, as well as from allied counties of Bangladesh, Nepal and Germany.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "FG May Be Liable for N25bn of N45bn Ruling against Shell in Ogoni",
          "text": "*Shell N13.77bn, Total E&P Nigeria N4.59bn, Eni N2.29\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal government, through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), may be liable for roughly N25.24 billion, that is 55 per cent of the total N45.9 billion court-ordered compensation against Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), for oil spillages in Ejama Ebubu community in Ogoni, Rivers State, THISDAY learnt yesterday.\n\nThough, Shell is the operator of the affected oil field, some analysts said last night the Joint Venture (JV) arrangement implied that all the partners would be responsible for the judgment award to the Ogoni community, \u201csince they must all absorb all liabilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe judgment is against one of SPDC\u2019s joint ventures and the partners would have to contribute in the proportion of their interests,\u201d remarked one analyst.\n\nHowever, another analyst said it might not be that straight forward, arguing that all the joint venture partners would only be liable, \u201cdepending on the JV agreement and the operator agreement signed.\n\nShell only runs the operations of joint ventures (JVs) in Nigeria where the federal government is the holder of 55 per cent of the assets.\n\nIf it turns out that all the JV partners are liable for the Ogoni compensation, based on the JV/operator agreement, Shell is expected to pay its share of 30 per cent of the recompense, estimated to be N13.77 billion; Total E&P Nigeria Limited will pay its 10 per cent, about N4.59 billion; while Eni which holds five per cent will pay the least amount of N2.29 billion.\n\nThe affected oil field has the government-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation \u2013 NNPC owning (55 per cent share), SPDC (30 per cent), Total E&P Nigeria Ltd (10 per cent) and the Eni subsidiary Agip Oil Company Limited (five per cent), according to details on Shell\u2019s website.\n\nLast Wednesday, Shell finally agreed to pay an agreed compensation after a long legal battle, which commenced in 1991 over the spill that occurred 31 years ago, but was silent on the liabilities of the JV partners.\n\nJudgment first came in favour of the Ogoni community in 2010, courtesy of Justice Ibrahim Buba of the Lagos division of the Federal High Court.\n\nThe oil giant had initially declined payment and proceeded up to the Supreme Court twice; first in 2017 to appeal the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which had upheld the judgment of the trial court and in 2019, to seek a review of the apex court judgment dismissing its appeal.\n\nAham Ejelamo, a lawyer to Shell, the local arm of the Royal Dutch Company, said the company resolved to pay the monetary compensation awarded in 2010 after several attempts to amend earlier judgement failed.\n\nHe informed the court of the decision to pay up the money and sought permission of the trial judge, Justice Ahmed Mohammed, to make payment through the Chief Registrar of the court in a bank account to be opened for the purpose.\n\nHowever, Mohammed ruled that the money should be paid through the counsel to the Ogoni community, Chief Lucius Nwosu (SAN).\n\nThe development will put further strain on the finances of NNPC, which is currently struggling to meet its obligations to its stakeholders, including the federal and state governments, having been consistently unable to remit up to 30 per cent of its statutory contribution to the federation account for several months.\n\nThose to benefit from the judgment include the people of Ejama Ebubu, a community in Tai Eleme local government area of Rivers State, one of the six kingdoms in Ogoni land, while other kingdoms are Babbe, Eleme, Gokana, Ken-Khana, and Nyo-Khan.\n\nThe Shell\u2019s nod ended the legal tussle that entangled the oil giant and the community for decades.\n\nThe case was instituted in 2001 by 10 representatives of the Ejama Ebubu community against the oil company for the losses caused by the oil spills.\n\nA source at Shell said: \u201cThe spills occurred during civil war\u2026 it was caused by the soldiers. And immediately after the war, we mobilised, cleaned, and remediated the site. We got a certificate from National Oil Spill Detection & Response Agency (NOSDRA) to that effect. The case is one-sided and judgement without justice.\u201d\n\nShell had argued in court: \u201cThis spill was caused by third parties during the Nigerian Civil War, a challenging period, which resulted in significant damage to oil and gas infrastructure in the region. While SPDC does not accept responsibility for these spills, the affected sites in the Ebubu community were fully remediated.\n\n\u201cThe claimants have, at their own admission in court, materially miscalculated and overstated the value of the award previously sought in this case. The ruling of the Supreme Court did not decide liability or the size of the award, which remains in dispute in other ongoing court proceedings.\n\n\u201cIt is our position that any attempt to enforce payment should not be permitted. It is regrettable that the legal process in this case had focused for so long on procedural issues and not the merits of the case. We have always maintained that we are ready to defend this case based on the available facts.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s currently an ongoing negotiation between the federal government and the oil giant as to its future operation in the country, with the company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Ben van Beurden, insisting in May that the company could no longer bear its exposure to the risk of theft and sabotage in the Niger Delta.\n\nWith 19 Oil Mining Leases (OMLs) in its SPDC subsidiary, a THISDAY report quoted Wood Mackenzie , a global research firm, yesterday as valuing Shell\u2019s JV assets in Nigeria, excluding export pipelines and terminals, at $2.3 billion.\n\nShell is planning to sell off all its assets in the shallow waters and onshore, leaving only its offshore operations intact in Nigeria.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

There is a conflict between our culture at the moment and the threat that we face.\u201d\n\nHe, however, assured that preemptory steps to contain it if detected in Nigeria were \u201calready afoot in the proactive system of approach of the center.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "What better place to have lunch than a restaurant accused of racism?\n\nSaharaReporters visited Shi Shi Chinese restaurant on Thursday due to multiple allegations of racism towards Nigerian visitors to the restaurant, located at 21B, Emina Crescent, off Toyin Street, Ikeja, Lagos.\n\nOur Experience\n\nOn arriving Shi Shi, tucked away in a residential area in Ikeja, we approached the gate.\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" we called out to the grumpy and irritated-looking security guard.\n\n\"Who did you come to see?\" he queried. Taken aback by the question, the SaharaReporters correspondent asked: \"Is this not a restaurant?\"\n\nThe security guard looked as if he was contemplating a response, but seemed to think twice about it and stepped back.\n\nThe team proceeded (we came disguised as a company of people who had come to hang out).\n\nThe entrance smelt of something funny, but the source of the smell was not readily visible. There was a show glass displaying what looked like bags made of real leather. We made our way into the dimly-lit restaurant. Inside, we approached the front desk, which had a stern-looking female Chinese national at the register (probably trying to reconcile the books). She barely looked up, save for the Nigerian attendants/waiters who looked completely bewildered and almost shocked that we were standing there.\n\nIn the sitting area, two Asian men were seated, looking on at us. A member of the team turned back and requested with an assertive voice: \"Can I see your menu?\" The announcement was to deflect from our main mission there.\n\nWe were ushered to a seat, five of us on a round table overlooking a transparent glass and an outdoor sitting area. As the menu arrived, so did about three waiters, circling for no reason, with one making as if she wanted to serve tea, all the while peeking into our phones.\n\nThe Wait\n\nAs we awaited our moderately-priced fried rice and spaghetti, we made small talk, sipping the tea. By now, apart from the waiters who looked aloof and were now stationed at strategic points in the restaurant, the stern-looking Chinese lady behind the counter was now sitting close by in the restaurant.\n\nShe beckoned to another lady (Chinese) and spoke something to her in their language, while motioning at us. The new lady in the most inconspicuous manner (even for an amateur) started taking photos of us and recording. I caught her glance and she tried to look away while concealing her phone. Sigh.\n\nWe continued to have conversations and our food began to arrive, the Chinese fried rice first.\n\nIn a bid to what I perceive as remedying our awkward \u2018glance lock\u2019, \u2018Camera lady\u2019 approached our table and offered to teach us how to use chopsticks.\n\nPlease note: while I was preoccupied with documenting our experience with a secret recorder, the team noticed that the two Asian men who were seated and had made their orders \"looked disgusted, got up and made their way into one of the many rooms\" in the restaurant.\n\nThe Show Must Go On\n\nAnd so it began, the overly choreographed friendliness, niceness, half-smiles and forced response to questions. Ya ya (camera lady) was now tutoring us on how to use the chopsticks. A member of the team quickly requested a selfie and with concealed reluctance, she proceeded and everyone was obliged, including me.\n\nI wondered if they took selfies with all their guests or if it was a curated PR move? Soon after, we had to leave and requested takeaway packs for what was left off our spaghetti and fried rice (God forbid it wastes). As we were about to leave, a woman clad in black (Chinese) appeared from one of the many doors.\n\nShe walked up to us and said \"hello\" and stayed there. A member of the team asked for her name and she said Si Si and introduced herself as the manager of the place. One member of the team queried if \"everyone is welcome here?\" to which she simply said \"yes\".\n\nShe then proceeded to accompanying us out the front door (again, what establishment has its manager see customers to the door?). As we exited the building, I noticed the security guard (seemed like a Nigerian from his looks) looked jittery. I couldn't let it go, so I went back to take a photo in front of the building. How else would we prove we came to eat racist spaghetti?\n\nIt turned out the manager was watching from the glass window I described earlier; she hadn't anticipated our abrupt return for a photo.\n\nMore suspicious was the security guard, who suggested I use a wall with some flower pots for the photo as opposed to standing by the entrance which had the name of the establishment carved into it.\n\nIn the End\n\nFrom our findings, interaction with staff and management, we couln't help thinking that Shi Shi resturant is indeed racist, hence the security guard\u2019s inquiry about who we were looking for in a place listed as a public restaurant even on Google. There was also the issue of the staff recording a video of us, the policing while in the restaurant and the manager accompanying us out.

          "text": "The recent cholera outbreak in Nigeria has become dreadful with hundreds of people dying from it and thousands more coming down with the disease. In July alone, TheCable reported that Nigeria recorded 441 deaths from cholera as states across the country record different burden rates of the epidemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) states that cholera is primarily a water-borne disease caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholera and presents with an acute diarrhoeal condition in victims. It is a potentially life-threatening disease and victims can die from dehydration within hours or days of contracting the disease.\n\nGlobally, 1.3 to 4.0 million cases of cholera are recorded annually with 21,000 to 143, 000 deaths, according to WHO.\n\nIn 2021 alone, between January 01 and August 01, the NCDC reported that Nigeria has recorded 31,425 suspected cases of cholera, 311 confirmed cases, and 816 deaths reported from 22 states and FCT.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even this number might be underreported because according to the WHO, the number of cholera cases it received has continued to rise over the last few years and the figures might not even capture the real picture because of limitations in surveillance systems in developing countries.\n\nFLOODS ARE EXACERBATING INFECTION SPREAD\n\nResearch shows that the cholera-causing bacteria are mostly found in the faeces of an infected person and so experts believe it is easily transported by flood when it rains in an environment where people defecate in the open.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChukwumerije Okereke, a professor of global environmental and climate governance and director of centre for climate and development at Alex Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu-Alike, Ebonyi told TheCable that the relationship between cholera and climate change is the change in rainfall patterns which has led to increased rainfall and huge amount of flood.\n\nAccording to him, the huge amounts of flood carry in their path dirt, sewages, and debris which are deposited into water bodies that are used by people for drinking and cooking, and this eventually results in them coming down with the disease.\n\n\u201cThe two key ways in which climate change is having an impact in a range of different ecosystems and physical environments in Nigeria is through change in temperature and change in rainfall pattern, especially the latter which is change in rainfall pattern.\n\n\u201cThis is the reason why we have had a huge amount of flooding. Recall since 2011 Nigeria has experienced a huge amount of incidence of flooding. The flooding event also means that sewage, debris, and all manner of dirt are washed into the water bodies which then people can scoop and drink and this is the reason why we have many outbreaks of diseases including cholera but also dysentery, diarrhea, and other types of diseases. So this is the connection.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, Emmanuel Chukwu, a laboratory analyst, agrees that increased flooding as a result of climate change causes an increase in the spread of the cholera-causing virus.\n\nHe told TheCable that flood occurring during the rainy season serves as the means of transportation for the cholera virus by washing microorganisms from surfaces into water bodies.\n\n\u201cClimate change is a contributing factor, especially flooding. When you see areas that are prone to flooding, there is a tendency that there is going to be a high rate of cholera in such communities,\u201d Chukwu said.\n\n\u201cFlood carries a lot of things with it. This is the rainy season and there has been an accumulation of microorganisms in surfaces, so once the rain starts falling, it washes the microorganisms into the water bodies and many of these communities rely on these water bodies for drinking and for basically everything they do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe explained that the virus which is water-borne multiplies into millions once it comes in contact with water and flood moves the virus from one infected community to different other communities, thereby causing an increase in infection. This he said would naturally not occur if there was no flooding.\n\nIS THERE A SOLUTION?\n\nGoing by the recent climate change report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), \u2014 human activities have caused damages to the earth that will be irreversible over hundreds and thousands of years. This means that climate change impacts like flooding which Nigeria currently experiences cannot easily be wished away soon but would most likely increase in the coming years. If this is the case, then such diseases as cholera will continue to affect even more lives and communities in Nigeria as flood incidences increase in coming years.\n\nOkereke suggests that if Nigeria must tackle cholera, it needs to improve on climate change mitigation and adaptation measures by improving water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure such as adequate and properly channeled drainage systems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe noted that flood carries with it a sludge of dirt, sewage, debris, plastics due to lack of WASH infrastructures in communities across the country and this increases disease spread.\n\n\u201cIf the country is interested in tackling this problem then they would need to ensure that they implement a range of climate mitigation and adaptation measures to reduce the incidence of flood disaster, but also we need to actually improve our WASH systems,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFlooding is a big problem in many other countries even in Europe but the chances that flooding will lead to an outbreak of disease is higher in poor developing countries because of the poor sewage, poor drainage, poor sanitation systems which we run.\n\n\u201cThere is a whopping lack of WASH infrastructure in Nigeria. I think only 30 to 49 percent of Nigerians have access to proper water systems and toilets. And so this is the reason why when you now have this flooding, it can then lead to an increase in diseases.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Chukwu advised that Nigerians need to change their habit of open defecation and also be careful about the water they use.\n\n\u201cThat is why we always advise people should stop open defecation when the rain falls it carries it and flushes it into the water bodies and this is the water body that they use,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPeople should be very careful about the kind of water that they drink and if you must use that water, you ensure you boil them very well. Not warming, there is a difference between warming and boiling. You have to ensure you boil the water very well to ensure at least that the microorganism will be limited, they will be reduced to a minimal rate.\u201d\n\nThis story is published in partnership with Report for the World, a global service programme that supports local public interest journalism.",

          "title": "Beyond funding, MAGIC Fund\u2019s value-add helps early-stage founders scale",
          "text": "For a founder, the startup world is an exciting yet very challenging one.\n\nWhile there have been many startup success stories over the past two decades, globally, the majority fail to make it past early-stage due to a number of reasons; inadequate funding, business model/strategy failure, or product/market challenges.\n\nThe odds are even greater for startups based in emerging regions like Africa, where there is a dearth of funding, an economy-crippling infrastructure gap, a massive consumer base with low purchasing power, political hostility and uncertainty as well as fragmented markets.\n\nA lack of access to capital is often cited as the biggest reason businesses fail in Africa and other emerging markets. But apart from funding, it can be helpful for founders in such markets to also get mentoring \u2013 preferably from people who have first-hand experience \u2013 as they embark on their startup journey with unknowns and untread paths.\n\nWith this in mind, a global collective of startup founders with expertise in several industries and geographies has been providing both access to capital and mentorship to early-stage startups and founders for more than three years.\n\nA fund by founders for founders\n\nMAGIC Fund, launched in 2017, is an early-stage venture capital fund built by founders turned investors. It has 12 founders from across the world who act as general partners with the Co-founder and CEO of Helium Health, Adegoke Olubusi, serving as managing partner, and Matt Greenleaf as operating partner.\n\nThe fund is built on two theses. One, that pooling funds and resources of individual founder-investors together open the group to more opportunities for investments, which they could then evaluate better using their diverse skill sets.\n\nMost founders-turned-investors go the angel investing or venture capital way alone, a practice that often comes with geographical and expertise limitations.\n\nRealising this, Greenleaf and MAGIC\u2019s other partners \u2013 who met Olubusi when Helium Health was going through the Y Combinator accelerator programme in 2017 \u2013 co-invest together.\n\n\u201cMAGIC is like a fund of micro funds built by founders,\u201d Greenleaf told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cBefore we started, we were all into some kind of investing as founders but realised that with our expertise in particular industries, it would make more sense to consolidate our collective intelligence and streamline our angel investment practice through a fund,\u201d he explained.\n\nMAGIC Fund 1 was $1.5 million, comprising the founders\u2019 personal monies according to Greenleaf.\n\nWith its first fund, MAGIC invested in over 70 companies at pre-seed and seed stages across Africa, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Southeast Asia.\n\nHelping founders on their journey\n\nTwo, MAGIC believes that smaller funds run by founders perform best in early-stage investing. Thus, the fund backs startups solving challenges across the world at their earliest stages.\n\nMAGIC has provided founders with more than just money, Greenleaf notes.\n\nUnlike traditional investors whose main focus is getting sweet returns on investments, the founders-investors at MAGIC with startup experience also look out for how much value they can drive for startups invested in.\n\nMAGIC\u2019s investment comes with support for founders through knowledge sharing and sessions with experts in relevant fields. This way, they help early-stage founders find product-market fit, fine-tune business models, and fundraising strategies for successful seed rounds.\n\nAccording to Greenleaf, the Fund\u2019s partners offer mentoring, advice, and network connectivity to support investee-founders as they scale their businesses.\n\n\u201cWe bring that general knowledge and know-how to help other founders run a company from zero to 100,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have people in the team who have started multiple companies and have access to people who have helped build unicorns. With that collective knowledge of the team, we provide mentorship.\u201d\n\nMAGIC Fund\u2019s expanded team.\n\nSome of the startups MAGIC has invested in and supported so far include Bankly, Mono, Eden Life, Evolve Credit, Indicina, Bamboo, Chronus Health, Oxygen, Kiwibot, etc.\n\nBy investing in startups and mentoring early-stage founders, Olubusi believes the way MAGIC Fund operates provides the general partners an opportunity to give back to their ecosystems.\n\n\u201cLater-stage founders whose companies have gone beyond the initial pre-seed, seed, or product-market fit stage have a very critical role to play in facilitating and helping grow their ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the things we get to do at the fund.\u201d\n\nWhat next?\n\nAfter seeing success from its investments \u2013 MAGIC Fund 1 performed 5x over the period of three years, according to Olubusi \u2013 the company has raised a second fund of $30 million announced recently.\n\n\u201cWe had fully deployed the first fund so we thought: why not scale up the strategy since it worked so well and bring a few more people on board?\u201d Greenleaf said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a full-time dedicated team for fund 1 but now have that and 15 general partners who help with different industries. Obviously, $30 million is a lot of money to deploy and manage.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSome of the new partners joining the MAGIC team are the founders of startups invested in under Fund 1 but have exited. According to MAGIC, one-third of the new fund was contributed by the founder-general partners.\n\nMAGIC\u2019s limited partner base is diverse, with 50% of them black and 33% women. Some of the LPs are Paystack\u2019s Shola Akinlade, Olugbenga Agboola, the CEO of Nigeria\u2019s Flutterwave, and Hendra Kwik of Payfazz in Southeast Asia, Katie Lewis, Michael Seibel, Kirsten Connell of Octopus Ventures, Tim Draper, etc.\n\nJoining as partners are Evercare\u2019s Temi Awogboro, Troy Osinoff, Tom Chen of Stitchroom, Elvis Zhang of Oxy2, Medumo\u2019s Adeel Yang, and Juice\u2019s Michael Lisovetsky.\n\nMagic Fund 2 will be writing $100,000 to 300,000 checks at pre-seed and seed stages, Greenleaf revealed. The global fund is sector agnostic and plans to focus on fintech, healthcare, SaaS and enterprise, women\u2019s health, developer tools, etc.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "title": "Wellness: A day at the Dew centre in Lagos",
          "text": "Lagos is a busy, exciting, and yet very stressful city. Personally speaking, working in Apapa, and living on what Lagosians call the \u2018island\u2019 can sometimes mean up to 3 hours in traffic on any given day. I always joke and say that the traffic alone in Lagos, can break up relationships and I would be curious to test that hypothesis.\n\nThe bustle and hustle of the most populous city in Africa can be exhilarating in some ways, yet ever so chaotic at the same time. I always say that if you can live in Lagos, you can pretty much live anywhere. Hate it or love it Lagos is Lagos, and it is important to create a balanced wellness routine to offset the day-to-day stresses.\n\nRead also: Is Slow the most exclusive restaurant in Lagos?\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic somewhat made everyone take a much-needed pause and many people found themselves idle at home in their thoughts. The lockdown forced many to start practising wellness and exercise routines at home, focusing on a concept called \u201cself-care\u201d. Self-care is not synonymous with self-indulgence or being selfish. Self-care means taking care of your mental and physical health, so you have the ability to do all the things you wish to accomplish on a daily basis: excel at your job or business and help care for others.\n\nWellness in Lagos\n\nWellness according to the Global Wellness Institute is \u2018the active pursuit of activities, choices, and lifestyles that lead to a state of holistic health\u2019. Wellness has always been an important part of my work-life balance, so I was excited to discover wellness at the Dew Centre which is located on 31 Adebayo Doherty Streetin the upscale neighbourhood of Lekki Lagos.\n\nThe Dew Wellness Centre\n\nThe Dew Centre is the brainchild of notable interior designer and wellness advocate, Omon Anenih-Mordi and Africa\u2019s first design consultancy, boutique hotel and wellness centre. It promises its clientele a safe space for self-discovery and healing from the hustle and bustle of Lagos city.\n\nOur visit to the DEW Center was exhilarating and relaxing. Upon arrival, we were warmly welcomed with a smile. We were taken on a mini-tour of the sensory garden, spa and amazing health and wellness facilities. As we stepped foot in the DEW centre, we were fascinated by the amazing art pieces and the beautiful, artistic and creative images that paid homage to the African woman in all shapes and sizes.\n\nThe DEW centre\u2019s ambience is serene and peaceful. We opted for the Viny\u0101sa yoga class and I can say that it strengthened my core, relieved my stress and gave me some high-intensity workout training. We had a wonderful instructor Tunde (@lifelongfitnessintl on Instagram). He was just perfect: courteous and patient and designed the session to cater to our specific fitness capacity. Boffy also enjoyed it thoroughly and are now committed to practising yoga daily.\n\nBenefits of yoga\n\nYoga is a great way to work on your flexibility and strength. Just about everyone can do it. It\u2019s not just for people who can touch their toes or want to meditate. Some types of yoga are about relaxation, whilst others are similar to the one we practised at the Dew centre, make you move more. Most types focus on learning poses, called asanas.\n\nThey also usually include attention to breathing. Yoga poses work by stretching your muscles. They can help you move better and feel less stiff or tired. In one study, people improved their flexibility by up to 35% after only 8 weeks of yoga.\n\nThere is a misconception that yoga is an alternative to religious practice; it is not and has nothing to do with worship. You can actually burn up to 1000 calories in a one-hour session. I have practised yoga before, but I was seriously challenged.\n\nSome styles of yoga, such as ashtanga and power yoga, are very physical. Many of the poses, such as downward dog, upward dog, and the plank pose, build upper-body strength. The standing poses, especially if you hold them for several long breaths, build strength in your hamstrings, quadriceps, and abs. Poses that strengthen the lower back include the upward dog and the chair pose. When done right, nearly all poses build core strength in the deep abdominal muscles.\n\nAfter our workout session, we went on to have a full body massage, and it was wonderful and soothing. The massage room was beautiful, the background music had a tranquil and calming effect, and the masseuse was polite and professional.\n\nThe Dew massage rooms are very relaxing, you will not miss the breathtaking photographs by renowned Nigerian photographer Kelechi Amadi- Obi. The series of photographs which I will dare to call pieces of art is entitled \u201cThe Bare Exhibition\u201d which features a series of carefully curated photographs with nude subjects that explore the theme of freedom, self-exploration, self-acceptance, and identity through a study of the female form. \u201cThe bare exhibition is focused on the female form, but it is more than just the body. It is about self-acceptance, body confidence, owning your truth, and stepping out of the shadows, and into the light\u201d says Omon Anenih-Mordi.\n\nBenefits of massage therapy\n\nWhen it comes to relaxation, there are a few things we all associate with that it, and a massage definitely one of them. It is great for relaxation and has therapeutic benefits, too. The term \u201cmassage\u201d itself actually encompasses a wide array of different types of massage, ranging from Swedish massage (the most common type) to massages that have a more targeted and specific purpose, like a sports massage, which is aimed at helping athletes recover.\n\nNo matter the type of massage, the benefits come down to one thing: pressure. \u201cThe skin is moved during a moderate pressure massage, which results in a calming and slowing of the nervous system,\u201d says Tiffany Field, PhD, director at the University of Miami School of Medicine. Massage therapy also has these benefits: decrease in heart rate lowered blood pressure, and changes in EEG patterns (electrical activity in your brain).\n\nWhat I find unique about the Dew Centre is that it\u2019s not just a spa or yoga studio in Lagos, they use design to take the concept of total wellness while recognizing that a person\u2019s every thought, word, experience and behaviour affects their greater health and wellbeing. The wellness centre\u2019s design of spaces, as well as all the services, ensure the promotion of education, clarity, connection, common sense, empathy, and well-being. The Dew centre is the first of its kind in Africa, mixing elements of design, education and wellness.\n\nThe Food and the Sensory garden\n\nTo round up our experience we had a light lunch at Angelo\u2019s caf\u00e9 in the Sensory Garden, which is a literal garden area where you can relax while enjoying some tea and light lunch. It was beautiful scenery and offered tranquillity as we munched on our salmon and turkey sandwiches while enjoying the soft breeze and the freshness from the exotic collections of plants. The Dew Centre offers the possibility to become a plant mom or dad. They offer plant care services as well. It was the perfect way to round up our day and we felt re-energized.\n\nWe left the DEW centre feeling excited, rejuvenated and relaxed. We will definitely be back for more yoga classes, massages, and also to check out their counselling services, because mental health is as important as physical health. What I love most is that wellness is an inside-out experience at The Dew Centre, and I encourage you to take a break from the hustle and bustle of Lagos and spend some time at the Dew.\n\nTo find out more visit www.thedewcentre.com",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s palm oil producers posted their highest profit in six years in the first half of 2021 as the industry continues to reap the gains of a boom in local demand.\n\nOkomu Oil Palm Company and Presco PLC, the largest players in Nigeria\u2019s oil palm space collectively recorded a revenue increase of 67 percent year on year in the first half of 2021, reaching N45.09 billion from N26.98 billion in 2020. The profit after tax of both firms surged by a combined 134 percent to N19.7 billion from N8.4 billion, according to data compiled by BusinessDay.\n\nPalm oil producers are still reaping benefits of the policies established by fiscal and monetary authorities, especially the ban placed on accessing forex for palm oil importation into the country and the impact of the border closure exercise which has encouraged patronage of locally made products.\n\nIn addition to this, both companies\u2019 revenue increased on the back of increased demand for their products, which has been a trend since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic as consumer\u2019s preference for essential products rather than luxurious products grew.\n\nInvestment bank, United Capital, in a recent report, gives an optimistic projection about the future of the Palm oil industry in Nigeria as the key player continues to invest aggressively in capacity expansion.\n\n\u201cHowever, considering the volatility in government policy due to change of government, there is a medium to long-term downside risk of policy reversal,\u201d United Capital analysts said.\n\nRead also: CBN distributes N820m worth of inputs to Ekiti rice farmers\n\nOkomu Plc had a revenue surge of 75 percent to N23.6 billion from N13.5 billion in the previous year.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s telecommunications company, 9mobile has restated its support for youth entrepreneurship and innovation, urging Nigerian youth to take advantage of the incredible opportunities that technology offer to optimize their businesses and professional endeavors.\n\nThe telecom company stated this during a virtual session, titled \u201cDriving Youth Innovation in Business through Technology\u201d, organized by 9mobile to mark this year\u2019s International Youth Day.\n\nThe session which was facilitated on Instagramlive by popular business coach, Tricia Olufemi-Olumide (Tricia Biz) and social entrepreneur, Olusola Amusan, attracted several young participants who joined in to learn more on how they can leverage technology and innovation to drive business efficiency.\n\nDefining innovation, Tricia Biz noted that innovation doesn\u2019t necessarily mean inventing something new or that has never been done before, but simply about improvement. \u2018It is improving your current business to achieve your goals & objectives, grow your income, reach more people and impact more people.\u2019\n\nWhile speaking further on business model and process innovation, Tricia encouraged businesses to consider and explore the subscription-based market model which has tripled in recent times. \u201cThere is no better way to grow your business than to take advantage of the subscription market to get your product on repeat order. The subscription market has grown tremendously especially with Covid 19. Just finding an innovative way to make your existing customers to become paying subscribers can make that difference in your numbers,\u201d she said.\n\nOn his part, Olusola Amusan noted that with digitalization and globalization, the economic impact of technology and innovation is compelling and huge for the youths and entrepreneurs. He stated, \u201cAs a business owner you must constantly familiarize yourself with emerging technologies to stay relevant with time. In addition, you must then educate your team to achieve better workplace collaboration.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the purpose of the session, the Executive Director, Regulatory and Corporate Affairs, 9mobile, Mr. Abdulrahman Ado noted that the discussions tied into the global theme for this year\u2019s international youth day celebration, \u201cTransforming Food Systems: Youth Innovation for Human and Planetary Health\u201d which highlights the very strategic and important roles youths play in the general context of the global economy for growth and sustainability.\n\n\u201cThere is a remarkable increase in the number of young entrepreneurs springing up on a daily basis in the business space, this for us is a welcome development and must be encouraged with all the necessary infrastructure needed technologically speaking. Youths must therefore not hesitate to embrace innovative technology for their respective businesses to succeed,\u201d Ado stated.\n\nThe international youth day is celebrated annually on 12th August to highlight youth-impacting issues to the international community and to celebrate the potentials of young people as active partners in the global society.",

We know that Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu had been in London about the same time the president was there.\n\n\u201cLike you said, we don\u2019t believe what we read in social media but we have read a lot about Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s health, so the president\u2019s visit was a goodwill visit.\n\n\u201cThe president still has two years less than three months in his tenure of office. So, for him to start supporting somebody now will just be like jumping the gun and you know that President Buhari will never do that.\n\n\u201cBefore the 2019 election, people began to campaign for him before INEC blew the whistle for the campaign to start. He was the one who came out to say \u2018no, don\u2019t do it; don\u2019t jump the gun\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe president himself will dare not jump the gun in terms of supporting one candidate or the other. Also, recall that he had said anybody that wants to be president after him should go out and work. That means the president may not be supporting anybody until maybe perhaps a candidate of the party emerges. Knowing President Buhari, he will never jump the gun.\u201d",

          "text": "Brentford celebrated their return to the top tier after a 74-year absence with a memorable, magnificent victory over woeful Arsenal as they opened their Premier League campaign in style.\n\nThomas Frank\u2019s side were vibrant, skilful and energetic on a night of high emotion at the Brentford Community Stadium, making the perfect start to the season, but inflicting serious pain on the Gunners in a sobering 90 minutes for the visitors.\n\nBrentford took to life in the big time with ease and fully deserved the lead given to them after 22 minutes when Sergi Canos drove low past keeper Bernd Leno at the near post, although Arsenal complained bitterly that the ball had gone out of play in the build-up.\n\nOnly Emile Smith Rowe truly rose above the mediocrity for Arsenal, forcing a save out of Brentford keeper David Raya \u2013 who also brilliantly denied Nicolas Pepe late on \u2013 before the home fans exploded in noise and elation when they scored a second with 17 minutes left.\n\nArsenal, without strike pair Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang through illness, paid the price for a hopeless attempt to defend substitute Mads Sorensen\u2019s routine long throw. New \u00a350m defender Ben White was particularly culpable as Christian Norgaard arrived to head home.\n\nBrentford\u2019s supporters, understandably, celebrated wildly at the final whistle, but this was a result and performance that instantly turns the spotlight on Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta as he desperately needs an improvement on last season.\n\nBrentford could not have made a better start to life in the Premier League, showing the pedigree that has made them such an entertaining side on their journey to this stage.\n\nOn a thunderous night at the Brentford Community Stadium, the arena was alive with noise and excitement well before kick-off \u2013 and what happened when the action started only raised those levels.\n\nTough days will inevitably lie ahead for the top-flight newcomers, but this was a night when the Bees showed what they were all about under charismatic manager Frank.\n\nOnce they realised Arsenal had little offer after the early exchanges, Brentford took charge and Bryan Mbeumo had already struck the post before Canos opened the scoring.\n\nThey grew in confidence, winning the physical challenges, attacking swiftly and, on the rare occasions he was called upon, keeper Raya looked a class act.\n\nFrank and his players rightly savoured the moment at the final whistle \u2013 in front of supporters who did themselves huge credit with the standing ovation given to Arsenal substitute Bukayo Saka, who was racially abused after missing a penalty in England\u2019s Euro 2020 final loss to Italy.\n\nThis was quite simply how Brentford would have scripted it. No-one can begrudge them their victory \u2013 and the manner in which they revelled in it.",

          "title": "The Devastating Flood That Left Taraba Residents Hopeless",
          "text": "Solomon Simon woke up in the morning of Thursday, August 5, to a flooded house. In panic, the middle-aged man quickly moved his children out of the building before trying to salvage some of his properties.\n\nBut most \u2013 including precious livestock \u2013 were already submerged in the flood.\n\n\u201cBefore I came back to recover the animals, the water had increased,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just rushed out and left them there because I cannot predict what could happen.\u201d\n\nSimon\u2019s was just one among many families affected by the recent flooding in Taraba State. Elvis Joseph\u2019s was another.\n\n\u201cAt exactly 6am, there was a heavy rainfall,\u201d Joseph told Channels Television. \u201cThe whole place was flooded all of a sudden and there was a car parked here. Before we knew it, it was swept away.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing we can do actually, and the destruction is enormous. It is something we never planned for, but we thank God that we still have shelter over our heads. This is the second time this is happening. Some of us are still counting our losses till now.\u201d\n\nRelocating To Higher Grounds\n\nParts of Taraba State \u2013 especially the river belt areas \u2013 are particularly prone to flooding. Residents of Jalingo \u2013 the state capital \u2013 were not left out of the tragedy.\n\nThe August 5 incident was the second time in less than one month that communities would be ravaged by high waters, with valuables worth millions of naira destroyed \u2013 buildings, farmlands, vehicles.\n\nState authorities also confirmed the death of a teenager in the recent flooding.\n\nAccording to the Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, the flooding is caused by people who have encroached on the river valleys in the state.\n\nThe way out of the problem, for him, is to discourage people from settling in the valleys and relocate to higher grounds.\n\nBut the government, in the meantime, is making efforts to ease the effect of the flooding on the people.\n\n\u201cThe first thing is to immediately send food supplies to all these people because most of them, their houses have been completely damaged,\u201d said Ishaku.\n\n\u201cWe need to support them with what to eat immediately and the second stage will be how they can reconstruct their houses, but not in the same area because they are all in the low valley of the rivers.\n\n\u201cAny flooding again in the future will be worse. We had this issue in 2005 and this looks a bit worse than that.\u201d\n\nIt, however, appears that the government\u2019s effort is being sabotaged by officials responsible to distribute palliatives to the victims.\n\nWhile some didn\u2019t get any relief, the little received by others was as good as nothing.\n\nAn Avenue To Loot?\n\nYohanna Obidah, whose family was also affected, said, \u201cWe did not benefit from anything. We did not even see anything, nobody came to capture anything.\n\n\u201cBut our (community) leader said some people came to the area and captured (documented) some (residents) but we were not around. So our names are not included on the list and we did not see anything.\n\n\u201cMy neighbour later brought groundnut oil in a pet bottle (50cl) that they distributed to people and he brought for us, but we said we do not want it.\u201d\n\nBeyond the sad feeling of watching their properties soaked or swept away by the powerful torrent, some residents had other problems to deal with.\n\n\u201cSome of our properties that we were unable to move as a result of the flood, we saw some guys from nowhere entering the water to pick them,\u201d Joseph lamented.\n\n\u201cAnd when we attempted to claim our properties, they claimed they were their valuables swept away by the flood. Others came from behind and entered some houses to pick some valuables.\u201d\n\nAs the question of what was responsible for the flooding continued to beg for answers, Alfred had an opinion contrary to the position of the governor who blamed it on encroachment on river valleys.\n\nThe middle-aged man believes the erection of buildings on water channels contributes largely to the situation the people have found themselves in.\n\nHe advised the authorities not to add to the problem but embark on a campaign to discourage the people from obstructing the free flow of water by building structures on drainage channels.\n\n\u201cOur government is not helping matters; they need to sensitise people,\u201d said Alfred. \u201cThey need to organise even if it is a seminar to create awareness and educate people not to settle here (on water channels).\n\n\u201cIf we knew this would happen, we would not have settled here and I pray that Taraba State government and Nigerian Government will come to our aid.\u201d",

          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has called for a reform of the Nigerian civil service by doing \u201csomething bold and big that will make a difference.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, a mass housing policy for all civil servants fits into this \u201cbold and big\u201d agenda, a statement signed by presidential spokesperson Laolu Akande on Friday said.\n\nProf Osinbajo reportedly made the comment on Thursday at the Presidential Villa when he received a brief on the Federal Civil Service Strategy & Implementation Plan 2021-2025, presented by the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Dr Folashade Yemi-Esan.\n\nThe meeting is a Presidential Level Briefing of the reform process of the Federal Civil Service which has been on since 2017.\n\nThe reform is being led by Steering and Implementation Committees with membership drawn from the public and private sectors with the engagement of development partners.\n\nThursday\u2019s meeting was attended by the Attorney General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami; Ministers of Labour & Employment, Dr Chris Ngige; Finance, Mrs Zainab Ahmed; Ministers of State, Budget & National Planning, Prince Clem Agba; and Works and Housing, Engr. Abubakar Aliyu.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the President on Economic Matters, Dr. Adeyemi Dipeolu, some of Nigeria\u2019s development partners including officials of the World Bank and the President of the Africa Initiative for Governance, Mr Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, (a private sector representative and member of Steering Committee) were also present.\n\nSpeaking after listening to Dr Yemi-Esan\u2019s presentation and subsequent contributions by ministers and other participants at the meeting, the Vice President noted that \u201cit is evident that perhaps, for the first time in a long time, some very serious attention is being paid to all of the various issues in our civil service.\u201d\n\nAccording to Osinbajo, \u201cI think that we should really do something that is bold, big and that will really make the difference in order to address some of the issues especially that of accommodation for civil servants.\n\n\u201cWe can do much more with mass housing. We have a target now of 300,000 houses under our ESP social housing scheme. CBN has allocated N200 billion, but we have seen that we can provide mass housing, and we can make civil servants beneficiaries of the scheme.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough the housing scheme is very modest, it is the sort of thing that we can at least do, to begin to take into account, the fact that everybody who worked for the civil service deserves to live in their own home. There must be a strategy for giving everybody a place to live in,\u201d Osinbajo added.\n\nMaking the point about access to affordable homes being one of the easiest ways to get people out of poverty, Prof Osinbajo said \u201cit is a vital part of what we are trying to do\u201d, noting that \u201cwe must address it. A civil servant ought to be able to own a home, and justify to his family the reason why he went for the job\u201d.\n\nRelating his experience while serving as Attorney General in Lagos State, Prof. Osinbajo said that like what was done with the reform of the Lagos State Judiciary, fixing the welfare of federal civil servants would be key to addressing challenges associated with productivity and corruption.\n\nThe Head of the Civil Service of the Federation also presented a report on the implementation status of the Federal Civil Service Strategy Plan 2017-2021.\n\nEarlier in her presentation, Dr Yemi-Esan identified staff welfare particularly, remuneration and housing as areas that require better focus and urgent intervention by the Federal Government.\n\nShe appealed for improved support, particularly in funding the implementation of successive strategy and implementation plans to overhaul the service for better productivity.\n\nThe Head of the Civil Service of the Federation said the current reform in the Federal Civil Service has enabled government to save huge sums through the verification of personnel payroll and digitization of some operations, among others.\n\nThe Head of Service would continue to lead the reform process as the 2021-2025 plan goes forward to the Federal Executive Council for approval.\n\nThursday\u2019s meeting featured comments and observations on the proposed plan tabled on behalf of the Steering Committee chaired by the Head of Service.",

          "title": "Grief Grips South African Town after Gruesome Vigilante Killings",
          "text": "For Philisiwe Ngcobo, 45, a crippling wave of anxiety began to set in when the sun went down and her 34-year-old brother, Bhekinkosi Ngcobo, had not returned home.\n\n\u201cMy brother left our house around 6pm to find fuel in Phoenix; when he didn\u2019t return we started to look for him everywhere,\u201d said Ngcobo. \u201cThe next time I saw my brother was at a mortuary.\u201d\n\nHer brother was brutally beaten to death and his car burned beyond recognition on July 12.\n\nViolent protests, riots and looting rocked South Africa in July for more than a week, leaving more than 300 dead and hundreds of businesses destroyed.\n\nAmid the unrest, historical racial tensions between African and Indian communities exploded in Phoenix \u2013 a predominantly ethnically Indian town on the outskirts of Durban, KwaZulu-Natal province.\n\nAccording to official reports, groups of Indian residents in Phoenix and surrounding areas formed vigilante groups to protect their property. Allegedly armed with semiautomatic rifles, machetes and pistols, the groups formed illegal roadblocks and burned tyres to bar access to their areas.\n\nThese initiatives, Police Minister Bheki Cele said in a press briefing in Phoenix on August 3, gave birth to the \u201cheinous criminal and racist incidents that resulted in brutal killings and injuries, horrendous damage to property, and untold pain and trauma\u201d.\n\nThirty-six people died in Phoenix during the unrest.\n\nA neighbour, who was with Ngcobo\u2019s brother and survived the gruesome attack, told Ngcobo that there were 15 to 20 assailants, and claimed that two police officers stood by as the attack took place.\n\nStill reeling from the loss, Ngcobo feels palpable anger. No one has yet been arrested for the killing. But she is hopeful that police officers who allegedly witnessed the crime can help.\n\n\u201cI want them to point out my brother\u2019s killers,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to police minister Cele, 33 people have been arrested for the killings that took place during the week of riots in Phoenix. He said that a 31-member detective team was working with a team of prosecutors to ensure justice for the lives lost in Phoenix.\n\n\u201cPolice investigations found that 36 people were killed in Phoenix, 30 people were shot, two were burned to death, one was stabbed and one was run over,\u201d he said.\n\nCommunity activists, however, insist that the real number of deaths is almost double the official toll.\n\nJackie Shandu, the organiser of the Justice for Victims of Phoenix Massacre community group set up in the wake of the violence, claims a source at the Phoenix mortuary told them at least 74 people were murdered during the unrest.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t reveal the name of the staff member at the mortuary at this time, but the real number is appallingly high,\u201d Shandu said.\n\nThe grassroots group made up of families of victims and community members marched to City Hall in Durban recently demanding justice and systemic change.\n\n\u201cThe apartheid legacy that put Indians above Africans in the economic hierarchy of this society laid the foundation for Indian people to look down on us \u2013 not just in Durban, in South Africa as a whole,\u201d said Shandu.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t just want compensation for the families who lost their loved ones, we want substantive economic inclusion of Black people.\u201d\n\nEconomic inequality across racial lines remains stark in South Africa. The average monthly salary was 6,899 rand ($469) for Black South Africans, 14,235 rand ($967) for Asian South Africans, and 24,646 rand ($1,674) for white South Africans, according to a Statistics SA report released in February 2020.\n\nAccording to Shandu, the traumatic incidents of racial violence in Phoenix left many survivors facing destitution.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that a lot of survivors have sustained life-altering injuries. One man had his hands chopped off,\u201d Shandu said.\n\nKwaZulu-Natal provincial police said they are also investigating 52 cases of attempted murder, 16 cases of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and nine cases of common assault from the unrest in Phoenix and surrounding areas.\n\nGcina Yandeni, 26, quit her job as a domestic worker for an Indian family in Phoenix on July 12, following the violence that engulfed the community. She described the man she worked for as being \u201cout for blood\u201d.\n\nAccording to Yandeni, in response to stories of looting and riots, the Indian community in Clayfield, Phoenix formed a WhatsApp group and named it \u201cneighbourhood watch\u201d the night that vigilantism started in her area.\n\n\u201cAt around 7pm, my boss went to a meeting where over 200 Indian people had converged; they dispersed shortly and my boss came in to get his firearms,\u201d said Yandeni.\n\n\u201cHe looked excited; his eyes looked crazy.\u201d\n\nYandeni alleges that her former employer later bragged that he joined the large group and went down to the petrol station where they barricaded the road with burning tyres and large rocks, and would open fire on \u201canything black, even black dogs\u201d.\n\nWith 25,000 members of the South African National Defence Force still deployed in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces, calm on the streets of Phoenix seems to have been restored.\n\nBut many feel that the government\u2019s and police\u2019s responses to the violence and unrest that unfolded have been grossly inadequate.\n\nOn July 12, Ntwenhle Mhlongo\u2019s 19-year-old son, Sanele Mngomezulu, was shot dead \u2013 allegedly by vigilantes \u2013 while driving with friends. His body was dumped on the side of the road in Trenance Park Drive, Phoenix.\n\nAccording to Mhlongo, the police have provided little information about the investigation and have not told her whether any arrests have been made in relation to her son\u2019s murder.\n\n\u201cThey keep speaking about property, but my son was looted,\u201d said Mhlongo. \u201cI just want justice for my son.\u201d\n\nSouth African Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane told Al Jazeera in a telephone interview that the authorities acted too slowly.\n\n\u201cThere were multiple preventative measures that the police could have taken as soon as personal accounts of racial profiling and targeted assaults started to emerge, like increased visibility in affected areas,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere were videos of Black people being shot execution-style by people brandishing illegal firearms and nothing was done to stop the vigilantism,\u201d added Mkhwebane.\n\nIn addition to allegations over the police\u2019s lax response, Mkhwebane accused the mainstream media of largely failing to cover the racial violence.\n\n\u201cThe media failed to be the voice of the marginalised at a time when it was most imperative,\u201d she said.\n\nMinistry of Police Spokesperson Lirandzu Themba told Al Jazeera that a full investigation has been launched into the conduct and response of the police during the unrest.\n\n\u201cWe understand some of the allegations being made against the police\u2019s response as well as involvement of private security firms in the violence that took place in Phoenix, and we are investigating all concerns,\u201d Themba said.\n\nA veteran police officer from Chatsworth Police Station in Durban, who wished not to be named for fear of reprisal, told Al Jazeera: \u201cSometimes the situation doesn\u2019t allow us to combat criminals head-on, but now that there are resources, we are moving in swiftly to arrest the criminals.\u201d\n\nThe officer, who is Black, said he was not on the ground when the violence was taking place due to fears over his own safety.\n\n\u201cA lot of us were scared that they might kill us as well. They don\u2019t care about the uniform; they see a Black man,\u201d he said.\n\nOn July 24, the day Ngcobo laid her brother to rest, community members filled the funeral venue\u2019s capacity.\n\n\u201cMy brother was senselessly killed. We just want justice. We want closure,\u201d an impassioned Ngcobo told the almost 100 people in attendance.\n\n\u201cLawlessness prevailed and now we, on the other side of the hill, sink deeper in despair.\u201d\n\nChris Biyela, the organiser of a peace committee made up of community members elected from Phoenix and surrounding areas, says that in order for peace to truly be restored, the culprits that took part in vigilantism must be held accountable for the bloodshed.\n\n\u201cA lot of the senseless killings were recorded; the police must use these videos as evidence to bring the culprits to book. Black people want peace between the communities. But first, we want justice.\u201d\n\nAl Jazeera",

          "text": "The first US troops are arriving in Afghanistan to help diplomatic staff and others leave, as many countries scramble to evacuate workers and citizens amid a rapid Taliban advance.\n\nOn Friday, militants captured Pul-e-Alam, capital of Loghar province, just 80km (50 miles) from the capital Kabul.\n\nThe UN chief said the situation was spinning out of control with devastating consequences for civilians.\n\nMore than 250,000 people have been forced to leave their homes so far.\n\nThe Taliban advance comes as US and other foreign troops withdraw after 20 years of military operations. The fighting has raised fears that gains in human rights made since the militants were ousted from power in 2001 could be swiftly reversed.\n\nLife under the Taliban in the 1990s saw women forced to wear the all-covering burka, education restricted for girls over 10, and brutal punishments including public executions.\n\nAlso on Friday, the Taliban seized the country\u2019s second-largest city Kandahar and the nearby city of Lashkar Gah, as well as Herat in the west. They now control about a third of Afghanistan\u2019s provincial capitals.\n\nPentagon spokesman John Kirby called the recent advances \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d, but downplayed any suggestion that Kabul was under imminent threat from the group.\n\nMost of the 3,000 troops being sent to help evacuate US diplomatic staff will arrive by the end of the weekend. The US intends to airlift thousands of people a day out of Kabul.\n\nThe latest US intelligence assessment suggests the militants could try to advance on the national capital within 30 days.\n\nThe US embassy there informed staff that an incinerator and other tools were available to destroy sensitive material, including documents and equipment such as flags that could be used in propaganda.\n\nThe UK, which is sending 600 troops to aid the evacuation of British nationals and former Afghan staff, said staffing at its embassy would be reduced to an absolute minimum \u2013 as did Germany.\n\nDenmark and Norway are closing their embassies altogether.\n\nUS-led forces toppled the Taliban: In 2001 US-led forces overthrew Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban rulers after the 9/11 attacks masterminded by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was based there.\n\nTwenty years of occupation and military operations followed: The US and allies oversaw elections and built up Afghan security forces, but the Taliban continued to launch attacks.\n\nEventually the US made a deal with the Taliban: They would pull out if the militants agreed not to host terrorist groups. But talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government failed. US-led forces withdrew this year and the Taliban have now retaken most of the country.\n\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called on the Taliban to end the fighting and urged the international community to make clear that power seized through military force is unacceptable.\n\n\u201cEvery day the conflict is taking an even bigger toll on women and children. Continued urban conflict will mean continued carnage with civilians paying the highest price,\u201d he said.\n\nFood and medical supplies are dwindling and critical infrastructure including schools and clinics has been destroyed, he said. The UN has appealed to neighbouring countries to keep their borders open, to allow people to reach safety.\n\nMore than 1,000 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the past month alone, according to the UN.\n\nMakeshift camps have been established on scrubland on the outskirts of the capital, while many of those seeking safety in Kabul have been sleeping on the streets.\n\nAbout 72,000 children are among those fleeing to the capital in recent days, according to Save the Children.\n\nZuhal, a 20-year-old student who has been helping those displaced, told the BBC: \u201cCeasefire, just like an immediate ceasefire, just stop the fighting because we cannot get up another day and see a child filled with blood, a mother crying for her son \u2013 we cannot see that anymore.\u201d\n\nIn a separate development, Canada said it planned to resettle more than 20,000 vulnerable Afghans including women leaders, human rights workers and reporters.",

          "title": "Nigeria: NNPC May Be Liable for 55% of $110m Oil Spillage Ruling against Shell in Ogoni",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government, through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), may be liable for roughly N25.24 billion (about $60m), that is 55 per cent of the total N45.9 billion (about $110m) court-ordered compensation against Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), for oil spillages in Ejama Ebubu community in Ogoni, Rivers State, THISDAY learnt on Friday.\n\nThough, Shell is the operator of the affected oil field, some analysts said Friday the Joint Venture (JV) arrangement implied that all the partners would be responsible for the judgment award to the Ogoni community, \u201csince they must all absorb all liabilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe judgment is against one of SPDC\u2019s joint ventures and the partners would have to contribute in the proportion of their interests,\u201d remarked one analyst.\n\nHowever, another analyst said it might not be that straight forward, arguing that all the joint venture partners would only be liable, depending on the JV agreement and the operator agreement signed.\n\nShell only runs the operations of joint ventures (JVs) in Nigeria where the federal government is the holder of 55 per cent of the assets.\n\nIf it turns out that all the JV partners are liable for the Ogoni compensation, based on the JV/operator agreement, Shell is expected to pay its share of 30 per cent of the recompense, estimated to be N13.77 billion; Total E&P Nigeria Limited will pay its 10 per cent, about N4.59 billion; while Eni which holds five per cent will pay the least amount of N2.29 billion.\n\nThe affected oil field has the government-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation \u2013 NNPC owning (55 per cent share), SPDC (30 per cent), Total E&P Nigeria Ltd (10 per cent) and the Eni subsidiary Agip Oil Company Limited (five per cent), according to details on Shell\u2019s website.\n\nLast Wednesday, Shell finally agreed to pay an agreed compensation after a long legal battle, which commenced in 1991 over the spill that occurred 31 years ago, but was silent on the liabilities of the JV partners.\n\nJudgment first came in favour of the Ogoni community in 2010, courtesy of Justice Ibrahim Buba of the Lagos division of the Federal High Court.\n\nThe oil giant had initially declined payment and proceeded up to the Supreme Court twice; first in 2017 to appeal the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which had upheld the judgment of the trial court and in 2019, to seek a review of the apex court judgment dismissing its appeal.\n\nAham Ejelamo, a lawyer to Shell, the local arm of the Royal Dutch Company, said the company resolved to pay the monetary compensation awarded in 2010 after several attempts to amend earlier judgement failed.\n\nHe informed the court of the decision to pay up the money and sought permission of the trial judge, Justice Ahmed Mohammed, to make payment through the Chief Registrar of the court in a bank account to be opened for the purpose.\n\nHowever, Mohammed ruled that the money should be paid through the counsel to the Ogoni community, Chief Lucius Nwosu (SAN).\n\nThe development will put further strain on the finances of NNPC, which is currently struggling to meet its obligations to its stakeholders, including the federal and state governments, having been consistently unable to remit up to 30 per cent of its statutory contribution to the federation account for several months.\n\nThose to benefit from the judgment include the people of Ejama Ebubu, a community in Tai Eleme local government area of Rivers State, one of the six kingdoms in Ogoni land, while other kingdoms are Babbe, Eleme, Gokana, Ken-Khana, and Nyo-Khan.\n\nThe Shell\u2019s nod ended the legal tussle that entangled the oil giant and the community for decades.\n\nThe case was instituted in 2001 by 10 representatives of the Ejama Ebubu community against the oil company for the losses caused by the oil spills.\n\nA source at Shell said: \u201cThe spills occurred during civil war\u2026 it was caused by the soldiers. And immediately after the war, we mobilised, cleaned, and remediated the site. We got a certificate from National Oil Spill Detection & Response Agency (NOSDRA) to that effect. The case is one-sided and judgement without justice.\u201d\n\nShell had argued in court: \u201cThis spill was caused by third parties during the Nigerian Civil War, a challenging period, which resulted in significant damage to oil and gas infrastructure in the region. While SPDC does not accept responsibility for these spills, the affected sites in the Ebubu community were fully remediated.\n\n\u201cThe claimants have, at their own admission in court, materially miscalculated and overstated the value of the award previously sought in this case. The ruling of the Supreme Court did not decide liability or the size of the award, which remains in dispute in other ongoing court proceedings.\n\n\u201cIt is our position that any attempt to enforce payment should not be permitted. It is regrettable that the legal process in this case had focused for so long on procedural issues and not the merits of the case. We have always maintained that we are ready to defend this case based on the available facts.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s currently an ongoing negotiation between the federal government and the oil giant as to its future operation in the country, with the company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Ben van Beurden, insisting in May that the company could no longer bear its exposure to the risk of theft and sabotage in the Niger Delta.\n\nWith 19 Oil Mining Leases (OMLs) in its SPDC subsidiary, a THISDAY report quoted Wood Mackenzie , a global research firm, yesterday as valuing Shell\u2019s JV assets in Nigeria, excluding export pipelines and terminals, at $2.3 billion.\n\nShell is planning to sell off all its assets in the shallow waters and onshore, leaving only its offshore operations intact in Nigeria.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
          "summary": "Shell only runs the operations of joint ventures (JVs) in Nigeria where the federal government is the holder of 55 per cent of the assets.\nThe affected oil field has the government-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation \u2013 NNPC owning (55 per cent share), SPDC (30 per cent), Total E&P Nigeria Ltd (10 per cent) and the Eni subsidiary Agip Oil Company Limited (five per cent), according to details on Shell\u2019s website.\nJudgment first came in favour of the Ogoni community in 2010, courtesy of Justice Ibrahim Buba of the Lagos division of the Federal High Court.\nHowever, Mohammed ruled that the money should be paid through the counsel to the Ogoni community, Chief Lucius Nwosu (SAN).\nThe case was instituted in 2001 by 10 representatives of the Ejama Ebubu community against the oil company for the losses caused by the oil spills.",

          "text": "Elder statesman and former federal \u201cSuper Permanent Secretary\u201d, Ahmed Joda, died in Yola, Adamawa State in Northeast Nigeria on Friday at the age of 91.\n\nIn a swift tribute, President Muhammadu Buhari highlighted Joda\u2019s \u201cmonumental contributions to Nigeria\u2019s unity and progress,\u201d from birth of the nation until his death, saying \u201chis lofty ideals will continue to motivate millions across the nation.\u201d\n\nOne of Joda\u2019s associates, Mohamed Baba told THISDAY that he died in the afternoon at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Yola, after a prolonged illness.\n\nAnother source said Joda had been buried according to Islamic rites.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019m talking to you, the elder statesman has already been taken to the family cemetery for burial,\u201d the source said.\n\nJoda will always be remembered as the chairman of the 18-member transition committee nominated by the President Muhammadu Buhari to receive the handover notes from the Goodluck Jonathan-led administration in 2015.\n\nHe rose through the administrative cadre of the Northern regional government, and then the federal civil service, to retire as Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Industries. During the administration of the youthful General Yakubu Gowon, he was considered to be among a group known as Super Permanent Secretaries.\n\nJoda was born in Girei Local Government Area of Adamawa State in 1930. His great-great-grandfather was Modibbo Raji, a 19th-century Islamic scholar and contemporary of Sheikh Usman Dan Fodio.\n\nHe attended Yola Elementary and Middle schools before proceeding to Barewa College. After completing his secondary education in 1948, he was admitted to Moor Plantation, Ibadan.\n\nHe worked briefly at an agricultural centre in Yola. Then, in the 1950s, he attended Pitman College, London and gained practical experience in journalism while staying in Britain. On his return to Nigeria, he practiced journalism at Gaskiya Corporation, Zaria.\n\nHe later worked with the then Northern Broadcasting Corporation in Kaduna before joining the Northern Nigeria civil service as Chief Information Officer.\n\nJoda became a federal permanent secretary in 1967 in the Ministry of Information and subsequently moved to Lagos.\n\nHe retired into private business during the second Republic, where he served as chairman and board member of various companies, including the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation; Nigerian Communications Commission; SCOA Nigeria; Chagoury Group; Flour Mills of Nigeria, and the Nigerian LNG.\n\nHe was also a member of the 1988 Constituent Assembly which planned the constitutional transition of the Third Republic. In 1999, he was appointed as a member of the Committee to Advise the Presidency on Poverty Alleviation and in 2015, headed the Buhari presidential transition.\n\nIn his tribute to Joda, who is the last surviving member of Governor Hassan Usman\u2019s Northern Nigeria cabinet, President Buhari highlighted his \u201cmonumental contributions to Nigeria\u2019s unity and progress\u201d, saying \u201chis lofty ideals will continue to motivate millions across the nation.\u201d\n\nThe President, in a release issued by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, noted that the late \u201cSuper Permanent Secretary\u201d, as Joda and some of his colleagues were referred to in the 1970s, \u201cdistinguished himself as a remarkable scholar, journalist, intellectual, public servant and farmer.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari called Joda \u201ca hero for all Nigerians\u201d who, even in death, \u201cwill continue to inspire every generation to move forward with love, brotherhood and harmony.\u201d\n\nHe prayed to Allah to accept his good deeds and grant fortitude to those he left behind in his family, Adamawa Emirate Council and the entire people of the state, to bear the loss, adding, \u201cWe will not forget his sacrifices.\u201d\n\nEx-President Olusegun Obasanjo described Joda\u2019s death as \u201cheartbreaking\u201d.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, signed by his media aide, Kehinde Akinyemi, Obasanjo said the late Joda was his friend for about 60 years.\n\nThe ex-President explained that the late former Federal Permanent Secretary saved the unity of Nigeria shortly after the 1966 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat when others insisted that Nigeria should collapse.\n\nObasanjo described Joda \u201cas not just a Nigerian, but, a true and great Nigerian, committed to unity, development and progress of the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cOh! What a heartbreaking news, that my friend for well over 60 years has passed to the great beyond. If every Nigerian have the attributes of Joda, Nigeria will have been better than what it is now.\n\n\u201cAhmed Joda by his feature did not need to tell you he is a Fulani man, but, in everything I know he did, he lived not just as a Fulani man, he lived, he worked and he laboured as a true Nigerian. They are not many like him, and that was what strengthens our relationship since 1959,\u201d Obasanjo was quoted to have said.\n\nHe said they met when he was a Second Lieutenant in the Nigeria Army and Joda was a Deputy Chief Information Officer in the Federal Civil service.\n\nObasanjo recalled that the effort of Joda and his other Super Permanent Secretaries as they were fondly called in the then civil service saved Nigeria in 1966.\n\nAccording to the former President, \u201cI know that if not for people like Joda and other Senior Permanent Secretaries, as they were called Super Permanent Secretary as at that time, after the second upheaval of 1966, we would have had Nigeria broken into pieces.\n\n\u201cBut, it was Ahmed Joda and other Super Permanent Secretaries (senior civil servants) like Philip Asiodu, Liman Ciroma, Alison Ayida who prevailed not to have Nigeria broken up.\n\n\u201cWell, Dear Ahmed, you have served your family, your community. You have served your country and indeed humanity, you have done your best, including working for the transition between the Buhari administration and Jonathan administration.\n\n\u201cYou have done your best working with me on the progress and programme of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library. You have done your best on becoming the Chancellor of Bells University. We love you, but God loves you best. Rest permanently in the bosom of Allah,\u201d Obasanjo added.\n\nThe former vice president, Atiku Abubakar expressed shock about the death of Joda, saying \u201can iroko tree has fallen.\u201d\n\nIn statement he signed, Atiku said: \u201cToday, our beautiful Adamawa State has lost a colossus. Indeed, an iroko tree has fallen in Nigeria particularly Northern Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe said that the news of the death of Joda, came with some kind of a jolt even though he lived to a prime old age.\n\nThe former vice president said Jorda belonged to the first generation of Adamawa indigenes that put the state and the North in the map of modern Nigeria.\n\nAtiku said: \u201cHis stature as an accomplished administrator was towering and colourful. He was a shining star in the galaxy of Nigeria\u2019s public servants.\n\n\u201cAhmed Joda, with a few of his peers, wrote the rule book of Nigeria\u2019s civil service and his footprints will remain indelible.\n\n\u201cNigeria mourns this great Nigerian with immense contribution to growth of our country, we pray that the Almighty Allah accepts his soul and provide his family with fortitude to bear the loss of a forthright and iconic patriarch.\u201d\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Deji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha in Abuja and Daji Sani in Yola",
