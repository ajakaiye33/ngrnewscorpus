          "text": "The Monday Katsina Local Government election was marred by voter apathy, delay in the arrival of election materials at various polling units as well as complaints by political parties\u2019 agents of non-availability of election results sheets, among others.\n\nThe story was virtually similar in all the polling units visited in the Katsina, Batagarawa, Kankia and Safana Local Government Areas of the state.\n\nWhile agents of the Peoples Democratic Party at Wakili Gabaz 1 and 2 in the Katsina Local Government Area complained of non-arrival of election results sheets as at 8.45am when our correspondent visited the units, the All Progressives Congress agents at Turawa A and B polling units in the Batagarawa Local Government Area made similar complaints over non-availability of the results sheets. The agents spoke under condition of anonymity.\n\nAccreditation of voters was yet to commence at many polling units visited by 9.30am, despite the fact that the election was slated for 8am to 3pm.\n\nIt was also observed that fewer voters turned up at polling units despite the state Government\u2019s declaration of Monday as work-free to allow people carry out their civic responsibility.\n\nTrading and commercial activities were also seen to have resumed in Katsina as at 10am and the surrounding towns of Batagarawa, Kayaoki, Charanchi and Kankia, notwithstanding the police restriction on both human and vehicular movements within the state.\n\nAttempts to seek the comments of the chairman of the Katsina State Independent Electoral Commission, Ibrahim Bako, were unsuccessful as he was said to have gone out to inspect the election exercise.\n\nMeanwhile, a joint team of security operatives was seen patrolling various locations in Katsina and in the surrounding towns and cities.\n\nNo fewer than 3,187,988 registered voters in the state were expected to participate in the Monday council election.\n\nThe exercise was for the election of chairmen for the 34 Local Government Areas of the state and 361 councillors for the councils.\n\nTwelve political parties participated in the election, although only the APC and the PDP reportedly filled candidates for both the chairmanship and councillorship seats.",

Alarmingly, almost half of these crisis-affected people, 4.1 million are expected to face the severe pain of food insecurity in the approaching lean season.\u201d\n\nHe explained that in 2021, the gap between people in need and people supported by food and nutrition assistance was 1.8 million, stressing that due to reduced funding, that number is projected to dramatically increase to 2.9 million this lean season.\n\nHe opined that unless resources are urgently mobilised, almost three million people in dire need of food and nutrition support will go unassisted.\n\nHe stated that without food assistance, desperation may compel extremely vulnerable people into transactional sex, child labour, and selling their few possessions.\n\nSchmale observed that he heard stories from last year\u2019s lean season of people in the North-East eating grass to stay alive and feared the recurrence of this tragedy if they fail to act quickly.\n\nNadia Soso, the Head of Special Duties, Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, said that food security and nutrition of this affected population in the north remains a priority.\n\nHe said that the situation paints a concerning picture of the great force they are up against, adding that not only having to worry for one\u2019s safety but also struggling each day to find food and adequate nutrition.\n\nHe said that for people across Borno, Adamawa and Yobe state, every day is a challenge and in which without quick action, no relief is in sight, saying that funding is urgently needed to ensure critical food and relief assistance as the gap between people in need and available resources will grow more severe.",

          "text": "Daughter of Pastor Paul Enenche of Dunamis International Gospel Center, Deborah, has disclosed that her father had no knowledge of the physical abuse of Osinachi Nwachukwu experienced in the hands of her husband, which led to her death.\n\nIn a post shared on Facebook, Enenche noted that her father has advocated against unhealthy marriage, adding that everything was done to ensure Osinachi was removed from her situation.\n\nShe wrote: \u201cMy father has always been an advocate for removing oneself from a deeply unhealthy marriage. It is spread across the fabric of his ministry the clear fact that he has always ensured the weak are protected. It is not different in this situation.\n\n\u201cEverything was done to ensure the departed was removed from her situation and in lieu of that, she was cared for as much as possible. Bear in mind that there was no knowledge of the physical abuse. If such had come to light, we wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201c\n\nShe promised to ensure that justice is served and the husband faces the full extent of the law.\n\nEnenche assured that there will be many measures taken to protect the children and the family of the late singer.\n\nHer post read, \u201cI have been unable to sleep the past few days due to my fury at the untimely and avoidable exit of a generational voice. She inspired me to chase after God. I can\u2019t express how much shock I experienced on hearing. What\u2019s worse is that I didn\u2019t know the actual background facts of her life as I don\u2019t indulge in gossip or poke into other people\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cThat being said, I truly wish I had known her better. I wish I could have done more for her. I wish I had been aware of all the pain she experienced. I will do what I am able to now I know the facts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also came to my attention that many who knew her personally were not entirely privy to her situation. It\u2019s even more disheartening to know, from an account of her twin sister, that she wouldn\u2019t let her spiritual father be made aware of the gravity of the abuse she suffered. This, therefore, informs how I address things.\n\n\u201cThere is so much to be said yet so much discretion is needed. I am however not one who knows how to stay mute on issues that potentially affect me and those around me. I also have a fiscal responsibility to the young people who look up to me as well as my role in both the body of Christ and society.\n\n\u201cThat being said, in order to not be misconstrued. I will keep my opinions brief;\n\n\u201c1. The deceased was very isolated from loved ones. Much of what happened, in the end, could have been avoided if she hadn\u2019t been marooned from the ones who cared for her most. I believe she not only passed due to the compendium of physical hurt and pain; she died of a broken heart. I will personally do my best to ensure that the offending party in the equation is punished to the fullest extent of the law. He will not go scot-free. There will be many measures taken to also protect the children and her family as well.\n\n\u201c2. Many are quick to jump to conclusions on things they know nothing about. The collective approximate shock we feel is not compared to that of the pain of people who have been so heavily involved both physically, financially, spiritually and even legally in trying to extricate someone from a truly nightmarish situation that could only really be absolved by the parties involved.\u201d",

          "title": "Beneath the NIN-SIM partial deactivation",
          "text": "The April 4 directive of the Federal Government to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to bar telephone subscribers yet to link their Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) with their National Identity Number (NIN) has brought avoidable pains to affected subscribers. Already, no fewer than 72.7million subscribers have been partially shut-out . LUCAS AJANAKU writes on the issues around the exercise.\n\nAt the expiration of the March 31, 2022 timeline given by the Federal Government to subscribers to link their SIM with their NIN, the Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC) said over 125 million SIMs have had their NINs submitted for immediate linkage, verification and authentication.\n\nThe National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) also said it has issued over 78 million unique NINs. The March deadline marked the eight time after the first deadline of between December 16 and 30, 2020 was extended to January 19, 2021.\n\nThe euphoria that came with the liberalisation of the telecoms sector in 2001 did not give room for proper planning around the process of SIM acquisition. So SIM cards were hawked across the country like groundnuts and sold to willing buyers, including criminals, without attaching proper identities to their owners.\n\nAs a matter of fact, pre-registered SIM card sale was rampant despite the operators knowing the criminal implication of such action should they be caught by the long arm of the law. Indeed, all the operators were eventually apprehended and huge sanctions imposed on them by the NCC.\n\nBut the imperative of SIM registration became apparent when the mobile phone became a facilitator of criminal activities. Intimidation, kidnap-for-ransom and other vices became the order of the day. A source in the NCC said SIM cards became lethal weapons in the armoury of Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nTherefore, the Federal Government had in December 2009, announced that with effect from March 1, 2010, all new SIM cards in Nigeria must be registered before activation.\n\n\u201cThe NCC, in exercise of its regulatory functions as provided for by the Nigerian Communications Act (NCA) 2003, wishes to inform the relevant stakeholders that arrangements have been concluded for the commencement of registration of SIM card holders in Nigeria. The registration will include the capture of the photograph and biometrics of the subscriber,\u201d a statement by NCC had said.\n\nIn 2019, when insecurity in the country assumed a disquieting proportion, the NCC said registration of new SIM cards will require the presentation of NIN and announced immediate enforcement of the new rule, noting that the move became necessary following the rising criminality in the country.\n\nAccording to its Executive Vice Chairman (EVC), Prof. Umar Danbatta, the policy is in line with the NIMC Act 2007 relating to NIN regulations, which provide that a person must provide his/her unique number to register a SIM card. Consequently, Danbatta said the NCC, in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, had set in motion mechanisms for compliance.\n\nThe Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Prof Isa Pantami, had stopped the sale of new SIM cards, a move that had debilitating unintended consequences on subscriber figures and inevitably, the bottomline of the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs).\n\nNew SIM reg policy\n\nWhen the Federal Government finally lifted the embargo on new SIM registration on April 19, last year, it came with strict policies, one of which was the activation of new SIM card registration with mandatory NIN.\n\nPantami, who issued the directive, said the approval was in line with the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration.\n\nTechnical Assistant (Information Technology) to the Minister, Dr Femi Adeluyi, said the implementation of the policy will commence on April 19, last year.\n\nAdeluyi explained that the issuance of new SIMs and other suspended activities would resume on the same date, as long as verification was done and the guidelines were fully adhered to.\n\nNCC and NIMC were directed to ensure that the provisions of the policy are strictly followed by operators and subscribers.\n\nThe Nigerian Communications Act (NCA) 2003, Section 23(a) specifies the role of the minister to include the formulation, determination, and monitoring of the policy for the communications sector.\n\n\u201cThe minister had coordinated and led the development of the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration in collaboration with other stakeholders.\n\n\u201cAn earlier policy was approved on February 4, 2020, while the Revised Policy was developed in early March 2021.\n\n\u201cThe final amendments to the revised policy based on the directives of Mr President to make the use of NIN mandatory for all SIM registration were completed April 14, 2021.\n\n\u201cPrior to that, the key aspects of the draft policy were presented to the stakeholders at the Fourth Review Meeting of the Ministerial Task Force (MTF) on the NIN-SIM registration which was held on 26th of February, 2021,\u201d he said.\n\nThe policy includes Guidelines on New SIM Acquisition and Activation, SIM Replacement, New SIM Activation for Corporates and Internet-of-Things/Machine-to-Machine (IoT/M2M), among others. The possession of a NIN will be a prerequisite for each of these categories.\n\nFor the corporate registration, he said institutions will be required to appoint a Telecoms Master (at the minimum of an Executive Management level) to provide the operational Primary NIN representation.\n\n\u201cThe Telecoms Master will also be responsible for ensuring that the users provide their NINs to serve as a secondary NIN.\n\n\u201cFor IoT/M2M activations, SIM security protocols would be implemented on the SIM profile to ensure that SIMs can only be used for point-to-point data services specific to the URL they are working with.\n\n\u201cAll other services will be barred. In the event that a data only service is particular to individual use (eg home car tracking, WiFi, MiFi services, etc), the standard NIN registration process will be followed.\n\n\u201cA Telecom Master will also be required for Corporates requiring IoT/M2M activations. The full details of the requirements for each class of service will be made available in due course.\u201d\n\nAdeluyi had stated that significant progress has been made in the process across the country, noting that the Federal Government is committed to supporting Nigerians and legal residents to obtain a NIN.\n\n\u201cThe biometric verification has been slower than anticipated, owing largely to the non-adherence of many previous SIM biometric capture processes to the NIMC standards.\n\n\u201cThe Revised Policy will ensure that operators conform to the required standards for biometric capture.\n\n\u201cThe Guidelines in the Policy have been painstakingly developed and while they are thorough, it should be noted that they have been developed that way in National interest since the SIM is essentially a national resource,\u201d he explained.\n\nTrust or lackadaisical\n\nWhat could have been responsible for so many subscribers who daily throng telecom companies offices and enrolment centres to get their NIN and wait to get their NIN verified so that they could be unbarred from originating calls from their lines?\n\nWhile some subscribers say they do not want to share their data because they do not trust the system, others say they have yet to see how impactful the exercise has been in checking crimes across the country. Kidnappers, they say, still use the network to negotiate ransom from the families of the captors.\n\nThe Director-General, NIMC, Alhaji Abdulaziz Aliyu, said the reason about 73 million subscribers were caught napping was purely attitudinal. According to him, it was sheer display of lackadaisical attitude that made them either not to link their SIMs with their NINs or failed to enroll to be captured into the National Identity DataBase (NIDB).\n\nAliyu, who was a guest on NTA programme at the weekend, along the Chaiman, Association of Licensed Telecom Companies of Nigeria (ALTON), Gbenga Adebayo; Executive Commissioner, Stakeholders Management at NCC, Mr. Adeolu Adewolu; and an Associate Professor and Executive Director, Centre for Cyberspace Studies (CCS), Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Dr. Uche Mbanaso, said as at the time the last extension was given in December, there were about 50 million NINs\n\nHe underscored the importance of the programme to national security and the ability of the government to plan effectively for the citizens. He said in the United States, there\u2019s the Social Security Number while in the United Kingdom, there is the National Insurance Number. India, which he said, shared some commonalities with Nigeria, registered 1.3billion people within five years and issued them Aadhaar, lamenting that Nigeria started the process since 2012 and has not been able to attain the 100 million mark.\n\nAdewolu agreed with him. He said it was unfortunate that people didn\u2019t take time to enroll for NIN until it became an issue of enforcement. He said only 125 million is in the kitty of the NCC, saying he did not know whether the 72.7million partially deactivated had NIN or not.\n\nChallenges\n\nWhile apologising to subscribers for the pains they were going through, sleeping at enrolment centres, Adebayo said the journey had been on since 2020, pledging the support of the MNOs to realising the objective of helping the Federal Government to get a credible national data base.\n\nHe blamed the slow process of verification on the \u201cother end\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the first place, people\u2019s outgoing calls have been barred and a lot of people depend on this for their daily livelihoods. The crowd is the problem but people come with the objective of either obtaining a NIN or register their new SIM but the crowd is enormous. It is difficult to manage because people have come to capture their NIN, waiting for verification of their NIN. It is taking time to get the verification and get back to them; we can lift the bar until verification is done; the system at the other end is a bit slow in responding. As service providers, we are doing all we can but really, a number of these issues are not on us other than the crowd, the delay in verification is certainly not coming from telecom operators,\u201d he said.\n\nAnalysts said like the stoppage of new SIM sales last year that took a toll on total subscriber figures and their books, the partial deactivation would affect the financials of the telecoms companies.\n\n\u201cSome 72million subscribers can\u2019t make calls but can receive. The MNOs make money when customers make and receive calls. Therefore, it is logical to expect a decline in cash flows to the service providers,\u201d a sector analyst said on condition of anonymity.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja and Steve Agbota\n\nMinisters and other political appointees of President Muhammadu Buhari nursing political aspirations are in a dilemma on their next line of action just as the deadline set by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for political parties to conduct primaries draws near.\n\nBased on the new Electoral Act, the ministers and other aides of the president are expected to resign in order to be eligible to contest any elective positions in next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nThough President Buhari is silent on the controversy over the resignation of his aides, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in its March national convention, had barred political appointees from voting as delegates.\n\nSection 84 of the new Electoral Act stipulates that anyone holding a political office \u2013 ministers, commissioners, special advisers and others \u2013 must relinquish the position before they can be eligible to participate in the electoral process, either as candidates or delegates.\n\nLast week, APC national publicity secretary, Felix Morka, urged political appointees to resign before the primaries of the party, despite an Umuahia Federal High Court ruling, striking down Section 84(12).\n\nPart of Section 84 of the Act states: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nThe provision further states that where a political party failed to comply with the provisions of the Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate for election shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nPolitical appointees that the provision refers to include the 43 federal ministers, special advisers, senior special assistants, special assistants and heads of government agencies. Commissioners and other political appointees at the state level are also affected.\n\nA competent source told Daily Sun that during a private meeting between President Buhari and Abdullahi Adamu, the new chairman of APC last week, concerns were raised about the refusal of the affected ministers and other aides in the Federal Cabinet to resign.\n\nThe source said APC leadership was worried that the appeal filed by the National Assembly, challenging the decision of Umuahia High Court on the Electoral Act, may diminish the chances of the party in next year\u2019s elections.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cAPC leadership, barring any last minute change, will officially write to inform its members who are appointees at the state and federal levels, but intend to vie for any position, to resign,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said as soon as the directive is issued, key A-list ministers, including the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), who is among the leading contenders, will resign en masse.\n\nWithin the Buhari cabinet, aspirants believed to be affected include ministers of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige; Aviation, Hadi Sirika; Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu; Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio; State for Petroleum Resources,Timipre Sylva; Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami; Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola; Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare and Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba.\n\nThere are other aides to the president, vying to various positions, who are also under pressure to resign ahead of the planned primaries of the ruling APC.\n\nMeanwhile, following his public declaration to contest the 2023 presidential election, the Niger Delta Transparency, Accountability and Good Governance Group (Niger Delta TAG), has asked Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi to resign immediately.\n\nOn Saturday in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Amaechi had expressed interest to contest the presidential election.\n\nIn a statement in Port Harcourt, yesterday, National Coordinator of the Niger Delta TAG, Julius Godspower, said while it is within Amaechi\u2019s rights to seek election into the highest office in the country, it is \u201cimmoral, illegal and unethical\u201d for him to remain in office as minister and member of President Buhari\u2019s cabinet while chasing his political ambition.\n\n\u201cThe minister placed the cart before the horse. The proper thing to do would have been to first resign, before declaring his presidential ambition. It is rather unfortunate that due process is not followed by the minister and I hope President Muhammadu Buhari will direct him to step down immediately. The proper thing to do now is for him to immediately resign to pursue his dream. Remaining in office as minister while pursing his presidential ambition will be a huge distraction to government. The transport sector is in a very bad state, and it is bound to suffer more with a presidential aspirant as minister.\n\n\u201cAlso, the situation creates a clear conflict of interest for the minister. How are we sure contractors and agencies under the Federal Ministry of Transportation will not be cajoled or compelled to support his presidential bid one way or the other?\u201d",

          "text": "By Doris Obinna\n\nAn impeachment plot is being hatched and perfected against Abia State Deputy Governor, Dr. Ude Chukwu, for daring to indicate interest to succeed his boss, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, Daily Sun has learnt.\n\nIt was also gathered that in the event that the impeachment plot fails, there is also a plan to disqualify the deputy governor from the guber race.\n\nChukwu, who hails from Nkporo, in Abia North Senatorial District, two weeks ago, picked the governorship expression of interest and nomination forms of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) amid plans by Governor Ikpeazu to have a successor from Nsiala Ngwa, in Abia Central Senatorial District.\n\nThere has been contention over which zone would produce the next Abia State governor, with Abia North saying that since power shift started with it in 1999 and had gone round to Abia Central and Abia South, it should naturally produce the next governor and thereby kickstart another round of power rotation .\n\nOn the other hand, the Ngwa bloc of the state, where the governor comes from, insists on taking another shot at the office, back-to-back, to give Aba zone 16 straight years.\n\nSources told Daily Sun that for picking the governorship form and thereby going against Governor Ikpeazu\u2019s plan to have an Ngwa man succeed him, a massive mobilisation is ongoing to get Chukwu removed from office before the PDP governorship primary to reduce his strength and make him vulnerable.\n\nIt was gathered that the impeachment assignment has been given to one of Ikpeazu\u2019s senior advisers who handles special tasks, and a former Deputy Speaker of the state House of Assembly.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nAs their reward, if the plot succeeds, it was gathered that the adviser has been promised a ticket to the state House of Assembly, while the ex-Deputy Speaker, who is from Abia North, is penciled down to become the new Deputy Governor.\n\nIt was learnt that the former Deputy Speaker is to use his connection in the state Assembly to convince his former colleagues key into the impeachment plot, while the special adviser is to take care of logistics.\n\nTo get members of the Abia State House of Assembly agree to commence impeachment proceeding against Chukwu, it was gathered that they have been threatened with denial of reelection ticket if they fail to comply. If they cooperate, automatic tickets were promised.\n\nAs a result of the threat, some of the state lawmakers have been frightened and caught in a dilemma as to whether to follow their conscience and resist being used to impeach the Deputy Governor or cooperate and pick PDP tickets for next year\u2019s election.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that although Governor Ikpeazu\u2019s adviser and the former Deputy Speaker are cajoling some state lawmakers with the ticket denial threat, they still do not know how to get the cooperation of the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Chinedum Orji.\n\nOrji is the son of ex-governor Theodore Orji and senator representing Abia Central. The older Orji recently said that power should shift to Abia North, in continuation of the zoning arrangement in the state.\n\nIt was gathered that the former Deputy Speaker, whose task is to woo the lawmakers, has not mustered the courage to speak with Orji. His handicap, it was learnt, stems from his previous action against the Speaker who he openly castigated for visiting former Governor of Abia State and senator representing Abia North, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, a member of the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC). For criticising the speaker, believed to have been done to please Governor Ikpeazu, the former Deputy Speaker drew the ire of Orji.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nThe former Deputy Speaker is believed to have also mounted criticisms against the Speaker\u2019s father on social media in the past, despite the fact that the former governor was instrumental to his success in politics\n\nIt was gathered that if the impeachment plot fails, the plan B is to get the Deputy Governor disqualified at the screening level.\n\nThe anti-Chukwu group reckoned that his disqualification from the race would put paid to his ambition and thereby give the governor\u2019s camp easy opportunity to hand PDP\u2019s ticket over to a preferred successor.\n\nSince the screening of the aspirants would be done by PDP bigwigs and officials from outside the state, it was gathered that the governor\u2019s camp is waiting for its composition before moving in.\n\nEdo State governor, Godwin Obaseki, was a victim of similar plot in the APC, when he was disqualified from seeking reelection by his party following disagreement with former national chairman of the party. He had to defect to PDP, on whose platform he won his re-election.\n\nSources revealed that orchestrated plot against Chukwu over Abia 2023 governorship started more than one year ago, when payment of some of his entitlements were stopped. This, it was gathered, was aimed at ensuring that he does not have the resources to finance his governorship ambition.\n\nIn the anti-Chukwu programme, some politicians from Abia North are being empowered to become counter-force.\n\nRecently former aide to Chukwu, who fell out with him and joined the APC, was appointed General Manager of Abia Roads Maintenancy Agency.\n\nAlso, an indigene of Chukwu\u2019s Ohafia Local Government Area, was recently appointed Deputy Chief of Staff to the Governor, a position which was vacant for long, following the death of the previous occupant.\n\nSomebody from Ohafia Local Government Area was also recently appointed Chairman of Abia State University (ABSU) Governing Council after the removal of ex-Senator President, Adolphus Wabara, for opposing the plan to breach the power rotation arrangement in the state.\n\nTo whittle down Chukwu\u2019s influence in Abia North, government officials from his local government area and senatorial zone have been mandated to raise groups to visit Governor Ikpeazu and pledge loyalty and support for whoever he chooses as successor. There is already indication that immediate past Vice Chancellor of ABSU, Prof Uchenna Ikonne, from Isiala Ngwa, is the governor\u2019s preferred candidate.\n\nSources however revealed that the Deputy Governor is getting sympathy because of his unflinching loyalty to Governor Ikpeazu since he came to office with him in 2015.\n\nIn seven years, the Deputy Governor, it was revealed, has never had any cause to be disloyal to the governor and has discharged his duties well.\n\nOwing to his loyalty and competence, the Deputy Governor has attracted sympathy from across the state, including the governor\u2019s clan.",

          "text": "*My experiences, insights, opportunities must be used for Nigeria and Nigerians\n\n\n\nBy Yemi Osinbajo\n\n\n\nIn the past seven years, I have served as Vice President under a true Nigerian patriot, a servant of the nation in war and peace, and a man of integrity, President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nWe have, together, worked through some of the most difficult times in the history of our Nation, but we have remained focused on securing the country, providing infrastructure and growing our economy.\n\nAs stipulated by the Nigerian Constitution, our tenure will end next year.\n\nIn this period of seven years, I have served the government in several capacities, and have, at the direction of Mr. President, represented our country in sensitive high level international engagements. I have been to practically all local governments in Nigeria. I have been in markets, factories, schools, and farms. I have been in agricultural, mining and oil producing communities; in the Delta, in Kebbi, Enugu, Borno; Rivers, Plateau and Ondo; & in all other States of the federation, listening to the diverse experiences and yearnings of our people.\n\n\n\nI have visited our gallant troops in the North East and our brothers and sisters in the IDP camps. I have felt the pain and anguish of victims in violent conflicts, terrorist attacks, flooding, fire and other disasters.\n\nI have been in the homes of many ordinary Nigerians in various parts of the country. I have sat with our techprenuers in Lagos, Edo, and Kaduna, with our Nollywood and Kannywood actors; with our musicians, from Lagos, Onitsha, and Kano. And I have spoken to small and large businesses.\n\nI stood where they stood and sat where they sat. I know their hopes, aspirations and fears; and I believe that in those hopes and aspirations are the seeds for the great Nigeria that we all desire.\n\nI believe that the very reason why the Almighty God gave me these experiences, these insights, and these opportunities, is that they must be put to the use of our country and it\u2019s great peoples.\n\n\n\nWhich is why I am today, with utmost humility, formally declaring my intention to run for the Office of the President, Federal Republic of Nigeria, on the platform of our great party, the All Progressives Congress. If by the grace of God and the will of the people, I am given the opportunity, then I believe that first, we must complete what we have started;\n\n*radically transforming our security and intelligence architecture,\n\n*completing the reform of our justice system focusing on adequate remuneration and welfare of judicial personnel,\n\n*ensuring justice for all and the observance of rule of law,\n\n*rapidly advancing our infrastructure development, especially power, roads, railways and broadband connectivity,\n\n*providing an excellent environment for businesses to thrive,\n\n*taking the agriculture revolution to the next level especially mechanization and developing the farm to table value chain\n\n*making sure that the government, its agencies and regulators serve the business community,\n\n*creating a tech economy that will provide jobs for millions;\n\n*enhancing our Social Investment Programme to a full scale social welfare scheme,\n\n*completing the promise of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty within this decade,*completing the task of ensuring that all Nigerians, male and female, attend school,\n\n*reforming our educational system for relevance to the challenges of this century,\n\n*completing the task of universal health coverage for all,\n\nand\n\n*strengthening the capacity of States and Local Governments to deliver on their respective mandates.\n\nAbove all, front and centre of our efforts will be the provision of jobs and opportunities for our young people.\n\nI now most solemnly and respectfully seek the support of fellow Nigerians everywhere in this land, and the diaspora, young and old, male and female, in the great and exciting journey that we have ahead of us.\n\nWe will, working together, establish by the grace of God, the Nigeria of our dreams in a few short years. We will build on the foundation laid by our predecessors. We will need to move, with much speed, intentionality, and perseverance, towards the vision of a prosperous, stable, and secure nation.\n\n\n\nI am convinced beyond doubt that we have the creativity, the courage, the talent, and the resources to be the foremost black nation on earth. Let us now birth the expectations of greatness conceived generations before us.\n\nLet us build a Nigeria where the man from Nnewi sees the man in Gusau as his brother, where the woman in Warri sees the woman in Jalingo as her sister, where the love of our nation burns alike in the hearts of boys and girlsfrom Gboko to Yenogoa. Where everywhere, in this land, is home for everyone, where our diversities, tribes and faiths unite, rather than divide us.\n\nLet our tribes become one tribe; the Nigerian tribe, where all are treated fairly, justly and with respect. Where all are given equal access to the abundant opportunities that God has bestowed on this nation. It\u2019s time.\n\nGod bless and keep our Republic and its great people.\n\n\n\n* Being the full text Vice President Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s declaration for President speech on Monday April 11, 2022\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has announced that it will commence the enforcement of a ban on open grazing in the South-East region from April 27, 2022.\n\n\n\nThis was made known in a statement issued on Monday by the secessionist group's spokesperson, Emma Powerful.\n\nHe explained that from the said date, those who are into cow business in the South-East must have a ranch, and properly mark their cows.\n\n\n\nIPOB also noted that ranches must be properly marked with an identifiable name or symbol to avoid sanctions.\n\n\n\nAccording to the group, while the measures are not targeted against any tribe, they are geared towards stopping the killings in Igbo land by killer-herdsmen.\n\n\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cWe the global movement and family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) under the command and leadership of our great leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, wish to make the following clarifications concerning the ban on the movement of Fulani cows which will take effect from the April 27, 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom April 27, 2022, we shall commence the enforcement of the ban on open grazing which has since been pronounced by South-East Governors and passed into law by many states in Biafraland but the Nigerian security agencies have failed to enforce them. Thus, from the said date, no cows should be seen roaming the streets of Biafraland.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom April 27, 2022, anybody interested in cow business anywhere in Biafraland, must have a ranch and properly mark the cows. Cows seen outside ranches with effect from this date shall be treated as contraband products. Owners of such cows should blame themselves.\n\n\n\n\u201cOwners of cows and ranches should properly mark them with their ranch name or symbol for easy identification.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe above measures have become necessary to stop the senseless and wanton killings in our land by Fulani jihadists masquerading as herdsmen. We want to stop the incessant invasion of our communities and raping of our mothers and sisters by Fulani herdsmen. Enough is enough!\n\n\n\n\u201cOur action is not targeted against any tribe. We are only taking this measure as a necessity for self-preservation.\n\n\n\n\u201cIgbo people alone in Biafraland spent more than N3 trillion every year on cows. We, therefore, want to stop using our money to finance the genocidal attacks on our people by Fulani herdsmen. Let them keep their cows so that we may have our lives.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe want our people to breed native cows on our land and also put them in a ranch. We won't tolerate the wandering of cattle again in our land.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe group, in October 2021, banned the rearing and consumption of cows in the South-East region.\n\n\n\nThe group, however, said the ban would take complete effect in six months\u2019 time.\n\n\n\nHe added that only local breed would henceforth \u201cbe consumed and used for all ceremonies in Biafraland.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cfrom that date, no more Fulani cows shall be allowed into Biafraland for any reason, not for burials, title taking, weddings, etc.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said the ban followed constant attacks on their people by suspected Fulani herdsmen, resulting in killing, raping of their women and other forms of assaults.\n\n\n\nThis came months after the 17 Southern governors led by Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State met in Lagos on July 5, 2021, and \u201cset a timeline for the promulgation of the anti-open grazing law in all member states\u201d.",

          "text": "The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has announced that it will commence the enforcement of a ban on open grazing in the South-East region from April 27, 2022.\n\n\n\nThis was made known in a statement issued on Monday by the secessionist group's spokesperson, Emma Powerful.\n\nHe explained that from the said date, those who are into cow business in the South-East must have a ranch, and properly mark their cows.\n\n\n\nIPOB also noted that ranches must be properly marked with an identifiable name or symbol to avoid sanctions.\n\n\n\nAccording to the group, while the measures are not targeted against any tribe, they are geared towards stopping the killings in Igbo land by killer-herdsmen.\n\n\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cWe the global movement and family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) under the command and leadership of our great leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, wish to make the following clarifications concerning the ban on the movement of Fulani cows which will take effect from the April 27, 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom April 27, 2022, we shall commence the enforcement of the ban on open grazing which has since been pronounced by South-East Governors and passed into law by many states in Biafraland but the Nigerian security agencies have failed to enforce them. Thus, from the said date, no cows should be seen roaming the streets of Biafraland.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom April 27, 2022, anybody interested in cow business anywhere in Biafraland, must have a ranch and properly mark the cows. Cows seen outside ranches with effect from this date shall be treated as contraband products. Owners of such cows should blame themselves.\n\n\n\n\u201cOwners of cows and ranches should properly mark them with their ranch name or symbol for easy identification.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe above measures have become necessary to stop the senseless and wanton killings in our land by Fulani jihadists masquerading as herdsmen. We want to stop the incessant invasion of our communities and raping of our mothers and sisters by Fulani herdsmen. Enough is enough!\n\n\n\n\u201cOur action is not targeted against any tribe. We are only taking this measure as a necessity for self-preservation.\n\n\n\n\u201cIgbo people alone in Biafraland spent more than N3 trillion every year on cows. We, therefore, want to stop using our money to finance the genocidal attacks on our people by Fulani herdsmen. Let them keep their cows so that we may have our lives.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe want our people to breed native cows on our land and also put them in a ranch. We won't tolerate the wandering of cattle again in our land.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe group, in October 2021, banned the rearing and consumption of cows in the South-East region.\n\n\n\nThe group, however, said the ban would take complete effect in six months\u2019 time.\n\n\n\nHe added that only local breed would henceforth \u201cbe consumed and used for all ceremonies in Biafraland.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cfrom that date, no more Fulani cows shall be allowed into Biafraland for any reason, not for burials, title taking, weddings, etc.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said the ban followed constant attacks on their people by suspected Fulani herdsmen, resulting in killing, raping of their women and other forms of assaults.\n\n\n\nThis came months after the 17 Southern governors led by Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State met in Lagos on July 5, 2021, and \u201cset a timeline for the promulgation of the anti-open grazing law in all member states\u201d.",

          "text": "Some gunmen have razed the country home of the Imo State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Cyprian Akaolisa.\n\n\n\nThe assailants also burnt the residence of the father of the state justice commissioner located in the Orsu Local Government Area of the state.\n\nIn June 2021, Akaolisa\u2019s country home was also attacked and burnt by some unknown gunmen.\n\n\n\nThe residence of the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, was also attacked last year.\n\n\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Akaolisa confirmed the attacks, saying, \u201cThe Igbos are hard-working people who through their years of toils put up structures and leave developmental strides in their communities of Origin maka \u2018ak\u1ee5 ruo \u1ee5l\u1ecd, a mara onye nwe ya\u2019.\n\n\n\n\u201cThrough my many years of struggle, I have managed to put a block on another to build a befitting house for my family. My aged father also has a house he built through his sweats.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, both buildings are in rubbles and ashes \u2013 our fellow Igbos burnt them. Firstly, last year, these arsonists burnt my country home in Obibi, Awo-Idemili, Orsu LGA of Imo State for no just cause.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis year again, they returned and this time, they perfected the complete burning of even the blocks/bricks.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd last night, to my utter consternation, they levelled my father\u2019s house. This is a house my father built by himself \u2013 the life-toil of an aged man.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn other words, I wish to put on record that my family house is completely destroyed. This was after they used a truck to cart all the properties: fridges TVs, bed/foams, generator sets and other household materials.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat are my crimes, who did I offend? And what were my father\u2019s offences? And I dare ask, where is the Igbo spirit? This is a direct affront to the ak\u1ee5 ruo \u1ee5l\u1ecd spirit. Who will invest in Ala Igbo nay Orsu LGA today under this type of atmosphere?\n\n\n\n\u201cThe above are acts of arson ongoing in my LGA of Orsu. The complete burning of our LGA Secretariat, the house of my colleague \u2013 Chief Prince Ford Ozumba, the Hon Commissioner, Imo State Ministry of Labour, Employment and Productivity, the house of Hon. Ekene Nnodumele, the member representing Orsu State Constituency in the Imo State House of Assembly. There are also houses of other political leaders which have been razed in my area so far.\n\n\n\n\u201cOther ungodly acts are the sacking and carting away of all the Police presence & armouries in Orsu LGA, the kidnapping and killing of well-to-do individuals and security operatives. This attendant scare has become a daily phenomenon in my Local Government Area.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, these gunmen (Codenamed \u1ee4m\u1ee5 \u1eccma, under the guise of freedom fighters) have continued to demand huge sums of money from mourning families who wish to bury their loved ones and the likes. It is now strictly business! These gunmen have almost made a god of themselves, killing and cannibalising at will, in my area but believe me, they will not succeed with our voices up and collaborative efforts.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere is the Igbo spirit, \u1ee5m\u1ee5nne m? It is unfortunate that the majority of those who foment these troubles are not indigenous to Orsu but have garnered collaborators and enablers among the locals either through fear, persuasion, financial inducements and made to swear to devilish oaths of secrecy.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is time to synergize and put an end to the siege in Orsu LGA and liberate our people who are worse hit by the economic downturn occasioned by the ravaging insecurity. For the enablers and cheerers, It is time for the needed retrospect, soul-searching to interrogate the process so far by weighing the gains and losses.\u201d",

          "text": "When Adisa Olashile, a corps member in Ibadan, Oyo state, noticed the frequent visits of an aged drummer to the venue of his community development service (CDS), many thoughts ran through his mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere was an old man always beaming with smiles and passionate about entertaining the corps members with his drumming skills each time they gather.\n\nIt looked surreal to Adisa and finally, the photographer resolved to do one thing \u2014 \u201cto make him smile more with my camera.\u201d\n\nThe aged man, simply identified as Baba Onilu, is no model but his charming personality and amazing poses were all Olashile needed for a compelling shoot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI always meet this man at the secretariat where we have our CDS, so I decided to make him smile more with my camera. I hope you all see the emotions in his smiles,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAfter taking his pictures, Olashile realised he could do more for the man than just bring smiles to his face.\n\nHe decided to mint the man\u2019s photographs as a non-fungible token (NFT) on OpenSea and sold them for 0.3 Ethereum (Eth) each.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Forbes, \u201cAn NFT is a digital asset that represents real-world objects like art, music, in-game items and videos. They are bought and sold online, frequently with cryptocurrency, and they are generally encoded with the same underlying software as many cryptos.\u201d\n\nIn his earlier post, the corps member announced that he would be donating 50 percent of proceeds from the initiative to the man.\n\n\u201cMinted baba\u2019s pictures as nft and got them sold immediately. Inshallahu 50% is going to him. Ramadan Kareem,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a follow-up post on Friday, the photographer made good on his promise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe shared a video of himself giving the man the said percentage of the proceeds.\n\nOlashile further gave the man the sum of N100,000 donated to him after his photos went viral. The NFT creator also took the man to the bank to open an account for him.\n\n\u201cRemember Baba Onilu? This is the video of how I gave him 50% of the money made from his picture that minted as NFT on #opensea. Note: I\u2019m not rich, I just felt baba needs the money more, NFT is here to stay and I will be fine later,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRemember this?

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Can Hytch succeed where GoMyWay failed?",
          "text": "At the end of October 2018, the Nigerian ride-sharing platform GoMyWay ceased to exist after operating for about 4 years. According to a statement by the company\u2019s CEO Damilola Teidi, this was due to a lack of follow-on funding, as its investors had decided not to continue backing the company.\n\nIt was a surprising event, owing to the promise of the business at launch. Within its first month of launch, it announced that it would quickly expand into Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa. A pan-African expansion within launch month is unusual, but the calibre of investors\u2014Konga founder and CEO Sim Shagaya, and Co-Creation Hub (CcHub) and former Amazon and Naspers executive Bill Paladino\u2014on the startup\u2019s capital table somewhat made the possibility considerable. Though the expansion didn\u2019t eventually happen, the prospect of it happening, however, was an indication that the business was meeting its projection.\n\nIt\u2019s now 4 years since anybody last used GoMyWay, and another startup is ready to take up the challenge of scaling digital vehicle-pooling in Nigeria. Founded by Laolu Onifade, Hytch Africa was launched to the public last month\u2014after months of public building and teasing its internet community with product videos and pictures\u2014to help people share rides and move faster and cheaper.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLike GoMyWay, Hytch has also begun to ramp up users. The company announced, on its social media platforms, that it had acquired 600 users in just 3 days, with zero spend on marketing. Its CEO also tweeted that they are looking to get 2,000 users by the end of the second quarter.\n\nGoMyWay, before it went into oblivion, had said it had over 12,000 users and had completed 106,630 rides across 16 states in Nigeria. But how the 2 startups acquired users is different. While the defunct company ran free services, accompanied by giveaways, like offering car owners one month\u2019s supply of fuel, Onifade told TechCabal that Hytch hasn\u2019t spent a kobo on user acquisition.\n\nBusiness model is king\n\nGoMyWay had traction but wasn\u2019t making money. According to Teidi\u2019s statement, the plan by its shareholders and investors was to run a free service for a year or 2, then focus on growing the user base. So, there was traction with zero revenue and no way to monetise the business.\n\nFor Hytch, the opposite is the case as they want to make money as they go, and are already doing so. \u201cWe are already making money. We charge 15% on every ride and, since launch, we\u2019ve recorded an average of 25 rides daily,\u201d Onifade told TechCabal.\n\nLaolu Onifade, founder and CEO at Hytch\n\nHytch operates a cashless payment method and it provides an inbuilt wallet for both drivers and riders, and riders are automatically debited at the end of every trip they take.\n\nGoMyWay and others like Ridebliss, another local carpooling service that\u2019ve since failed, are great learning references for Hytch. Hytch, in a bid to capture the vehicle-pooling market, allows not just carpooling, but bus-pooling; buses can pick up people going their way. This means that public bus owners can also use the platform to get riders daily.\n\n\u201cHytch is not just for private car owners; there is a bus-pooling option as well,\u201d Onifade said.\n\nRide-sharing is essential\n\nVehicle-pooling is not new to people: globally, it\u2019s one common way for people to move from one place to another, hitching rides with an unknown driver at random locations or bus stops. What if this same experience can be digitised?\n\nThis is the question companies like Hytch are answering.\n\nDifferent ride-hailing companies are currently trying to incorporate ride-sharing into their product. Last year, Uber in Kenya was reported to be testing Pool Chance, a feature that lets riders heading in the same direction share the cost of the journey. They have plans to roll out the service to Ghana and Nigeria. The company first introduced the service to its San Francisco market, and it was reported to be a success until the pandemic forced its pause.\n\nAnother disturbing factor is that the ride-hailing sector\u2014even though it\u2019s not the most-funded tech sector\u2014requires a lot of capital to scale. At least that\u2019s what the top companies have done and made the world believe is best practice: burn heavy cash to acquire users. Bolt recently raised $607 million in a Series F round; Uber raised a total of $25.2 billion over 33 rounds before it IPOed in 2019; and even French BlaBlaCar, which is primarily doing the same thing as Hytch, has raised more than $443 million in venture capital since its founding in 2006 (its recent funding of $115 million came in April last year).\n\nFor now, it looks like the company has learnt a great deal from the defunct startups in the sector and may be well on its way to success. But it\u2019s too early to say.\n\nOnifade believes that his company has the skill and drive to build the product and a business model that works but do they have the money needed to fully build? Per investment, the CEO said they have raised a family-and-friends\u2019 round and are currently raising pre-seed.\n\nShare this article",

The Nairobi studio is the first in Africa and sixth globally.\n\nThe new facility supports Visa\u2019s commitment to promoting innovation and creating opportunities for clients and fintech partners to co-create market-relevant payment and commerce solutions throughout the region.\n\nAida Diarra, Senior vice president and head of Visa in Sub-Saharan Africa, said the studio will assist in increasing the Visa market in the region by issuing digital and physical Visa to its clients.\n\n\u201cSub-Saharan Africa is a fast-growing region with a tech-savvy population and as we continue to grow digital payments adoption in the region, our aspiration is to deepen our collaboration with clients and partners in developing solutions that are designed around the unique needs of Africa,\u201d said Diarra.\n\nA photo of the corner fabrics section at the Visa Innovation studio in Nairobi\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a brand built on technology, Visa has driven the major technology advancements that make electronic payments what they are today. We are confident that the innovation studio will continue that legacy and cement Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s position as a leader in creating out-of-the-box solutions to deal with our most pressing challenges as a region.\u201d\n\nVisa has previously used its existing innovation hubs to design products for the African market, including a collaboration with Nigerian Fintech Paga to develop new merchant acceptance solutions involving QR codes and NFC technology.\n\nLast year, Visa partnered with Kenya\u2019s largest telco Safaricom to allow M-Pesa\u2019s 24 million users and 173,000 local merchants to be linked to Visa\u2019s 61 million merchants and its more than 3 billion cards.\n\nAcross Africa, local and multinational corporations, as well as governments, have been launching innovation centres as a means to develop new products through collaborations and to remain globally competitive. Last month, Microsoft launched a new office for its African Development Centre in Lagos, it\u2019ll house the company\u2019s product engineering, ecosystem development and innovation teams. In 2021, Huawei also announced its intention to build an innovation and research centre in Tunisia.\n\nIn Kenya, organisations such as Cisco and Philips also run similar innovation studios in Nairobi, while the Kenyan government is building a technology city, Konza City, to drive innovation in the country.\n\nThe launch of Visa\u2019s first African innovation studio and others serves as a boost to the African tech ecosystem as it\u2019ll encourage the creation, development, and implementation of novel ideas.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to statistics from Intelligence by Techpoint, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has, since 2010, embarked on several industrial actions that have gone on for 742 cumulative days. That amounts to over two and a half years during which most of Nigeria\u2019s university undergraduates were out of school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUU strikes by duration since 2010\n\nDue to their indefinite nature, ASUU strikes seldom have an end date students can anticipate. So far in 2022, for instance, there have been 57 days of strike action, which might reach 90 days eventually.\n\nGiven the consistency of these strike actions and the inability of the Federal Government and the Union to reach a lasting agreement, taking advantage of these \u2018free days\u2019 to develop new skills and position yourself for ideal job openings won\u2019t be a bad idea.\n\nIf you\u2019ve accepted these consistent ASUU strikes and would like something to pass the time, you could consider learning these skills fit for high-ranking roles. Fortunately, you can learn almost anything online via YouTube channels, remote training institutes, boot camps, and paid or free online learning platforms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoftware engineering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware engineering is one of the most in-demand tech skills globally; consequently, organisations pay top dollar to get software engineers. Interestingly, you don\u2019t need to have a background in computer science or computer engineering to become a software engineer.\n\nYou can learn from scratch as long as you have soft skills like creative thinking, teamwork, consistency, and patience. For starters, you can go through different routes. An excellent place to begin is watching YouTube videos like this to know which fields interest you.\n\nBeyond soft skills, coding and programming are the fundamentals for software development. You will need to develop fluency and understanding of different programming languages like Python, Java, and C++, to mention a few. Being a software developer will require you to write lines upon lines of codes, and you can easily self-teach to be a programmer.\n\nBesides, basic coding skills come in handy for any position as they make launching an app, optimising a website for the search engines, and even creating or editing content easier.\n\nWith software engineering, there are diverse fields you can specialise in, such as:\n\nFrontend engineering\n\nBackend engineering\n\nCloud engineering\n\nMobile engineering\n\nMachine Learning engineering\n\nDevOps engineering\n\nData engineering\n\nYou can enrol for the next AltSchool cohort or use free online courses on Coursera, edX, Udacity, and Udemy, among others, to hit the ground running.\n\nProduct management\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough not a core tech skill, product management is vital for any solution-driven market, not only for startups but also for large companies interested in gaining and retaining customers and sustaining market relevance.\n\nThe responsibilities of a product manager include product development and product strategy, among others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is more enviable than developing a skill fit for a role that is described as the most important in a company because you have to create successful products that will get customers\u2019 interest, satisfy them, and attract prospects?\n\nTo become a product manager, you should learn analytical skills, hone research abilities, develop a great business sense, and have a basic understanding of what programming, marketing, and sales entail. Also, being smart with delegations won\u2019t hurt.\n\nRelevant courses have learning tracks that cover how to develop product strategy, product design, prototyping, testing customer development, product launch, and introduction to project management tools. Get going with free courses on Udemy or enrol and pay to get certified after course completion.\n\nContent development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Adeolu Eletu on Unsplash\n\nCreatively connecting with and engaging target customers is critical to selling a product. While content is key, quality content is king. Interestingly, with the Internet, the challenge of reaching many people is already half solved.\n\nCreating great digital content is one thing, developing a content plan and defining an approach for different platforms is another. All these make up the spice for effective communication.\n\nHowever, effective communication is only half the puzzle; there\u2019s still the question of reaching the right prospects. This is why understanding search engine optimisation (SEO) is key to excelling in this field.\n\nBecause content transcends texts, learning content development includes building basics in video content, graphics, animation, content design, surveys, and generating polls. There is a lot on the list, but you can get started here.\n\nDigital marketing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing is no longer restricted to offline activities due to the popularity of the Internet and social networking platforms. A digital marketer\u2019s role is to improve a company\u2019s online presence to make the business grow. This will involve tools and hacks in social media, email, and website marketing. Google digital skills for Africa has courses you can explore.\n\nGraphics and visual designing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow interesting would it be if you could help a business portray its brand professionally? As a graphics or visual designer, you\u2019re responsible for creating the best impression of your brand on customers.\n\nSometimes, you\u2019ll have to make designs to engage or inform customers or convince potential customers to use your product. If a picture is worth a thousand words, a graphic or visual design could be worth thousands of naira.\n\nAn interest in graphic and visual designing will have you learning how to use tools like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Canvas, Blender, Pixlr, and image libraries like Crello. Interestingly, many of these tools and software are free to use.\n\nData analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Myriam Jessier on Unsplash\n\nA data analyst role is key in any company planning to make improved business decisions. Data analysts are in high demand as companies want to draw meaningful insights from data gathered over time.\n\nIn 2021, the International Data Corporation (IDC) forecast spending on big data and analytics software to hit $215.7 billion by the end of the year and a 12.8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2025.\n\nYou will need to be proficient in Excel and similar statistical analysis tools, SQL, and data modelling tools, among others.\n\nThere are several career tracks to explore:\n\nData analysis\n\nData science\n\nPython\n\nQuantitative analysis\n\nStatistics\n\nMachine learning\n\nData engineering\n\nGet started with DataCamp courses or get certificate courses on Zacrac Learning.\n\nPenetration testing/cybersecurity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause companies now take online security seriously, penetration testing/cybersecurity skills are prioritised. Penetration testers ethically hack into devices to check for the vulnerabilities of websites, databases, or apps and ensure they are safe.

The Internet started with Web1, which was majorly one-sided and aptly named \u201cread-only web.\u201d\n\nHeralded by social media, Web2 gave room for anyone to create content on the Internet; consumers of the content could also give feedback on the content. Web2 is the business evolution of the Internet and has birthed some of the biggest tech companies in the world, such as Twitter, Meta, Amazon, and Google.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeb3, however, is bringing decentralisation to the Internet. An era where data and information are not held and controlled by one big corporation but by the users of every Internet platform.\n\nWith Blockchain being the underlying technology for Web3\u2019s promise of a decentralised Internet, the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit wants to assess these promises, their possibilities, and how to prepare for them.\n\nOn May 7, 2022, some of the biggest minds and stakeholders in Africa\u2019s Web3 space will be making sense of the buzzword and how Africa and Africans can position themselves to harness the best of all that Web3 offers.\n\nHighlights of the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Currency Summit 2021\n\nLast year, our Digital Currency Summit featured a business conference and discussions focusing on critical areas in novel applications of digital currency.\n\nThis year, we\u2019re going deeper. We\u2019re taking a magnifying glass to blockchain technology and looking at how it powers cryptocurrencies and many other innovations that have emerged from it, especially Web3.\n\nFrom learning the basics of Web3 to discovering how to build a career in Web3 and blockchain, the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit is unpacking all there is to know about Web3 in breakout sessions structured to answer specific Web3-related questions.\n\nIt will also feature a hackathon where incredible prizes will be won.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nWhat\u2019s new in Africa digital identity race\n\nEconet\u2019s Smart Dollar US Bundles\n\nWhile you\u2019re here, let\u2019s start the new week with a good deed. Help Techpoint Africa determine how much African tech workers earn by filling out this form or sharing it with your developer friends.\n\nDigital identity in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past week, news of telcos barring subscribers from making outgoing calls in Nigeria has been the talk of the town.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an exercise that has taken the better part of two years \u2014 with nine deadline extensions \u2014 it seems the Nigerian government\u2019s patience has run its course. It was initially begun in December 2020 to grow the country\u2019s digital identity database. This would, in turn, help with security and fraud issues.\n\nNigeria\u2019s \u2014 and indeed Africa\u2019s \u2014 struggle with digital identity is not new. But what\u2019s going on in other African countries?\n\nIn May 2021, Ghanaians were asked to re-register their Subscriber Identification Modules (SIM) cards by connecting their Ghana Card, the country\u2019s smart National ID. As of March 2022, nearly 14 million SIMs have been linked to the Ghana Card. According to Statista, in 2020, there were 31 million adults living in Ghana.\n\nIn Kenya, the Communications Authority (CA) of Kenya has told subscribers that their lines would be disconnected from this Thursday, April 15, 2022, if their details have not been registered with their respective telco providers.\n\nAccording to the CA\u2019s DG, Ezra Chiloba, there would be no deadline extension. Like in Nigeria, long queues have formed as people rush to meet the deadline, a situation which some are not particularly fond of. Currently, there are 65 million registered SIM cards in the country.\n\nOn a somewhat related note, Zambia is taking a different approach. In March 2022, the government disconnected over two million SIM cards in a bid to clamp down on fraudulent mobile money activities and \u201cillegal\u201d registrations. A bit high-handed if you ask me. But then, where does all this leave us?\n\nThe \u201cbig\u201d picture: According to the World Bank, 45% of people living in sub-Saharan Africa have no form of legal identification. Certainly, the current digital identification drive is crucial \u2014 not to talk of legal \u2014 but questions regarding government trust also have to be asked. Do citizens trust their government to use this data for the right purposes? How does the government currently use the data that is available to it? Is there good faith?\n\nEconet introduces US dollar bundles in Zimbabwe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEver heard of the term hyperinflation? Well, if you haven\u2019t, here\u2019s a simple way to look at it. This morning, you went to the supermarket to buy a loaf of bread for $2. In the afternoon, your colleague goes to buy the same loaf of bread, but this time, it\u2019s sold at $10. By evening, on your way home, you decide to get a loaf for tea tomorrow morning, and again the price has risen. This time, it\u2019s at $25.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHyperinflation is extremely rapid inflation. Prices of goods and services rise uncontrollably over a defined period. This is commonly caused by an increasing amount of money in supply when there is no supporting economic growth. So, a government printing more cash to pay its debts or solve economic problems \u2014 cough cough, Zimbabwe \u2014 could lead to hyperinflation.\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s history with hyperinflation goes back a long way, since 2007, with inflation rates hitting as high as 79.6 billion% month-on-month in 2008. Although the country appeared to bounce back in recent years, with the introduction of other currencies like the US dollar and the Rand, there are still some ways to go. The digitisation of transactions has also helped with increasing cash availability challenges.\n\nThis year, inflation rates have shot up to 72.7% as of March 2022.\n\nTo help ease the burden, telecom operator, Econet Wireless, has introduced Smart US Dollar Bundles to enable subscribers to buy airtime, SMS products, and Internet data in US dollars.\n\nWhile the Zimbabwean dollar can be used to purchase items, it is not very valuable. The country\u2019s economy is pegged to the US dollar, and visitors are encouraged to spend in that currency.\n\nEconet\u2019s new product is expected to bring relief to millions of customers with US dollar-free funds without first changing their money into local currency \u2014 a very dicey and expensive experience.\n\nThis move would also help the company generate foreign currency, which it can then reinvest.\n\nTechpoint stories last week\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nOpportunities\n\neLimu (CcHub) is hiring a mid-level Game Developer.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe commitment of the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration to the implementation of the Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) Agenda has brought about a series of notable reforms in the State Civil and Public service.\n\nSpecifically, the State has adopted top-to-bottom, bottom-down and unilateral approaches to reinvigorate the Service by building and developing human capacity, creating a digitally-driven culture of performance management, enshrining a new culture to make workers accountable in the Service to enhance productivity, efficiency and promote better service delivery.\n\nThe latest in these efforts is the State government\u2019s collaboration with MacTay Consulting, on an 8-day Performance Management System (PMS) training exercise that was designed to equip Commissioners, Permanent Secretaries and Directors in the various Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), with the requisite knowledge and skills to fully adopt the new PMS which makes use of the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) introduced into the State Civil/Public in the Second Quarter performance review of 2021.\n\nPMS is a new evaluation system introduced by the Federal Government of Nigeria in November 2020 in place of the Annual Performance Evaluation Report (APER) to assess Civil/Public servants\u2019 performances and ultimately transform the State\u2019s workforce into a competent, efficient and competitive one.\n\nEdo State, which has been rated as a leading State in institutional reforms and accountability to citizens, is in a hurry to rid its institutions of dysfunctional processes and systems, and is one of the few States that have adopted this system.\n\nIn her opening address, the Managing Director of the Chief John Odigie-Oyegun Public Service Academy, Mrs. Precious Imuwahen Ajoonu, welcomed participants on behalf of Governor Obaseki and advised participants to take the training seriously as the State expects much from them.\n\nShe reiterated the State government\u2019s position on value creation and usage and how each person would be held accountable in the new era.\n\nShe said: \u201cGovernor Obaseki takes this training very seriously, if you can recall, we should have been doing the Quarter 1 performance review by this time, however, we have suspended that until we complete this exercise because we do not want a situation where we carry out reviews and we get the kind of feedback we used to get in the past. We want leaders in the Edo State Government to take ownership of their scorecards.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe are going to do the performance review training a bit differently this time around, instead of brining participants per sector, we selected participants to fit into the six (6) thematic pillars of the MEGA Vision and it is our thinking that at the end of this training exercise, MacTay would have taken us through the scorecard to understand it and spend less time during the review.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate destination is to be able to move this to the E-GOV platform to make it electronically-driven.\u201d\n\nIn attendance were the Head of Service, Anthony Okungbowa Esq, Commissioners for Agriculture, Water Resources, Local Government Affairs, Physical, Urban and Regional Planning and Mrs. Elizabeth Rotimi of MacTay Consulting among others.\n\nIn the course of the training, participants were advised to take performance review seriously as targets must be met, and taxpayers\u2019 money must be accounted for.\n\nThe training which adopted a very practical approach had Public servants trained on how to appropriately fill in the BSC, carry out proper job alignment and placement in their respective MDAs, bring out the best in their subordinates and strategically meet citizens\u2019 expectations which the MEGA Agenda of the State Government is set to deliver.\n\nBSC which is a framework that helps organizations translate strategies into operational objectives that drive both performance and behavioral cultures would ensure Civil/Public servants are accountable for their respective responsibility, as it\u2019s no longer business as usual.\n\nPrior now, the Annual Performance Evaluation Report (APER) system used for appraising Public servants was faulted because of its catalogue of drawbacks which include; bias/sentimental appraisal of staff, poor prioritization of tasks/goals, poor role definition, favoritism and subjectivity, no uniform parameters of assessment, unrealistic and unclear tasks/goals, political interference, no strict adherence to who evaluates and most importantly inadequate information training across board by those using it for evaluation.\n\nThe inability to properly, fairly and justly explicate and value each employee\u2019s contribution has been one of the greatest challenges emanating from the use of the APER system as what cannot be measured cannot be done.\n\nMost of the civil servants delivering on their responsibilities despite their counterparts\u2019 behaviors towards work assumed that since commitment was not valued appropriately they may as well be reluctant on their jobs concurring with the wrong sayings \u201cIf you cannot beat them, you join them.\u201d\n\nThe loopholes in the system are currently addressed by the PMS and the role of Public servants as the custodians of Citizens hard earned taxes and not the owners, has been reiterated from all the policies and programs of this present administration thus enshrining accountability and transparency in the system. The administration believes that performance is key if they must deliver on the promises made to Edo people.\n\nThe PMS which appraises the State civil/public servants ascertains each employee\u2019s contribution, measures the value each brings to their MDAs, builds performance culture and excellent service, brings about career development in service and ultimately achieves the MEGA Vision.\n\n\u201cThe BSC has the ability to change the behavior of employees. The end of performance is a consequence. Positive behavior recognized and valued will get repeated and even replicated, while negative behavior reprimanded would be discouraged. Performance determines rating not looks or familiarity. PMS is a shift in mindset\u201d said Mr. Ajayi Adeyemi, a Consultant and Facilitator from MacTay Consulting.\n\nThe Edo State Government has done a lot to change the culture of its workforce and training of these top officials is one of the steps in this direction because culture is the shadow of a leader.\n\nThe adoption of a merit-based system of recruitment and appraisal which was clearly seen in the just-concluded recruitment exercise that absorbed over 300 young graduates and the Promotion examination exercise for civil servants on grade levels 8 and 9, are true reflections that the Governor is setting a new pace that we all must follow to achieve our vision 2030.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s vice president, Yemi Osinbajo, on Monday, formally declared his intention to run for president in 2023, ending years of speculations about his presidential run.\n\nIn a broadcast posted on all his verified social media handles, he promised to build on the legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari, his principal.\n\nOsinbajo, who turned 65 last month, is a senior advocate of Nigeria and a former lecturer at the University of Lagos. He is also a senior pastor with the Redeemed Christian Church of God.\n\nHe began his public office career in 1988 as an Adviser (legal advice and litigation) to the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Bola Ajibola, a position he held for four years.\n\nThe Vice-President was appointed Attorney-General of Lagos State in 1999 by then Governor, Bola Tinubu, and held the position till 2007, implementing several judicial reforms.\n\nHe was nominated as Buhari\u2019s running mate in 2014 and was elected alongside Buhari in 2015. During his seven-year tenure as Vice-President, Osinbajo served as acting President for more than 120 non-consecutive days while his principal was on medical leave in London between 2016 and 2018.\n\nOsinbajo will be contesting the APC Presidential primary against Tinubu, his former boss; the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi; and Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, among others.\n\nHis Full Declaration Speech Below:\n\nWHY I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, BY OSINBAJO\n\nIn the past seven years, I have served as Vice President under a true Nigerian patriot, a servant of the nation in war and peace, and a man of integrity, President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nWe have, together, worked through some of the most difficult times in the history of our Nation, but we have remained focused on securing the country, providing infrastructure and growing our economy.\n\nAs stipulated by the Nigerian Constitution, our tenure will end next year.\n\nIn this period of seven years, I have served the government in several capacities, and have, at the direction of Mr. President, represented our country in sensitive high level international engagements. I have been to practically all local governments in Nigeria. I have been in markets, factories, schools, and farms. I have been in agricultural, mining and oil producing communities; in the Delta, in Kebbi, Enugu, Borno; Rivers, Plateau and Ondo; & in all other States of the Federation, listening to the diverse experiences and yearnings of our people.\n\nI have visited our gallant troops in the North East and our brothers and sisters in the IDP camps. I have felt the pain and anguish of victims in violent conflicts, terrorist attacks, flooding, fire and other disasters.\n\nI have been in the homes of many ordinary Nigerians in various parts of the country. have sat with our techprenuers: in Lagos, Edo, and Kaduna, with our Nollywood and Kannywood actors, with our musicians, from Lagos, Onitsha, and Kano. And I have spoken to small and large businesses.\n\nI stood where they stood and sat where they sat.

          "text": "Elder statesman and leader of Afenifere, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, has said that at the age of 94, he\u2019s already gone and only expecting his funeral.\n\nAdebanjo who turned 94 on Sunday, April 10, made the declaration in an interview on the state of the nation to mark the birthday anniversary.\n\nSpeaking on the state of the nation, Adebanjo said his greatest regret about Nigeria is that he is going to leave behind a country led by the blind and with blind followers.\n\n\u201cI have nothing to worry except Nigeria that I am going to die in this position that blind people are leading the country, the followers are equally blind,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody wants material gain. It is unfortunate and that is what makes me sad.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he was expecting a revolution in the country given its persisting challenges, Adebanjo who decried the failed leadership in the country and the refusal to restructure the country, answered in the affirmative.\n\nHe noted, however, that he has tried his best and would leave the issues for the younger generation, as according to him, he\u2019s already gone and expecting his funeral.\n\n\u201cOf course. Mind you, I have told people, freedom is never granted, it is won. It is the people who are suffering that will show by their action, the way people like Sunday Igboho are reacting, the way people like Nnamdi Kanu are reacting and more will react. They will be forced to go to the streets and call for a change,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou say you don\u2019t want the country to break and you want to stop a revolution, make the constitution acceptable to everybody.\n\n\u201cLet us sit down, if you are not going to accept the one we had at independence, you are not going to accept the 2014 National Conference report or the el-Rufai report, then, let us sit down and talk but you said know; you want to impose the constitution brought by the army that is in favour of a section of the country that makes the ruler a dictator, which they are now doing. Who will accept that and you say you want peace.\n\n\u201cYou are just playing to the gallery; I have said it that the problem of the country is obvious, a lay man can solve it.\n\n\u201cThey introduced ethnicity and religion, all because they want to stay in power and some people, who eat the crumbs from the table, support them but once the crumbs are not there, they revolt. That is what is happening in the APC when they rigged the national chairman into office. Have you heard of consensus democracy? It is a shame.\n\n\u201cIt is left for you younger generation and as I said, I am already gone and I am expecting my funeral.\n\n\u201cWill I say that God has not been kind enough to me? I am 94. Where are my other colleagues? I am worried about those I am going to leave behind. In the First Republic, you will promise your son and daughter that if he or she makes a first class, you will buy a car for them. Can the father buy a bicycle for himself now?\u201d Adebanjo queried.\n\nSpeaking on the upcoming 2023 general election, he said the polls will be an exercise in futility without restructuring.\n\n\u201cIt is an exercise in futility. I have said it before. The 2023 elections, without restructuring, is an exercise in futility and I stand by it,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the Kaduna-Abuja train attack and the threat by Governor Nasir el-Rufai that North West governors would hire mercenaries to tackle insecurity in their region if the Federal Government fails to curb the menace, he said, \u201cThat is not the first time; it is unfortunate that they are all living in denial.I have said it before that Buhari has failed in everything he promised us and he has failed in the major thing he should do for the country- to protect lives and property. What has he done to stop insecurity? Every day when they kill, he would say \u201cI give marching orders\u201d. How many marching orders has he given?\n\n\u201cSince when has the governor of Borno State told us Boko Harm has taken so many local governments in his state? Have you heard that they have recovered those local governments?\n\n\u201cSince when has the government of Niger State told us that Boko Haram territories are increasing?You see, they are all living in denial. They know the solution to the problems of the country. I take you up again. You mentioned el-Rufai. The man said that the attack on the train could have been avoided and he gave the details that the DSS and security agencies know where the terrorists are, they had discussions with them. Has the government responded to them? Is that the first time?\n\n\u201cA former general once said that he has given the list of those in charge of Boko Haram to Buhari since 2018 and that some of them are in the cabinet of Buhari, some are in the Senate. Has the government refuted that statement?\n\n\u201cAnd if you remember, General Theophilus Danjuma once said that the Army is in collusion, has the government refuted that? What has the government said or done to deny or refute all these allegations?\u201d",

She does not do anything on her own.\n\n\u201cShe would say, please beg my husband. She was at his mercy. I didn\u2019t know the intensity of what she was going through; I didn\u2019t know how somebody would be jealous of the wife he claimed to love.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of stories where people told her this and that, but what I know was that the control was too much.

          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Monday declared his intention to run for the presidential seat in the 2023 election, ending months of speculation over his interest in the post.\n\nOsinbajo joins the increasing number of high-profile Nigerians who have declared their interest in the country\u2019s presidential post under the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nBelow is his full declaration speech:\n\nWHY I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, BY OSINBAJO\n\n*My experiences, insights, opportunities must be used for Nigeria and Nigerians, VP adds\n\nIn the past seven years, I have served as Vice President under a true Nigerian patriot, a servant of the nation in war and peace, and a man of integrity, President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nWe have, together, worked through some of the most difficult times in the history of our Nation, but we have remained focused on securing the country, providing infrastructure and growing our economy.\n\nAs stipulated by the Nigerian Constitution, our tenure will end next year.\n\nIn this period of seven years, I have served the government in several capacities, and have, at the direction of Mr. President, represented our country in sensitive high level international engagements. I have been to practically all local governments in Nigeria. I have been in markets, factories, schools, and farms. I have been in agricultural, mining and oil producing communities; in the Delta, in Kebbi, Enugu, Borno; Rivers, Plateau and Ondo; & in all other States of the federation, listening to the diverse experiences and yearnings of our people.\n\nI have visited our gallant troops in the North East and our brothers and sisters in the IDP camps. I have felt the pain and anguish of victims in violent conflicts, terrorist attacks, flooding, fire and other disasters.\n\nI have been in the homes of many ordinary Nigerians in various parts of the country. I have sat with our techprenuers in Lagos, Edo, and Kaduna, with our Nollywood and Kannywood actors; with our musicians, from Lagos, Onitsha, and Kano. And I have spoken to small and large businesses.\n\nI stood where they stood and sat where they sat. I know their hopes, aspirations and fears; and I believe that in those hopes and aspirations are the seeds for the great Nigeria that we all desire.\n\nI believe that the very reason why the Almighty God gave me these experiences, these insights, and these opportunities, is that they must be put to the use of our country and it\u2019s great peoples.\n\nWhich is why I am today, with utmost humility, formally declaring my intention to run for the Office of the President, Federal Republic of Nigeria, on the platform of our great party, the All Progressives Congress.\n\nIf by the grace of God and the will of the people, I am given the opportunity, then I believe that first, we must complete what we have started;\n\n*radically transforming our security and intelligence architecture,\n\n*completing the reform of our justice system focusing on adequate remuneration and welfare of judicial personnel,\n\n*ensuring justice for all and the observance of rule of law,\n\n*rapidly advancing our infrastructure development, especially power, roads, railways and broadband connectivity,\n\n*providing an excellent environment for businesses to thrive,\n\n*taking the agriculture revolution to the next level especially mechanization and developing the farm to table value chain\n\n*making sure that the government, its agencies and regulators serve the business community,\n\n*creating a tech economy that will provide jobs for millions;\n\n*enhancing our Social Investment Programme to a full scale social welfare scheme,\n\n*completing the promise of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty within this decade,\n\n*completing the task of ensuring that all Nigerians, male and female, attend school,\n\n*reforming our educational system for relevance to the challenges of this century,\n\n*completing the task of universal health coverage for all,\n\nand\n\n*strengthening the capacity of States and Local Governments to deliver on their respective mandates.\n\nAbove all, front and centre of our efforts will be the provision of jobs and opportunities for our young people.\n\nI now most solemnly and respectfully seek the support of fellow Nigerians everywhere in this land, and the diaspora, young and old, male and female, in the great and exciting journey that we have ahead of us.\n\nWe will, working together, establish by the grace of God, the Nigeria of our dreams in a few short years. We will build on the foundation laid by our predecessors. We will need to move, with much speed, intentionality, and perseverance, towards the vision of a prosperous, stable, and secure nation.\n\nI am convinced beyond doubt that we have the creativity, the courage, the talent, and the resources to be the foremost black nation on earth. Let us now birth the expectations of greatness conceived generations before us.\n\nLet us build a Nigeria where the man from Nnewi sees the man in Gusau as his brother, where the woman in Warri sees the woman in Jalingo as her sister, where the love of our nation burns alike in the hearts of boys and girls\n\nfrom Gboko to Yenogoa. Where everywhere, in this land, is home for everyone, where our diversities, tribes and faiths unite, rather than divide us.\n\nLet our tribes become one tribe; the Nigerian tribe, where all are treated fairly, justly and with respect. Where all are given equal access to the abundant opportunities that God has bestowed on this nation. It\u2019s time.\n\nGod bless and keep our Republic and its great people.\n\nProf. Yemi Osinbajo, SAN\n\nVice President, Federal Republic of Nigeria\n\nMonday April 11, 2022",

          "text": "French leader Emmanuel Macron and challenger Marine Le Pen qualified for what promises to be a very tightly fought presidential election runoff on April 24, pitting a pro-European economic liberal against a far-right nationalist.\n\nWith 96 percent of the votes counted for Sunday\u2019s first round, Macron garnered 27.41 percent of the votes and Le Pen 24.03 percent.\n\nIn face of the results, other major candidates admitted defeat, and except for another far-right candidate, Eric Zemmour, they all urged voters to block the far-right in the second round.\n\nBut after five years in power in which his abrasive style has upset many, while Le Pen succeeded in softening her image, Macron will have to fight hard to win back disgruntled voters. He cannot take it for granted that voters will rally around a traditional anti-far right front.\n\n\u201cNothing is decided, and the battle we will wage in the next 15 days will be decisive for France and Europe,\u201d Macron told supporters, urging all voters to rally behind him on April 24th to stop the far-right from ruling the European Union\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nIfop pollsters predicted a very tight runoff, with 51 percent for Macron and 49 percent for Le Pen. The gap is so tight that victory either way is within the margin of error.\n\nOther pollsters offered a slightly bigger margin in favour of Macron, with up to 54 percent. But that was in any case much narrower than in 2017, when Macron beat Le Pen with 66.1 percent of the votes.\n\nLe Pen, who had eaten into Macron\u2019s once-commanding 10-point poll lead in recent weeks thanks to a campaign focused on cost-of-living issues said she was the one to protect the weak and unite a nation tired of its elite.\n\n\u201cWhat will be at stake on April 24 is a choice of society, a choice of civilisation,\u201d she told supporters, who chanted \u201cWe will win!\u201d as she told them: \u201cI will bring order back to France.\u201d\n\nMacron, meanwhile, told supporters waving French and EU flags: \u201cThe only project that is credible to help purchasing power is ours.\u201d\n\nFollowing the announcement of the projections, Communist Party candidate Fabien Roussel, Socialist Anne Hidalgo, Yannick Jadot of the Greens and right-wing Republicans\u2019 candidate Valerie Pecresse said they would vote for Macron to prevent the far-right leader from coming to power.\n\n\u201cSo that France does not fall into hatred of all against all, I solemnly call on you to vote on April 24 against the far-right of Marine Le Pen,\u201d Hidalgo, who polled ninth with just under two percent of votes, said.\n\nPecresse also said she would vote for Macron, warning of \u201cdisastrous consequences\u201d if he did not win the runoff. Melenchon urged his supporters to refrain from voting for Le Pen in the runoff.\n\n\u201cWe know who we will never vote for \u2026 Not a single vote must go to Mrs Le Pen,\u201d he said at his party headquarters in Paris, stopping short of telling supporters they should back Macron.\n\nFar-right candidate Eric Zemmour endorsed Le Pen, the only major candidate to do so. He acknowledged disagreements with Le Pen, but said Macron was a worse choice.\n\nPolitical Commentator Pierre Huski said that Le Pen might be disappointed with the projected results announced.\n\nHuski believes the gap between the estimated votes of Le Pen and Macron makes the former a weaker challenger than she imagined for the second round.\n\n\u201cThe next two weeks will be pretty hard for her as she has to face the president, who is good at debating, on a televised debate,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cFive years ago, she lost [to Macron] because of the same debate.\u201d\n\nLate campaign run\n\nNot for two decades has a French president won a second term.\n\nBarely a month ago, Macron appeared near certain to reverse that, riding high in polls thanks to strong economic growth, a fragmented opposition and his statesman role in trying to avert war on Europe\u2019s eastern flank.\n\nHowever, he paid a price for late entry into the campaign, during which he eschewed market walkabouts in provincial France in favour of a single big rally outside Paris. A plan to make people work longer also proved unpopular.\n\nBy contrast, Le Pen for months toured towns and villages across France, focusing on cost-of-living issues that trouble millions and tapping into anger towards the political elite.\n\nA Le Pen victory on April 24 would lurch France, the European Union\u2019s second-largest economy, from being a driving force for European integration to being led by a euro-sceptic who is also suspicious of the NATO military alliance.\n\nWhile Le Pen has ditched past ambitions for a \u201cFrexit\u201d or to haul France out of the eurozone\u2019s single currency, she envisages the EU as a mere alliance of sovereign states.\n\nWho next holds the Elysee Palace will depend on how those who backed Macron and Le Pen\u2019s rivals cast their ballots. In past elections in 2002 and 2017, voters on the left and right have united to block the far-right from power.",
