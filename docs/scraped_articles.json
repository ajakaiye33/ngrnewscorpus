          "title": "More defections loom in APC as PDP woos Yari, Marafa",
          "text": "Several factions of the All Progressives Congress in at least 12 states have started defecting to the Peoples Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party ahead of the primaries which begin next month, The PUNCH has learnt.\n\nThe crisis began last year as fallout of the party congresses in the states which led to the emergence of factions.\n\nThe PUNCH learnt that although the crisis began while then Caretaker Chairman, Governor Mai Mala Buni, was still in charge, a decision of the new Chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, to take sides with some of the factions in court had also deepened the crisis in the party.\n\nAlready, the Speaker of the Sokoto State House of Assembly, Aminu Achida, and the Deputy Chief Whip, Alhaji Murtala Maigona, who have been engaged in a feud with a former Governor of Sokoto, Senator Aliyu Wamakko, have both defected to the PDP following Adamu\u2019s decision to recognise Wamakko\u2019s faction.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that Adamu had ordered the APC legal team to withdraw all cases from the Court of Appeal and obey all subsisting High Court judgments instead.\n\nThis decision was not well received in some states including in Akwa Ibom where the faction loyal to the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, was inaugurated to the chagrin of erstwhile Caretaker Secretary, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, who is now accusing Adamu of disregarding an order of the Court of Appeal that the status quo be maintained.\n\nLast month, the faction in Kwara State loyal to the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, defected to the SDP.\n\nWith party primaries beginning next month, APC factions who have lost out are now defecting at a fast rate.\n\nIn Zamfara State, a former Governor, Abdul\u2019Aziz Yari; an ex-lawmaker, Senator Kabiru Mafara; and other top APC members have almost finalised plans to join the PDP.\n\nBriefing journalists in Gusau on Sunday, the PDP chairman, Colonel Bala Mande (retd.), said the party had received Yari, Marafa and other top APC members who have joined the party together with their supporters.\n\nMande said, \u201cGentlemen of the press, we have called you to brief you on the joining of our great party the PDP by former Governor Yari, Senator Kabiru Mafara and their supporters. They have joined us, we have reached an agreement and we are going to implement the agreement.\n\n\u201cWe have agreed to be together in one party, the PDP and work together for the success of the party. We have also agreed to work extra hard in order to reclaim Zamfara State in 2023 and save its people from the present their predicament. I have given the stakeholders a complete update of where we are as a result of this development.\u201d\n\nThe chairman maintained that, Yari, Marafa and other top APC members would be officially received in Gusau in a colourful ceremony.\n\nHowever, Marafa told The PUNCH that negotiations are still ongoing.\n\n\u201cNo, it (defection report) is not correct. We are talking. It is not correct,\u201d he stated.\n\nSpeaking with The PUNCH on Sunday, the former ranking member of the Senate, who criticised the APC for handing over the structure of the party in Zamfara State to \u201cnew comers,\u201d said other parties had begun to approach him and Yari.\n\nMarafa lamented the alleged marginalisation of founding leaders of the APC by the Buni-led committee.\n\nThe ex-lawmaker also noted that time was running against aspirants in his faction of the APC, as deadlines on the Independent National Electoral Commission\u2019s timetable for the 2023 general elections are fast approaching.\n\nWhen asked if there is likelihood of him and Yari joining the PDP, Marafa said, \u201cThere is a probability of going. If you look at the injustice meted out to us by the Mai Mala Buni leadership; if you look at the INEC timetable, then unless we want to retire from politics, we will have to go somewhere.\u201d\n\nBauchi Speaker dumps APC, joins PDP\n\nThe Speaker of the Bauchi State House of Assembly, Abubakar Sulaiman, has dumped the APC, the party upon which he was elected the member representing Ningi Constituency in 2019 and joined the ruling PDP in the state.\n\nSulaiman, who is also the Chairman, Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures of Nigeria, made his defection known during a Ramadan breaking of fast (Iftar) dinner hosted by Governor Bala Mohammed, which held at the Government House, Bauchi late Saturday night.\n\nThe event was attended by PDP stakeholders from Ningi, Toro, Warji and Dass local government areas of the state.\n\nIn a short video of the event, which was obtained by our correspondent early Sunday morning, the Speaker, in his speech at the Iftar, was heard introducing the Chairman of the PDP in the state, Hamza Akuyam, as \u201cChairman of our great party, the PDP.\n\n\u201cThe governor said there is a new groom in the PDP, there is no lie about that fact.\u201d This, he said, to the cheers and applause of those present including the governor.\n\nSuleiman went on further to say, \u201cI know there have been speculations; people have been saying that, \u2018he has defected to the PDP,\u2019 others said, \u2018no he has not defected\u2019.\n\n\u201cBut today in this place, I want to happily announce to you all that I am now a member of the PDP.\u201d\n\nImmediately he announced his defection, the whole gathering erupted in claps, shouts and cheers.\n\nAccording to him, his decision to join the PDP in the state was as a result of the \u201cexemplary leadership style of Governor Mohammed and his commitment to transform the state.\u201d\n\nHe also commended the governor for his ability to ensure harmonious working relationship with the State Assembly despite party differences which allowed formulation and implementation of policies and programmes aimed at ensuring the development of the State.\n\nThe PUNCH reports that the Speaker\u2019s defection has put to rest months of speculations across the state that despite being in the APC publicly, he was operating as a member of the PDP.\n\nSuleiman never fails to seize any opportunity to always praise the transformation drive of the governor and his administration.\n\nThe 9th Assembly in Bauchi State from inception in June 2018, had been controlled by members of the APC with 22 members, the PDP had eight while the New Nigeria People\u2019s Party had one.\n\nHowever, gradually, some members of the APC kept defecting to the PDP including the NNPP member.\n\nWith Suleiman\u2019s defection, the APC currently has 16 members while the PDP has 15.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Nigerian duo Joe Aribo and Calvin Bassey were impressive for Glasgow Rangers as they came from behind to beat Old Firm rivals Celtic 2-1 in the Scottish Cup semi-final after extra-time in Hampden Park on Sunday, The PUNCH reports.\n\nCeltic went into the game hoping to keep their hopes of a fifth domestic treble in six seasons alive, after winning the Scottish League Cup in December and establishing a six-point lead at the top of the Scottish Premiership.\n\nHowever, Giovanni van Bronckhorst\u2019s men were the better side from the kick off and Aribo had the chance to give the Gers the early lead but saw his header narrowly miss the target.\n\nJohn Lundstram almost handed Rangers the lead but curled his shot against the post as the men in blue enjoyed the better of the first half, but their threat faded after Aaron Ramsey was injured shortly before the break.\n\nIn the absence of the injured Ramsey, Aribo took charge of play in the midfield and was at the heart of every move made by Rangers.\n\nDespite their dominance, Celtic took the lead in the 63 minutes after Greg Taylor fired a low finish beyond Jon McLaughlin.\n\nThe Hoops came close to adding a second five minutes later when Cameron Carter-Vickers crashed a left-footed shot against the crossbar from a corner.\n\nThey were however made to pay for that missed opportunity after 78 minutes after Bassey\u2019s cross was met by Kemar Roofe whose heavy touch fell nicely to Scott Arfield to curl home just four minutes after coming on to force an additional time.\n\nWith a penalty shoot-out on the horizon, Rangers found time for a winner as Bassey\u2019s left-wing cutback was diverted into his own net by Starfelt, ending Celtic\u2019s treble hopes and booking Rangers\u2019 cup final spot where Hearts lie in wait after overcoming Hibernian on Saturday.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Patrick \u2018Dr P\u2019 Omoyeni, FIXIT Founder celebrates birthday, returns glory to God",
          "text": ".\n\nLagos (GPP), Patrick \u201cDr. P\u201d Omoyeni, Founder/President of the multifunctional popular online and mobile service place, Fixit.ng, Never Get Stranded Enterprises, celebrates his birthday today. Godspowerproject authoritatively confirms, as family, friends and colleagues celebrate this seasoned exporter and Chartered Management Consultant.\n\nFIXIT NIGERIA or FIXIT NG, the impactful brand which Patrick started in 2020, is now a thriving aggregator in the services and trade industry in Nigeria bridging the gap between service needers and providers who need verified data of artisans, professionals and other services being rendered by this brand. In the words of its Founder/President, \u201cFixit is a divine idea from God,\u201d\n\n\u2018One day I was driving along the Expressway, I thought within myself, how would stranded travellers whose vehicles suddenly break down in this forested area get help? I immediately checked my phone to see if there\u2019s any of such service efficient and up-to-the-rescue enough, I could not find any good directory that could do the magic. That meant to me there is a wide gap that was needed to be filled to impacting lives in this context.\n\nLater on, other ideas started coming in, like a multifunctional directory of all professionals and artisans across all the states cities and major towns in Nigeria, along with a database to help local exporters easily connect with foreign buyers, And especially Fixit-DTM, Dating to Marry, which is focused on connecting matured singles who are ready to marry. The idea of dating to marry came in when we found out that a number of singles are engrossed with the routine of work, home and worship centres which of course overtime become commonplace and do not expose them to external environment where their prospective specifications of the opposite sex they would like to marry could be found.\n\nFIXIT DTM is focused on connecting these serious and matured singles, as we gather their data and put the necessary IT and on-the-field mechanisms to connect them.\n\nThe site\u2019s growing popularity among Nigerians has made its amiable Founder a highly sought-after Consultant within and outside Nigeria in the shortest while. Despite his hectic schedule as the Operations Manager at Palmadex Global Integrated Services Ltd, Dr. Patrick Omoyeni still finds time to have meetings with the IT, Media and Admin Personnels of FIXIT as well as review reports of FIXIT agents across the States in Nigeria including the Federal Capital City, Abuja. These FIXIT agents called FIXITpros are saddled with the responsibilities of gathering data and verifying artisans, professionals, exporters, serious singles and widowed individuals in need of serious companionship as well as market and distribute FIXIT products.\n\nCurrently, almost all the states in Nigeria has a number of FIXITpros on paid employment with FIXIT.\n\nExport is Nigerian future of the economy. FIXIT profiles Nigerian products to the international market by putting registered exporters on first page search result.\n\nInternational Community as we may know, like Nigerian products, because we produce raw materials that are non GMOs- all naturally grown. FIXIT serves as a connect between Nigerian exporters and international buyers.\n\n\u201cDr. P\u201d, who is 7th among the 8th children of Pa (Amb) Julius and Mrs. Regina Omoyeni, highlights that the definitive purpose of establishing Fixit NG, Never Get Stranded is to connect people and businesses. And at the same time, make solid impact by putting everyone on a platform where they can be easily connected, both nationally and internationally.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot coming onboard Fixit. As a brand we will also be launching more life impactful products and services. FIXIT Feed will provide an opportunity for Nigerians to put up daily updates, ideas, current trends and information. FIXIT JOBS/VACANCIES is a platform for posting job opportunities and vacancies for companies recruiting and applicants.\n\nFIXIT NG mobile app is one of a kind. It is a one-stop app where we provide all the necessary services that everyone needs everyday.\n\nFIXIT NG is fully registered, trademarked and certified by necessary Nigerian government agencies as well as some international bodies.\n\nAligning his brand closely with the renowned exporting organisation, Palmadex Global Integrated Services Ltd, led to easy success for the export arm of Fixit and caught the eye of foreign buyers for local products.\n\nAccording to verified sources, the multiple award-winning Dr Patrick Omoyeni grew up in a very poor background, where sometimes he and his siblings would go to school without breakfast. He attended St. Mary\u2019s Primary School, Oka Akoko, and had his secondary school education in African Church Grammar School also in Oka Akoko before attaining a level of training at the Nigerian Institute of Aviation Management, with a Diploma in Aviation Management. He later bagged his first degree at the University of Port Harcourt.\n\nAs an undergraduate who was home for 10 years before gaining University admission. He loved surfing the internet and gathering information, especially after attending the Institute of Aviation and eventually gaining admission into the University of Port Harcourt.\n\nSpeaking on Dr. Patrick\u2019s antecedents as a trailblazer, his older brother and chairman of Palmadex Global Integrated Services, alongside Principles and Application of Environmental Impact Assessment, Dr. Benard Omoyeni, expressed joy concerning the milestone, he was quoted saying\n\n\u201cI am delighted to wish my beloved brother, lover of God and humanity a Happy birthday. We roll out the drums to celebrate God\u2019s faithfulness today as he has brought you to witness this milestone of 40 years. You are a product of grace, encapsulated by Shekinah\u2019s glory. At 40 you are blazing the trail, setting the pace in export trade and e-commerce creating landmark value to the economy of Nigeria. Age 40 represents a generational shift. I see you moving to new realms of exploiting this new phase of your life. As the Lord liveth your days shall be long and you shall fulfil destiny in colourful styles. Amen.\n\nOn behalf of the Management and staff of Palmadex, I wish our diligent and dutiful Operations Manager a most fulfilling and remarkable 40th birthday celebration.\u201d\n\nHis day job as Operations Manager at Palmadex Global Integrated Services Ltd, Nigeria and Palmadex LLC, Dubai, keeps him abreast of international trade policies that got him involved with many international functions and recognitions, winning many globally ranking awards top among which is the highly revered Kwame Nkrumah Award for Transformational Leadership, in recognition of notable impact in his business area. Other outstanding certifications include Fellow of the African Institute of Public Administration; Doctorate in Business Administration from University of Nicosia, Cyprus; Business Management Consultant from London Graduate School and Aberdeen Institute of Management Specialists, UK. He had earlier bagged Fellow of the Institute of Management Consultants, Nigeria, Fellow Institute of Management Specialists, United Kingdom and in 2021 became Chartered Management Consultant (ChMC) at the Chartered Institute of Management Consultants, Canada.\n\nWhen asked to comment on his graced milestone, Dr. Patrick Omoyeni emphatically returned all glory to God saying,\n\n\u201cI must say the grace of God brought me this far, everything around my life points to God as the one behind them. Imagine someone who was an inch away from the hope of ever becoming anything again after being stagnated for 10 years without a single mark. \u201cI thank God for changing my life to that of impact, purpose, direction and bearing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOne day my brother and Palmadex CEO, Dr Benard Omoyeni, invited me to Winners Chapel, and when I got there I gave my life to God on December 5, 2009. That was how my life got transformed.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the glory of God, I am an example of someone who by the special grace of God and divine intervention came out of obscurity to the limelight. Our God is a God of overnight turnaround.\n\nDr. Patrick \u201cDr. P\u201d Omoyeni is happily married to his beautiful wife, Augustina Omoyeni and they are blessed with 3 beautiful and wonderful children; Mimiola, Kikiola and Bibiola Omoyeni.\n\nHappy birthday Dr. P, and many happy returns!\n\nFrom Godspowerproject/ Fixit/ Palmadex/ Eiawithbenard.",

          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to use his \u201cgood offices to urgently review and withdraw the pardon granted to former governors of Plateau State, Senator Joshua Dariye, and Taraba State, Rev Jolly Nyame who are serving jail terms for corruption.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also urging him to \u201cpropose constitutional amendment to the National Assembly to reform the provisions on the exercise of the prerogative of mercy to make the provisions more transparent, and consistent and compatible with Nigeria\u2019s international anti-corruption obligations.\u201d\n\nMr Dariye and Mr Nyame were jailed for stealing N1.16bn and N1.6bn, respectively. However, the National Council of State last week endorsed the pardon of Mr Dariye, Mr Nyame and 157 others serving jail terms following the recommendations of the Presidential Advisory Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy.\n\nIn the letter dated 16 April, 2022 and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cImpunity for corruption will continue as long as influential politicians escape justice for their crimes. The constitutional power of prerogative of mercy ought not to be an instrument of impunity.\u201d\n\nSERAP said, \u201cThe pardon power ought to be exercised in a manner that is consistent with the Nigerian Constitution 1999 [as amended], particularly the provisions on oath of office by public officers, and section 15[5] which requires your government to abolish all corrupt practices and abuse of power.\u201d\n\nSERAP also said, \u201cIndeed, the presidential pardon power must be exercised in good faith, and in line with the provisions of Chapter 4 of the Nigerian Constitution on fundamental rights.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cWe would like your government to clarify if the pardon granted to Mr Dariye and Mr Nyame would entitle them to the return of the stolen assets already forfeited to the government.\u201d\n\nSERAP said, \u201cThe pardon also constitutes an interference in the exercise of judicial power. Because the pardon appears to be arbitrary, it undermines the authority and independence of the judiciary, and access to justice for victims of corruption.\u201d\n\nThe letter, copied to the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption, read in part: \u201cThe pardon is clearly inconsistent and incompatible with the requirements of the Nigerian Constitution, and the country\u2019s international obligations including under the UN Convention against Corruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresidential pardon for corruption cases is inconsistent with the rule of law, and the public interest, as it undermines the principle of equality before the law. It will undermine public confidence in your government\u2019s fight against corruption, and the justice system.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP is concerned that while the pardon power is routinely exercised to shield influential politicians and politically exposed persons from justice and accountability, ordinary people who have committed petty offences but with no money or influential politicians to speak for them, languish in prisons and are rarely considered for pardon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile there is no doubt that Section 175 of the Constitution vests wide discretionary power in the Nigerian president to grant pardon, it does not stipulate the conditions under which such power should be exercised.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, when section 15(5) of the Constitution is read together with the oath, it would seem to impose some ethical conditions on you to ensure that the exercise of the discretionary power of the prerogative of mercy is not such that it will encourage corruption or impunity of perpetrators.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr Dariye and Mr Nyame should have been allowed to complete their jail terms. The exercise of the presidential pardon in their cases would seem to be unfair and undeserving.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe investigation and prosecution of the corruption cases involving the pardoned former governors Dariye and Nyame reportedly cost over N300 millions of taxpayers\u2019 money. The cases went from the High Court to the Supreme Court of Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 15(5) of the Nigerian Constitution provides that \u2018The State shall abolish all corrupt practices and abuse of power.\u2019 Similarly, article 26 of the UN Convention against Corruption requires your government to ensure \u2018effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions\u2019 in cases of grand corruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cArticle 26 of the convention complements the more general requirement of article 30, paragraph 1, that sanctions must take into account the gravity of the corruption offences.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP notes that in your inaugural speech on May 29, 2015 you stated that, \u2018We are going to tackle pervasive corruption head on. Nigerians will not regret that they have entrusted national responsibility to us.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, the latest Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index shows that Nigeria scored 24 out of 100 points, and ranked 154 out of 180 countries surveyed, falling back five places from the rank of 149 in 2020. This places Nigeria as the second most corrupt country in West Africa.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pardon power, if properly exercised, can help to protect citizens against possible miscarriage of justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP therefore urges you to urgently withdraw the presidential pardon granted to Mr Dariye and Mr Nyame, and to propose amendment to section 175 of the Nigerian Constitution that will make the exercise of the power to pardon more transparent and consistent and compatible with the country\u2019s international obligations.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny proposed amendment should also empower the citizens to challenge the legality of any arbitrary exercise of the power of prerogative of mercy.\u201d",

          "text": "By Dirisu Yakubu\n\nDirector-General, Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Organisation, Hafsat Abiola-Costello, has said Nigerians of all walks of life would play the godfather role to Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi state when he is elected President of Nigeria in the 2023 election.\n\nThis is even as the daughter of Moshood Kolawale Abiola, presumed winner of the June 12 Presidential election, said in a free, fair and credible contest, Yahaya Bello has what it takes to beat other Presidential aspirants on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC, to the sole ticket.\n\nAbiola-Costello stated Sunday while addressing a world press conference in Abuja on the aspiration of Governor Bello and his chances at the delegate election.\n\nShe said: \u201cOne of the major qualities is that this is a person that is willing to be independent, a person that is willing not to have a godfather. The people that will be the godfathers of Governor Yahaya Bello when he becomes President are the people of Nigeria,\u201d she said.\n\nShe, however, said though Bello had resisted the influence of godfathers for long, he would accommodate old when he becomes the President of Nigeria.\n\nShe said this in reaction to a question asked by our correspondent on whether Bello could get the ticket with the likes of Bola Tinubu, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Rotimi Amaechi and other APC stalwarts in the race.\n\n\u201cIt is good that you said heavyweights. But he will win in a free and fair contest. His chances are actually the best of the group because in a competition, it is about the voters and 60 per cent of Nigerians are under 30. I am his Director-General because I believe in him.\n\n\u201cThere have been a ground swell in our country by young people to play a bigger role in our political affairs. You do know about the not-too-young-to-run campaign that has been going on for a long time, which led to the President signing the not-too-young-to-run bill into law.\n\n\u201cYoung Nigerians are ready to take more responsibilities in the governing of our affairs and this is the young people\u2019s candidate.\n\n\u201cBut we really value and appreciate the heavyweights and those you call tested politicians, and they can be sure that if, God\u2019s willing, we have President Yahaya Bello come 2023, he will carry them along, he will be consulting them and seeking their counsel.\n\n\u201cHe will be wanting to build on their networks and resources because the country belongs to all of us. It belongs to the tested politicians and most especially, the young people of Nigeria,\u201d the Campaign DG added.\n\nOn zoning, she said that the APC as at today had thrown open the contest, not restricting it to any zone, noting that everyone was eligible to contest regardless of the zone.\n\n\u201cAt this time, the APC has said that all candidates are free to contest. They have given no restrictions by zone and we are guided by that and our aspirant has the freedom to put his aspiration forward.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that his aspiration that he has put forward was done with a lot of consultations from within the party to the highest level and there have been no reservations to his this. The support across Nigeria is overwhelming,\u201d she added.",

          "title": "Tinubu is God\u2019s choice for 2023 presidency \u2013 Bishop Kayode Williams",
          "text": "The telephone conversation was brief and direct. \u201cMr. Yusuf, you have to help me deliver this message from God to Nigerians: my secret for 2023 presidential election is Bola Ahmed Tinubu sayeth the Lord,\u201d Bishop Kayode Williams said when he called The Nation recently. Williams, who is better known for evangelism in prisons having spent time in prison himself for armed robbery where he met Christ, said thrice did he receive the message from heaven. An appointment for interview was thus agreed. He spoke exclusively to IBRAHIM APEKHADE YUSUF and FUNKE COLE. Excerpts:\n\nCan you shed more light on the message from God about Asiwaju Bola Tinubu winning the 2023 presidential elections?\n\nThis story started in 2014 when God spoke and sincerely directed me to inform all the leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC). That was before the primaries. And I wrote to all of them, starting from the then Chairman of the party, Chief John Odigie Oyegun; and Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the national leader of the party. They were all struggling then. They didn\u2019t know whether they should vote for Muhammadu Buhari or not. God said, no, Buhari was His choice; that I should tell the nation so. So, I wrote a letter to all of them that were in that contest including Alhaji Rabiu Kwankwanso, Owelle Rochas Okorocha. Everything is there: their names, the dates and copies of the letter. I hope they\u2019re not going to deny me. Even God did not ask me to go and deliver the letters myself. He (God) asked me to connect Oba Adedapo Adewale Tejuoso to give out those letters to all of them. Oba Tejuoso now decided to send the letters by DHL. All of them received their copies. Some of them stepped down for Buhari. I think one or two refused. But the result is history now. Later God told me that Buhari would defeat the incumbent president, the person there. It was a bit controversial because so many people who heard about it said the incumbent could not be easily defeated. And for the first time in the history of this country, the incumbent, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan was defeated. Shortly after that phase, there was something that happened in Ondo State; it was during the primaries for who would be the governor of the state; so everywhere was tensed. And God asked me to write Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the traditional rulers in Nigeria, particularly obas in the Southwest specifically for them to intervene and allow Rotimi Akeredolu to contest because that was what God said to me; that he (Akeredolu) would win the election. God specifically instructed the obas and Asiwaju Tinubu to support Akeredolu because God has a bigger assignment in the future for him (Tinubu); that all Yoruba must unite and respect Tinubu. That was what God told me. He (God) said Tinubu should be humble. I specifically took a copy to Akeredolu. God said that Akeredolu should humble himself before Tinubu because He (God) had chosen him (Tinubu) for the upliftment of the Yorubas and the Nigerian nation. When I took the letter to Akeredolu I didn\u2019t see him after enduring some long hours of waiting. So, I said to myself, I have been in prison and since God brought me out I thought to myself that why should I be going to give messages to people. Thankfully, before Akeredolu became governor I had known him, so I called his phone number and delivered the message. Akeredolu was once my lawyer when I was in prison. Mind you, he wasn\u2019t the one that handled my criminal case. No. The case he handled for me was another case entirely. They (authorities) said there was a riot in the prison and that I didn\u2019t support them to silent the inmates because their action was capable of breaching peace in the prison. That was the case. So, Akeredolu heard about the case and came to assist. So, when I came out of prison, we became friends. Akeredolu won the primaries and also won the election and the rest as they say is history. Again, in 2018 and 2019, when the electioneering campaigns began, some group of pastors came together. Let me say this. All pastors in Nigeria are divided into three bodies. We have the bigger body, Christians Association of Nigeria (CAN), which is the umbrella body of all Christians in Nigeria. We have founders of churches; some of them are not against CAN neither are they regular members of CAN, but they are kings in their different cathedrals. We also have independent ministers of God, who have nobody to help them up there or even down below. So, they remain there but they are working according to God\u2019s directives in their small way. They may not have a large congregation, but when aggregated they are more in numbers than the Anglicans, the Catholics, all other big churches put together. These set of churches by independent ministers are in large numbers and these are the people that really vote. Majority of our leaders don\u2019t vote; it is not even convenient for some leaders in the church. Even if they receive messages they want to announce to the church that God Has spoken, you must follow this man or that man, it is not possible because church members don\u2019t belong to only one party. But as for independent pastors, when God speaks to them, they can direct their members on what to do because the message is a mandate from God, which is different because there are pastors called hirelings, who are recruited and paid by some masters. As a hireling, you cannot go beyond what your masters say. I\u2019m not using this to put down anybody. God sees my mind. I\u2019m only trying to analyse things. The majority of people that will vote are within our organisation, the Integrity Ministers International Ministry Incorporated (IMIM). We have members across the different 774 local government areas in the federation. We\u2019re seriously in control of the grassroots. And that is why my message must be general considering the respect that I have for all our leaders in big churches. I\u2019m giving them the message of God. I\u2019m not forcing anybody. I\u2019m only saying the truth that they should look at it and consider whether it is from the Lord or not, because the Bible says they have the right to go into prophetical message and analyse.\n\nThe letters you sent to the APC top shots you mentioned earlier, do you still have copies?\n\nYes, I will let you have them.\n\nMost people know you as a minister of God involved in prison ministry, so at what point in time did you delve into receiving prophetic political messages?\n\nI have been receiving it but I didn\u2019t want to go and be exposing things about governance and people would say someone who just came out of prison. Right from prison, immediately I gave my life to Christ, I have been receiving revelations about Nigeria. I was in prison during the regime of Shehu Sagari and I saw a vision that he was ousted in a coup. When I told my fellow inmates they mocked me. They said, \u201chaha, Joseph alala. (Joseph the dreamer) what are you saying? Take it easy o. You just received Jesus o.\u201d So I had to go back into my shell. What most Nigerians don\u2019t know is that they play politics in the prisons. Serious politics goes on in the prisons. There is APC, PDP, and all kinds of parties in the prison community. During electioneering campaigns, even prisoners mount the rostrum to canvass votes for their favorite candidates and parties. In the prisons, politics there is very serious because they can beat you to a pulp and you can\u2019t escape the wrath if you say something stupid. I also remember I dreamt about Bola Ige\u2019s murder. I shared the vision with a few pastors and they said how do you prove this? They said that\u2019s not just possible. He is the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation with all security apparatus at his beck and call. Coincidentally, the day they killed Bola Ige, I was in Ibadan; my house is not far from Bodija. But now, boldness came particularly when Muhammadu Buhari wanted to contest in 2015. Buhari had been struggling to become president. He never achieved that aim; he had been failing. Most prophets prophesied at that time that Goodluck Jonathan would retain power. I was the only person, the lone ranger who said otherwise. Newspapers refused to publicise it. I don\u2019t want to mention names of the papers. In fact, somebody told me when they were interviewing me that, \u201ca o le ko eleyi jade\u201d (We cannot publish this.) I was able to come out boldly at that time because I felt I was now in the shoes of leaders. So, I prophesied and said, \u201cThus sayeth the Lord. Buhari will win.\u201d The argument then was that how would it be possible. According to what God has been telling me Tinubu will bring back the glory of Nigeria. That was why I sent all those letters. When I prophesied that time nobody believed me. But God that sent me made it a reality. Buhari won the primaries and the general elections in 2014-2015. In 2018, I came out again to say Buhari would retain power. But people were shouting, \u201cebi n pa wa o. Nigeria o da mo.\u201d (People are hungry, things are worsening in Nigeria).You know all the noise. I came out at the time, even went on the radio, Lagos Radio to be precise. I was even interviewed by some newspapers including The Nation. I said Buhari was going to win the election. Even my own people started fighting me. Buhari won in 2019. Now 2023 is right at the corner. God spoke to me not just once but thrice.\n\nYou said earlier that some clergymen congregate on the mountain to receive prophetic messages. Tell us how these things happen. Are they in form of trance or dream or the thought just drops on your mind?\n\nSince the last election, we have been holding our prayers every Friday on a mountain in Osun State. Some people curse the president and the nation, but we pray against such curses that bring condemnation to the nation. God knows what is happening because whosoever that is on the throne as a leader, God wants us to pray for him. So, there is nothing that you want to tell God that He doesn\u2019t know. If you remember the Bible where the Israelites murmumed against Moses in the wilderness. They started cursing him, and God started reacting, fighting and killing the followers. And the Israelites were dying. Moses had to plead on their behalf and God instructed Moses to lift up a serpent because it was the serpent that was biting them, killing them with a poisonous serpent. And God gave Moses instruction that whosoever that had been bitten by the snake should raise his eyes above and watch the serpent He will forgive and heal them and it happened. This dispensation, there is no Moses; Jesus is in total control because as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness. It is not for a pastor to sit down in the corner of his room and say thus sayeth the Lord, God revealed or I saw. But when you hear thus sayeth the Lord, there will be a voice under the inspiration and impartation of God through one of the prophets. After he might have spoken which will be written down by the secretary of the organisation, another person will speak. Because so many people might have been slain in the spirit so we would wait for a second person. Everybody will be quiet. There will be no more praying; prayers will stop either by ringing of the bell. But again, we don\u2019t normally ring the bell otherwise other speakers will not speak again.\n\nThere must be no break in transmission. So the prophetic message will come out. Thus sayeth the Lord. I\u2019m trying to clarify your question. Then the third one will be heard. After the third one, we will stop because the witness must be from two to three then we will establish the truth.\n\nIn 2020, God spoke to me to tell Nigerians to stop cursing but people did not stop. In 2021, God reminded me again. We would not have suffered greatly the way the COVID-19 pandemic devastated Nigeria. Before that time, we were saying we didn\u2019t have money and in fact, were borrowing money to implement all manners of projects but when the pandemic broke out, we were all imprisoned in our houses, everyone was under lockdown. This happened because we had cursed the country with our mouths. God is not a joker. As I told you earlier, God told us in 2016 that He was going to raise Bola Ahmed Tinubu for Nigeria; you will all see. And the message was sent to obas and God mentioned specifically the name of the oba that must be given the letters through Oba Adedapo Adewale Tejuoso. He is my best evangelistic pastor. He is the Chairman and President of the Christians Traditional Rulers of Nigeria. He was the one who gave letters to Buhari. The good thing is that we were able to pass the message across. When this one came out, three times, I called Oba Tejuoso and said, \u201cIt\u2019s Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\u201d\n\nYou said you received the messages thrice on how Tinubu will emerge victorious in the 2023 presidential elections. Can you mention these dates and times the messages came to you?\n\nI will need to check all those dates to be able to give you specific answers. But I remember sometime last year, 2021, I shared the message with Cardinal James Omolaja Odunmbaku, also known as the Baba Etoo. He is the Visioner/President of Christ Ambassador Soul Winners, because I believe he is closer to Tinubu. I went to his house. So when this message came, God told me to take it to Odumbaku. But he was not around. When he came back, he called me and said, \u2018Bishop I saw your message for Tinubu.\u201d I said, \u201ce ma je ko tutu o, ogbonna oo. Tinubu ma wole.\u2019 (It\u2019s hot, let it not get cold. Tinubu will win).That time even the shenanigans we\u2019re all seeing today was happening because nobody was even thinking about elections. Then, at another programme, I asked him last year, \u2018have you given this message to Tinubu?\u2019 And when I went back to Baba Tejuoso and said God Has spoken, he agreed with me, but said that we should go back and listen to God again. I\u2019m quoting him verbally. He told me that last year. He said you have only confirmed it once, I want God to confirm it again. Then I went back and he (Oba Tejuoso) asked, \u201cki lOluwa tunso?\u201d Se Tinubu yi naa si ni? (What has God said this time? Is it Tinubu still?).Then I said, \u201cKabiyesi oun ni, Tinubu ni Oluwa tun so oo.\u201d (Yes kabiyesi, he\u2019s the one God confirmed).The third time was last month or two months ago. Elder Fajemisin was with me. We were writing and updating the notes and preparing the letters together. Because we could not just bring out a piece of paper and pass to Tinubu and say this is the message. We had to sit down. Fajemisin is a journalist of high repute. He retired as a Director of Programmes in NTA, Abuja. He knows my integrity and hence decided to join this ministry. He knows what I\u2019m saying. He was the one writing. So, the third message now came. That was the last one and we were preparing how to take the message to Baba Akande because God mandated us to go and give Baba Akande. But they said Baba Akande was in Abuja. I don\u2019t want to go to the gate of Tinubu and be lurking around like a nuisance. Even some pastors have been troubling me to lead people to Bourdillion Road saying that way I can gain access to Tinubu but I told them to wait for God\u2019s direction. When Tinubu returned from London after his medical trip, they forced me and I had to dance to their tune, so we took my car and some others. Justice Shogbola, the president of this organisation; mama doesn\u2019t believe in \u201cnigbati ngbati woli kan so pe\u201d (when a prophet said). But because of the integrity and trust she has found in me, she decided to accept the leadership because she has been seeing the consistency and the follow-up of all my prophetic messages. And I said Mama because you know all these things you\u2019re a judge of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, you retired from the National Industrial Court, you are part of us. This is just to confirm to the whole world that it is not an imagination because if a judge is part of this set up, any reasonable person will know we\u2019re not joking here. This is a woman, not a frivolous person. You can go and check her antecedents. So, she accepted. So when I now informed Oba Tejuoso that Kabiyesi, this letter must be submitted, he said glory be to God. That is what is gearing us up to speak out now. The copies for Tinubu, we wanted to go through his daughter, Sade, because the Iyaloja lives in the same place with my wife. But my fear is that if I go anyhow, people will say it is manipulation. But I know Sade as my daughter but this is God\u2019s message. But I told myself I cannot use that familiarity to say, Sade go and give your father because God said.\n\nPolitics is big business which requires funding. You have mentioned that your group hopes to mobilise support for him. Who is going to be bankrolling this project?\n\nIn the 774 local governments in Nigeria, we have members. God has decided in His infinite mercy to grant us the opportunity of the mandate in the six geo-political zones in Nigeria that we must mobilise people to be praying for the success of the election and success particularly of Tinubu in every area. Our mandate also is that because we are sure of what God hath said that it will come to pass, that immediately he starts his campaign, all our members in the city, we must mobilise to go and be praying and make sure that there\u2019s no calamity. K\u00ed \u1e63e w\u00edp\u00e9 Ol\u00fawa j\u1eb9 \u00f3 w\u1ecd l\u00e9, \u00f3 ti w\u1ecdle. (The prayer point is not that he should win; he has won already). This is not a prediction neither is it a forecast, permutation or guesswork. God said Bola Ahmed Tinubu is His choice for Nigeria come 2023. In fact, our members are no longer praying for Tinubu to win the elections because we know his victory has already been sealed in heaven above. We\u2019re only praying that God protects him from all forms of evil machinations ahead of his inauguration in 2023. Note this down.\n\nYou are a leader in the Christendom. Interestingly Asiwaju Tinubu is a Muslim. How do you marry this? Couldn\u2019t the Lord have shown you a Christian, as against a Muslim?\n\nGod does not see things the way we do. If God wants to send rain, He sends rain for both Christians and Muslims. God does not see anybody as a Christian or Muslim, He sees us as the work of His Hands. We have made a choice in the world to follow. That\u2019s the way God is seeing us. It was when I came out of the prison that I went to the university to do diploma in Human Resource Management to increase my knowledge. God does not look at the people He created as Chinese or Russians. God sees them as human beings and that\u2019s what the Bible says that in the beginning God created them male and female. Did He mention Muslim? When God speaks, I cannot go and query the integrity of God. Galatians 3:28 says that \u2018there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female, for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\u2019",

          "text": "Tinubu to youths: With you on my side, we\u2019ll make Nigeria excel\n\nAll Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, yesterday sought the support of Nigerian youths in his bid for the presidency, saying together, they could change the story of the country for the better.\n\n\u201cIf YouTube alone has 2.9 billion people following it, including you all standing here, then Nigeria can excel.\n\n\u201cWe can do it. You must develop the \u2018can do\u2019 attitude. You must believe that this country is yours and you want to change the story,\u201d Tinubu told thousands of youths from the six Southwest states who stormed the Mobolaji Johnson Stadium, Onikan, Lagos for a rally endorsing his aspiration.\n\n\u201cYou must change the story of potential, the story of banditry, you must change the story of tribalism,\u201d he added.\n\nNigeria, Tinubu said, has all it requires to conveniently feed its citizens \u201cby being creative, visionary and committed.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cAnybody who says we cannot, they can get out, because it is voluntary. We cannot continue the lamentation of the past.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue with excuses of power failure. No nation can make rapid development without electricity.\n\n\u2018Nigeria, it is about time. We have enough gas to fire up electricity and supply the rest of Europe and make money.\n\n\u201cYou know it. We don\u2019t want to bore you with it.\n\n\u201cWhen I started, we used to pick dead bodies on the streets. But today, Lagos is one of the cleanest, most progressive states in the country.\u201d\n\nHe said that with him at the helm of Nigeria\u2019s affairs, challenges such as unstable power supply, banditry, ethnic bigotry would be eliminated.\n\nHe told them to revalidate their permanent voter cards to enable them to vote in the 2023 elections.\n\nThe former Lagos State governor spoke at a grand rally by youths under the aegis of Progressive Youth of South-West to declare their support for his presidential aspiration at the Mobolaji Johnson Arena in Onikan area of the state.\n\nThe youths from different states in the region, like Lagos, Ogun, Osun, Ekiti, Ondo and Oyo states, had converged on Lagos in their large numbers to drum up support for the aspiration of the national leader of the party.\n\nTinubu, addressing the crowd of youths he described as the brightest, urged them to team up with him in his bid to change the story of Nigeria for the youths and tomorrow which they represent.\n\n\u201cWe as a nation can conveniently feed ourselves by being creative, visionary and committed,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged the youths to revalidate their permanent voter cards and get ready to vote in the forthcoming 2023 general elections.\n\nAlso addressing the rally organised by the Progressive Youth of South-West, Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said the youth would continue to be critical stakeholders in Nigeria\u2019s socio-political development.\n\nHe hailed the rally organisers and the attendees for the event, which he hoped would herald a new dawn in the 2023 polls.\n\nOne of the speakers, Dr. Muritala Seriki, said Tinubu\u2019s achievements in Lagos State during his tenure as governor bore eloquence to his ingenuity, hard work and commitment.\n\nI fully support Tinubu\u2019s presidential ambition \u2013 ex-NAN MD Onanuga\n\nA former Managing Director of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), Bayo Onanuga, yesterday pledged his support for the presidential ambition of the APC national leader.\n\nOnanuga reaffirmed his support while responding to claims that he had switched camps ahead of the 2023 election.\n\nHe said he had known Tinubu for a long time and was part of his governorship campaign in 1998.\n\nOnanuga wrote: \u201cMy attention has been drawn to some lies being circulated about me as having jumped the Bola Ahmed Tinubu train and being against his presidential ambition.\n\n\u201cThe faceless writer, I guess a hatchet hand, wrote: \u2018Almost all members of the Tinubu original power/intellectual base and allies when he was governor are not in support of his presidential ambition. Aregbesola, Afikuyomi, Ojudu, Onanuga, Alake, Fasola, etc. Most of them may work for PYO.\u2019\n\n\u201cLet me correct this misrepresentation straightforwardly: the statement is far from the truth as far as I am concerned.\n\n\u201cI am fully in support of Bola Tinubu. I am not in PYO\u2019s camp and will not be in his camp if Tinubu is running.\n\n\u201cPeople who know me will attest to the fact that I am ever loyal to my friends, loyal to a political cause. I have been on the political left since 1978 when I joined Awolowo\u2019s UPN as a UNILAG student.\n\n\u201cI am not a renegade. And I can vouch for Senator Tokunbo Afikuyomi and Dele Alake as well.\n\n\u201cThe author of the rumour was merely writing conjectures on an issue that is unpredictable, a party\u2019s primary election, where an outsider will only labour in vain in making permutations.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, and let me say it loud and clear, I am in support of Bola Tinubu\u2019s ambition. I am not against him. He is my first choice, the second choice and the third choice for the exalted seat.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in need of a visionary, a deep thinker, a man with the Midas touch, who can take our country on a journey of prosperity. This country has suffered enough and really needs a new leader who can breathe fresh air in it and change the way things are done.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs a man of ideas, who will not just talk his way, but really get things done.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that Bola Tinubu is capable of this, which is why I support his campaign to lead Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI have known him since 1992. I was part of his governorship campaign in 1998 before others were invited to his government after we won the election in January 1999.\n\n\u201cI was close to his government for eight years and I bore witness to the innovations he brought into governance, the overhauling of the system that he carried out, some of which other states and the Federal Government had copied.\n\n\u201cI have no iota of doubt that he will replicate the same at the centre, and even do more, if given the opportunity. These are the reasons I support his campaign. And Nigerians will hear more about my involvement in the next few days.\u201d",

          "text": "The Bring Back Our Girls Movement, Lagos, Saturday, held its weekly sit-out at Falomo, Lagos, to commemorate the eight anniversary of the abduction of over 200 students of the Government College, Chibok, Borno State by the dreaded Boko Haram sect.\n\nOne of the liberated girls, Grace Dauda, was there to share her experience.\n\nLooking pretty and well-kept, Dauda recalled her experience in the three years she spent in captivity saying: \u201cImagine yourself living in the forest, no freedom and fighter jets hovering around. No one would want that. Please we need these young women back. We can\u2019t fold our hands and do nothing, thereby losing them forever.\n\n\u201cI want to tell the Nigerian government to help us out. I no longer hear anything about my sisters in captivity. Please don\u2019t forget about these young women. They are suffering because I know what I went through when I was there. They deserve better.\u201d\n\nTracing the history of the Chibok abduction, which has since gained global acclaim, with even the Bring Back Our Girls (BBOG) movement having branches across continents, Coordinator of Bring Back Our Girls (Lagos), Habiba Balogun, said \u201c276 girls were abducted, 57 jumped out of the bus as they were being taken away; government negotiated the release of 82 and later another 21 girls. A few others also escaped or were liberated by the army, but there are still 109 Chibok girls in captivity, whose families are still crying, still begging God for them to be released.\u201d\n\nShe however said that the movement and indeed Nigerians are tired of begging and we are now demanding that the government should bring back the girls now and alive.\n\nShe said all Nigerians are now a metaphor for Chibok girls, stressing that the series of abductions and attacks, including the recent Kaduna-Abuja train bombing and abduction more than underline this.\n\nBalogun revealed what could be termed a piece of good news, when she said two more girls were recently liberated, culminating in celebrations in their families. She, however, that they are still being processed, which is why they have not released their names.\n\nIn an attempt to capture the trauma parents of the yet to be released girls are going through, Balogun said, \u201cIf your child is dead, she is dead, but for her to be missing, that is a nightmare. And to even know that your child is in the hands of people who are not kind, to know that your child is in a condition that nobody would pray to be in; in a forest, with no shelter, no clean water, no regular food, and subject to God knows what, is something you don\u2019t want to imagine.\u201d\n\nDelivering a message titled, \u201cLet everyone be restless until they are free,\u201d Very Reverend Allotey Pappoe, urged united and concerted effort until the girls are back.\n\nReading from the book of Luke 22: 35-38, Rev Pappoe said \u201cthe people will remain restless until they are sure that everyone in captivity is back and there is no more of this criminality in our land.\u201d\n\nMember BBOG Ikoyi and renowned Human rights activist, Ayo Obe, said, \u201cWe have entered into the 9th year, having celebrated 8th years two days ago. The government did not have anything to say or deemed it fit to say anything on the 8th anniversary of the abduction, apparently because they had nothing to tell us. But government should say something even if they are embarrassed. They should face the embarrassment and tell the people what they are doing. The father of Leah Sharibu said he no longer hears anything from the government. Rather than keep quiet, they should speak up.\u201d\n\nConfirming Balogun\u2019s claim that the group has been sitting out for the past eight years, Mrs Obe said she is disappointed that the government has not been able to bring back all the girls.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed, not only because we don\u2019t have our children back but at the number of kidnap victims, particularly because those kidnapped from educational establishments have been on the increase. The impact on education has been devastating. I praise parents who still send their children to school in those areas. If government does not find a solution, the seed of assault that is being sewn on our educational establishment, we will reap the harvest and we will not find it funny.\u201d\n\nAsked if she is not tired sitting out for the same purpose all of eight years and still counting, Obe said, \u00cf am tired. But we are not giving up.\u201d",

          "title": "FULL TEXT: Kukah\u2019s Easter message to Buhari",
          "text": "TO MEND A BROKEN NATION: THE EASTER METAPHOR (ON NIGERIA):\n\n(Easter Message by Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, Diocese of Sokoto, April 17th, 2022)\n\n1: Hello brothers and sisters in Christ, men and women of goodwill everywhere, I send you hearty greetings and felicitations as we celebrate the risen Christ. Easter is here again. For all Christians, Easter is a metaphor for our lives as individuals, families, communities or nations. Easter is a metaphor for how shame, scandal, powerlessness, weakness, and opprobrium suddenly transform into glory, honour, pre-eminence, laudation and applause. It is a fulfilment of what the Master himself had foretold when He said, \u2018Unless a grain of wheat falls on the ground and dies, it remains only a single grain, but if it dies, it bears much fruit\u2019 (Jn. 12: 24). And the Psalmist had said, \u2018Those who sow in tears will sing when they reap.\u2019 (Ps. 126:5).\n\n2: The crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus are central to the Christian faith and yet, as St Paul said, \u2018We preach Christ crucified, a scandal to the Jews and nonsense to the Gentiles\u2019 (1 Cor. 1: 23). St Paul continues: \u2018What seems to be God\u2019s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom and God\u2019s weakness is stronger than human strength\u2019 (1 Cor. 1:25). Without the claims of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, millions of people would be Christian today. As with the times of Jesus, the very idea is preposterous and incomprehensible yet St. Paul still insists that \u2018If Christ has not been raised, then our faith is a delusion and we are still in our sins\u2019 (1 Cor. 15:17). It is faith in the resurrection of Christ that inspires us Christians to hold firmly to the fact that, like the people of Israel, our dry bones shall rise again (Ez. 37: 11).\n\n3: Our dear country, Nigeria, still totters and wobbles as we screech towards a dangerous and avoidable canyon of dry bones. Nonetheless, we still cling to hope, a hope in the resurrected Christ, knowing as St. Paul; said, \u2018this hope does not disappoint us\u2019 (Rm.5:5). Nigerians can no longer recognise their country which has been battered and buffeted by men and women from the dark womb of time. It is no longer necessary to ask how we got here. The real challenge is how to find the slippery rungs on the ladder of ascent so we can climb out. Yet, we ask, ascend to where? For us as Christians, ascent is to the loving embrace of the resurrected Christ who is Lord of history.\n\n4: One would be tempted to ask, what is there to say about our tragic situation today that has not been said? Who is there to speak that has not spoken? Like the friends of Job, we stare at an imponderable tragedy as the nation unravels from all sides. The government has slid into hibernation mode. It is hard to know whether the problem is that those in power do not hear, see, feel, know, or just don\u2019t care. Either way, from this crossroad, we must make a choice, to go forward, turn left or right or return home. None of these choices are easy, yet, guided by the light of the risen Christ, we can reclaim our country from its impending slide to anarchy.\n\n5: The greatest challenge now is how to begin a process of reconstructing our nation hoping that we can hang on and survive the 2023 elections. The real challenge before us now is to look beyond politics and face the challenge of forming character and faith in our country. Here, leaders of religion, Christianity and Islam, need to truthfully face the role of religion in the survival of our country. The Nigerian Constitution has very clearly delineated the fine boundaries between religion and politics. Yet many politicians continue to behave as if they are presiding over both the political and the spiritual realms in their states rather than governing in a Democracy.\n\n6: This conflict between Caesar and God is inbuilt in faith and is part of world history. Many religious leaders often measure their power by how close they are to Caesar, yet Caesar\u2019s embrace is often full of thorns. The challenge is for the religious leader to know that both Caesar and those he represents are answerable to God who created them. The welfare of citizens constitutes the cornerstone for measuring the legitimacy of any political leader. As such, religious leaders must focus more on the issues of welfare, safety and security of ordinary citizens. They must raise their voice when these rights are being trampled upon. A leader must know when to call Caesar a fox and not a horse (Lk. 13:32).\n\n7: The greatest challenge for Nigeria is not even the 2023 elections. It is the prospects for the reconciliation of our people. Here, the Buhari administration sadly has divided our people on the basis of ethnicity, religion, and region, in a way that we have never witnessed in our history. This carefully choreographed agenda has made Nigerians vulnerable and ignited the most divisive form of identity consciousness among our people. Years of friendships, cultural exchange, and collaboration built over time have now come under serious pressure from stereotyping. Notwithstanding these challenges, religious leaders must recover and deploy their moral authority and avoid falling victim to the schemes of politicians and their material enticements.\n\n8: Today, the values of Interfaith dialogue have come under severe strain and pressure with extremists from both sides of our faiths denigrating the idea of dialogue with their counterparts of other faiths. Ignorance and miseducation have combined with prejudice to create the falsehood that somehow, one religion is superior to the others. With so many ill equipped fraudsters posing as religious leaders, there is an obsession with defaming the others and widening our differences.\n\n9: Religious leaders must face the reality that here in Nigeria and elsewhere around the world, millions of people are leaving Christianity and Islam. While we are busy building walls of division with the blocks of prejudice, our members are becoming atheists but we prefer to pretend that we do not see this. We cannot pretend not to hear the footsteps of our faithful who are marching away into atheism and secularism. No threats can stop this, but dialogue can open our hearts.\n\n10: Thank God, in the last few years, we have had some good news from outside the shores of Nigeria. The most noteworthy is the initiative undertaken by both Pope Francis and the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Mosque, Egypt, Shaikh Mohammed Al-Tayeb in 2019, when both of them met and signed the Document on Human Fraternity. Pope Francis followed up with the publication of an Encyclical titled, Fratelli Tutti, We are all Brothers, in 2020. The following year, the United Nation\u2019s General Assembly declared February 4, World Day of Fraternity. Both leaders agreed that: \u2018We need to develop the awareness that nowadays, we are either all saved together or no one is saved. Poverty, decadence, and suffering in one part of the earth are a silent breeding ground for problems that will end up affecting our entire planet.\u2019\n\n11: We need to start thinking of a Nigeria beyond banditry and kidnapping and the endless circles of violence that have engulfed our communities and nation. We cannot continue to pretend that there are no religious undertones to the violence in the name of God that has given our religions a bad name. The way out is for the state to enforce the secular status of the Nigerian state so as to give citizens the necessary freedoms from the shackles of semi-feudal confusion over the status of religion and the state in a plural Democracy. We must be ready to embrace modernity and work out how to preserve our religions and cultures without turning religion into a tool for tyranny, exclusion, and oppression.\n\n12: In finding our way forward, the President must concede that it is within his powers to decide how we are going to end the war that has engulfed and is tearing down our nation. It seems that the federal government has shown far greater commitment to integrating so called repentant terrorists than getting our children back from kidnappers or keeping our universities open. Earlier last month, Operation Safe Corridor announced that it had graduated 599 members of various terrorist groups who have acquired new skills and are now ready to be integrated into society. The total comes to over a thousand now. It is plausible to note that the programme involves pyscho-social support, rehabilitation, vocational training, skill acquisition and start-ups. Despite all this, the larger issue is that their various communities have expressed their reluctance to receive their erring sons back. Nigerians have no access to the transcripts of the texts of the confessions of these terrorists not to talk of evidence of their commitment to not sin again. We have only the words of the terrorists and the same military that they have been fighting a war with. It speaks volumes when the President and his military hierarchy choose to believe these young men who took up arms and for years waged war against their country, killed, maimed and wasted thousands of lives, destroyed entire communities and now, they are being housed, fed, clothed with public funds. All this while their victims have been forced to make the various IDP camps their new homes! Where is the justice for the victims and the rest of the country they have destroyed?\n\n13: As a priest, I cannot be against a repentant sinner or criminals changing their ways. After all, the doors of forgiveness must always remain open. However, in this case, Nigerians have very little information as to the entire rehabilitation processes. Have these terrorists felt the heat or have they seen the light or, is their repentance a mere strategic and tactical repositioning? So far, we have no evidence that these terrorists have been able to confront their victims not to talk of seeking forgiveness from them. Something is wrong. We see these terrorists adorned in our national colours in their green and white kaftans, trousers, and looking like heroes of the state! Are we to assume that they have become acknowledged models for Nigerian youth? Perhaps the next graduating set might be treated to Presidential handshakes, receptions at the villa with full national colours!\n\n14: Only last week, as if in delayed solidarity, the Jama\u2019atu Nasril Islam, JNI, in a Statement stated that: \u2018It appears that the continuous callous acts of mayhem, killings and arson happening almost on daily or weekly bases around us; either within communities or on the roads we ply, has automatically reset our human psyche that we now have accepted such dastardly acts as part of our lives, to the extent that we no longer feel it\u2026.Any government that is incapable of protecting the lives of its citizens has lost the moral justification of being there in the first place\u2026.our humanity is being eroded and that erosion is become a new normal.\u2019 Similarly, the Northern Elders Forum, NEF, and the House of Representatives have finally called on the President to resign since, in their view it is now clear that he cannot protect his citizens. This has come three years after the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Statement issued on April 26th, 2018 made the same call that was greeted with cynicism.\n\n15: The challenge of fixing this broken nation is enormous and, as I have said, requires joint efforts. With everything literally broken down, our country has become one big emergency national hospital with full occupancy. Our individual hearts are broken. Our family dreams are broken. Homes are broken. Churches, Mosques, infrastructure are broken. Our educational system is broken. Our children\u2019s lives and future are broken. Our politics is broken. Our economy is broken. Our energy system is broken. Our security system is broken. Our Roads and Rails are broken. Only corruption is alive and well. So, we ask with the Psalmist, We look up to the hills, from where shall come our help? Our help shall come from the name of the Lord (Ps. 121:2).\n\n16: 2023 beckons and the stage is set. The challenge is whether we have learnt any lessons from the tragedy that has afflicted us in the last few years. The Presidency of Nigeria is not a human right based on ethnic, religious or regional sentiments. The next President of Nigeria must be a man or woman with a heart, a sense of empathy and a soul on fire that can set limits to what human indignities visited on citizens that he or she can tolerate. We have no need for any further empty messianic rhetoric laced with deceitful and grandiose religiosity. We need someone who can fix our broken nation, rid our people of the looming dangers of hunger and destitution. Our Presidential aspirants must show evidence from their legacies and antecedents that they know the country well enough and its severe wounds. Whoever wants to govern us must illustrate that he or she understands what has turned our nation into a national hospital and show us plans for our discharge from this horror. Support for INEC and its infrastructure is fundamental to a free and fair election and we condemn in very strong terms all those criminals who continue to threaten the society with violence. They should meet the full force of the law.\n\n17: I thank the President for accepting the report of the Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy and granting pardon to over 150 Nigerians serving various terms of imprisonment. The more serious challenge is to immediately free all innocent Nigerians who are held captive and whose only crime is that they are living in Nigerians. With the news of the purchase of new sophisticated weapons, we hope that the President and the military will quickly roll out a strategy for routing this cancer that has afflicted our country. The general feeling is that the military has the capacity to end this tragedy. In reality, the military cannot fire beyond the radar set by their commander-in-chief. If the President can end this tragedy, he will immediately get the support of all citizens and hopefully leave office witih his head held high.\n\n18: We cannot end this Message without sparing a thought for the untold sufferings being experienced by the people of Ukraine as a result of the invasion of their country by Russia. We turn in prayer to the Lord to touch the hearts and minds of those in power and in position to reverse this avoidable loss of human lives. May the spirit of the resurrected Christ and the appeals of all men and women of good will help to bring an end to this human tragedy.\n\n19: Finally, in the last few years, my Messages have been borne out of a sense of moral revulsion over how life has been destroyed in my country. No country anywhere in the world is undergoing these self-inflicted wounds, citizens randomly murdering innocent citizens and getting away with it. For me as a Christian, there is a minimum threshold of human indignity that I can live with because the reason why Jesus came is so that all of us will have life and have it to the full (Jn. 10:10). We must shout at what diminishes any and every life in our society. Once human dignity is respected and restored, we will change our tone, but for now, our voice must have a sense of urgency. We Christians believe that to redeem the world, Christ allowed His body to be broken. We know He can heal out broken nation. May the light of His resurrection scatter the clouds and rout the men of evil, inspire a new birth in our dear nation and restore us to wholeness. A happy Easter to you all.",

          "text": "\n\n* Says Nigerians tired of excuses, lamentations\n\n*We\u2019re not overwhelmed by Plateau killings, Lalong reassures\n\n*Blames crises on porous interstate borders\n\n*Terrorists have formed parallel govt, MBF laments\n\nSegun James in Lagos and Seriki Adinoyi in Jos\n\nAs the country battles multiple security challenges, a frontline presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and National Leader of the party, Senator Bola Tinubu, has promised that he will deliver a united and banditry-free Nigeria if elected president.\n\n\n\nThis is as the Plateau State Governor, Hon. Simon Lalong has stated that his government was not overwhelmed by the recent mass killings in Kanam Local Government Area of the state in which over 100 lives were lost to attacks by the terrorists.\n\nBut the President of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr Bitrus Pogu, has stated that terrorists have formed a parallel government in Nigeria, describing the country\u2019s security situation as that of a failed state.\n\n\n\nSpeaking yesterday at a grand rally by the youths under the aegis of Progressive Youth of South-West who declared their support for his presidential aspiration at the Mobolaji Johnson Arena, Onikan in Lagos, the former Lagos State governor stated that Nigerians are tired of excuses and lamentations of the past.\n\n\n\nThe youths from different states in the South-west, converged on Lagos in large numbers to drum up support for the aspiration of the national leader of the party.\n\nTinubu urged them to team up with him in his bid to change the story of Nigeria for the youths of today and tomorrow, which they represent.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cAll you need is courage, determination and perseverance, if the YouTube alone has 2.9 billion people following it, including you all standing here, then Nigeria can excel, we can do it, you must develop the can-do-attitude, you must believe that this country is yours and you want to change the story. You must change the story of potential, the story of banditry, you must change the story of tribalism.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe as a nation can conveniently feed ourselves by being creative, visionary and committed, anybody who says we cannot, they can get out because it is voluntary. We cannot continue the lamentation of the past. We cannot continue with excuses of power failure, no nation made rapid development without electricity. Give us light and if we cannot be successful then you can abuse us, you cannot give us erratic light that is undependable and then blame us again that we are lazy.\n\n\n\n\u201cNigeria, it is about time we have enough gas to fire up electricity and supply the rest of Europe and make money, long term from it. You know it. We don\u2019t want to bore you with it, when I started we used to pick dead bodies on the streets, but today Lagos is one of the cleanest, most progressive states in the country.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe urged the youths to revalidate their Permanent Voter\u2019s Cards and be ready to vote in the forthcoming 2023 general election.\n\n\n\nIn his keynote address, Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who appreciated the grand support for Tinubu, noted that youths would continue to be identified as critical stakeholders, just as he enjoined all delegates to the APC primary to exercise their franchise wisely.\n\nThe South-west youth leaders at the event took their turns to speak on why they are promoting Tinubu to become the next president of Nigeria, come 2023.\n\n\n\nSpeaking, Dr Muritala Seriki, Dayo Israel, Muhammed Sulaiman, among others applauded the achievements of Tinubu in infrastructure, education, and raising the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of Lagos, while he was governor of the state, saying some of them were his products having brought them to the level they had attained presently.\n\nThis was just as they described the APC national leader as a detribalised Nigeria.\n\nWe are Not Overwhelmed by Plateau Killings, Lalong Reassures\n\nMeanwhile, Plateau State Governor, Lalong has stated that his government was not overwhelmed by the recent mass killings in the Kanam Local Government Area of the state in which over 100 lives were lost to attacks by the terrorists.\n\n\n\nLalong lamented that a planned military raid of the locations of the terrorists at the state borders may have been leaked to the terrorists who attacked the state a day earlier than the planned military operations.\n\nThe Plateau State governor, who was featured on ARISE NEWS Channel on Friday night, blamed the persistent attacks in the state on porous interstate borders, pointing out that the state government was not overwhelmed by the state of insecurity in the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cI will not say I am overwhelmed because I have been working with the security agents. But for this reason (Kanam attacks), we may say we are overwhelmed, but not overwhelmed.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said one of the challenges facing the state was the long stretch of borders it has with Kaduna, Taraba, and Bauchi, saying \u201cyou may work out measures to protect your border, but some people will enter from other states, especially if the states are not doing same.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said that was the reason the Northern Governors Forum (NGF) was working out a synergy \u201cso that as one state protects its borders, others do same, if not, just when you think you have done well, you will see an influx of bandits from other states.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added that with the heavy military bombardments in the North-west, the terrorists are now looking for hideouts, and migrating towards states in the North-central, and vowed that Plateau will not harbour them.\n\nHe said he was not only worried about Plateau State, adding that as Chairman of NGF, but he was also worried about a region devastated by the terrorists.\n\n\n\nHe added that there must be some informants that leaked the planned military operations to terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe had started having meetings on synergy to prepare to secure our borders against the terrorists, but it was like someone leaked the information. This is because the military was planning a raid on the border areas, but before we carried out the raid, they were very fast and had attacked a day earlier.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut some of these terrorists move like thieves \u2013 thieves won\u2019t inform you before they come. They come when they know you\u2019re not awake,\u201d Lalong lamented, adding that \u201cwhen our attention was on other places, they sneaked into where we had relative peace, caused havoc and ran away.\u201d\n\nThe governor also insinuated that the terrorists may have used mining activities in the area as a cover for their sinister motives.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are massive mineral deposits in the area; they may have pretended that they are there for mining activities and wreak havoc on the people. \u201cIncidentally, that\u2019s where we also planned our pilot scheme on ranching; all these may have been the attraction.\u201d\n\nHe said that at a recent meeting, he reminded the Council of State that the governors had enumerated certain challenges in addressing some of the security issues in some states that were identified as frontline states in the North.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr President had directed sometimes ago that we have a meeting with the security chiefs, which we did. But shortly after that, the then Chief of Army Staff died in an accident. After his death, it took a while to come back to the issues. So, at the Council of State, I had to ask what had happened to the measures that were being put in place,\u201d Lalong explained.\n\n\n\nHe said that as a followed-up to the issues he raised at the Council of State, President Muhammadu Buhari had called for a Security Council meeting. \u201cThis is particularly because it\u2019s now farming season, and farmers need to feel secure to go back to their farms,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nThe governor who was in Kanam five days after the attacks, said: \u201cI drove there immediately\u201d to commiserate with the people, and to show them that the state cared much for them.\n\n\n\nPriding himself as one that has brought a measure of peace to the state in the last two decades, Lalong said he has done much in this regard. He said that on the assumption of office, he had set up an inter-religion council, established Plateau Peace Agency, mediated between Fulani and Berom, and now mediating between the Fulani and Irigwe, all of which he said had paid off by the measure of peace that was witnessed in the state before the recent attacks. He added that it\u2019s no longer the issue of farmers and herders crisis, but terrorist attacks.\n\n\n\nHe said that the white papers from the various commissions set up to address crises in the state revealed that injustice and unfairness were a major cause of the crisis, which he said has largely been addressed, and has nothing to do with the current attacks by terrorists.\n\n\n\nIn another development, the President of MBF, Dr Bitrus Pogu stated that terrorists have formed parallel government in the country and described Nigeria\u2019s security situation as that of a failed state.\n\n\u201cWe have a parallel government out there that seems to do what it feels like, while the constituted government seems to be incapacitated. So terrorists continue to do what they want to do and get away with it.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY yesterday, Pogu said: \u201cConfidently I can tell you that these people are not more powerful than our military, but political forces are stopping our military from doing what are supposed to do.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis has gone beyond the acceptable level. The unfortunate thing is that this government, because of its attitude, has pushed people into hating Fulani, because everybody now thinks Fulani are a nuisance; a people that will come and kill others in their sleep for whatever reason. But we can say that it is for displacement and taking over of ancestral lands and to change democracy.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, this thing has to stop, because if, and when it gets to a level, the innocent Fulani who may not be part of these whole attacks will pay for it. How many Fulani are there across this country; if their attack is triggered from somewhere, it will spread like wildfire and they will be wiped out. So, this government has to change its attitude and deal with these criminals, otherwise, we are heading in that direction.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The aspiration is to build a Trust of at least $45 billion in resources.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe RST will serve as a third pillar of the IMF\u2019s lending toolkit, in addition to the General Resources Account and the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust. The RST will provide policy support and affordable longer maturity financing \u2013 with a 20-year maturity and a 10\u00bd -year grace period \u2013 to help build resilience against long-term risks to balance of payments stability.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe added that about three-quarters of IMF\u2019s country members will be eligible for RST financing.\n\n\u201cAbout three-quarters of the IMF\u2019s country members will be eligible for RST financing, including low-income members as well as most middle-income countries and all small developing states. We have worked extensively with our members and other stakeholders to design the RST, to balance the needs of potential contributors and borrowers,\u201d the statement added.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have worked extensively with our members and other stakeholders to design the RST, to balance the needs of potential contributors and borrowers.

          "text": "Our reporters\n\nAs Christians in Nigeria join their counterparts all over the world to celebrate Easter, governors across the country and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday have urged them to pray against insecurity in the country.\n\n\n\nIn his Easter message, the Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi called on Nigerians to always embrace unity and love as well as be hopeful for a better Nigeria after the current parlous state.\n\n\n\nFayemi, in the message signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Yinka Oyebode, urged Christians to emulate the sacrificial lifestyle of Jesus Christ who gave His life to save mankind.\n\n\n\nOn his part, Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, charged Christians to use the occasion of the celebration of Easter to pray for an end to insurgency in the state.\n\nBello said fervent prayers, coupled with the efforts being made by the government would lead to the restoration of peace in areas bedevilled by insurgency.\n\n\n\nIn the message signed on his behalf by the Chief Press Secretary, Mrs Mary Noel Berje, Governor Bello said the state was witnessing trying moments, adding that \u201cwe need to strengthen our resolve to collectively confront the challenges.\u201d\n\n\n\nEdo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has also urged the Christian faithful to emulate Jesus Christ by making sacrifices that would engender development and ensure lasting peace and unity in the country.\n\n\n\nObaseki, in his Easter message, urged Christians to reflect on the purpose of the Easter celebration with a renewed hope for a better Nigeria, and be a part of the process of rebuilding the country.\n\n\n\nOyo State Governor, Mr Seyi Makinde, urged Christians to imbibe the lessons of love, sacrificial living and peaceful co-existence.\n\n\n\nThe governor, in an Easter message signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Taiwo Adisa, stated that prayers of God\u2019s people remained an important ingredient to sustaining the peace and prosperity being witnessed in the state.\n\n\n\nKwara State Governor, Alhaji Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq also urged the Christian community in the state to use the Easter festivities as a period of reunion, self-discipline, sacrifice, forgiveness, and commitment to God.\n\n\n\nIn a statement issued in Ilorin by the governor\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Mr Rafiu Ajakaye, the governor also called on Nigerians to take advantage of the period to seek God\u2019s favour for the country and to reunite against all forces of evil who seek to tear the country apart and terrorise its people with violence and economic sabotage.\n\n\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta has also called on Christians to pray for socio-economic and political rejuvenation of Nigeria to stem insecurity, and political and economic challenges plaguing the country.\n\n\n\nOkowa made the call in his Easter message contained in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Olisa Ifeajika.\n\nHe asserted that the turbulence in the polity could only be surmounted through dedicated prayers by Nigerians, adding that with prayer at Easter, challenges bedevilling the country would be overcome.\n\n\n\nOn his part, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State has called on the people of the state and indeed all Nigerians to take advantage of the historic event to advance peace, intensify prayers and commit themselves to God.\n\n\n\nIn his Easter message, Ugwuanyi applauded Christians for the successful conclusion of the forty-day long Lenten season.\n\n\n\nGovernor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State has also stated that the Easter celebration offers Nigerians the opportunity to rethink the essence of their humanity in true reflection of love, forgiveness, peace, reconciliation, brotherliness and sacrifice, all of which Jesus Christ symbolises.\n\n\n\nOn its part, PDP has urged Nigerians to use the occasion of Easter to rekindle their hope for a brighter future and a national rebirth under a coming democratic and people-oriented government. Easter, the PDP said is the celebration of the victory of life over death, that offers the opportunity to further strengthen the resolve to rescue the nation from the forces of death, suffering and misrule that have held her hostage in the last seven years.\n\n\n\nAccording to a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, \u201cSuch forces have in the last seven years divided and suppressed Nigerians, arrogantly instituted lies, propaganda, deceit, disregard for the rule of law, intimidation and violation of human rights as official policies of State; brought untold economic hardship and acute poverty as a weapon of suppression and mass destruction, pillaged our national treasury with impunity, opened our nation to terrorists and look the other way as outlaws take over territories and daily massacre our citizens.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Pardon All Thieves in Prison, SANs Tell Buhari, Knock President over Dariye, Nyame",
          "text": "\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThree Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs), Chief Mike Ozekhome, Mr. Femi Falana and Mr. Jibrin Okutepa, have faulted the state pardon granted to former Governors Joshua Dariye of Plateau State and Jolly Nyame of Taraba State, and called on President Muhammadu Buhari to pardon other thieves in prison.\n\n\n\nThe former governors, who were jailed for corruption, were pardoned alongside 157 others at the Council of State meeting presided over by President Buhari on Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe action by the government, has however come under strong criticisms by many Nigerians, including Ozekhome.\n\nOzekhome, in faulting the action of the president queried the basis for granting the pardon when the charge of corruption upon which they were convicted is not only a bane in the country but \u201cstruts around imperiously like a peacock\u201d.\n\n\n\nIn a statement titled: \u2018Legal and Moral Implications of Granting Pardon to Ex-convicts and Serving Prisoners,\u2019 the senior lawyer was of the opinion that the decision to free the two governors who are still serving their jail terms was not in the interest of the people and capable of dampening the confidence of the citizenry in the national moral fabric, and in the fight against corruption.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cBy granting pardon to these treasury looters, Buhari is reviving, nurturing and watering corruption with state powers\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, when the Council of State recently authorised the pardon of 159 convicts, including Senator Joshua Dariye of Plateau State and ex-Governor Jolly Nyame of Taraba State, who were both imprisoned for stealing N1.16 billion and N1.6 billion, respectively, many Nigerians justifiably showed anger, because these two political leaders had been duly tried and convicted for stealing money belonging to their respective states\u201d, he said.\n\n\n\nThe senior lawyer maintained that the purpose of criminal prosecution is to secure justice, not only for the accused, but also for the victims of crimes and the state; and to some extent get reparation and restitution for the victims, while deterring others from going the same route.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere lies the justice for the impoverished people of Plateau and Taraba States who will now watch their tormentors stroll out with red carpet treatment?\n\n\u201cThe government budgets huge sums of money for the prosecution of such accused persons from the tax players\u2019 sweat; and if after the rigorous period of trial and subsequent conviction, the guilty are simply let off the hook in such a brazen manner, the little remaining lean hope the citizens have in the system is further diminished\u201d, he added.\n\n\n\nWhile stating that both the president and the Council of State goofed and abused their undoubted constitutional powers and privileges, Ozekhome explained that a constitutional issue as volatile as this could have been better managed if the minders of the president had told him the embarrassment this could cause the government in the estimation of the comity of nations.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Falana, speaking during the one year remembrance programme for the late Publicity Secretary of the Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Yinka Odumakin, described the release of the former governors as discriminatory.\n\n\n\nHe stressed that it was wrong to grant state pardon to the two of them who were convicted for stealing state funds.\n\n\n\nFalana said under the 1999 constitution, there is equality for all citizens, adding that the state pardon has to be extended to all thieves and criminals serving jail terms in various prisons.\n\nHe said, \u201cMy reaction is that all criminals, all thieves and criminals in our prisons should be released.\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause Section 17 of the Constitution says there shall be equality, equal rights for all citizens and section 42 said there shall be no discrimination on the basis of class, gender, whatever, so you can\u2019t take out two people and leave the rest there. It\u2019s illegal.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said he might be forced to ask lawyers whose clients are still in prison to go to court and challenge the discriminatory treatment.\n\nFalana suggested that the 1999 constitution should be referred to as decree 24 on 1999 as \u201cit was not duly signed.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat the National Assembly has continued to do is to amend illegality. The so-called 1999 constitution is really decree 24 of 1999. When you see the so-called constitution, you will not the signature of the man who signed the law, that\u2019s the fraud.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you see a law, the name of the person who signed it should be there with the date.\n\n\u201cDecree 24 of 1999 was promulgated by General Abdulsalami Abubakar on the 5th of May 1999 but today you will not see his name on it. It\u2019s a fraudulent document.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe decree was imposed on us the last set of military dictators in Nigeria headed by Gen. Abubakar and because that document is okay for members of the ruling class regardless of their political parties, ethic regional or religious inclination, they are all comfortable with the document so they can\u2019t do anything about it including all those we are campaigning today to be President.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is to retain the status quo and perhaps adjust it here and there, that is the only thing they are saying, so those who are contesting particularly on the platform of the ruling party are saying we are going to continue the programme of the Buhari administration that has put our country in problem.\n\n\n\n\u201cNigeria has become a huge joke in the committee of nations and so for any set of people to say they want to package his rickety vehicle and begin to panel beat it, it\u2019s not going to move.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Okutepa faulted the presidential pardon granted to Dariye and Nyame.\n\nHe wondered why president Buhari granted the pardon despite his lamentations that corruption is affecting Nigeria\u2019s growth.\n\n\n\nWhile speaking during an interview, he said: \u201cWe are all aware of the reasons they were arraigned and found guilty by the Supreme Court. They are politically exposed people in our society.\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest things that has retarded the growth of Nigeria today is corruption. It is the best enterprise in Nigeria today. So, when I heard that Buhari agreed to pardon the ex-governors, I weep for this country. The reason is that the mantra for which this person came to power is that of corruption.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe duty of the Nigerian government is to fight and eradicate corruption. Corruption has become so cancerous and all hands must be on deck to fight it. I am so upset by the decision because the ex-governor of Plateau State has his appeal dismissed in March 2021 by the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn this country, the executive had on a series of occasions said that one of the things affecting the fight against corruption is the judiciary, so if the judiciary, therefore, enforces the provisions of the law and sends the ex-governors to prison, why does the executive sabotage its own law.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Stella Oduah, a Nigerian Senator and former Minister of Aviation has finalised her defection from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\n\n\nOduah on August 27, 2021, left the PDP for the APC.\n\nStella Oduah\n\nA source told SaharaReporters that the Senator returned to the PDP and secretly obtained the party\u2019s nomination form to return to the Senate.\n\n\n\n\u201cSenator Stella Oduah has finally dumped the APC and moved to the PDP after days of playing hide and seek game. Having used Abubakar Malami, the AGF to frustrate and hang her trial and prosecution at the Federal High Court, Abuja before Justice Inyang Ekwo on allegations of fraud, embezzlement and siphoning of N7.9 billion when she was the Minister of Aviation,\u201d the source said.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters on Tuesday, March 29, 2022 reported that the former aviation minister had concluded plans to dump the ruling APC for the PDP.\n\nSee Also Politics After Tricking Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Malami To Frustrate N7.9bn Fraud Trial, Stella Oduah Moves To Dump APC For PDP\n\nSaharaReporters reported that the Senator had held a closed-door meeting with Anyim Pius Anyim, a PDP presidential aspirant and some party leaders.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe used Senator Anyim to reach out and perfected her new arrangement and agreement with the PDP leadership preparatory to her decampment to PDP in the next few days,\u201d a source had said.\n\n\n\nThe move came a few days after Malami orchestrated different strategies to compromise and frustrate the prosecution of Oduah, who has corruption cases hanging on her neck.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe trio of Abubakar Malami, Governor Mai Mala Buni and Senator Ahmad Lawan are feeling used and dumped by Stella Oduah, having been briefed and realised that she has used them to frustrate her prosecution and betrayed their 'agreement' and 'accord' by finalising arrangements to dump APC for PDP in the next few days,\u201d the source had added.\n\nSee Also Scandal How Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Malami Frustrated N7.9bn Fraud Trial Of Stella Oduah After Ex-Aviation Minister Joined Ruling APC\n\nSaharaReporters exclusively reported in 2021 that Oduah\u2019s trial by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over N7.9 billion fraud might be scuttled going by her secret plot with Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and Malami.\n\n\n\nHowever, SaharaReporters learnt on Friday that Oduah had reached out to PDP members in her zone and her town in Ogbaru Local Government Area to secure the PDP Senatorial nomination form for Anambra North zone.\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving obtained the form secretly so that the office of AGF, Abubakar Malami and also the national leadership of APC will not know that she has used them to stall and frustrate her trial before Justice Ekwo, then having achieved her aim, she has finally used and dumped them,\u201d another source confirmed to SaharaReporters on Friday.\n\n\n\n\u201clt is most disturbing and disheartening that 3 years after the EFCC (Economic and Financial Crimes Commission) concluded its investigation into the case of diversion of N7.9 billion fraud and embezzlement of public funds perpetrated by Stella Oduah, she is still evading trial and justice.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe has been summoned to enter the witness box and take her plea about five times so that the trial can commence, but Malami and Governor Mai Mala Buni (Yobe governor and former chairman of the APC caretaker committee) shielded her from justice and the long arm of the law by frustrating the case.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe same Stella Oduah has now run back to the PDP and obtained PDP nomination form.\u201d\n\nOduah is being prosecuted on 25 counts of money laundering alongside Gloria Odita, Nwobu Emmanuel Nnamdi, Chukuma Irene Chinyere, Global Offshore and Marine Limited, Crystal Television Limited, Sobora International Limited and the China Civil Engineering Construction Company Limited.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the arraignment of the Senator was aborted at the Federal High Court in Abuja during the last adjourned date (Monday, November 22nd, 2021) over a letter written by Malami.\n\n\n\nWhen Oduah and three others were called into the dock to take their plea, counsel for the 7th and 8th defendants, Ogwu James Onoja (SAN), objected to the arraignment on the ground that his clients were being persecuted by EFCC.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the aggrieved defendants had petitioned Malami, seeking a review of the charges against them.\n\n\n\nOgwu informed Justice Inyang Ekwo that the AGF, upon receipt of the petition, wrote the chairman of EFCC to remit the case file to his office for a review, adding that in flagrant disregard to the AGF\u2019s letter, the EFCC had bluntly refused to remit the case file to the AGF.\n\n\n\nHe tendered a certified true copy of the AGF\u2019s letter as received by the EFCC chairman and urged the court not to go ahead with the arraignment until the petition had been resolved in the interest of justice.\n\n\n\nHowever, a lawyer for the EFCC, Ofem Uket denied any knowledge of the AGF's letter, adding that as a staff member of EFCC, he was just sighting the letter for the first time in court.\n\n\n\nThe counsel urged the court to disregard the petition by the defendants and proceed to arraign them.\n\n\n\nHe said that the AGF would have come to the court if he had any opposition to the arraignment.\n\n\n\nHowever, Justice Ekwo said since the petition was raised as

          "text": "Stella Oduah, a Nigerian Senator and former Minister of Aviation has finalised her defection from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\n\n\nOduah on August 27, 2021, left the PDP for the APC.\n\nStella Oduah\n\nA source told SaharaReporters that the Senator returned to the PDP and secretly obtained the party\u2019s nomination form to return to the Senate.\n\n\n\n\u201cSenator Stella Oduah has finally dumped the APC and moved to the PDP after days of playing hide and seek game. Having used Abubakar Malami, the AGF to frustrate and hang her trial and prosecution at the Federal High Court, Abuja before Justice Inyang Ekwo on allegations of fraud, embezzlement and siphoning of N7.9 billion when she was the Minister of Aviation,\u201d the source said.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters on Tuesday, March 29, 2022 reported that the former aviation minister had concluded plans to dump the ruling APC for the PDP.\n\nSee Also Politics After Tricking Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Malami To Frustrate N7.9bn Fraud Trial, Stella Oduah Moves To Dump APC For PDP\n\nSaharaReporters reported that the Senator had held a closed-door meeting with Anyim Pius Anyim, a PDP presidential aspirant and some party leaders.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe used Senator Anyim to reach out and perfected her new arrangement and agreement with the PDP leadership preparatory to her decampment to PDP in the next few days,\u201d a source had said.\n\n\n\nThe move came a few days after Malami orchestrated different strategies to compromise and frustrate the prosecution of Oduah, who has corruption cases hanging on her neck.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe trio of Abubakar Malami, Governor Mai Mala Buni and Senator Ahmad Lawan are feeling used and dumped by Stella Oduah, having been briefed and realised that she has used them to frustrate her prosecution and betrayed their 'agreement' and 'accord' by finalising arrangements to dump APC for PDP in the next few days,\u201d the source had added.\n\nSee Also Scandal How Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Malami Frustrated N7.9bn Fraud Trial Of Stella Oduah After Ex-Aviation Minister Joined Ruling APC\n\nSaharaReporters exclusively reported in 2021 that Oduah\u2019s trial by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over N7.9 billion fraud might be scuttled going by her secret plot with Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and Malami.\n\n\n\nHowever, SaharaReporters learnt on Friday that Oduah had reached out to PDP members in her zone and her town in Ogbaru Local Government Area to secure the PDP Senatorial nomination form for Anambra North zone.\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving obtained the form secretly so that the office of AGF, Abubakar Malami and also the national leadership of APC will not know that she has used them to stall and frustrate her trial before Justice Ekwo, then having achieved her aim, she has finally used and dumped them,\u201d another source confirmed to SaharaReporters on Friday.\n\n\n\n\u201clt is most disturbing and disheartening that 3 years after the EFCC (Economic and Financial Crimes Commission) concluded its investigation into the case of diversion of N7.9 billion fraud and embezzlement of public funds perpetrated by Stella Oduah, she is still evading trial and justice.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe has been summoned to enter the witness box and take her plea about five times so that the trial can commence, but Malami and Governor Mai Mala Buni (Yobe governor and former chairman of the APC caretaker committee) shielded her from justice and the long arm of the law by frustrating the case.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe same Stella Oduah has now run back to the PDP and obtained PDP nomination form.\u201d\n\nOduah is being prosecuted on 25 counts of money laundering alongside Gloria Odita, Nwobu Emmanuel Nnamdi, Chukuma Irene Chinyere, Global Offshore and Marine Limited, Crystal Television Limited, Sobora International Limited and the China Civil Engineering Construction Company Limited.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the arraignment of the Senator was aborted at the Federal High Court in Abuja during the last adjourned date (Monday, November 22nd, 2021) over a letter written by Malami.\n\n\n\nWhen Oduah and three others were called into the dock to take their plea, counsel for the 7th and 8th defendants, Ogwu James Onoja (SAN), objected to the arraignment on the ground that his clients were being persecuted by EFCC.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the aggrieved defendants had petitioned Malami, seeking a review of the charges against them.\n\n\n\nOgwu informed Justice Inyang Ekwo that the AGF, upon receipt of the petition, wrote the chairman of EFCC to remit the case file to his office for a review, adding that in flagrant disregard to the AGF\u2019s letter, the EFCC had bluntly refused to remit the case file to the AGF.\n\n\n\nHe tendered a certified true copy of the AGF\u2019s letter as received by the EFCC chairman and urged the court not to go ahead with the arraignment until the petition had been resolved in the interest of justice.\n\n\n\nHowever, a lawyer for the EFCC, Ofem Uket denied any knowledge of the AGF's letter, adding that as a staff member of EFCC, he was just sighting the letter for the first time in court.\n\n\n\nThe counsel urged the court to disregard the petition by the defendants and proceed to arraign them.\n\n\n\nHe said that the AGF would have come to the court if he had any opposition to the arraignment.\n\n\n\nHowever, Justice Ekwo said since the petition was raised as both a statutory and constitutional matter by the defendants, he would not proceed.\n\n\n\nOduah\u2019s planned arraignment before then in the corruption charges had been stalled five times, largely due to her absence in court.",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time.

          "title": "Digital Nomads: Julian Owusu\u2019s journey from football to fintech",
          "text": "\u201cPeople don\u2019t know me as a footballer anymore. I\u2019m no longer defined by the game. This, along with the fact that I can build products that real people are using, is a true mark of success.\u201d\n\nAt 14, UK-born Ghanaian Julian Owusu discovered a talent that would earn him money: playing football.\n\nIt\u2019s a dream many young boys have, to gain global recognition and wealth doing something they enjoy, a sport watched by over 1.1 billion people across the world. While football might not be one of the top 20 paying professions in the world, it is the fifth-highest paid sports profession, with pro players getting an average of $3.6 million yearly.\n\nEven though football held a promising future for Julian, it was only one of his dreams. \u201cI grew up playing football,\u201d he says, \u201cBut I\u2019ve always been interested in tech, even long before I started playing professionally.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of his football career, Julian knew he wanted to tell a different story with his journey. \u201cMost of the other footballers I know have the same story, whether they were rich or poor. They don\u2019t know what else to do when they\u2019re not practising or playing. They don\u2019t know where or if they belong outside the field. I wanted to be different.\u201d\n\nHe started his professional journey at 16 when he joined Eleven Wise\u2014a Division One football league club based in Ghana\u2014as a striker. Julian had joined the club on the recommendation of his agent who thought he would benefit from the club\u2019s rigorous training. \u201cIt was actually my first solo trip to Ghana,\u201d he says. \u201cMy folks had brought me over every year, but coming down to join Eleven Wise was the first time I\u2019d be in Ghana on my own. And I think that trip is really what helped me build my entrepreneurial spirit.\u201d\n\nHe had to forget his UK background and immerse himself in Ghana\u2019s culture. \u201cI had to understand local cultures and become like my teammates. I had to understand what the fans wanted, and what my coaches wanted. So I learned a lot of lessons very quickly about becoming a professional and just having a professional mindset.\u201d\n\nUpon completion of his one-year contract with Eleven Wise, Julian moved to Berekum Chelsea, a premier league club out of Ghana, in 2010 where he helped the team score several goals including the 2010\u20132011 Ghana Premier League cup\u2014the youngest team ever to win the cup\u2014the MTN FA Cup, and the 2011 Ghana\u2019s President\u2019s Cup.\n\nFrom Berekum Chelsea, he glided through other clubs, from Hayes and Yeading United, to Burnham, right until 2014 when he decided to retire.\n\nWhen football players on defining paths, such as Julian, retire, it\u2019s often because of injury. Like in most contact sports, football players are exposed to more than their fair share of harm including muscle sprains and toe fractures.\n\nJulian\u2019s retirement, however, had nothing to do with injury, age, or scandal. He simply wanted to be more.\n\n\u201cI was on holiday one year, writing and thinking through what I wanted to become,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI wondered what I wanted to be when I was in my 30s, 40s, 50s or 60s, and I realised that football wasn\u2019t the only thing I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nHe needed to build knowledge in an industry that could set him up for success, and so he decided to return to school, a transition he didn\u2019t find so difficult, he says. \u201cIt was difficult at the beginning, but all the skills I\u2019d learnt playing football were transferrable. I knew how to work hard. The only reason it was difficult at the start wasn\u2019t because I was studying. It was more because I wasn\u2019t training or going to play a match.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, enrolled at the London School of Business and Management, Julian got introduced to digital product management by executing the website for the New Student Union. But he didn\u2019t fall in love with the field until 2 years later when he landed a product management role at Landon and Fitch, a London-based advertising firm. \u201cIn my first role, I was only managing the teams and scope, and I wanted more. At Landon and Fitch, though, I got hands-on experience with building and ideating, and that\u2019s where everything clicked into place and I knew it was what I would continue doing. There\u2019s something beautiful about the process of taking something from an idea, bringing it to life and seeing real people use it.\u201d\n\nFrom his product management role at Landor & Fitch in 2018, Julian went on to manage other products at Culturetool and Spark44, right until he decided to build a product of his own: Zuberi Pay.\n\nThe idea for Zuberi came to Julian as he drove through the streets of London. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking of building a fintech. I just wanted to tackle a problem every day people had. And when I thought about what problems 90% of people had, it was cash flow, money!\u201d\n\nWhile the product was officially released for beta-testing in January 2021, Zuberi started operation right around the time COVID went mainstream in February 2020. Julian added 10 workers to a WhatsApp group and explained his idea to them: Zuberi would provide them with salary advances, for a small interest fee.\n\nZuberi\u2019s app interface\n\nWithin a few months, the number of people who\u2019d joined the group doubled. He was providing 30 people with advances, using everyday tools like WhatsApp for communication, Excel for data collection, and Taptap Send to transfer payment. \u201cWhen I thought about how much I was doing just on WhatsApp and Excel, I realised that I could learn more and expand better with an app. So I started pitching to investors.\u201d\n\nMonths later, he\u2019d raised about \u00a322,000 ($28,700) from friends and family to build the first iteration of the Zuberi App. At that time, he also brought on as co-founder Nana Adomako\u2014who worked as the Growth Manager for Taptap Send.\n\nBy December 2021, Julian quit his 9\u20135 as a product manager and moved to Ghana to focus on and lead the vision of Zuberi. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a founder of a startup,\u201d he says, \u201cI think the best role is probably to be a product manager because you\u2019re basically the CEO of the product and you get to know the ins and outs of what you\u2019re building.\u201d\n\nWhile Zuberi is still in its early stages and available to only a select group of users, it has thousands of Ghanaians on its waitlist. \u201cWe are still sorting out regulation and yet to fully launch. We\u2019re working with the Bank of Ghana to get Zuberi up as soon as possible so people can access its benefits.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his fears, Julian says he has none, even though he\u2019s earning significantly less as a CEO, compared to when he was a footballer or a product manager. \u201cI think I could probably play again if I wanted to, but I\u2019m not interested. I\u2019ve found my calling. Here, I\u2019m building value, actual value I can see in people\u2019s lives. I might not be earning as much but I\u2019m not high-maintenance. As long as I can provide for my family, then that\u2019s all that really matters.\u201d\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech.

          "title": "In the wake of explosive accusations against Africa\u2019s most valuable startup, Flutterwave co-founder speaks",
          "text": "Former CEO of Africa\u2019s most valuable startup Flutterwave, Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, has responded to the recent allegations of fraud and insider trading levelled against the company\u2019s management and current CEO and co-founder, Olugbenga Agboola.\n\nThe accusations were laid out in an article by David Hundeyin, and a Medium post by Clara Wanjiku.\n\nWhile both Wanjiku and Hundeyin\u2019s articles raised important questions about the culture, ethics, and governance at Flutterwave, Aboyeji claims no privileged insight into the company after his time there. He however addressed concerns raised about things that happened while he was CEO of the payment giant.\n\nOne of the many actions Agboola was accused of was creating a ghost \u201cco-founder\u201d identity, who went by the name Greg, to give himself more shares, in the company\u2019s early days. To this, Aboyeji told TechCabal that the agreement between the co-founders was that Agboola would hold some shares in trust for the fictitious Greg.\n\n\u201cWhen I joined the company, I was told there\u2019s a chief technology officer named Greg, who\u2019s from MIT, whom I\u2019d meet someday. It never happened,\u201d Aboyeji said. \u201cAfter a while, it became clear what had happened. By that time it didn\u2019t matter. We [Aboyeji and third co-founder Adeleke Adekoya] had already signed agreements, and I decided to just move on.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, on Wednesday, April 13, Aboyeji had put out a series of tweets, aimed at distancing himself from any involvement in the allegations levelled at Agboola and Flutterwave. He said, in one of them, that some of the allegations made could prevent him from being a company director, and thus affect his livelihood.\n\nHe also said that Hundeyin, the article\u2019s author, didn\u2019t reach out to him for comment.\n\nThe article alleged that Agboola did not resign from his job as Head of Digital Factory and Innovation at Access Bank before working at Flutterwave. It said Aboyeji had been a co-conspirator who had testified, alongside Agboola and Access Bank CEO Herbert Wigwe, before the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under oath, that Agboola never worked simultaneously at Flutterwave and Access Bank.\n\nAboyeji\u2019s time as CEO\n\nLaunched in 2016 as a Nigerian and US-based payments company, with offices in Lagos and San Francisco, Flutterwave was co-founded by Agboola, Adekoya, and Aboyeji, who had earlier co-founded Andela. TechCabal obtained a copy of Flutterwave\u2019s US certificate of incorporation, prepared by Aboyeji on May 2, 2016.\n\nFlutterwave started when Aboyeji met the other co-founders Agboola and Adekoya while still at Andela.\n\nAccess Bank had hired an engineer from Andela to work on a product that later turned out to be PayWithCapture, a mobile payment solution that permitted customers to make payments by scanning a merchant\u2019s pre-generated QR code using their phone cameras.\n\nAfter a series of conversations about the African payment landscape, Aboyeji, Agboola, and Adekoya teamed up to start Flutterwave, to solve the challenges with African payment. Agboola and Adekoya had the ideas; Aboyeji came on board to execute.\n\nIn the early days of Flutterwave, the co-founders were still working at their previous jobs. Aboyeji explained that although the trio had agreed to a transition timeline towards working on Flutterwave full-time, there were challenges with adhering to that timeline. Flutterwave investors were made aware that Agboola and Adekoya had transitioned from working for the bank to consulting for the Africa Fintech Foundry through an investor update.\n\n\u201cMy co-founders informed me that they\u2019ve resigned from Access Bank, but they had to give some notice to the bank, and since they were handling sensitive positions at Access Bank, what ended up happening was they became consultants to Africa Fintech Foundry,\u201d Aboyeji said. Africa Fintech Foundry is an initiative by Access Bank that nurtures and accelerates the growth of fintech startups in Africa.\n\nAboyeji described the relationship between Access Bank and Flutterwave as a mutually beneficial one. Access Bank was the budding fintech\u2019s banking partner and Flutterwave helped introduce the bank to its Silicon Valley network.\n\nHe also disclosed that, early on, when the company started, there were ongoing conversations with Access Bank to invest in Flutterwave, but due to Nigerian banking regulations that prohibited banks from getting involved in non-banking activities, the deal couldn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cThe foundation of Flutterwave was as a result of the collaboration between a bank and the local tech ecosystem. I think that\u2019s an incredible learning opportunity,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nTechCabal has reached out to Access Bank to comment on their relationship with Flutterwave\u2019s founders but hasn\u2019t gotten a response as of press time.\n\nSEC investigation\n\nIn an investor update obtained by TechCabal, covering Flutterwave\u2019s activities from May 2016 to June 2017, Flutterwave\u2019s investors were informed that the SEC had opened an investigation into the company and its investors.\n\nAs seen in a legal brief by Orrick, a US law firm, Flutterwave had 85 investors, and there was concern that some of them were not qualified to be investors under US law.\n\n\u201cTo invest in a startup in the US, you have to be a US resident, an international investor who can claim to be a Reg S investor or a close family, friend, or employee of founders,\u201d Aboyeji said. \u201cThe SEC were concerned about whether we had followed the right process in making sure the investors were accredited. We proved that every investor was profiled and qualified under the required exemptions.\u201d\n\nAfter the SEC\u2019s initial enquiries, further investigation on Flutterwave, as related to this matter was closed, according to a letter from the SEC dated September 28, 2017. There was no other investigation made by the SEC outside of this incident during his tenure as CEO, according to Aboyeji.\n\nChange of name\n\nAfter the initial fictitious Greg co-founder incident, there were accusations of instances where Agboola often changed his first name to Greg when communicating with external parties.\n\nAboyeji acknowledged being aware of this happening on a few occasions, stating that it sometimes happened when Agboola, who was already well known as an Access Bank employee\u2014but now with Flutterwave\u2014needed to engage with other banks.\n\n\u201cThat was the context to which I understood him using Greg. Otherwise, as a result of the hostility among banks, other banks can just say, \u2018You\u2019re from Access Bank, we will not use you.\u2019 While we\u2019re not Access Bank. We\u2019re Flutterwave,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nExiting Flutterwave\n\nIn October 2018, when the news broke out that Aboyeji was stepping down from his role as Flutterwave CEO, there were rumours that all wasn\u2019t well, and that he had been fired. Aboyeji explained to TechCabal that his departure was due to differing opinions with Agboola on how the company should be run.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very simple. GB [Agboola] and I started butting heads,\u201d Aboyeji said. \u201cHe wanted input on things that I felt were my responsibilities, and he didn\u2019t want input on things he felt were his responsibilities. And I said there can\u2019t be two captains of this ship.\u201d\n\nBy mid-September 2018, during a board meeting, Aboyeji stated that he wanted to leave the company and suggested that Agboola, who was then Chief Product Officer, be brought in as a product-focused CEO.\n\nAboyeji offered to leave Flutterwave within 6 months, to allow for a smooth transition. But the board said that there was no need for that, suggesting he could hand over immediately.\n\n\u201cI thought it was rather sudden, but I agreed because I already wanted to leave,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nAfter a few weeks of negotiating the terms of his exit, on October 12, 2018, Aboyeji sent an email announcing his decision to resign as CEO and board member at Flutterwave. A copy of this email was shared with TechCabal.\n\nAboyeji maintains that his exit followed due process and that he currently doesn\u2019t own a stake in the company; he also insists he wasn\u2019t forced to sell his shares at a lower price.\n\n\u201cHow can someone force me to do that? I didn\u2019t sell my shares to GB [Agboola]. I sold my shares to a third party. I fully exited Flutterwave at the $1 billion valuation round last year.\u201d\n\nAboyeji also shared his thoughts on past Flutterwave employee Clara Wanjiku\u2019s recent account of Flutterwave neglecting to remove her as the contact person on their M-Pesa account, resulting in the police hounding Wanjiku and her family after the account recorded a fraudulent transaction.\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t think it was intentional. Based on his experience, the company\u2019s negligence was due to not having a process to properly off-board employees when they leave.\n\n\u201cI kept getting Flutterwave bank alerts for over a year after I left,\u201d Aboyeji said. \u201cI\u2019ve run into trouble with the authorities because Flutterwave still had me listed as a point of contact, long after I left.\u201d\n\nThese allegations come 2 months after Flutterwave raised $250 million in a Series D round that tripled the company\u2019s valuation to over $3 billion in just 12 months.\n\nCommenting on the allegations raised in Hundeyin\u2019s article, Flutterwave shared this response with TechCabal:\n\n\u201cThe blog post in question is based on recycled and previously addressed claims, and several others that are false. As part of our commitment to operating an ethically responsible company in compliance with all applicable laws, we take all claims of this nature seriously, and are conducting a thorough review. We will take action as and when appropriate. This enables us to maintain the highest workplace standards and remain focused on our mission to create financial possibilities for companies and consumers across Africa.\u201d\n\nLed by Agboola, Flutterwave has grown to become a beacon of success in the African tech ecosystem, with Agboola seen as not just a successful entrepreneur but a notable investor in the African startup space.\n\nIn its last fundraising announcement in February, the company revealed that 900,000 businesses globally use Flutterwave to process payments, in 150 currencies, up from 290,000 businesses, as at March 2021. This threefold increase means that the African payment giant has now processed 140 million transactions worth more than $9 billion since its inception.\n\nUpdates: Flutterwave\u2019s response to the allegations were added to this story by 11:00 PM GMT+1 on April 16, 2022\n\n\n\nFlutterwave is an advertiser with and sponsor of several TechCabal properties.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

I couldn\u2019t think.\n\nI guess the salesperson suspected what was wrong. So, she informed me that I didn\u2019t have to pay upfront and I could spread out my payments over six months or so.\n\nBut I was surprised because I didn\u2019t expect a physical retail electronic store to offer such a financial service.\n\nWhat is the service? The store integrates financial services into its non-financial platform \u2014 essentially embedded finance.\n\nIn simpler words, embedded finance is the use of financial tools or services \u2013 like lending or payment processing \u2013 by a non-financial institution.\n\nConsequently, embedded finance enables customers to obtain financial assistance through a third-party app. Embedded finance plans to simplify financial processes for consumers, making it easier for them to get the services they need when they need them.\n\nThe big question is: Can embedded finance drive financial inclusion in Nigeria? Click on the link to find out.\n\nUber Tanzania suspends operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, Thursday, April 14, 2022, ride-hailing company, Uber, suspended operations in Tanzania until further notice after six years in the country.\n\nUber announced the decision in a statement sent to customers across the country, noting that they will not operate in Tanzania until an agreement with the authorities is reached.\n\nWhy the suspension? Uber is suspending operations in Tanzania after the country\u2019s Land Transport Regulatory Authority (LATRA) \u2014 an authority that establishes and approves fares for ride-hailing operators \u2014 approved higher fares as fuel prices reached an all-time high.\n\nA look into the increase: The new fare represents a 50% increase over the previous fare per km. Essentially, its original fare of TSh450/km ($0.19/km) has been raised to TSh900/km ($0.39).\n\nIs this similar? Yeah, it is. Recall that in May 2021, the company increased its fares in Kenya and Nigeria in response to driver demand for a larger share of commissions to offset increased operating costs.\n\nConsequently, it raised its motorcycle ride and delivery services in Kenya by 15%, while ChapChap \u2013 a ride option that allows riders going in the same direction to share a ride if they find a match \u2013 riders will pay an extra KSh 3 ($ 0.03) per kilometre. This followed Uber\u2019s unveiling of electric motorcycles and scooters in Kenya.\n\nIn Nigeria, Uber increased rates on its UberX platform by 13% in Lagos and 20% in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja.\n\nWhat\u2019s the company saying? In the same statement, Uber stated that current transportation regulations had created an unfriendly environment, which has posed a challenge to their business.\n\nMeanwhile, LATRA stated in a March 14, 2022 order that the ride-hailing services fares were approved \u201cin an effort to maintain competition and affordable ride-hailing taxi services.\u201d\n\nHowever, Tanzania\u2019s ride-hailing operators do not perceive LATRA as a regulatory body that promotes competition and low-cost taxi services. Rather, they accuse LATRA of assuming a dictating role by doubling market rates.\n\nAlso, it is accused of regularly threatening to revoke operator licenses, thereby creating an uncertain and hostile business environment.\n\nQuick note: Did you know that Uber launched UberMoto, its on-demand motorbike service in Ibadan, Nigeria, in January 2022 to compete with SafeBoda, MAX.ng, and Gokada?\n\nTake a look at it here: Uber\u2019s gamble on Nigerian motorbikes\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

OPay Egypt, a fintech and electronic payments company, has announced that the Central Bank of Egypt has given it preliminary approval to issue prepaid cards via its OPay app.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that OPay cards will be linked to OPay\u2019s mobile app, allowing users to request the issuance or cancellation of prepaid cards.\n\nAccording to Hesham Ezz El-Din, Digital & Cards Business Director at OPay Egypt, prepaid cards will assist them in reaching a non-cash society in light of The Central Bank of Egypt\u2019s strategy and the Egyptian state\u2019s directive.\n\nThe prepaid cards will be distributed in collaboration with Egyptian Cards Company, the largest card distributor in the local and regional markets.\n\nWhat is the company hoping to accomplish with this? OPay Egypt aims to provide all electronic payment solutions in the local market.\n\nHow? Customers will be able to deposit money into the cards and then use them for cash withdrawals and purchases without opening a bank account. These cards offer OPay customers a wide range of services to meet their financial and payment needs.\n\nLastly, Ezz El-Din stated that they are working hard to strengthen their presence in the local Egyptian market through this new offering and supporting their customers through an inclusive system that aids in driving forward digital transformation and financial inclusion.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nNestcoin is hiring an Associate UX Researcher.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, African eCommerce giant, Jumia, launched JumiaPay, its mobile money option, five years after it had first launched. In a statement on its launch, then co-CEO Jeremy Hodara said the objective was to \u201cprovide a safe, secure and convenient shopping experience to our customers.\u201d\n\nWhile novel in Africa at the time, the model has since been adopted by Nigerian startups as they attempt to capture more market share. If you\u2019re wondering what this model is, it is embedded finance.\n\nAn embedded finance play involves a company, usually not a financial institution, offering a financial service in addition to its existing offers.\n\nFor example, a fashion eCommerce startup could add a wallet that users can use for payments, a lending feature that lets them get loans or an insurance feature to insure expensive purchases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor businesses, the benefits are massive. Using our previous example, the eCommerce startup could witness fewer cart abandonments if customers do not have to use external payment methods. They could also see more people buy from them due to the lending feature.\n\nOn the other hand, customers experience ease while using different services and could get access to products they may have been unable to afford previously. Whichever way you look at it, embedded finance seems like a good deal for everyone involved, so how does that affect financial inclusion in Nigeria?\n\nAccording to the World Bank, financial inclusion means that businesses and individuals have access to financial products and services that meet their needs responsibly and sustainably.\n\nThese needs include the ability to save, make payments, access loans, and get insurance. In a 2021 EFInA study, only 45% of Nigerians had a bank account, with the majority of them living in urban areas.\n\n71% of urban adults have a bank account compared to 40% in rural areas. This disparity also shows in the gender of bank account holders, with 57% of men having bank accounts compared to 45% of women.\n\nOne of the reasons for the inability of Nigerians to open bank accounts is the hassles of getting a Bank Verification Number (BVN). Currently, only banks that are often absent in rural areas can assign BVNs.\n\nPer the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), only 54,169,047 Nigerians have a BVN. While the CBN has launched BVN 2.0 to cater to people who don\u2019t have all the basic requirements, numerous Nigerians are still unable to get one.\n\nWith more than half of Nigerians under 18, this figure suggests that over 40% of Nigerians are excluded from using financial services. However, considering financial inclusion can be achieved in other ways besides using a bank account, this may not be an accurate representation of financial inclusion in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy integrating financial services into non-financial solutions, more Nigerians can be integrated into the financial system without requiring a bank account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "Is Flutterwave\u2019s CEO guilty of insider trading or not?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nYesterday, I incorrectly stated that Flutterwave is Africa\u2019s most valuable company.\n\nBut per African Financials\u2019 March 2022 market report, South Africa\u2019s multinational telecommunications company, MTN Group, is the most valuable African company in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by market capitalisation.\n\nSome numbers: As of February 2022, MTN Group\u2019s market capitalisation was estimated at $24 billion, making it the most valuable brand in SSA. This is comparable to Flutterwave\u2019s $3 billion valuation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlutterwave, on the other hand, is arguably Africa\u2019s most valuable startup. That was where I got it wrong. Please keep in mind that, at the time of writing, MTN Group is the most valuable African company, while Flutterwave is the most valuable African startup.\n\nMore importantly, Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, is the one facing allegations, not Flutterwave.\n\nWe still need you on this: Help Techpoint Africa determine how much African tech workers earn by filling out this form or sharing it with your developer friends.\n\nAnyway, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nFlutterwave CEO\u2019s insider trading allegation\n\nHow VC firm, Katapult, invests\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million Series A\n\nIs Flutterwave\u2019s CEO guilty of insider trading or not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that on Tuesday, April 12, 2022, David Hundeyin, an investigative journalist, published an article in which he allegedly accused Flutterwave Founder and CEO, Olugenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola of impersonation, inappropriate behaviour, and insider trading.\n\nSince then, the phrase \u201cinsider trading\u201d has topped my Twitter trend tables. While I\u2019ve seen a variety of perspectives \u2013 some of which appear to be accurate and some false \u2013 the question on almost everyone\u2019s lips is, is insider trading a thing given that Flutterwave is a private, US-based startup?\n\nBefore you exercise your Googling skills, I\u2019d like to do my part to simplify things.\n\nFirst off, insider trading, according to Investopedia, is the purchase or sale of stock in a publicly-traded company by someone who has non-public, material information about that stock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSidebar: For proper understanding, nonpublic material information is corporate news or information about a company that has not been made public but has the potential to affect its stock price.\n\nFor example, suppose Chimgozirim learns about nonpublic material information from someone who works at ABC company and shares it with Bolu. If Chimgozirim\u2019s informant uses this insider information to profit in the stock market, all three involved are guilty and can be prosecuted.\n\nBesides, insider information is typically available to executives working within or near a public company.\n\nAccording to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), illegal insider trading is the purchase or sale of a security in violation of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence based on material, nonpublic information about the security.\n\nWhat does the law say about insider trading? Insider trading laws apply to private and public companies and transactions involving employees, employee stock plans, and third-party shareholders.\n\nSo, what is your verdict on the allegations against Agboola? Guilty? Or innocent?\n\nWhile I may not be able to delve into some of Hundeyin\u2019s allegations, today\u2019s podcast analysed the article to an extent, leaving us with many unanswered questions. You can listen to it here.\n\nAlso, Ogheneruemu has worked on a piece to fact-check Hundeyin\u2019s story. And I believe it will add context to this. Please read it here: Fact Check: Is there any truth to some of the allegations against Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga Agboola?\n\nHow VC firm, Katapult, invests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf my memory serves me correctly, since secondary school \u2013 if not primary school \u2013 some of us have heard the clause \u201cAgriculture is the mainstay of the national economy.\u201d And, of course, I mean the Nigerian economy.\n\nI also remember my secondary school Agricultural Science teachers repeatedly asking my class to discuss what that meant in both tests and exams at one point or another.\n\nSo, how about we talk about what this means for Africa? Do you want to give it a shot?\n\nI\u2019ll go then: Agriculture is the backbone of most African economies, and agricultural performance is inextricably linked to economic performance in these countries.\n\nTo give some context, studies have shown that agriculture is by far Africa\u2019s most important economic activity. It employs roughly two-thirds of the continent\u2019s working population and contributes an average of 30%-60% to each country\u2019s gross domestic product and approximately 30% of export value.\n\nI\u2019m not here to bore you, so this is my final point: Per a Mckinsey research, Agriculture has a massive social and economic impact in Africa. Smallholder farmers account for more than 60% of sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s population, and agriculture accounts for approximately 23% of the region\u2019s GDP.\n\nRegardless of my points, much of Africa\u2019s agricultural potential is still untapped. In 2020, 282 million Africans went hungry due to insecurity, inadequate agricultural infrastructure, and drought.\n\nMoreover, according to the United Nations (UN), it is expected that Africa will be unable to feed 60% of its population by 2025. The African population, estimated at 118 million at the turn of the twentieth century, had risen to 788.5 million in 1997 and is expected to reach 1.5 billion by 2025.\n\n1.5 billion people will go hungry by 2025? Omo X100! But what are we doing to change this narrative?\n\nAlthough food insecurity, climate change, and other agricultural issues persist on the continent, some startups are trying to address some of the sector\u2019s problems. And Katapult Africa, a venture capital firm, focuses on startups developing solutions for agriculture, food, and the environment.\n\nInteresting facts about the VC firm: The firm was founded in 2016 by Norwegian entrepreneur, Tharald Nustad and has invested in 108 startups, including two unicorns \u2013 Esusu and Betterfly. Also, in 2018, the firm began investing in African startups, and it now has 17 startups in its portfolio.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that I\u2019m not one to give spoilers. But I trust Chimgozirim to provide a detailed explanation of how Katapult invests.\n\nCheck out his insightful article here: An insight into how Katapult VC invests in African startups\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUmba, a digital banking platform based in Lagos, Nigeria, has raised $15 million in Series A funding to expand into new markets like Egypt, Ghana, and Kenya, where mobile money is popular.\n\nWho are the investors? Costanoa Ventures led the round. While firms like Nubank, a credit fintech platform, ACT Ventures, Lux Capital, Palm Drive Capital, Banana Capital, and Streamlined Ventures participated, individuals like Tom Blomfield, the co-founder of Monzo, and Lachy Groom also took part in the round.\n\nWhat does it do? The startup claims it offers transparent and readily available financial products to Africans who are underbanked or unbanked by legacy banks \u2013 locally owned and operated community banks.\n\nWhat is the startup\u2019s model?: Tiernan Kennedy (CEO) and Barry O\u2019Mahony (CFO) launched the company in 2018. And per TechCrunch, the company follows the credit-led model, first solving customers\u2019 liquidity problems before upselling them on a wide range of banking products.\n\nUmba says most of its revenue is generated by charging customers a monthly interest rate of 10%, which the CEO claims is the lowest rate in the market. But how true is this?\n\nTake Payhippo for example \u2013 an AI-powered lending platform that makes it easier to fund small and medium-sized businesses \u2013 claims its loan offering begins with short-term, affordable working capital delivered in 30\u201345 days at a 6% interest rate.\n\nHowever, since Umba\u2019s launch, the company claims it has doubled its revenues every three months, with over 1 million installs on Google Play.\n\nUnlike legacy banks, the company says that its core banking systems, which it designed from the ground up, prioritises customers. Consequently, in both the banking and mobile money markets, it offers customised user experience without delay.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nNestcoin is hiring an Associate UX Researcher.

          "text": "Lagos State government has raised red flag for prospective tenants, advising them to beware of quacks and fake professionals in the state\u2019s rental market who claim to be landlords and genuine estate agents.\n\nThe state in the last 12months has recorded a surge in rent fraud involving prospective tenants, landlords and agents in cases which the Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Housing, Toke Benson-Awoyinka, estimated at over 200 in just a few locations including Alapere, Ajao Estate, Akoka, Gbagada etc.\n\nThe Special Adviser, who spoke at a one-day stakeholders forum for lawyers in real estate practice, explained that the case in Akoka involved about 113 renters who were defrauded of over N51 million while 66 prospective tenants were defrauded of N16 million in the Gbagada case.\n\nShe also cited other cases in Alapere and Ajao Estate areas of the state, pointing out that these victims paid between N200,000 and N500,000 for a limited number of apartments, not more than 20.\n\nBoniface Adebayo, a civil engineer and estate manager, though worried with this bad situation in the Lagos rental market, said such was to be expected in a city where both urbanization and population are growing in leaps and bounds while housing supply is lagging that growth.\n\n\u201cThis is a state where, according to report, there is a housing deficit that is in excess of 3million. That is not all; the same report says the state has the most active rental market in Nigeria where over 60 percent of its 20million population lives in rented accommodation,\u201d Adebayo said.\n\nRead also: Dateline Lagos, circa 1935 \u2013 Standoff at Ereko\n\n\u201cIt is also said that, on daily basis, over 600 people come into Lagos and more than half of that number don\u2019t go back, meaning that, at any given time, you have people who are looking for houses to rent. That unending demand for houses to rent is fueling the activities of these fraudulent agents and landlords,\u201d he reasoned.\n\nThe Special Adviser enjoined prospective renters and home buyers to seek the services of genuine professionals like lawyers for all their real estate services, assuring, however, that the state government has decided to put a stop to such fraudulent activities by enacting the Lagos Real Estate Regulatory Authority (LASRERA) law.\n\n\u201cThe LASRERA Law was reviewed in order to regulate and bring sanity to the real estate sector, as well as all transactions therein; this is to the benefit of lawyers and their prospective clients both in Lagos State and the Diaspora.\n\nAccording to her, while the law will help to protect tenants against fraudulent agents and landlords, it is also an opportunity for lawyers, pointing out however that the role of property lawyers, as legal professionals, is to protect the interest of all parties in any real estate transaction.\n\n\u201cReal estate transactions have relevant processes with necessary documents required for the preparation of specific property business transaction in the sector,\u201d she noted, adding that, in real estate transactions, lawyers and real estate agents offer completely different services.\n\n\u201cA real estate agent is involved in the process of buying and selling properties or rental services while all paper works are handled by a lawyer as prescribed by law,\u201d she said.\n\nThough some lawyers saw the setting of LASRERA as an unnecessary duplication of functions in government, the special adviser insisted that the functions of the agency were basically to formulate policies that will sanitize the real estate sector and to maintain the policies.\n\nThe agency, she added, would register and update that register of all people that are practising in the real estate sector and also people involved in real estate management, including Lawyers and estate managers.\n\n\u201cIt will also regulate the stakeholders including developers, facility managers, facility companies and all. The agency will collate the data of all relevant people in that field so that the state is aware of what is happening in real estate and the general public too will know they are protected by the state,\u201d she assured.",

          "text": "Explainer: What to know about the $1bn attack helicopters US sold to Nigeria\n\nIn a bid to address the insecurity crisis in Nigeria, the United States State Department has cleared the sale of 12 AH-1Z Cobra attack helicopters worth nearly $1bn to Nigeria.\n\nThe clearing of the sale followed the lifting by US lawmakers of objections over human rights concerns.\n\nThe Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced last Thursday the sale of the helicopters and related defence systems to the Nigerian military.\n\nThe sale includes the Bell-made Cobras; 28 General Electric-made T700-401C engines; 2,000 Advanced Precision Kill Weapon Systems used to convert unguided missiles into precision-guided missiles; and night vision, targeting and navigation systems.\n\nAbout Bell AH-1 Cobra\n\nThe Bell AH-1 Cobra is a single-engined attack helicopter developed and manufactured by the American rotorcraft manufacturer, Bell Helicopter. A member of the prolific Huey family, the AH-1 is also referred to as the HueyCobra or Snake.\n\nThe helicopter type, which was used during the Vietnam War, was produced in response to fulfill a need for a dedicated armed escort for transport helicopters to give the helicopters greater survivability in contested environments.\n\nDesign and features\n\nThe AH-1 is a dedicated attack helicopter, featuring a tandem cockpit, stub wings for weapons, and a chin-mounted gun turret.\n\nThe fuselage and other sub-assembly elements are all made of corrosion-resistant material. No two dissimilar metals of the structure are in contact.\n\nThe helicopter features an epoxy primer layer on the exposed surfaces. The AH-1Z Viper is deployed to provide close air support, armed escort/reconnaissance, anti-air warfare, and anti-armour operations.\n\nNorthrop Grumman developed the integrated avionics systems for the AH-1Z. The systems include two mission computers and an automatic flight control system with four-axis stability control augmentation system. Each crew station has two 8in\u00d76in multifunction displays and one 4.2in\u00d74.2in dual function display, based on active-matrix liquid crystal colour technology.\n\nThe communications suite combines the US Navy RT-1824 integrated radio, UHF/VHF, COMSEC and modem in a single unit. The navigation suite includes an embedded GPS inertial, a low-airspeed air data subsystem, which allows weapons delivery when hovering, and a digital map.\n\nThe Super Cobra can carry both TOW and Hellfire anti-armour missiles and is qualified to carry the Maverick missile.\n\nThe Super Cobra carries a three-barrel, 20mm gatling gun for close range (up to 2km) engagement and 750 rounds of ammunition. With the gun in a fixed forward position, the pilot can aim by manoeuvring the helicopter. Either crew member can slave the turret to the helmet-mounted sight and aim the gun by looking at the target.\n\nCountries that have used the Cobra helicopters\n\nSeveral countries, including the US, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Turkey, Pakistan and the Philippines, have deployed the Bell AH-1 Cobra for attack missions.\n\nThe first examples of the type entered service with the US Army during 1967; other branches of the US military also opted to acquire the type, particularly the US Marine Corps, while export sales were made to numerous overseas countries, including Israel, Japan, and Turkey.\n\nFor several decades, the AH-1 formed the core of the US Army\u2019s attack helicopter fleet, seeing combat in Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, and Iraq.\n\nIn the US Army, the Cobra was progressively replaced by the newer and more capable Boeing AH-64 Apache during the 1990s, with the final examples being withdrawn during 2001.\n\nThe Israeli Air Force operated the Cobra most prolifically along its land border with Lebanon, using its fleet intensively during the 1982 Lebanon War.\n\nTurkish AH-1s have seen regular combat with Kurdish insurgents near Turkey\u2019s southern borders. Upgraded versions of the Cobra have been developed, such as the twin engined AH-1 SeaCobra/SuperCobra and the experimental Bell 309 KingCobra.\n\nExperts\u2019 views on Cobra attack helicopters\n\nKabir Adamu, founder and chief executive officer of Beacon Consulting, a security risk management and intelligence consulting company, said the attack helicopters would not be useful in the fight against banditry, terrorism, and all security threats that involve armed conflict.\n\nAccording to him, the helicopters expected in the country are very good for precision-styled warfare, especially in urban settings where the enemy is sometimes mixed with the citizens.\n\n\u201cYou need this precision-styled attack, especially where you want to take the enemy by surprise and in close proximity from an aerial point of view,\u201d he said, while stressing that the deployment of the aircraft using credible intelligence would prevent civilian harm.\n\nRead also: Insecurity: A disincentive to investments\n\nAccording to Adamu, the helicopters will help the military respond to distress much faster, especially in forward operating bases, which are most vulnerable to attacks.\n\n\u201cThese helicopters will be very helpful to that response capability. In fact, it\u2019s one of the things that would be the game-changer because of the way the Nigerian security forces are spread thinly; there are so many threat elements and that means we have a lot of bases that are vulnerable to attacks. But where you have this response capability, anytime they are in distress, and you are aware, you can deploy speedily,\u201d he said.\n\nThe expert therefore advised that the armory should be well secured so that enemy would not steal or destroy them as done in the past.\n\nAccording to Shehu Sadeeq, a private security and defence consultant, the helicopters are more rugged and can access places where other aircraft including the Super Tucano cannot access.\n\nHe said the aircraft would make it easier for the military to access the forests where bandits/terrorists hibernate.\n\nThe security consultant, however, noted that Nigeria had not yet purchased the aircraft, saying the contract had not been signed.\n\nSadeeq said, \u201cThe US Congress has to make the final approval; after that is done, Nigeria and America will agree on terms of use and constituents of the aircraft. When they agree, they will sign the final agreement for the aircraft to be produced. So, this is just the start of a long journey.\n\n\u201cWe have learnt our lesson form the Tucano; Nigeria did not do due diligence. Americans did; they specified how the aircraft will be used and Nigeria signed, not knowing that it will not be used against banditry. Before signing, we must be sure of the terms of use.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the attack aircraft can only be effective if handled by well-trained personnel that can maximise its features. \u201cA good aircraft needs a good pilot, else you won\u2019t be able to maximise its benefits. It\u2019s our pilots and technicians that will make sure that the human element complements the quality of the aircraft,\u201d he said.\n\nChidi Omeje, a security analyst, applauded the move to purchase more aircraft, saying, \u201cNigeria is in need of more attack aircraft to deal with security threats.\u201d\n\nHe said the aircraft would enable the Nigeria Air Force (NAF) to dominate the airspace. \u201cThe NAF will have more eyes in the sky, and this will add great impetus to the war on terror,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Uber may not be a core payment company like Flutterwave, but it shares some similarities with the Nigerian-founded company.\n\nFirstly, the ride-hailing company which was founded in 2009 grew to become the most valuable startup in the world valued at $51 billion after its funding rounds in July 2015. Flutterwave, founded in 2016, is presently the most valuable tech company in Africa with a valuation of $3 billion after a $250 million funding round in 2022. Both companies achieved the feats in about 6 years of being set.\n\nSecondly, Uber once had to battle about every kind of scandal possible in today\u2019s tech industry: privacy invasions, sexual harassment, mistreatment of gig workers, a toxic bro culture, intellectual property lawsuits. In the middle of the allegations was Uber\u2019s CEO and co-founder, Travis Kalanick.\n\nOlugbenga Agboola, the current CEO and founder of Flutterwave is the subject of allegations ranging from harassment, insider trading, creating a fictitious co-founder, getting multiple sexual favours from colleagues using his position, lying under oat to the US Securities and Exchange Commission among others.\n\nWhile Flutterwave\u2019s troubles may have begun with a LinkedIn post made by a former female employee, Clara Odero alleging harassment, it was a searing article authored by David Hundeyin, a Nigerian investigative journalist that seems to have hit home. Uber\u2019s troubles also began when a female employee outed the company for its sexist culture in a 3000-word blog post. Following the post were many more revelations including a video of the CEO having a heated argument with an Uber driver on pricing. There was also a story in The New York Times that accused Uber of spying on competitors and deliberately trying to deceive regulators.\n\nAlthough Flutterwave has yet to officially release a statement, the allegations are a big dark blot on a pristine reputation of the poster child of the burgeoning tech ecosystem in Africa. Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, a former CEO and co-founder who was mentioned in the Hundeyin article has since attempted to refute some of the claims made.\n\nRead also: Binance P2P expands risk management roadmap to protect users\n\nHowever, in an interview he granted TechCabal, he may have all but confirmed the fictitious co-founder allegation as well as an allegation that he was abruptly forced to step down from Flutterwave.\n\n\u201cWhen I joined the company, I was told there\u2019s a chief technology officer named Greg, who\u2019s from MIT, whom I\u2019d meet someday. It never happened. After a while, it became clear what had happened.\u201d Aboyeji told TechCabal.\n\nAboyeji who was also accused of colluding with Agboola to lie to the SEC, said the allegation was \u201cpatently false and deeply unfair.\u201d\n\nMany experts however say the admissions do not help the case of Agboola and causes further reputational damage for the brand Flutterwave.\n\nThe reputational damage does not also help the company\u2019s ambitions of becoming a listed company in the near future, a position where Uber found itself in the wake of the scandal involving their CEO.\n\nWhat did Uber do in the case of Kalanick?\n\nThe first thing was the board and investors of Uber taking precise action to stem the tide and stop the ship from sinking further.\n\nIn a letter titled \u201cMoving Uber Forward\u201d and obtained by The New York Times, the investors wrote to Kalanick that he must immediately leave and that the company needed a change in leadership.\n\nAfter Kalanick\u2019s ouster, the new CEO had a mandate to move Uber beyond Kalanick\u2019s legacy. The former CEO was reputed to have favoured building Uber by any means necessary. Kalanick aggressively turned the company into the world\u2019s dominant ride-hailing service and upended the transportation industry around the globe. That aggressiveness came at the cost of eroded culture bringing Uber\u2019s brand to disrepute.\n\nHence, Dara Khosrowshahi the new CEO worked hard to move beyond Kalanick\u2019s legacy, doing away with his predecessor\u2019s 14 company tenets, replacing principles such as \u201csuper pumped\u201d and \u201calways be hustlin\u2019\u201d with credos such as \u201cwe do the right thing\u201d and \u201cwe persevere.\u201d\n\nIn December 2019, Kalanick said that he has sold off all his Uber stock \u2014 estimated at more than $2.5 billion \u2014 and is resigning from the board of directors, severing ties to the company he co-founded.\n\nUber went ahead to list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the jury is still out on whether it was the best decision for Kalanick to completely sever ties with the company he helped to build. One thing the response of Uber investors and board achieved was to detach Uber\u2019s future from Kalanick\u2019s legacies.\n\nBusinessDay understands that Flutterwave is preparing an elaborate response to the allegations, how it learns from the lessons of Uber will determine whether the company\u2019s dream of IPO is realised quickly or postponed perhaps indefinitely.",

          "title": "Kukah Bombs Buhari: You Have Destroyed Nigeria",
          "text": "Bishop Matthew Kukah, the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, has accused President Muhammadu Buhari of destroying Nigeria, noting that Nigerians no longer recognise their country which has been battered and buffeted by men and women from the dark womb of time.\n\nKukah who made the remark in his Easter message on Sunday, explained that \u201cit is no longer necessary to ask how we got here the real challenge is how to find the slippery rungs on the ladder of ascent so we can climb out. Yet, we ask, ascend to where?\u201d\n\n\u201cWith everything literally broken down, our country has become one big emergency national hospital with full occupancy.\n\n\u201cOur individual hearts are broken. Our family dreams are broken. Homes are broken. Churches, Mosques, infrastructure are broken. Our educational system is broken.\n\n\u201cOur children\u2019s lives and future are broken. Our politics is broken. Our economy is broken. Our energy system is broken. Our security system is broken. Our roads and rails are broken. Only corruption is alive and well.\n\nAccording to the bishop, every aspect of life in Nigeria has been destroyed while corruption is enthroned.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur dear country, Nigeria, still totters and wobbles as we screech towards a dangerous and avoidable canyon of dry bones.\n\n\u201cOne would be tempted to ask, what is there to say about our tragic situation today that has not been said? Who is there to speak that has not spoken? Like the friends of Job, we stare at an imponderable tragedy as the nation unravels from all sides. The government has slid into hibernation mode.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to know whether the problem is that those in power do not hear, see, feel, know, or just don\u2019t care. Either way, from this crossroad, we must make a choice, to go forward, turn left or right or return home. None of these choices is easy, yet, guided by the light of the risen Christ, we can reclaim our country from its impending slide to anarchy.\n\n\u201cThe challenge of fixing this broken nation is enormous and, as I have said, requires joint efforts. With everything literally broken down, our country has become one big emergency national hospital with full occupancy. Our individual hearts are broken. Our family dreams are broken. Homes are broken. Churches, Mosques, and infrastructure are broken. Our educational system is broken. Our children\u2019s lives and future are broken. Our politics is broken. Our economy is broken. Our energy system is broken. Our security system is broken. Our Roads and Rails are broken. Only corruption is alive and well.\n\n\u201cThe greatest challenge for Nigeria is not even the 2023 elections. It is the prospect for the reconciliation of our people. Here, the Buhari administration sadly has divided our people on the basis of ethnicity, religion, and region, in a way that we have never witnessed in our history. This carefully choreographed agenda has made Nigerians vulnerable and ignited the most divisive form of identity consciousness among our people. Years of friendships, cultural exchange, and collaboration built over time have now come under serious pressure from stereotyping.\u201d\n\nHe also faulted amnesty granted to terrorists and former governors of Plateau State, Senator Joshua Dariye; and Taraba State, Rev Jolly Nyame.\n\nKukah said, \u201cWe need to start thinking of a Nigeria beyond banditry and kidnapping and the endless circles of violence that have engulfed our communities and nation. We cannot continue to pretend that there are no religious undertones to the violence in the name of God that has given our religions a bad name.\n\n\u201cThe way out is for the state to enforce the secular status of the Nigerian state so as to give citizens the necessary freedoms from the shackles of semi-feudal confusion over the status of religion and the state in a plural Democracy. We must be ready to embrace modernity and work out how to preserve our religions and cultures without turning religion into a tool for tyranny, exclusion, and oppression.\n\n\u201cI cannot be against a repentant sinner or criminals changing their ways. After all, the doors of forgiveness must always remain open. However, in this case, Nigerians have very little information as to the entire rehabilitation process. Have these terrorists felt the heat or have they seen the light or, is their repentance a mere strategic and tactical repositioning? So far, we have no evidence that these terrorists have been able to confront their victims not to talk of seeking forgiveness from them. Something is wrong.\n\n\u201cWe see these terrorists adorned in our national colours in their green and white kaftans, trousers, and looking like heroes of the state! Are we to assume that they have become acknowledged models for Nigerian youth? Perhaps the next graduating set might be treated to Presidential handshakes, receptions at the villa with full national colours!\u201d",

Under Section 17 of the 1999 Constitution, there shall be equality and equal rights for all citizens.\n\n\u201cSection 42 of the Constitution says there shall be no discrimination on the basis of class and gender, so you cannot take out a few people on the basis that they belong to a category or section of the society.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that if the government did not release others, I am going to call on lawyers whose clients are left in custody to come to court and challenge the discriminatory treatment on their clients.\n\n\u201cJust two weeks ago, a Nigerian was jailed for stealing N1,000 in Abuja; the accused pleaded with the judge that he had no food but the judge jailed him for six months.\n\n\u201cWhen we are talking of justice and fair play, if you want to pardon some set of people, then you must also extend presidential pardon to petty thieves in the prisons.\n\n\u201cThis is because if the big thieves are being asked to go, then they must also extend the facility to other Nigerians,\u201d the rights crusader said.\n\nSpeaking on the passing of late Odumakin after a year, Falana described his loss as a monumental tragedy.\n\n\u201cYinka remained a symbol of justice and we are gathered to celebrate his legacy. He was a man of honour, hope and consistency; a man who gave hope to the masses,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nIn his remarks, Ibikunle Amosun said the deceased was a friend who built bridges across ethnic and religious groups.\n\n\u201cHis legacy will still remain and the memory of his demise still lingers. My heart goes to his widow, Joe for staying strong after his demise,\u201d the former Ogun governor said.\n\nSimilarly, Tunde Bakare, the General Overseer of Citadel Global Community Church and a presidential hopeful, said late Odumakin was a fearless person who did not labour in vain, adding that his memory would linger forever.\n\nAlso, Akinwunmi Adesina, president, African Development Bank, said Mr Odumakin was a respected rights activist and a democrat.\n\nLeader of Oodua People\u2019s Congress, OPC, Gani Adams, thanked Mr Odumakin\u2019s widow for erecting a legacy for the deceased.\n\nHe noted that the Foundation would give room for generations to learn about what the deceased fought about.\n\nIn her remarks, the widow, Joe Okei-Odumakin, said her husband devoted to true federalism.\n\nShe described her deceased husband as an encyclopaedia of positive activism.\n\nNAN reports that late Odumakin, died in April 2, 2021, after battling with respiratory problems, occasioned by COVID-19 complications.",

We have agreed to be together in one party, the PDP and work together for the success of the party.\n\n\u201cWe have also agreed to work extra hard in order to reclaim Zamfara state in 2023 and save its people from their present predicament. I have given the stakeholders a complete update of where we are as a result of this development.\u201d\n\nThe chairman said the duo of Yari and Marafa as well as other top APC members would be officially received soon at a colourful ceremony in Gusau.\n\n\u2018APC not Islam\u2019\n\nEarlier, Senator Marafa had hinted on their planned move to join the PDP, citing injustice.\n\nSpeaking in a telephone interview with journalists in Abuja, Sunday, Senator Marafa said: \u201cAs far as I am concerned, I am not a fulfilled person as far as this project APC is called. If there is anything left, I am waiting to see how the architect of this cruelty meted out to the people of Zamfara state, how they are going to fare in politics.\n\n\u201cLet those people that are afraid of us come out and say they want to see us out and we can go out anytime now. But for now, I am happy, I told them to their faces in Kaduna that they will never benefit out of the machinations they were doing at that time that is Mai Mala and his co-travellers. And I\u2019m happy that they have lost out and they have lost out disgracefully.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t have any business, I can move out of APC anytime I so desire now, anytime I want, I can move out. APC is not Islam, it is my religion that I cannot leave for whatever reason, but a political party, I can leave and join anyone of my choice anytime I feel like.\n\n\u201cYes, APC has treated me unjustly and I have two options: either forgive her or I can move out if I want.\n\n\u201cSome people are too desperate to see us out and they should be rest assured that we will move out at our own pace. There were rumours that time that we were being suspended or expelled and I challenged them to do so. They could not because we are the architect that designed and built APC.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m happy that they were unable to see our back as far as the APC project is concerned. I am happy that we have seen their back today. We have sent them back to their primary assignment, the one that they have rejected and as far as we are concerned, we have won.\n\n\u201cMai Mala lost out disgracefully. He\u2019s a young man, he has just started politics, we are going to see how he\u2019s going to end in politics. Zamfara people are not the kind of people he can joke with.\u201d",

          "title": "20 years after ICJ\u2019s ruling on Bakassi: Language barrier stalls boundary demarcation \u2013 Blueprint Newspapers Limited",
          "text": "Two decades after Nigeria ceded the Bakassi Peninsula to Cameroon following a ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague, Switzerland; the federal government has approached international experts for the interpretation of the ruling, particularly as it affects both countries\u2019 understanding and interpretations of the textual rendering used in the ruling.\n\nThe problem, Blueprint gathered, is largely due to the use of language in the ruling as the textual renderings made available to the two countries in two different languages have yielded divergent comprehension and reactions.\n\nWhereas the version of the ruling sent to Nigeria is in English language, that given to the Cameroon is rendered in French language, a development that has generated discrepancies in their understanding and interpretations as a result of differences in textual rendering.\n\nDependable sources said Nigeria\u2019s understanding and interpretation of certain English words and phrases employed in the ruling by the ICJ differs greatly from Cameroon\u2019s understanding and interpretations of the French version of the same decision, which ultimately threw up completely varying applications from both nations.\n\nAccordingly, Cameroon, based on their understanding of aspects of the ruling, has opted to define border lines using its understanding of certain features as rendered in the French text as her legitimate portion and had undertaken to claim the same by attempting to place pillars for onward demarcation of such places.\n\nBut Nigeria has repeatedly resisted such claims, insisting that the areas in question \u2013 which are eight in number \u2013 are her bonafide portions based on the ICJ ruling and rightly should not be encroached upon.\n\nNBC DG speaks\n\nConfirming textual confusion as an hindrance to the implementation of the ICJ ruling to the letter, Director General National Boundary Commission (NBC) Surveyor Adamu Adaji said: \u201cBasically, sometimes, some of the terminologies used in English text may differ from those used in the French text, and has generally resulted in conflicting understanding and interpretations from both countries. So, we have had that controversy.\n\n\u201cIt is not only Nigeria but both countries differ in their understanding and interpretations of some of the texts. Sometimes, the disparity in the language \u2013 French and the English texts \u2013 allow misunderstanding to creep in.\n\n\u201cThat is why we have sought the assistance of an international expert to interpret the ruling. Nigeria has requested the assistance of Williams Robinson in this regard and we are hoping some features mentioned in the ruling of the ICJ will be clarified for better understanding and interpretation of the two nations.\u201d\n\nAdaji further said Nigeria insisted on the physical inspection of the scenes and features on ground as mentioned in the ICJ ruling, saying some of these would clearly establish ownership of the areas in contention.\n\nAreas of conflicting interpretations\n\nTwenty of such areas of discrepancies were observed and deliberated upon by the United Nations Cameroon- Nigeria Mixed Commission.\n\nAnd at the 33rd session of the meeting, 16 of these conflicting areas were thrashed and agreed upon, with four others pending.\n\nOne of such contentious areas is Koja in Mubi local government area of Adamawa state where an attempt was made by a contractor led by a UN team, to place pillars for subsequent demarcation exercise. The attempt led to riotous protest by the villagers.\n\nAside from Koja, the other areas with conflicting understanding of the ICJ ruling are Ligague/Sale Road, Mada/Gourougourou Road, both in Borno state, Mabas Village, Rhumsike Village, Anglo/German Pillars.\n\nAccordingly, the UN had, following Nigeria\u2019s request, directed that marking of border lines, placement of pillars, and delineation of these areas be suspended pending clarification and resolution of observed discrepancies.\n\nThe NBC boss said: \u201cThese are sectors of the boundary that are still outstanding. We have agreed on what we have to do, some of which would require a visit to the site by the mixed commission\u2019s demarcation sub-commission team under the auspices of the UN. We will be on the ground to see some of the features that were mentioned in the judgment for us to see how we can come to terms and finally agree on the correct interpretation of the judgment.\n\n\u201cSome features are mentioned, and we intend to go physical on ground because some of these areas were skipped previously because of security challenges in those areas,\u201d saying until these are resolved, embarking on demarcation exercise would be futile.\n\nAlleged invasion of Koja\n\nConfirming an attempt to embark on placement of pillars and subsequent demarcation exercise at Koja comprising eight villages in Mubi local government area of Adamawa state, which had generated riotous resistance from indigenes, the NBC said the exercise was conducted in error because Koja was one of the areas under border demarcation restriction.\n\nAlarm by villagers\n\nA contractor, led by a UN team, had gone there to carry out some exercise in connection with pillar placement.\n\nHe, was however, strongly resisted by the indigenes who thought Cameroon had invaded Nigeria and rightly raised the alarm.\n\n\u201cThe contractor was awarded a contract to replace pillars in about nine or so of the pillars to assist in defining the demarcation of the boundary. Of course, the contractor would want to carry out his assignment. But unknown to the contractor that the area had been segmented and we had agreed that it should be left outside whatever we want to do now, until he is properly informed.\n\n\u201cNow, the issue of Koja is one area that has been isolated as a yet- to-be resolved disagreement area. So, it was a mistake on the part of the team that went on ground to even attempt to place pillars in that sector. It was the attempt to replace pillars that agitated the communities and they rioted. So it was not an invasion, we should not call it invasion,\u201d Adaji said.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria-Cameroon border is defined by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and both countries were in the process of implementing the decisions of the ICJ.\n\n\u201cIt is surprising that some people termed what happened recently as invasion. It is not an invasion, because the Cameroonian government will not for any reason want to invade Nigeria and vice versa.\n\n\u201cIt is worthy to note that the story of invasion is not true. We are at the moment implementing the decisions of the ICJ by placing pillars to ensure that the boundary is visible and recognizable,\u201d he further added.\n\nNigeria demands Cameroon concession\n\nLast November (2021), Nigeria had asked the Cameroonian government to make some compromise in its ongoing boundary demarcation issue with her.\n\nAttorney-General of the Federation Abubakar Malami (SAN), who led the Nigerian team to the 33rd Session of the United Nations Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed Commission (CNMC) in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon, had assured the Cameroonian government of Nigeria\u2019s readiness to bring lasting solution to the dispute.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that it has been a long walk to peace, but for us, it is still better than war between brothers over land and or maritime boundary disputes.\n\n\u201cI look forward to seeing genuine strides recorded by both states in the submitted SCD report to the CNMC encapsulated in international best practice tools of horse trading, give and take, esprit de corps, fraternity and brotherhood where there would be \u2018no Victor no Vanquished\u2019.\n\n\u201cNigeria has demonstrated special concessions in the engagement that gave rise to the success recorded. We remain committed and urge for reciprocity,\u201d Malami had said, noting further \u201cwe as participants, must do all we could as brothers to foster unbreakable peace to our Affected Populations.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Cameroon had made a request which could result in Nigeria losing not only a few portions of her landmass but some parts of many local government areas largely from Adamawa, Borno and Cross River, among others.\n\nThe areas of dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon include the Bakassi Peninsula and stretches up to Lake Chad areas.\n\nOn numerous occasions, the Cameroonian military had forcefully attempted to claim these areas leading to an altercation with the Nigeria Military in 1994 under late General Sani Abacha regime.\n\nConsequently, Cameroon, which had met unexpected crushing resistance, sought solace from the ICJ and received a favourable ruling in 2002, while implementation of the flag hoisting in the ceded areas began in 2004.\n\nSince then, conflicting understanding and interpretations as well as demand for compromise across board have hindered speedy conclusion of the implementation of the ruling.",

He claimed he was contacted by someone in Brazil to receive Udogwu and lead him to Lagos for a fee of N100,000. Uchechukwu Onwugbufor was at the Airport with his neighbour, Nwogu Ezimadu, who is equally being investigated to determine if he\u2019s complicit in the crime or not\u201d.\n\nAt the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, NAIA, Abuja, a Psychology graduate of Imo State University, Owerri, Sebastine Emeka Kelvin, (30-years-old), was arrested with 74 pellets of cocaine weighing 1.454kg on arrival aboard Ethiopian Airline flight enroute Doula- Addis Ababa-Abuja on Wednesday, April 13.\n\n\u201cThe father of one who claimed he\u2019s a motor spare parts dealer is from Ezeagu in Ezeagu LGA, Enugu state. He said he\u2019s lived in Cameroon for six years before going into the drug business to raise money to boost his trade. He added that he was introduced to the man who gave him the drugs at Addis Ababa by another person serving jail term for drug offence at the Doula Newbell Prison,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn Lagos, another Brazil-based passenger, Uba Samuel was arrested at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, MMIA, by NDLEA operatives on Friday, April 15, on arrival aboard Ethiopian Airline flight from Sao Paulo via Addis Ababa to Lagos with sachets of cocaine weighing 633grams concealed in his footwear and toothpaste tube.\n\nWhile accepting ownership of the drug, the suspect who claimed to be a cobbler from Abia State, said he used his shoe-making knowledge to conceal the drug in his pair of sandals.\n\nUba who is a regular traveller confessed he bought the drug to sell at a market in Abia.\n\nMeanwhile, more illicit substances were recovered in raid operations in other parts of the country. In Gadaka village of Fika LGA, Yobe state, operatives arrested one Hassan Usman with a total of 22, 110 tablets of Tramadol, D5 and Exol 5, while one Ali Mohammed was nabbed in a commercial vehicle coming from Kano to Maiduguri with 40 blocks of cannabis weighing 33kg.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s U-17 girls on Sunday maintained a good position for the final round of the African qualification series for this year\u2019s FIFA U-17 Women\u2019s World Cup after a convincing 4-0 victory over Egypt at the MKO Abiola National Stadium, Abuja.\n\nDefender Tumininu Adeshina flashed a shot into the side-netting in the 13th minute before the team\u2019s leading scorer Opeyemi Ajakaiye got spectators screaming with a snapshot after controlling the ball with her chest outside the eighteen\u2013yard box. She came close to scoring but the ball was slightly off target.\n\nAdeshina again shot above target in the 20th minute, before Ajakaiye scored her fourth goal of the qualifiers with an angled shot that beat goalkeeper Habbiba El Taher fair and square in the 28th minute.\n\nThree minutes later, the ever-busy Laila Zaher got the better of the Nigeria defence and forced goalkeeper Faith Omilana into a save, before the ball was cleared from danger.\n\nNigeria would not relent and forward Omowunmi Bello headed home the second goal in the 39th minute from a corner kick by Tumininu Adeshina.\n\nIn the second half, Ajakaiye meandered her way past the Egyptian defence in the 46th minute but Judith Okah just failed to utilize the opportunity. Eight minutes later, defender Miracle Usani found herself with the ball just outside the Egyptian box after everyone had missed from a corner kick and slammed past goalkeeper El Taher for Nigeria\u2019s third.\n\nIn the 62nd minute, Bello again showed immense composure to lift the ball above onrushing El Taher, after she had been brilliantly played-in by the excellent Taiwo Afolabi on a counterattack.\n\nBello had two more opportunities to claim a hat-trick but missed narrowly from close range, just as Ajakaiye fluffed a good opportunity with 14 minutes left.\n\nBoth teams clash again in Cairo on April 30th. The winner will most likely play Ethiopia in the final round of the series for a ticket to the FIFA World Cup in India.",

          "title": "2023 Presidency: Gov Yahaya Bello is APC\u2019s best bet",
          "text": "The Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Organisation says the governor Yahaya Bello possesses all the attributes that can retain the presidency for the ruling All Progressives Congress in 2023.\n\nThe Director, Media and Publicity of the Campaign Organisation, Yemi Kolapo, added that the well experienced and accomplished leaders of the party would not sacrifice Bello\u2019s winning attributes for \u201cdestructive\u201d politics.\n\nShe said this in a statement she signed and made available to journalists on Friday.\n\nAccording to her, the party, in its wisdom, knows that, after eight years, it must present that candidate that can win the next election, considering the \u201cwe against them\u201d attitude of citizens in many countries to the government of the day, which usually makes retaining power, under a free and fair environment, difficult.\n\nHighlighting the attributes that distinguished Governor Bello as the candidate to beat, the media directorate said aside from Bello\u2019s plethora of obvious achievements in Kogi State, he enjoyed the massive support of Nigerian women and youths, which must not be ignored, considering their numerical strength.\n\nHis uncommon loyalty to the President, his colleagues, and allies, among others, as well as his clean records as regards the issue of betrayal of any form, among others, were some of the attributes listed in his favour.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe stage is almost set for Nigerians to, once again, choose the leaders that will steer the affairs of the nation at all levels for another four years. But before the general elections, the struggle is within the parties, and in that regard, many have put their hats in the ring.\n\n\u201cThe presidential race in the ruling All Progressives Congress is populated by known heavyweights in Nigeria\u2019s politics, and in the next few weeks, depending on what the party decides, all aspirants that have had the courage to declare so far and those still preparing to do so, would have to jostle for just one ticket.\n\n\u201cSome groups have even almost concluded that this ticket belongs to a particular zone as a result of some prior unwritten agreement, but those who have the interest of the nation at heart have said, times without number, that there is no zoning in the constitution of the party, and more importantly, that the best must get the job, regardless of his zone, if the wellbeing of the country is the target.\n\n\u201cOn the 2nd of April 2022, His Excellency, Governor of Kogi State, Alhaji Yahaya Adoza Bello, formally declared to run for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023 under the platform of the APC. In his signature bold manner, the declaration ceremony at the Eagle Square, Abuja, has been described, even by unrelenting critics as the first-of-its-kind in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis was even more significant because, while others veiled their declaration under other programmes, others, afraid to test their popularity the way of Governor Bello, settled for video recordings of their declaration speeches.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed commendable that despite the fears that there would be an irreversible crack in the APC after the last Convention, the party, under the able leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, proved naysayers wrong and had a rancour-free exercise, which has produced leaders of note to man the different offices in the party.\n\n\u201cThe party, in its wisdom, knows that, after eight years, it must present that candidate that can win the next election, considering the \u201cwe against them\u201d attitude of citizens in many countries to the government of the day, which usually makes retaining power, under a free and fair environment, difficult for incumbents. There are, however, many reasons the choice of Yahaya Bello would make the journey easier for the ruling party.\n\n\u201cThe party needs a candidate that can connect massively with women and youths, considering their combined numerical strength and that candidate is no other than Governor Yahaya Bello.\n\n\u201cThe preference of Nigerians, regardless of tribe, religion or party affiliation, for a younger leader is also very clear. Of the pool of aspirants, as the country stands today, even across party lines, Governor Yahaya Bello is the best bet for the younger generation if this dream must be actualized.\n\n\u201cThis consideration has made millions of youths across Nigeria resolve to put their numbers behind the Governor, and this is verifiable with the number of active youths with PVCs currently on the Bello Ambassadors Network, Rescue Nigeria Mission, and Yahaya Bello Network, among many other support groups.\n\n\u201cAgain, the North-Central, where Governor Bello comes from, has not produced a democratically elected president in the history of Nigeria, and so, irrespective of what people are made to believe, they will support their own when it is time to take a stand. The North Central believes strongly that the time for them to occupy the Aso Rock Villa is now. Being the strongest contender from the region places Governor Bello in a vantage position to clinch the presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cYahaya Bello is an acclaimed unifier. It is a well known fact that, for the first time in the history of Kogi State, the sharp, bitter division between the three major ethnic groups gave way to unity and harmony under the Governor. He united the tribes, starting from his cabinet, and today, everyone is first a Kogi indigene before being identified with his ethnic group. Nigeria needs a unifier now more than ever.\n\n\u201cThe Governor is ever ready to build on the President\u2019s efforts in this regard. How he turned the state from a notorious state, where kidnappers and criminals built empires, to one of the safest in Nigeria today and, conveniently, the safest in the north, is a question that has been on the lips of many Nigerians. Therefore, in terms of the main issues confronting the nation, Governor Yahaya Bello has excelled remarkably in Kogi State.\n\n\u201cThe loyalty of Governor Bello to the leader of the party, President Muhammadu Buhari, has often been described by critics as \u201cannoying\u201d, but this is the stuff our aspirant is made of. He is loyal to his friends, colleagues and allies, and more so, to the APC. He has demonstrated this on so many occasions, even in very difficult situations. He has no record of betrayal to his party members and his principles. He is a fair game player.\n\n\u201cThe current well experienced and accomplished party leaders would definitely not sacrifice these laudable attributes for \u201cdestructive\u201d politics. They will rally round Governor Yahaya Bello and retain the presidency with a wide margin come 2023.\u201d",

          "title": "Russia Sets Deadline for Ukraine Troops in Mariupol to Surrender",
          "text": "Russia told Ukrainian forces fighting in Mariupol to lay down arms on Sunday morning to save their lives, but there were no immediate reports of activity three hours after the ultimatum took effect at 0300 GMT in the strategic southeastern port.\n\nAir raid sirens sounded across the country early in the day, a regular occurrence, and a morning report from the Ukrainian military said Russian air strikes on Mariupol continued while there were \u201cassault operations near the seaport.\u201d\n\nLocal media reported an explosion in the capital Kyiv but Mykola Povoroznyk, the city\u2019s deputy mayor, said there were no explosions and air defence systems had prevented Russian attacks.\n\nRussia\u2019s Defence Ministry said its troops had cleared the urban area of Mariupol and only a small contingent of Ukrainian fighters remained in a giant steelworks on Saturday.\n\nMoscow\u2019s claim to have all but taken control of Mariupol, scene of the war\u2019s heaviest fighting and worst humanitarian catastrophe, could not be independently verified. It would be the first major city to have fallen to Russian forces since the Feb. 24 invasion.\n\n\u201cTaking into account the catastrophic situation that has developed at the Azovstal metallurgical plant, as well as being guided by purely humane principles, the Russian Armed Forces offer the militants of nationalist battalions and foreign mercenaries from 06:00 (Moscow time) on April 17, 2022, to stop any hostilities and lay down their arms,\u201d the defence ministry said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAll who lay down their arms are guaranteed that their lives will be spared,\u201d it said, adding that the defenders could leave the plant by 10 a.m. without arms or ammunition.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Kyiv.\n\nThe Azovstal plant, described as a fortress in a city, lies in an industrial area that looks out to the Sea of Azov and covers more than 11 square km (4 square miles), containing myriad buildings, blast furnaces and rail tracks.\n\nThe city\u2019s defenders include Ukrainian marines, motorised brigades, a National Guard brigade and the Azov Regiment, a militia created by far-right nationalists that was later incorporated into the National Guard. It was not immediately known how many were in the steelworks.\n\n\u201cThe situation is very difficult\u201d in Mariupol, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the Ukrainska Pravda news portal. \u201cOur soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis\u2026 Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian military said Russian warplanes that took off from Belarus had fired missiles at the Lviv region near the Polish border and four cruise missiles were shot down by Ukrainian air defences.\n\nThe western city, relatively unscathed so far, has served as a haven for refugees and international aid agencies.\n\nTWISTED STEEL, BLASTED CONCRETE\n\nIn Mariupol, Reuters journalists reached the giant Illich steelworks, one of two metals plants where defenders had held out in underground tunnels and bunkers. Moscow claimed to have captured it on Friday.\n\nThe factory was reduced to a ruin of twisted steel and blasted concrete, with no sign of defenders present. Several bodies of civilians lay scattered on nearby streets.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said its troops had \u201ccompletely cleared\u201d Mariupol\u2019s urban area of Ukrainian forces and blockaded the \u201cremnants\u201d in the Azovstal steelworks, RIA news agency said. It said that as of Saturday, Ukrainian forces in the city had lost more than 4,000 personnel.\n\nZelenskiy accused Russia of \u201cdeliberately trying to destroy everyone\u201d in Mariupol and said his government was in touch with the defenders.

          "text": "Three Senior Advocates of Nigeria, Chief Mike Ozekhome, Mr. Femi Falana and Mr. Jibrin Okutepa, have faulted the state pardon granted to former Governors Joshua Dariye of Plateau State and Jolly Nyame of Taraba State, and called on President Muhammadu Buhari to pardon other thieves in prison.\n\nThe former governors, who were jailed for corruption, were pardoned alongside 157 others at the Council of State meeting presided over by President Buhari on Thursday.\n\nThe action by the government, has however come under strong criticisms by many Nigerians, including Ozekhome.\n\nOzekhome, in faulting the action of the president queried the basis for granting the pardon when the charge of corruption upon which they were convicted is not only a bane in the country but \u201cstruts around imperiously like a peacock\u201d.\n\nIn a statement titled: \u2018Legal and Moral Implications of Granting Pardon to Ex-convicts and Serving Prisoners,\u2019 the senior lawyer was of the opinion that the decision to free the two governors who are still serving their jail terms was not in the interest of the people and capable of dampening the confidence of the citizenry in the national moral fabric, and in the fight against corruption.\n\nHe said: \u201cBy granting pardon to these treasury looters, Buhari is reviving, nurturing and watering corruption with state powers\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo, when the Council of State recently authorised the pardon of 159 convicts, including Senator Joshua Dariye of Plateau State and ex-Governor Jolly Nyame of Taraba State, who were both imprisoned for stealing N1.16 billion and N1.6 billion, respectively, many Nigerians justifiably showed anger, because these two political leaders had been duly tried and convicted for stealing money belonging to their respective states\u201d, he said.\n\nThe senior lawyer maintained that the purpose of criminal prosecution is to secure justice, not only for the accused, but also for the victims of crimes and the state; and to some extent get reparation and restitution for the victims, while deterring others from going the same route.\n\n\u201cWhere lies the justice for the impoverished people of Plateau and Taraba States who will now watch their tormentors stroll out with red carpet treatment?\n\n\u201cThe government budgets huge sums of money for the prosecution of such accused persons from the tax players\u2019 sweat; and if after the rigorous period of trial and subsequent conviction, the guilty are simply let off the hook in such a brazen manner, the little remaining lean hope the citizens have in the system is further diminished\u201d, he added.\n\nWhile stating that both the president and the Council of State goofed and abused their undoubted constitutional powers and privileges, Ozekhome explained that a constitutional issue as volatile as this could have been better managed if the minders of the president had told him the embarrassment this could cause the government in the estimation of the comity of nations.\n\nSimilarly, Falana, speaking during the one year remembrance programme for the late Publicity Secretary of the Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Yinka Odumakin, described the release of the former governors as discriminatory.\n\nHe stressed that it was wrong to grant state pardon to the two of them who were convicted for stealing state funds.\n\nFalana said under the 1999 constitution, there is equality for all citizens, adding that the state pardon has to be extended to all thieves and criminals serving jail terms in various prisons.\n\nHe said, \u201cMy reaction is that all criminals, all thieves and criminals in our prisons should be released.\n\n\u201cBecause Section 17 of the Constitution says there shall be equality, equal rights for all citizens and section 42 said there shall be no discrimination on the basis of class, gender, whatever, so you can\u2019t take out two people and leave the rest there. It\u2019s illegal.\u201d\n\nHe said he might be forced to ask lawyers whose clients are still in prison to go to court and challenge the discriminatory treatment.\n\nFalana suggested that the 1999 constitution should be referred to as decree 24 of 1999 as \u201cit was not duly signed.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat the National Assembly has continued to do is to amend illegality. The so-called 1999 constitution is really decree 24 of 1999. When you see the so-called constitution, you will not see the signature of the man who signed the law, that\u2019s the fraud.\n\n\u201cWhen you see a law, the name of the person who signed it should be there with the date.\n\n\u201cDecree 24 of 1999 was promulgated by General Abdulsalami Abubakar on the 5th of May 1999 but today you will not see his name on it. It\u2019s a fraudulent document.\n\n\u201cThe decree was imposed on us by the last set of military dictators in Nigeria headed by Gen. Abubakar and because that document is okay for members of the ruling class regardless of their political parties, ethnic, regional or religious inclination, they are all comfortable with the document so they can\u2019t do anything about it including all those we are campaigning today to be President.\n\n\u201cIt is to retain the status quo and perhaps adjust it here and there, that is the only thing they are saying, so those who are contesting particularly on the platform of the ruling party are saying we are going to continue the programme of the Buhari administration that has put our country in problem.\n\n\u201cNigeria has become a huge joke in the committee of nations and so for any set of people to say they want to package his rickety vehicle and begin to panel beat it, it\u2019s not going to move.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Okutepa faulted the presidential pardon granted to Dariye and Nyame.\n\nHe wondered why president Buhari granted the pardon despite his lamentations that corruption is affecting Nigeria\u2019s growth.\n\nWhile speaking during an interview, he said: \u201cWe are all aware of the reasons they were arraigned and found guilty by the Supreme Court. They are politically exposed people in our society.\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest things that has retarded the growth of Nigeria today is corruption. It is the best enterprise in Nigeria today. So, when I heard that Buhari agreed to pardon the ex-governors, I weep for this country. The reason is that the mantra for which this person came to power is that of corruption.\n\n\u201cThe duty of the Nigerian government is to fight and eradicate corruption. Corruption has become so cancerous and all hands must be on deck to fight it. I am so upset by the decision because the ex-governor of Plateau State has his appeal dismissed in March 2021 by the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIn this country, the executive had on a series of occasions said that one of the things affecting the fight against corruption is the judiciary, so if the judiciary, therefore, enforces the provisions of the law and sends the ex-governors to prison, why does the executive sabotage its own law.\u201d\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja",

          "text": "As the strike embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) entered its 61st day on Saturday, the federal government\u2019s move to renegotiate a deal reached with the university lecturers has witnessed a setback.\n\nThis followed the insistence by ASUU that the government should first pay the accrued N200 billion revitalisation fund for revamping the dilapidated infrastructure in the various institutions before it calls off the strike or engage in further negotiations.\n\nThe federal government had disclosed that it had set up a renegotiation committee to dialogue further with the lecturers to amend the earliest proposals in line with current economic realities.\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, who stated the government\u2019s position at a recent function in Abuja, said the renegotiation of conditions of service of the university lecturers, must be guided by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) principle of ability to pay.\n\nNgige said the former renegotiation committee headed by Prof. Jubril Munzali proposed a 200 per cent rise in the emoluments of university workers, which the federal government cannot pay.\n\nSpeaking to THISDAY on the telephone on Saturday, the President of ASUU, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke, argued that the May 2021 agreement is still sacrosanct and should be implemented for sanity to return to the tertiary institutions.\n\nWhen asked whether anything has been done to address their demands, Osodeke said: \u201cNo progress yet. It is still the same thing.\u201d\n\nReacting to the statement by the federal government that it had set up a renegotiating team led by Prof. Nimi Briggs to meet with ASUU on its demands, Osodeke said: \u201cWe have finished negotiations and we are expecting them to either sign it and implement or reject it but they have not done anything.\u201d\n\nWhen THISDAY drew his attention to the statement made by Ngige that the federal government could not sign the proposal because it has no money to implement, Osodeke said: \u201cIf they don\u2019t have the money, they will find. We will not renegotiate it. Why will they say that they don\u2019t have the money when they can have N4 trillion to fund fuel subsidies and you don\u2019t have N200 billion for your universities. Does it make any sense?\n\n\u201cIf they can raise N4 trillion to give to some people in the name of so-called fuel subsidy and then you cannot raise N200 billion to stop the strike and get our children back to school, does it make sense to anybody? So it is just setting the priorities right. Why not take N200 billion out of the N4 trillion fuel subsidy money and end this strike?\u201d he queried.\n\nOsodeke however said that the most critical issue is the payment of the revitalisation fund and the salary of the lecturers.\n\n\u201cAs we speak now, a professor in the country goes home monthly with only $600 while a senator goes home monthly with almost N18 million. How do you justify that? How will the $600 feed the professor and still be able to take care of his research work?\u201d he asked.\n\nSpeaking on the negotiations for improved salary for university staff, the ASUU president said that the government was yet to come up with any proposal on that.\n\nAccording to him, ASUU met last week with the federal government\u2019s renegotiation team but the government failed to come up with any proposal.\n\n\u201cSo, we are still waiting for them to bring their proposal of the conditions of salaries of lecturers,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen also asked if ASUU\u2019s position on salary increase, Osodeke insisted that the union concluded negotiations and a figure already agreed on with the government in May 2021.\n\n\u201cSo, we are not looking for any other one, we already have that one but they did not agree, they should come up with the one they have. Will it take one year to do that?\u201d\n\nWhile tracing the origin of the dispute on revitalisation fund, Osodeke said it was a panel set up by the government that recommended that it should invest N1.3 trillion in Nigerian universities to revamp it to the expected standards.\n\nHe said that based on the recommendations, the Jonathan-led administration had released N200 billion.\n\n\u201cSince that time, this government has only released N70 billion, when they were to release N200 billion every year. This is why our universities are lagging behind today and we don\u2019t have any foreign students or lecturers as before because the standard of our laboratories and equipment are not enough to attract anybody from other parts of the world,\u201d he said.\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",
