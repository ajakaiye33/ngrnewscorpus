          "title": "51 days after, resident doctors vow to continue strike",
          "text": "The National Association of Resident Doctors has insisted that it will not call off its ongoing strike until its demands are met.\n\nThe association said this despite the Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire\u2019s meeting with its leadership on Monday.\n\nThe PUNCH learnt that Monday was the first time Ehanire was meeting the leadership of NARD without the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, since the strike started 51 days ago.\n\nBefore now, Ngige has been the one spearheading meetings with representatives of NARD in a bid to end the strike.\n\nThe Secretary General of NARD, Dr Jerry Isogun, confirmed the meeting with Ehanire in an interview with The PUNCH on Tuesday.\n\nIsogun said, \u201cThe minister (Ehanire) met with us for the first time on Monday, without the presence of the minister of labour and employment.\n\n\u201cHe spoke to us and explained some things to us and said he was working really hard to make sure that issues were resolved.\n\n\u201cWe also shared our grievances with him. He listened and he said he would get back to us and make sure that everything is resolved.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the association had faith in Ehanire and if the strike would be called off immediately, the NARD secretary said, \u201cOf course, we trust him and we believe he is going to do as he promised.\n\n\u201cLike I said, that was the first time he was meeting us and he had promised to get back. Though he didn\u2019t say when he would do so.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we are calling off the strike immediately. Our position still holds. Pay us our money and rectify all the outstanding issues and then strike will be called off.\u201d\n\nThe NARD declared the strike action on July 30 at its National Executive Council meeting with the theme \u2018The Nigerian doctor, an endangered species: grappling with a pandemic, poor workplace infrastructure and security threats.\u2019\n\nAnnouncing that the action would begin on August 2 after the meeting held in Umuahia, Abia State, the National President of NARD, Dr Okhuaihesuyi Uyilawa, cited the failure of the Federal Government to implement the agreements it signed with the union 113 days after it suspended the previous strike as the reason for the fresh strike.\n\nSome of the demands include the migration of doctors from the GIFMIS (the government integrated financial management system) platform to the IPPIS (Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System) platform, review of hazard allowance, inconsistency in payment of salaries, death allowances for members of the association who died during COVID-19.\n\nIn a related development, members of the House of Representatives on Tuesday lamented that public hospitals in the country had been deserted because of the strike by NARD.\n\nThe House Committee on Health Institutions led by Pascal Obi raised this concern when the committee visited the Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital, Aro, Abeokuta, as part of its oversight functions.\n\nThe House committee toured the medical centre and visited projects such as the isolation centre, the intensive care unit and the molecular laboratory.\n\nObi urged doctors and the Federal Government to embrace compromise so as to make healthcare accessible to the masses.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn the issue of the strike by the resident doctors, the matter is before a court of competent jurisdiction and the court will definitely do justice to it, but I am calling for compromise both from the side of the Federal Government and the side of the union of the doctors who are on strike.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis what should be done in the interest of the patients because now, the hospitals have all been deserted. The resident doctors are the ones doing most of the jobs in the hospitals.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Ultimatum: No response from Federal Govt, says ASUU",
          "text": "The Academic Staff Union of Universities on Tuesday said the ultimatum it issued in July did not elicit any response from the Federal Government.\n\nThe National President of ASUU, Professor Emmanuel Oshodeke, in an interview with one of our correspondents, stated that government had not implemented the agreement it reached with the union nor responded to the ultimatum.\n\nThe union had on July 19 issued a fresh ultimatum to the Federal Government to pay the outstanding 10-month arrears of its members\u2019 salaries or be prepared for another industrial action.\n\nThe union gave government till August 31 to meet its demands including the resolution of issues relating to the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System platform.\n\nBetween September 10 and September, 2021, all ASUU zones across the country held press conferences calling on the government to implement their demands.\n\nThey also asked Nigerians to hold the Federal Government responsible if the university lecturers embarked on another strike.\n\nResponding to enquiries by The PUNCH on Tuesday, ASUU president said, \u201cNothing yet, not a single response from the government. For now, we are in Abuja we are meeting soon. No single response from the government. We are meeting this weekend in Abuja. We want to see what we can do between now and Friday to see them. Despite the letter we wrote to them and the press conferences, they are not bothered because nothing is at stake for them.\u201d\n\nThe union had accused the government of not implementing the agreement it signed with lecturers in December 2020.\n\nIn March 2020, ASUU embarked on a strike action following its disagreement with the Federal Government over the funding of the universities, the IPPIS, implementation of the University Transparency Accountability Solution, funding and revitalisation of public universities, earned academic allowances, promotion arrears and renegotiation of 2009 ASUU-FGN Agreement\n\nASUU had several meetings with government over UTAS and all the above issues were approved with a promise of prompt implementation.\n\nThe Federal Government\u2019s assurance of implementation, which was accompanied with the signing of a Memorandum of Action led to the call off of the strike on December 24, 2020 after government also agreed to exclude ASUU from IPPIS.\n\nSpeaking at the ASUU-Lagos zone press conference, zonal coordinator, Dr Adelaja Odukoya, said the arrogance with which government had continued to wish away the collective sacrifice of their members, students and parents on the struggles was frustrating.\n\nOdukoya said government\u2019s failure to ensure prompt renegotiation of the 2009 Agreement had consciously \u201csentenced\u201d ASUU members \u201cto agonising poverty, encouraged brain drain and criminally promoted falling standard of education in the country.\u201d\n\nFG not shunning ASUU, says minister\n\nBut in his response, the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, denied claims by ASUU that the Federal Government had been shunning its leadership.\n\nThe minister, in an interview with one of our correspondents, said there was no way ASUU leaders would reach out the government and nobody would attend to them.\n\nOn some of the demands made by ASUU in its ultimatum issued to the government which has elapsed, Nwajiuba insisted that the National Universities Commission was working on them and announcement would be made once the assignment had been completed.\n\nHe said, \u201cNo one is shunning ASUU. Ask them who they reached out to. I picked your call, didn\u2019t I?\n\n\u201cWe have already said the NUC is working on the issues with the universities, once they are done, they will issue a statement.\n\n\u201cThere is no way ASUU will reach out and nobody will attend to them.\n\n\u201cThe message is simple. The NUC is working on the issues raised, the moment they are done, a statement will be issued to let everybody be aware of the situation on the ground.\n\nEKSU ASUU opposes slashed subvention, gives 48 hours strike notice\n\nIn a related development, ASUU in Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti on Tuesday gave the university council and management 48 hours within which to act on its demands contained in its letter dated 16th September 16 risk an industrial action by the lecturers.\n\nASUU EKSU Chairman, Dr Kayode Arogundade, said the union would give the council and management two weeks within which to meet the demands in case the governing council discussed the letter at its Tuesday meeting, failure which would result in withdrawal of services by the academic staff.\n\nArogundade frowned upon the state government\u2019s slash of the monthly subvention to the university from N260m to N130m and unpaid salaries and arrears to academic staff members, whom he said could not continue to work under such harrowing conditions.\n\nThe demands of ASUU, in the letter titled, \u2018ASUU-EKSU position on government decision to reduce monthly subvention to EKSU for speculative reasons,\u2019 signed by ASUU EKSU Chairman, Arogundade and Secretary, Dr Daniel Ogunwale, included \u201cimmediate reversal of monthly subvention to EKSU to N260 million\u201d.\n\nASUU also demanded \u201crefund of N624m to the purse of EKSU by the state government being the differential in subvention payments to the university since April, 2021\u201d.\n\nThe academic staff also sought \u201cimmediate administrative trial (for alleged administrative infractions) of all alleged actors as contained in the DSS (Department of State Services) report pending determination of their financial involvement in the alleged fraud.\u201d\n\nThey also demanded that \u201cthe university bursar should be questioned for leading a team that is constantly misleading the University towards taking wrong financial decisions\u201d and t\u201cautomation of the university bursary should be done without further delay. More so that the contractor had since received advance payment for the project\u201d.\n\nIn the letter, the academic staff asserted that \u201cthe reduction of monthly subvention to EKSU since April, 2021 was based on mere speculation and an act of policy inconsistency and disservice to players in the educational sector.\u201d\n\nASUU, in the letter also posited that \u201cthe claim that Ekiti State started experiencing a drop in monthly allocation from FAAC (Federation Accounts Allocation Committee) effective from April 2021 is a blatant lie, instead, the state had experienced steady improvement in monthly allocation and steady growth in the IGR since then\u201d.\n\nThe union lampooned the governor, saying he was not fair to education with the slash in subvention, adding, \u201cHe stands out as the only governor who reduced monthly subvention to university in his state during the period under coverage and till date\u201d.\n\nArogundade who said there was nothing that required extra investment in the demands, said, \u201cIt just requires faithfulness and sincerity of purpose. If nothing is done to this document in the next 48 hours, we are going to shut down this university and all of us will be outside. If they are going to sack all of us, let them go ahead. We are tired of their rigmarole\u201d.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Corruption: How NPA, TTP, others unholy alliance causing gridlock along Oshodi-Apapa Expressway, environs",
          "text": "File: Gridlock as tankers shut down Apapa road.\n\n.As stakeholders pass buck\n\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni, Kingsley Adegboye, Godwin Oritse, Godfrey Bivbere, Providence Adeyinka, Prisca Achonu, and Nelson Alu\n\nDespite several interventions by relevant authorities, persistent gridlock along Apapa Expressway, inward ports access roads, and environs, occasioned by activities of truckers and other articulated vehicles has been attributed to corrupt practices and policies by Nigerian Ports Authority, and its agent, Terminal Truck Park, TTP, operators.\n\nHowever, stakeholders in the port operations have continued to pass the buck on one another as the cause of the intractable gridlock in the axis.\n\nStakeholders in the port operations include: Council of Maritime Transport Unions and Association, COMTUA, Amalgamated Container Trucks Owners, The United Truckers Forum, UTF, National Association of Road Transport Owners, NARTO, National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders, NAGAFF, National Council of Managing Directors of Licensed Customs Agents, NCMDLCA, beRoad Transport Employer Association of Nigeria, RTEAN, Nigerian Police, Lagos State Traffic Management Authority, LASTMA, Federal Road Safety Corps, FRSC, among others.\n\nChairman, Special Traffic Management and Enforcement Compliance Team, who is also the Special Adviser to the Governor on Transportation, Oluwatoyin Fayinka, and Senior Special Assistant to the state governor on Traffic Team, Mr. Sola Giwa, have always put the blame on sharp practices by port managers and its agents as well as security personnel not under the control of the special team which was inaugurated in February, 2021 to restore normalcy and keep traffic flowing in Apapa and environs.\n\nUndoubtedly, the achievements and success story of the Presidential Task Team set up by President Muhammadu Buhari with the mandate to clear the Apapa gridlock, chaired by Vice-president, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, and coordinated by former Commissioner for Transportation in Lagos, comrade Kayode Opeifa, had been eroded by corrupt practices exhibited by various interests.\n\nAccording to Fayinka, a major challenge, is that the team sees corruption fighting back, because the people the traffic team has prevented from the regular corrupt practices are back spreading falsehood information about the team inorder to frustrate its efforts.\n\nWhile some have commended the team others have accused it of incompetence and lack of will power of enforcement.\n\nFayinka, faulted series of allegations of sharp practices levelled against the team in some quarters, saying that rather the team should be commended for work well done, restoring sanity and orderliness in Apapa.\n\nHe said the traffic gridlock was man-made adding that corruption was the reason for the gridlock \u201cand we are working hard to make it a thing of the past soon.\u201d.\n\nHe however said that the State Government was working round the to roads leading to free of traffic.\n\nLast Sunday, when the Oshodi-Apapa Expressway usually free, there was standstill situation due to the closure of NPA gate which resulted in uncontrolled influx of truckers subjecting other road users to untold hardships.\n\nIt was gathered that NPA and TTP are solely responsible for the calling of truckers to the port, either to drop containers or pick consignments, which attracts extra fees when operations are intentionally delayed.\n\n\n\nHow bad road worsens Apapa/Oshodi gridlock\n\nAll efforts to sanitise Apapa and its environs, and ensure free flow of traffic into and out of Apapa, the economic nerve centre and financial hub of Nigeria, may drag longer than expected, and this is why commuters, motorists and residents of Apapa cannot heave a sigh of relief yet due to poor state of the port access road, particularly by Sunrise area.\n\nVanguard\u2019s visit to Apapa, starting from Berger Yard of the Oahodi-Apapa Expressway yesterday, showed the terrible state of the ever busy expressway into and out of Apapa as a result of neglect of decades.\n\nOur findings revealed that the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway which links the Murtala Muhammed International Airport with two of the nation\u2019s busiest seaports of Apapa Wharf and Tin Can Island has failed beyond imagination at several locations which is one of the reasons for the persistent gridlock on the dual carriageway particularly inward Apapa axis.\n\nThe craters on the express have caused truck drivers, commuters, motorists and cyclists to make use of the service lane which condition is not as deplorable as the express. This is why vehicular movement into Apapa is sluggish and takes hours to navigate the chaotic traffic.\n\nThe condition of the road appears worsen as one moves more into Apapa, because between Ottor Wolf and Sunrise axis, a truck driver can wait for over an hour before he can move for a few second and stop. This situation is like this to Tin Can port. For the trucks going to Apapa port through Creek Road, the situation is even worse, as Creek Road is being reconstructed to Tin Can Island.\n\nThe worst portions are Berger Yard under bridge, Sunrise, Coconut area and Tin Can.\n\nThese failed portions have particularly worsened the agonies of motorists and commuters on the expressway on daily basis with traffic stretching several kilometres and lasting throughout the day.\n\nWith the rains, the road has become a no-go area for smaller cars and buses which could not wade through the flood on the expressway whenever it rains. Even the failed parts of the road have also continued to increase in size as the flood washes off most parts of the road.\n\nAs it is now, only trailers and heavy trucks with big tyres and axles could afford to wade through the road and it takes them over six hours or more to go through the distance of about one kilometer\n\nWe are paying heavily to terminal not port in Lagos \u2013 Truckers lament\n\n\u2026We pay N15,000 for sticker\n\nUTF has decried continued extortion at Kirikiri Lighter Terminal, KLT, claiming NPA policy created room for such unhealthy situation for truckers in Lagos state.\n\nThe forum said that their trucks are forced to pay N11 thousand at KLT using a POS on behalf of TTP.\n\nThe forum revealed that as a first step, the authority directed immediate stoppage of the payment arrangement which is outside the procedure laid down between the TTP and the NPA.\n\nThe forum said that the Ag MD of NPA ordered an investigation into the extortion being perpetrated at KLT, using TTP account following the revelation.\n\nThe truckers said that the Ag MD had, had a meeting with the forum to ensure truckers are charged only when approved structures are put in place, and that trucks plying the KLT corridor will continue to enjoy entry into KLT I & II without payment until such a time when the service provider installs infotech and physical infrastructures for such locations as required by the agreement guiding its operations.\n\nThey said that the authority will continue to work with stakeholders to review and rejig all processes and procedures to ensure value for all charges by it partners and third party service providers.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the forum, Taskforce Chairman of NARTO, Mr. Hassan Adekoya, said that NPA policy created a platform for terminal to be collecting money from truckers against their wish.\n\nAdekoya said, \u201cKLT is a terminal not port, it is like a bonded terminal that we accuse of collecting N150 thousand for empty container. NPA, TTP are denying that they are not collecting any money. NPA policy makes terminal to be collecting money from us. A terminal not port.\n\n\u201cIt is NPA policy that is creating problem for truckers, trucking business is an investment and not thuggery. NPA policy legalized extortion and made it possible on Lagos road even with account number,\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have written several petitions and nothing is coming out of it. One of NPA policy disturbing us is the stickers, for minimum standard, we pay N15 thousand and we have FRSC in charge of minimum standard, we pay all of these and yet there are vehicles without road worthiness.\n\n\u201cWe have paid over N400 million to NPA for sticker. We pay N10 thousand for sticker and N5 thousand for check up, which is N15 thousand in total.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo end extortion, NPA policies must be reviewed.\u201d\n\nStakeholders accuse Customs of contributing to the Mile2/Tin-can gridlock\n\nThe Federal Operations Unit, FOU, Zone A, of the Nigeria Customs Service, NCS has been accused of contributing to the gridlock along the Mile 2 \u2013 Tin-can port.\n\nSome stakeholders who spoke with Vanguard said that operatives of FOU, Zone A have about four points between Tin-can port and Mile 2 with different sets of operative collecting toll from already cleared consignments from both Tin-can and Apapa ports.\n\nThey gave the extortion spots on the bridge just before Cocoa-nut bus stop, West Minister bus stop, around Sunrise bus stop, Berger under bridge area, and Mile 2 bus stop.\n\nSpeaking with Vanguard, a truck driver who simply gave his name as Kunle Adebayo, said they collect between N10,000 to N50,000 from every container-laden truck as well as vehicles cleared from the port.\n\nAdebayo further stated that in the process of collecting the toll, they free flow of traffic is stalled.\n\nHe explained that there were times when the officials stop between five to 10 trucks during the peak period in the evenings \u201cas we have it now.\u201d (He spoke with Vanguard during an on-the-site visit by our reporter).\n\nThe President, NCMDLCA, Lucky Amiwero, described the alleged extortion as one of the biggest corruption in the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest forms of corruption is that Customs don\u2019t comply with the law. When you operate out of the law, it is the height of corruption.\u201d\n\nAmiwero said the Kyoto Convention, which aimed at facilitating trade by harmonising and simplifying customs procedures and practices, has not been complied with by NCS, noting that the service has many units, which contravenes the convention.\n\nAlso, former President of the NAGAFF, Eugene Nweke, lamented the level of extortion and exploitation at the ports.\n\n\u201cEvery form of extortion is an extra cost passed to the final consumers or the end-users of goods and services. When you extort, you are indirectly increasing the cost passed on to the poor masses.\u201d\n\nResponding, the Public Relations Officer of FOU, Zone A, Peter Duniya, has distance officials of the Unit from traffic griclock along that route.\n\nDuniya explained that Customs officers are performing their statutory duty and do not stop consignments leaving the port for stopping sake.\n\n\u201cIf you see any vehicle that is being stopped, that is done based on intelligence or based on information by suspicion. They don\u2019t just stop every vehicle, so they act based on information,\u201d he said.\n\nRecall that freight forwarders had during the heat of the #EndSARS protests shut down commercial activities at Tin Can Island Port, seeking an end to extortion by the Federal Operations Unit (FOU) of Nigeria Customs Service (NCS).\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",
          "summary": "File: Gridlock as tankers shut down Apapa road.\nAccording to Fayinka, a major challenge, is that the team sees corruption fighting back, because the people the traffic team has prevented from the regular corrupt practices are back spreading falsehood information about the team inorder to frustrate its efforts.\nHe said the traffic gridlock was man-made adding that corruption was the reason for the gridlock \u201cand we are working hard to make it a thing of the past soon.\u201d.\nFor the trucks going to Apapa port through Creek Road, the situation is even worse, as Creek Road is being reconstructed to Tin Can Island.\n\u201cIt is NPA policy that is creating problem for truckers, trucking business is an investment and not thuggery.",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, has advised his southern counterparts not to dissipate energy on anti-open grazing laws that cannot be implemented.\n\nSpeaking when he paid a short visit at the headquarters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Tuesday, Governor El-Rufai revealed that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has supported his state with N7.5 billion out of the N10 billion required to build a ranch.\n\nHe also disclosed that since there are over 14 grazing reserves in Kaduna State he would want to convert into ranching, he would be glad if the Federal Government can support his state with N140 billion to develop the 14 grazing reserves.\n\nThe Kaduna governor cautioned southern governors that it is unhelpful politicising grazing rights and passing legislation that they know cannot be implemented.\n\nAsked his take on the controversial law on open grazing, the governor said: \u2018The northern state governors forum has already taken a position that open grazing is not a sustainable way of livestock production. And we must move towards ranching.\n\n\u2018But moving towards ranching cannot be done overnight. We have to have a plan, we have to have resources and we have to implement it sensibly. It is not a matter of populist legislation or saying tomorrow this or that. It is not a solution.\n\n\u2018We have taken a position as northern state governors and we are implementing that.\n\n\u2018And in my state, for instance, we are developing a huge ranch to centralize the herders. And that is the solution, a long time. But can it be done overnight? No,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018This project we are doing will cost us about N10 billion. The CBN is supporting us with about N7.5 billion. And it will take about two years to do. We will be settling about 1,500 Fulani herder families.\n\n\u2018And I hope that they will see that there are alternative ways of producing livestock instead of running up and down with cattle going to people\u2019s farms to cause all kinds of problems. We want to solve the problem.\n\n\u2018What is unhelpful is to politicise the situation and pass legislation that you know that you cannot implement. So, we have taken a position and we are working round the clock to implement that position.\n\n\u2018And these herders emanate from the north and we are going to centralise them. We cannot do it overnight. We need billions of naira. This is just one ranch that is causing 10 billion. I have 14 grazing reserves in Kaduna State and I will like to convert them into ranching. Do I have 14 times 10 billion naira? I don\u2019t have.\n\n\u2018If the Federal Government will give me a hundred and fourteen billion, I will convert the other thirteen into ranches and make sure that nobody comes out with a cow or sheep in Kaduna State because I will have enough ranches to take care of everybody. That is the solution. You can legislate but let us wait and see. And I wish them the best of luck,\u2019 he said.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.",

The matter came up before the vacation judge, Justice KCJ Okereke.\n\nSpeaking to the media, Barrister Ejimakor expressed confidence in the capacity of the Abia High Court to uphold the law by enforcing Kanu\u2019s human rights.\n\n\u2018There is an unbroken chain of federal government\u2019s violations of Kanu\u2019s constitutional rights that started with the lethal military invasion of his home in Umuahia and his flight to safety in 2017 and his extraordinary rendition to Nigeria in late June 2021,\u2019 Ejimakor said.\n\nAt today\u2019s hearing, it emerged that out of the eight respondents, only two \u2013 the DSS in Abuja and Umuahia \u2013 have filed their reply to the suit but their processes were filed out of time. Nothing was received from the other six respondents, which includes the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the Attorney-General of the Federation and the Nigerian Army.\n\nIt also emerged that an apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, the Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) has filed an application seeking leave of the court to file an amicus (friend of court) brief in support of Kanu.\n\nBarrister Ejimakor appeared for Kanu in company of several lawyers, two of whom were introduced as Barristers Patrick Agazie and Wilson Kalu. Also in court to observe the proceedings was Mazi Igboayaka Igboayaka, the President of Ohanaeze Youths Worldwide, who told the media that he had come to demonstrate solidarity of Ohanaeze Youths with Nnamdi Kanu in the suit.\n\nIn making his ruling for adjournment of the matter, the judge noted that Kanu shall be entitled to certain reliefs against any party that fails to timely respond to the suit.\n\nWhen queried on the chances of success of the suit, Barrister Ejimakor drew some inspiration from the September 17 fundamental rights judgment of Oyo State High Court in favor of Sunday Adeyemo (Igboho) and against the Federal Government.\n\nEjimakor said that \u2018the Oyo State High Court judgment in Igboho\u2019s case (which is similar to Kanu) restates the locus classicus on the wide jurisdiction of state high courts when it comes to enforcement of the fundamental rights stipulated under the Nigerian Constitution and the African Charter.\u2019\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "From Isaac Anumihe (Abuja) Adewale Sanyaolu and Merit Ibe\n\nMore difficult times await Nigerians in the months ahead as the Federal Government yesterday announced it is ending the N30 billion monthly electricity subsidy by January 2022.\n\nThe decision is also to affect all forms of subsidies hitherto extended to operators in the power sector value chain.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the President on infrastructure, Ahmed Zakari, disclosed this at a stakeholders\u2019 engagement meeting, organised by the Nigerian Electricity Commission (NERC) in Lagos.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, had last July said the government expected the electricity sector to generate its revenue from the power sector market.\n\nThe VP noted that government would be investing over N43 billion in the coming years to improve transmission and distribution infrastructure across the country.\n\nThe power industry in Nigeria has reportedly been bugged down by claims of revenue shortfall allegedly due to a tariff regime that is \u201cnot cost reflective.\u201d Data from the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET) shows that the tariff being collected by DisCos is below 50 per cent of their invoices.\n\nThe Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors (ANED) had consistently lamented that the absence of of a cost reflective remained one of the major setbacks confronting the sector.\n\nZakari, stated that the \u201cFederal Government intends to reduce its interventions in the power sector and thus allow the electricity market forces to to determine the course of action.\u201d\n\nStakeholders have argued that allowing market operators to determine the course of action simply means that Nigerians are to pay the full commercial price for power as determined by the generating and distribution companies.\n\nOne of the participants at that public hearing and Executive Director, Center for Transparency & Accountability in the Energy Sector, Barrister Abel Godson, stated that, \u201cwith the deteriorating nature of electricity supply in the country, coupled with a deteriorating and ageing infrastructure within the electricity network, government\u2019s pre-occupation should be about stabilizing the market, and not tariff hike.\u201d He also maintained that, \u201cpromoting cost reflective tariff at a time where the country is battling one its worst forex regimes and high inflation rates, which affect the cost of goods and services, will be counterproductive.\n\n\u201cIf this current precarious situation is met with any form of hike in electricity tariff, then we can bid goodbye to any meaningful development in the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Federal Government and Organised Labour had gone into extensive discussions prior to the implementation of the Service Based Tarrif in November 2020, where the electricity regulator (NERC) had promised improvement in service delivery to Nigerians.\n\nZakari noted that Nigeria has one of the poorest supply of electricity despite the power sector contributing 78 per cent to GDP growth for Q2 2021.\n\nBut reacting to the planned hike in electricity tariff, President, Consumer Rights Advancement Organisation(CRADO), Chief Adeolu Ogunbanjo, said consumers will mobilise the Nigeria Labour Congress(NLC) against this insensitive pronouncement which is anti-people.\n\nAlso speaking, Mr Frank Onyebu, Chairman, MAN, Apapa branch said, \u201c I\u2019m not against the removal of subsidy , but we need to look at it in a better context.\n\nThere is so much inefficiency in the electricity industry leading to much of the power generated being wasted, while DisCos want consumers to pay for their inefficiency.\n\nIf they run their firms as expected, there won\u2019t be need for subsidy because I believe the current tariff which is already high is adequate. We are still talking about tariffs because the handlers are still looking at the industry as old \u2018NEPA\u2019. They are not running the industry as a private concern . If they run it efficiently as a private organisation, they will realise that there is no need for subsidy.\n\nThere is really no subsidy on electricity, efficiency needs ro be improved upon.\n\nIn his reaction, a lawyer and economy expert, Mr Eze Onyekpere, said he does not see any reason government should subsidise the inefficiency of the GenCos and DisCos with public fund, stressing that such funds should be channelled into productive consumption. \u201cWhat I am saying is that just as we supported the increase in VAT what we need to do is to free up resources for other infrastructure and development. And subsidy on electricity is one of the things that is taking the money which we don\u2019t even have. What I am advocating is conditional in terms of ensuring that these DisCos and GenCos and transmission company are run with the best corporate performance standard and run very efficiently. I am not actually advocating that Nigerians should subsidise the inefficiency of these companies.\n\n\u201cMy suggestion is for the citizens of this country to resist the companies whether through civil disobedience or litigation or media advocacy to ensure that they are run efficiently.\n\nFor his part former Director General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Indsuty, Mr Muda Yusuf, argues that the Nigerian power sector situation is a complicated one. \u201cGenerating the liquidity to feed the power supply chain remains a major challenge\u201d. It is all the more worrisome because we have seen significant adjustments in tariffs over the last two years. There is a large measure of discontent over the moves towards a cost effective tariff. Therefore, the push towards a full cost reflective tariff should be gradual to minimise the shocks on citizens and corporates. This has become even more necessary because of the frequency of tariff reviews that had taken place over the last one to two years.\u201d\n\nHe however noted that the challenge of collection and commercial losses appear intractable. The DisCos seem helpless in tackling this menace. The problem of estimated billing still persists generating serious ill feeling towards the DISCOs. The metering programme is not as fast as promised.\n\nThe transition to full cost recovery has to be a gradual thing. There are significant social and economic considerations to be reckoned with. In a statement to Daily Sun the LCCI noted that was still too early to offer a prognosis. However, what matters most is the availability of electricity to power our homes, industries, and offices. Comparably, the cost of providing diesel for industries is likely higher than the electricity supply from the national grid.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "*Says \u2018one north\u2019 assumption delusional\n\n*Advises region to put purported numerical strength to productive use\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe issue of rotational presidency sparked yet another debate yesterday following a boast at the weekend by Director of Publicity and Advocacy, Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, that the North could retain the country\u2019s presidency, irrespective of the South, if the region\u2019s numerical strength was factored in.\n\nBut the Southern and Middle Belt Alliance (SaMBA) dismissed the NEF spokesman\u2019s claim as both reckless and careless.\n\nSaMBA, in a statement by its spokesman, Rwang Pam Jnr, said the statement purportedly made on behalf of NEF, lacked basis. It wondered how NEF could resort to such lowly submission.\n\nBaba-Ahmed had on Saturday said the North was in the process of rebuilding itself and was not prepared to play second fiddle in a nation, where it enjoyed numerical strength. He stated this in a keynote address at the maiden edition of the Maitama Sule Lecture Series organised by the students\u2019 wing of the Coalition of Northern Groups at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria.\n\nBaba-Ahmed stated, \u201cWe will lead Nigeria the way we have led Nigeria before, whether we are president or vice president, we will lead Nigeria. We have the majority of the votes and democracy says vote whom you want. Why should we accept a second-class position when we know we can buy a form and contest for first class and we will win?\n\n\u201cWhy does anybody need to threaten us and intimidate us? We will get that power, but be humble, because power comes from God. We inherited leadership and being honest is not being stupid. The North has pride; we are humble enough to know that we are going to run Nigeria with other people, but we are not going to play a second fiddle to anybody.\n\n\u201cWe may not have the most robust economy, there are people, who are trying to strangulate us even more than we are being strangled. We are ready for this. We will consider every economic adversity, challenge. We will fix the northern economy and we are the only ones who can fix this northern economy. For that reason, we are not for sale. We are in the process of rebuilding the North and we will rebuild the North from 2023.\n\n\u201cWhether the North holds power in 2023 or not, anybody who wants to break up in this country will say so, they are just looking for excuses. This is democracy. If they don\u2019t like what Nigeria is, they will say they want to break up from this country, we don\u2019t pay attention to those people, we are focused on the fact that we are running a democratic system.\u201d\n\nHowever, responding, SaMBA said in astatement, \u201cLet Dr Baba-Ahmed be reminded that without the Middle Belt, such numbers boasted about in the North are mere political posturing. It is disheartening that Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed will make such reckless and careless statement at a time, when we are still battling to keep the country united.\n\n\u201cOne would have expected that the retired Permanent Secretary with his exposure and academic prowess, will choose his words carefully, but it is quite unfortunate that NEF will talk recklessly.\n\n\u201cIt is certain that some liberal minded people in the North will be shedding secret tears as a result of the statement credited to the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), because it is based on a delusion of a \u2018one north\u2019 that has treated the Middle Belt region as second class citizens.\n\n\u201cThe so-called \u2018north\u2019 cannot boast of numerical strength to win election without reckoning with the strength of the Middle Belt and other northern Christians that have decided to work with their southern Nigeria counterparts to produce fresh and effective leaders for the country.\n\n\u201cRather than boasting of numerical strength to win election, NEF should look for ways to turn the numerical strength to productivity. Nigeria is presently rated as the poverty headquarters of the world, because of poor standards of living in the region under the present leadership.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, urge liberal minded northerners to work with the Southern and Middle Belt Alliance (SaMBA) to produce a new crop of leaders in 2023 with the requisite competence, character and courage to usher Nigeria into the 21st century.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Gen Christopher Musa, said the military was working within the ambit of international laws and maintained that the law would take its cause.\n\nHe further noted that the military was doing all within international laws in the handling of Boko Haram and the prosecution of surrendered terrorists against the backdrop of the recent mass surrender of the terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe are just doing what we are supposed to do. The laws will naturally take its course, nobody will take them in and tomorrow say \u2018go, your sins are forgiven\u2019.\n\n\u201cNo. It doesn\u2019t work that way, and that is why we were able to talk to the Governor (Borno) and advise him to call for a stakeholders\u2019 meeting which was held to chart a way forward,\u201d Musa said.\n\nSpeaking earlier during a media tour of troops in the frontlines, units and formations in the theatre of Operation Hadin Kai, Sector I and II in the region, Director, Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, said the objective of the visit was to review the wrong narratives about the surrendered Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorists.\n\nHe noted that operations conducted against the terrorists had resulted in depleting its ranks.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is very important to stop their desperate recruitment bid,\u201d he said.\n\nNwachukwu said the efforts of the military should be highlighted by the media for Nigerians to appreciate the efforts of the troops particularly, in the fight against insurgency and terrorism in the North-east.\n\nHe said the media tour was aimed at discussing the issues of rehabilitation of surrendered terrorists and plight of the victims of the conflict.\n\n\u201cThese fundamental reasons gave birth to the media tour of the North-east. The Boko Haram insurgents have been surrendering. People have questioned the authenticity of the surrendering of these insurgents. People are also questioning why the insurgents are surrendering at this point in time.\n\n\u201cThe fight against insurgency has recorded tremendous success considering what it was in the past. At some point, few years back, as far back as 2014, Boko Haram was almost advancing towards Lokoja, they were marching towards Abuja. Today, they have been boxed to the Timbuktu or the hills,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

This country is not built to have second-class or first-class citizens, that is the beauty of democracy.\n\n\u201cWhat we said is that you cannot compel the North to yield to the southern part of the country, a right that has been given by the constitution, our right to choose and elect people that we want. If you compel us to do that, that makes us second-class citizens. Allow the democratic process to decide who becomes the president.\n\n\u201cWe understand people who are desperate, the kind of people who say if you want justice, if you want equity, you must bring the southern presidency down but we say that is not the way to ask for southern presidency, you cannot threaten us (with) violence and intimidation.\u201d\n\nBaba-Ahmed said the North had lived under Southern Presidents \u2014 Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan \u2014 since Nigeria\u2019s return to democratic rule in 1999, and had no problems with it.\n\nHe, therefore, urged politicians in the South not to make the controversy over who succeeds Buhari to divide the country.",

          "text": "In June 2016, Ventures Platform launched as an innovation hub where tech enthusiasts, freelancers, startup founders, and professionals in Nigeria could meet, network, and co-create. The 1,200-square-meter hub in Abuja also served as a residential base for technology entrepreneurs on the continent selected to go through the VP accelerator programme.\n\nOver the past five years, Ventures Platform has changed its investment strategy from the accelerator model to become one of the leading early-stage funds in Africa while it spun off the innovation hub business, now managed by its subsidiary Ventures Park.\n\nWith the recent surge in fundraising, tech activity, and uptake of remote freelance jobs in Nigeria, Ventures Park has seen its community of active users nearly double from just over 100 in early 2021 to almost 200. In response to the increase, the company has launched a bigger campus, in Abuja, to provide greater support to its community.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNigeria has the highest number of startups in Africa, according to findings by fDi Intelligence of Financial Times, in collaboration with Briter Bridges. As of August, a report by Disrupt Africa showed that Nigerian startups accounted for the biggest share of the $1.1 billion funding the continent\u2019s tech ecosystem had attracted this year.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost two years since the Covid-19 pandemic began, yet remote work shows no signs of going away. The social distancing rules, public gathering restrictions, and other lockdown measures that were imposed to curb the spread of the virus forced companies across the world to adopt remote work options to keep their businesses running.\n\nThat reality has also played out in Nigeria. While most people in the country still work from physical offices amid the health crisis, a few companies, such as Andela, Paystack, and Buycoins, have fully embraced the work-from-home idea.\n\nBut there are significant barriers to the success or long-term adoption of remote work; such as Nigeria\u2019s inefficient power grid and irregular electricity supply as well as poor network connectivity and high internet costs. Nigeria ranks among countries with the most expensive data in the world.\n\nImage credit: Supplied by Ventures Park.\n\nA shared workspace at the new Ventures Park campus in Abuja. Image credit: Supplied\n\nInnovation hubs and co-working spaces like the new Ventures Platform campus in Abuja are equipped with power and internet amenities that help freelancers work and entrepreneurs build better.\n\nThe new 2,000-sq-meter hub is located in Wuse II, Abuja, and has the capacity to accommodate over 200 people. It has facilities such as private and shared offices, dedicated desks, restaurants, and spaces designed to host events, conferences, fun activities, and more.\n\nOn the walls of the new campus are displays of several contemporary Nigerian art, which help create a stimulating and stress-free work environment. \u201cAt Ventures Park, we believe fundamentally that the space people work in influences the kind of work they produce,\u201d Kola Aina, founder of Ventures Platform told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nThe Chill Zone. Image credit: Supplied.\n\nThe Chill Zone. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\nIn addition to technology enthusiasts and stakeholders, the campus is open to non-governmental organisations, international agencies such as the United Nations, as well as researchers and professors working in northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe majority of our users are in the startup ecosystem but we have a good mix of people that come, work, and interact with one another,\u201d Ventures Park CEO, Nkechi Oguchi said. According to Aina, the \u2018multidisciplinary\u2019 nature of the community is \u201creally important to creating a vibrant ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe Garden of V-Den.

Image credit: Supplied.\n\nBut why Abuja, and not Lagos, which is the epicentre of tech activity in Nigeria and where Ventures Platform has a \u201cvery active\u201d community? Oguchi explains that the company believes that talent is everywhere, but opportunity isn\u2019t evenly distributed.\n\n\u201cIf everyone continued to focus on Lagos, we\u2019d miss out on talents in other parts of Nigeria,\u201d she said. \u201cWe chose Abuja to cater to the community and build the ecosystem here and since we launched, we\u2019ve seen real progress in tech activity.\u201d\n\nAccording to Aina, Ventures Platform, since its launch, has been deliberate about wanting to provide opportunities in Abuja and the broader northern region of the country. \u201cMany years later, the ecosystem in Abuja and northern Nigeria has grown significantly and we\u2019re proud to have been part of that process.\u201d\n\nVentures Park offers different free and paid membership plans for people looking to make use of the campus, including low-cost options from as low as N1,500 ($2.7).\n\n\u201cWe understand how important it is for people to work with budgets,\u201d Oguchi said. \u201cCompanies can book a space for a two or three-hour meeting and we also have several membership plans for individuals and startups.\u201d\n\nThe training room at the new Ventures Park campus in Abuja.

          "text": "abokiFX, a popular mobile and web-based platform that collates the black market foreign exchange rates in Nigeria, on Friday announced it will temporarily suspend the publishing of rates on all its platforms, hours after receiving threats from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThe apex bank had said it would shut down the platform, which Governor Godwin Emefiele described as \u201cillegal and criminal\u201d and accused of carrying out an \u201cillegal activity that undermines the economy\u201d.\n\nAfter the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s two-day meeting in Abuja, Emefiele confirmed that the apex bank was also planning to prosecute abokiFX\u2019s supposed owner, Olusegun Adedotun Oniwinde, for \u201cillegal forex trading\u201d and \u201ceconomic sabotage\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have given instructions to our experts to go after his website and let it be clear that we will go after him because we can\u2019t allow this to continue,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that the CBN does not recognize any foreign exchange market window apart from the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window.\n\nWhy Nigeria has different exchange rates\n\nNigeria is Africa\u2019s largest producer of oil, a commodity that brings in more than 90% of the country\u2019s foreign exchange earnings. Between 2014 to 2016, a plunge in global oil prices caused a dollar crunch that resulted in an economic recession.\n\nBut rather than an outright devaluation of the naira, the CBN adopted a multiple exchange-rate regime. This involved keeping a stronger rate pegged to the U.S. dollar for official transactions and a weaker floating rate for investors and exporters, known as the NAFEX window.\n\nOther rates were introduced for travelers and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) while there\u2019s also the parallel or black market, where foreign currencies are traded unofficially and the naira is often valued less than the NAFEX rate.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA historic plunge in oil prices triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic last year caused a more severe scarcity of hard currency in Nigeria. The CBN was forced to devalue the naira twice last year, amid other measures meant to stabilise the exchange rate such as limiting forex deposits and withdrawals over the counter and banning the sale of forex to exchange bureaus.\n\nIn March, the apex bank also replaced the exchange rate at the official window, set at \u20a6379/$1, with the NAFEX rate of \u20a6410.25/$1, as part of efforts to ditch the multiple exchange rate system that\u2019s been said to distort the market and frustrate foreign investors, in favor of a single-rate system. That left Nigeria with only two rates \u2013 the NAFEX rate and the parallel market rate \u2013 from almost five different rates as of early 2020.\n\nWhere abokiFX comes in\n\nBefore abokiFX, Nigerians wanting to change currencies in the unofficial black/parallel market could only obtain information on rates manually, such as through phone calls to money changers.\n\nHowever, the platform, which was launched in 2014 has gained popularity as a go-to source for information on the value of the naira against the major foreign currencies in the black market. It is used by market operators for trading and news organisations for reporting.\n\nIn recent weeks, and particularly after the CBN stopped forex sales to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators a month ago, the value of the naira has plummeted sharply, with the gap further widening between the parallel and NAFEX rates.\n\nBefore the ban, the local unit traded at around \u20a6520/$1 but fell to \u20a6570/$1 on Friday. A day before, the naira recorded its biggest single-day plunge in the parallel market in several months, a \u20a68.00 or 1.42% decline from \u20a6562/$1 on Wednesday to \u20a6570/$1, per abokiFX data.\n\nMeanwhile, data on the FMDQ securities exchange window, where forex is traded officially, showed that naira closed at \u20a6412.88/$1 on Friday. Currency speculators profit from this difference between the black market and official rates through round-tripping and other forms of currency manipulation practices that negatively affect the value of the local currency.\n\nAllegations of economic sabotage\n\nAccording to the CBN Governor, Oniwinde, who is based in the United Kingdom, publishes arbitrary rates without contacting BDCs and uses his website for forex manipulations and speculations, making profits from the significant disparity in rates quoted on abokiFX and the official exchange rate.\n\nEmefiele added that the apex bank had been studying the activities of the platform in the last two years. \u201cThere was a time we asked our colleagues to call the abokiFX to ask how he conducts the rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CBN act section 2, does make it clear that only the Central Bank can determine the value of the naira, and yet a single individual living in England continues to manipulate the exchange rate and make a huge profit which he withdraws through an ATM in London.\n\nA screenshot of the abokiFX website.\n\n\u201cIt is economic sabotage and we will pursue him, wherever he is, we will report him to international security agencies, we will track him, Mr. Oniwinde, we will find you, because we cannot allow you to continue to conduct an illegal activity that kills our economy,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\nThe CBN head also alleged that Oniwinde was an illegal forex dealer with over 20 bank accounts in eight banks that are filled with money from speculative activities and he\u2019s sold \u201ctens of millions of forex\u201d to several Nigerian companies, violating the country\u2019s foreign exchange laws.\n\nabokiFX debunks claims\n\nabokiFX in a statement released on Friday debunked the CBN\u2019s claims and said all allegations towards its director were not confirmed.\n\n\u201cAll allegations against our director are yet to be confirmed but we at abokiFX DO NOT trade FX nor do we manipulate parallel market rates,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cOutside the media allegation, we have not received any communication from any government body and our accounts are not closed as stipulated in the media.\u201d\n\nThe company has, however, temporarily suspended rate updates on all its platforms to \u201cget better clarity of the situation\u201d, adding that it \u201csincerely hopes the suspension will lead to the Naira appreciation from next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinal rates have been posted this evening but the abokiFX news section and the crypto rates section will still be active,\u201d the statement adds. \u201cWith our decision to temporarily suspend online rates publication, we are aware that there will be limited visibility of parallel rates information which will impact decision making for many.\u201d\n\nThe abokiFX statement.

          "title": "iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa",
          "text": "After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple has released the iPhone 13 series.\n\nDuring a virtual event on Tuesday, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 will come in four new models: the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about the iPhone 13 series?\n\nWell, it looks very much like the iPhone 12 but two notable main updates were made to the phone\u2019s display and camera. The new phones will also run on the latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS 15. They also come with larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 Terabyte storage), a new A15 Bionic processor, a smaller notch and new camera features.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe iPhone 13 starts at $829 for 128GB, which is twice the storage the iPhone 12 started with; while the iPhone 13 Mini starts at $729 for 128GB of storage. The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max start at $999 and $1,099 respectively, for 128GB storage.\n\nIPHONE 13 SERIES US PRICES AND STORAGE\n\nPhone 128GB storage 256GB storage 512GB storage 1TB storage iPhone 13 Mini $729 $829 $1,029 NA iPhone 13 $829 $929 $1,129 NA iPhone 13 Pro $999 $1,099 $1,299 $1,499 iPhone 13 Pro Max $1,099 $1,199 $1,399 $1,599\n\nWhy the iPhone 13 series are more expensive in African countries\n\nOver the years, there\u2019s been a noticeable price difference for Apple products in African countries. So, TechCabal reached out to iPhone retailers in different African countries to find out when the iPhone 13 will be available and how much it\u2019ll cost.\n\nNigeria\n\n\u201cOf course, you can expect that since the iPhone will be available on September 24, we\u2019ll have it in Nigeria on or before October 1.\u201d Emmanuel Osho, CEO of Bodds IT and Apple certified technician told TechCabal. \u201cThe price will be about 30% higher because it\u2019s new and there\u2019s a lot of hype around it.\u201d\n\nDespite the increased margin on the iPhone, Osho expects that the new iPhones will still sell out fast. A positive effect of the people purchasing the new iPhone 13 is that they\u2019ll most times trade in their older iPhones, making room for other people to buy them at a more affordable price.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Nigeria, at an exchange rate of $1/\u20a6550, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about \u20a6593,000.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, the iPhone 13 will reportedly be available from October 8 according to iStoreZA, an Apple premium reseller. Although the store hasn\u2019t revealed the prices, the iPhone 13 Pro 128GB is expected to go for around R23,499 ($1,640), while the iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB could retail for around R25,999 ($1,815). This is a high price margin of over 50%, most likely influenced by the fact that an iPhone or iPod attracts 7% duties and 15% VAT in South Africa per Business Insider.\n\nYou can expect that the price of iPhones from other retailers to be around the same price range as the majority of Apple products sold in South Africa come through a sole distributor, Core Computer Group.\n\nKenya\n\nIn Kenya, TechCabal spoke to a Salute iWorld, an authorized Apple product retailer at Yaya Center, Nairobi.\n\nA representative of the retailer told us that they expect to have the iPhone 13 in their stores within the next two weeks.\n\nWhile he couldn\u2019t comment on how much it\u2019ll cost he mentioned that in general Apple products are charged a 16% import fee with an additional 6% added on for Value Added Tax (VAT). This is aside from the transportation cost and the profit margin that the retailer will add to arrive at a final price for the public.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Kenya, at an exchange rate of $1/KSh110, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about KSh119,000.\n\nThe iPhone 13 looks like it offers a bit over its predecessor. But not so much that it\u2019ll compel many to upgrade. In the context of Africa, it brings up the question of whether the minor upgrades are worth paying at least an additional 30% \u2013 50% to get the new iPhone 13 in Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa.\n\nAlexandria Williams contributed to this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised. During the lockdown, I was still able to onboard offline customers to our, at the time, new online platform, and this helped me reach more people and especially, made for ease of interaction with offline clients.\u201d \u2014 F.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s weak economy biting harder on weary citizens",
          "text": "Fresh data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) that one out of five Nigerians lost their jobs in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic adds to the picture of the relentless misery in Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nUnemployment rate has only been recently tipped by Doyin Salami, who leads President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s economic advisory committee, to hit 40 percent by year-end. That would catapult Nigeria to the top of the rankings of countries with the highest unemployment rates globally.\n\nMore Nigerians have fallen into extreme poverty following the impact of two recessions within five years and a pandemic that made an already bad economy worse.\n\nDespite reporting a GDP figure that was largely applauded by government officials in the second quarter of 2021, analysis of data by the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) shows the economy shrank between the first and second quarter.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria economy yet to heal after highest GDP growth since 2014\n\nThe data suggest that real GDP reported a 0.79 percent decline in Q2 2021 to N16.7 trillion in the quarter to June from N16.8 trillion reported in the first three months of 2021.\n\nNESG projects a lower GDP growth for Nigeria in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 as it expects the base effect to fade out.\n\nAside from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Nigeria retains a long list of economic reforms that can boost growth and reduce poverty but they have been stuck.\n\nAccording to a private sector-led think-tank and policy advocacy group, NESG, Nigeria needs to pay urgent attention to the five following action points.\n\nMacroeconomic Stability\n\nThe NESG notes in a recent document titled: \u2018The State of the Economy\u2019 that Nigeria needs to minimize its vulnerability to external shocks, which in turn will increase its prospects for sustained growth.\n\nEffective fiscal management, good Governance and effective citizen engagement were the measures outlined by NESG on how Nigeria can score high in stabilizing its macroeconomy.\n\nPolicy & Regulatory Consistency\n\nThis encompasses the need to reduce policy reversal and somersault that tend to be hostile to sectoral growth.\n\nA typical example that relates to this action point is the recent National Identification Number (NIN) policy by the Federal Government.\n\nThe complexity around government SIM registration policy pushed Nigeria\u2019s telecommunication industry, which has the largest customer base of any industry in Nigeria, to record its fifth consecutive quarterly decline in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nThe sector reported a growth of 5.90 percent in the second quarter of 2021, 12.2 percentage points lower than the 18.10 percent reported in the corresponding quarter of 2020, and lower than the 7.69 percent growth in Q1 2021 by 1.79 percentage points, according to data by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nBefore the second quarter of 2020, about the same period the government commenced the policy that banned SIM registration which also required telecom users to link their NIN to their SIM, the mobile service industry was growing by double digits every quarter.\n\nSectoral Reforms\n\nThere is a need to strategically reposition sectors for growth, job creation and poverty reduction if Nigeria is going to achieve an annual GDP growth that will be above the 3 percent population growth rate, the NESG said.\n\nSince 2017, when oil-dependent Nigeria emerged from its first economic recession in five years (exited its second in 2020), not only has the country\u2019s economic growth been sluggish but only a few sectors triggered the expansion, further undermining the country\u2019s capacity to create enough jobs to meet the growing number of labour market entrants.\n\nWhile the sectors of the Nigerian economy that require less labour have been growing at a pace faster than their peers, the labour-intensive sectors with the potential to reduce the country\u2019s 33.3 percent unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2020 have either been in recession or growing at a sluggish rate.\n\n\u201cThe sectors with significant growth use very little labour,\u201d the Presidential Economic Advisory Council (PEAC) said during its sixth Regular Meeting.\n\nHuman Capital Development\n\nMassive investment in research and development, digitalization of health and education and empowering youthful population with productive skills are some of the ways Nigeria can boost its human capital development that will consequently lead to economic growth, according to NESG.\n\nSecurity\n\nQuick intervention and resolution of the crisis to ease security challenges in the country will go a long way in deepening economic growth, the group said.\n\nFrom the north to the south, the problem of insecurity has continued to threaten the future of Nigeria.\n\nInsurgent violence and terrorism carried out by Boko Haram and Islamic State\u2019s West Africa Province (ISWAP) remain the major drivers of insecurity across north-eastern Nigeria and the Lake Chad region.\n\nThe effects of the insurgency and the persistence of insecurity are inseparable from the region\u2019s pre-existing socio-economic deprivation and harsh environmental conditions, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).",

          "title": "In further move from fossil fuel, Shell sells key US assets to ConocoPhillips for $9.5bn",
          "text": "In further move from fossil fuel, Shell sells key US assets to ConocoPhillips for $9.5bn\n\nShell\u2019s proposed deal to exit from the top U.S. oil field comes as the industry faces pressure to lower emissions.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell is making another aggressive push to move away from fossil fuel by agreeing to sell all of its massive oil assets in the Permian basin, the most active U.S. oil field, to ConocoPhillips for around $9.5 billion in cash.\n\nThe US deal, disclosed by both companies on Monday, comes as Shell is attempting to cut its carbon emissions and invest more in renewable energy and this sale is one of the largest recent transactions in the shale patch as large oil companies come under increasing pressure to diversify outside of fossil fuels. Shell is also in the process of divesting from all its onshore assets in Nigeria\u2019s Niger Delta.\n\nShell said $7 billion of the proceeds will be returned to shareholders, while it will use the remainder to shore up its balance sheet. The European oil giant acquired the bulk of its Permian assets in 2012 from energy giant Chesapeake for about $1.9bn.\n\nConocoPhillips said the assets, entirely in Texas, included about 600 miles of oil, natural gas and water pipelines and other energy infrastructure but declined to comment further on the deal Monday.\n\nRead Also: Shell\u2019s energy transition can contribute to Nigeria\u2019s economic growth\n\nShell found that divesting the asset was a more attractive option for its shareholders than acquiring additional assets to grow its footprint in the Permian oil field, which straddles Texas and New Mexico, said Wael Sawan, Shell\u2019s upstream director, in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe found the cost of acquisitions in the last few years was above what we felt was going to be value-accretive for our shareholders,\u201d Sawan said.\n\nMr. Sawan said the $7 billion that Shell plans to return to shareholders will most likely occur in the form of share repurchases, though that will be determined by the company\u2019s board when it closes the deal in the fourth quarter.\n\nShell has about 225,000 net acres in the Permian that produce about 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The Permian represented less than 1% of the company\u2019s carbon emissions from operations, Sawan said.\n\nShell said most of its workers in Midland, Texas, the heart of the Permian, and many of its employees in Houston will join ConocoPhillips, which is based in Houston.\n\nRoughly one-third of Shell\u2019s staff and overall capital investment in coming years will remain in the U.S., Sawan said. Following the Permian sale, the focus of the company\u2019s oil-production business will shift to the Gulf of Mexico, where Shell is one of the largest offshore oil producers.\n\nShell had approached a number of other companies about its Permian holdings, but ConocoPhillips\u2019s offer \u201csignificantly accelerated our cash flows in the future and de-risked this asset,\u201d Sawan added.\n\nThe price tag was in line with recent deals in the Permian Basin, at around $47,500 per barrel of oil equivalent, said Subash Chandra, an analyst at Northland Capital Markets.\n\nChandra said the deal also shows that ESG, or environmental, social and governance issues, are becoming a more important part of large deals in the oil patch. He noted that ConocoPhillips promised to increase its target for reducing emissions intensity by 2030 in conjunction with the deal.\n\n\u201cShell doesn\u2019t want to sell to someone who is going to make them look bad on their ESG metrics even after the sale,\u201d Chandra said. \u201cIt used to be, \u2018Just show me the money.\u2019\u201d\n\nOil production in the Permian has increased almost to pre-pandemic levels this year while other oil patches such as the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford in Texas have largely flatlined. The Permian has more prolific acreage than other fields and remains the oil industry\u2019s center of gravity in the U.S.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. was ConocoPhillips\u2019s financial adviser and Baker Botts LLP. was its legal adviser. Morgan Stanley and Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. were Shell\u2019s financial advisers and Norton Rose Fulbright was its legal adviser.",

          "title": "Nigeria unemployment could hit 40% by year-end",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s unemployment rate is projected to increase to 40 percent by the end of 2021, according to Doyin Salami, chairman of the Presidential Economic Advisory Council (PEAC).\n\nThis warning appears dire considering that the current unemployment rate put at 33.3 percent by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) is producing devastating consequences, with deepening poverty, rising crime rate and an exodus of skilled and unskilled workforce in a country where over 23 million people have no jobs.\n\nSalami blames rising unemployment largely on the low capacity of the manufacturing sector.\n\nCiting the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) July 2021 Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index report, Salami said that the sectors\u2019 employment indices at 46.5 remain constrained below the 50 points mark. A figure below 50 indicates contraction in employment levels.\n\nPresident Buhari constituted the eight-member Presidential Economic Advisory Council (PEAC) in October 2019 chaired by Salami, a professor at the Lagos Business School. They were charged with developing reliable data and advice for economic development. But there\u2019s little evidence to show the president is taking their counsel.\n\nExperts who spoke to BusinessDay validated the unemployment projection adding that the impact of the coronavirus could worsen the situation.\n\nAbidemi Ajai, HR manager at Nosak Farm Produce Limited a fully-integrated agro-industrial company said: \u201cThe effect of the Covid-19 pandemic and some of the policies taken by the federal government is still affecting businesses. \u201cA lot of manufacturing companies are leaving the country for Ghana and other neighbouring African countries to survive,\u201d Ajai said.\n\nHe adds, \u201cThe survival rate for manufacturing in Nigeria is something else and that also will have an effect on the rate manufacturing helps the unemployment situation in the country.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Low-wage manufacturing jobs can dent Nigeria\u2019s unemployment\n\nManufacturing is known to be among the top job creating sectors of the economy. Although growth in the sector has improved over the last one year, it is still very weak along with other job creating sectors.\n\nAccording to the recent second quarter 2021 GDP report by the NBS, the manufacturing sector grew by 3.49 percent from 3.40 percent in the first quarter of 2020 and a contraction of 8.78 percent in the second quarter of 2020.\n\nApart from the NBS data, the CBN\u2019s manufacturing and non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for employment level index has beenbelow 50 points since March 2020.\n\n\u201cWe are not making enough efforts to create quality and decent jobs that the young people truly deserve. Most of what we are doing is expanding indirect jobs which are mostly informal in nature,\u201d Ayodele Shittu, lecturer at the department of Economics, University of Lagos said.\n\nThe Federal Government recently announced the launch of a plan to tackle Nigeria\u2019s youth unemployment crisis, called the Nigerian Youth Employment Action Plan (NIYEAP 2021-2024).\n\nThe plan is the government\u2019s attempt to achieve its goal of creating 3.7 million jobs annually so as to achieve sustainable economic growth in the country.\n\n\u201cThe plan would emphasize the 4Es, which are: employability, entrepreneurship development, employment creation, and equality and rights, with detailed actions required in support of employment creation for youths in critical economic and social sectors,\u201d the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare said recently.\n\nThe PEAC has suggested that for the Nigerian economy to rebound, there must be a massive investment in research and development, digitization of health and education and also empowering the youthful population with productive skills.\n\nExperts have also advocated that the creation of low-skilled jobs inthe manufacturing sector that offers lower wages can help Nigeria temporarily tackle Nigeria\u2019s unemployment problem.\n\n\u201cIf you have an industrial or manufacturing revolution, it is going to be very critical in taking people off the jobless markets. Although the low wage jobs might not make them the richest, everybody will have the money to take care of their basic needs of life,\u201d Ayorinde Akinloye, an analyst at United Capital Plc said.",

There have been several attempts and one of the promises I made during my electioneering was that before leaving office, I was going to make Edo like modern cities in the world, making Edo people experience a retail shopping mall in the state.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the project is a public-private partnership and when completed, the government would sell its shares to Edo people.\n\nHe noted: \u201cWe are very pleased and happy with our partners, Persianas. We thank the chairman, who built the first Shoprite in Nigeria. For our administration, it\u2019s all about partnerships. This is what we call a classic public-private partnership between the government and the private sector.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t intend to keep any interest. Once the mall is built, the government intends to sell its own interests to Edo people who are interested in being part-owners. Our role is to ensure and enable transactions like this to take place in the state.\u201d\n\nHe further stated: \u201cWe are bringing back industries and transactions of this nature to the state. We are stimulating investment into the state and when the businesses are set up, the government will withdraw because it has no business in running businesses.\n\n\u201cEdo has a unique location, fertile land and lots of mineral resources. We are repositioning the state to attract investors to take advantage of these opportunities; we are making sure our investment climate is friendly, attractive and supportive.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Chairman of Persianas Nigeria Limited, Mr. Tayo Amusan said, \u201cWe are excited to bring Shoprite to Edo State. We have the experience to do business in the state, as we have done JARA stores in conjunction with the Edo State Government.\u201d\n\nAmusan expressed satisfaction with the developmental strides of the Obaseki-led administration, commending the governor for prioritizing the welfare and livelihoods of Edo people.\n\n...",

If truly he is fighting corruption, cases of someone like Fani-Kayode, alleged of embezzling almost N2billion, meant for the construction runaway in Enugu airport must now receive speedy trial\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince he has joined them now, they have no need looking around for him anymore because we believe that his going to them will be an opportunity to speed up action on his case.\n\n\u201cWe declare Fani-Kayode a political liability. We are not missing him in any way. He is not a card carrying member of PDP because he didn\u2019t register anywhere. He has no constituency, no electoral value, no followership, he is just living on the past glory of being a Minister.\n\n\u201cWe wish APC well for taking away a bad baggage that Femi Fani-Kayode represents.

          "text": "A Bill proposing life imprisonment for the offence of kidnapping or any form of abduction, wrongful restraint and confinement on Tuesday passed second reading in the Senate.\n\nThe Bill sponsored by Senator Ibikunle Amosun (APC, Ogun Central) seeks to, among others, introduce stiffer punishments and punitive measures to combat and prevent kidnapping in Nigeria.\n\nLeading debate on the Bill, Amosun observed that kidnapping is a major security challenge confronting Nigeria in recent times.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, the light punishment for the offence has continued to make it grow and assume horrendous dimensions with a negative impact on the economy.\n\n\u201cThe impact of kidnapping on both economic and daily life has been devastating.\n\n\u201cFor many Nigerians, kidnapping is far more devastating than the carnage of Boko Haram in the northeast, or the carnage in the middle belt over land, pasture and water use between farmers and herders.\n\n\u201cIn the rich oil south-south, kidnapping is often seem as a manifestation of the insurrection over how oil revenue is distributed.\n\n\u201cOvertime, the pool of potential victims has shockingly been expanded. No, most victims are often poor villagers, sometimes kidnapped indiscriminately, a departure from the targeted kidnapping of wealthy people. They struggle to pay ransoms because of their relative poverty; and this has resulted into many victims being killed in the process,\u201d he said.\n\nAmosun lamented that, \u201cNigeria has one of the rates of kidnaps for ransom of both locals and foreigners in all of Africa.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cwhile the insurgents in the North East now thrive on the proceeds of kidnappings, criminal elements in the South East and South West are also having a field day. In fact, kidnapping has now become a big and lucrative business.\u201d\n\nCiting recent statistics released by Neil Young Associates International \u2013 a specialist crisis prevention and response consultancy group \u2013 the lawmaker noted that Nigeria accounted for 26 percent of kidnapping and ransom incidents globally.\n\nSimilarly, Amosun said that a Vanguard report published online on the July 13, 2021, states that an average of 13 persons were abducted daily in Nigeria in the first half of 2021, bringing to 2,371 the number of reported persons kidnapped in the country within the first six months of the year.\n\nHe bemoaned the worrisome development, warning that the trend has the potential of negatively affecting Nigeria\u2019s Foreign Direct Investment.\n\nThe lawmaker stated that the bill, therefore, seeks to introduce stiffer punishment for the offence of abduction, wrongful restraint and confinement for ransom.\n\n\u201cThis Bill also provides more punitive measures for ancillary crimes flowing from the commission of the crime of abduction, like death or grievous harm.\n\n\u201cTo achieve the deterrent effect, life imprisonments is proposed for the offence of kidnapping, particularly where death results from the act.\n\n\u201cThe law is made stricter by ensuring that recipients of any proceeds of the act of kidnapping are heavily sanctioned with term of imprisonment of up to 30 years\u201d, Amosun said.\n\nThe bill, according to him, also proposes to give the Inspector General of Police wider powers to enable adequate policing of the crime of kidnapping.\n\nAfter an exhaustive debate, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, thereafter referred the Bill to the Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters for further legislative inputs.\n\nThe Committee which is chaired by Senator Michael Opeyemi Bamidele was given four weeks to report back to the upper chamber.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate President on Tuesday referred President Buhari\u2019s request to approve $4.054bn, \u20ac710m external borrowing, and $125m grant component captured for projects under the 2018 \u2013 2021 borrowing plan to the Committee on Local and Foreign Debts.\n\nThe Committee chaired by Senator Clifford Ordia was given one week to report back to the Senate.\n\nBuhari in a letter dated August 24, 2021, explained that the projects listed in the 2018-2021 Federal Government Borrowing Plan are to be financed through sovereign loans from the World Bank, French Development Agency (AFD), China-Exim Bank, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Credit Suisse Group and Standard Chatered/China Export and Credit (SINOSURE) in the total sum of USD4,054,476,863.00; Euro 710,000,000.00 and Grant Component of USD125,000,000.00.\n\nHe added that the amount would be used to fund Federal and States Government projects cut across key sectors such as Infrastructure, Health, Agriculture and Food Security, Energy, Education and Human Capital Development and COVID-19 Response efforts.",

          "text": "A Bill proposing life imprisonment for the offence of kidnapping or any form of abduction, wrongful restraint and confinement on Tuesday passed second reading in the Senate.\n\nThe Bill sponsored by Senator Ibikunle Amosun (APC, Ogun Central) seeks to, among others, introduce stiffer punishments and punitive measures to combat and prevent kidnapping in Nigeria.\n\nLeading debate on the Bill, Amosun observed that kidnapping is a major security challenge confronting Nigeria in recent times.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, the light punishment for the offence has continued to make it grow and assume horrendous dimensions with a negative impact on the economy.\n\n\u201cThe impact of kidnapping on both economic and daily life has been devastating.\n\n\u201cFor many Nigerians, kidnapping is far more devastating than the carnage of Boko Haram in the northeast, or the carnage in the middle belt over land, pasture and water use between farmers and herders.\n\n\u201cIn the rich oil south-south, kidnapping is often seem as a manifestation of the insurrection over how oil revenue is distributed.\n\n\u201cOvertime, the pool of potential victims has shockingly been expanded. No, most victims are often poor villagers, sometimes kidnapped indiscriminately, a departure from the targeted kidnapping of wealthy people. They struggle to pay ransoms because of their relative poverty; and this has resulted into many victims being killed in the process,\u201d he said.\n\nAmosun lamented that, \u201cNigeria has one of the rates of kidnaps for ransom of both locals and foreigners in all of Africa.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cwhile the insurgents in the North East now thrive on the proceeds of kidnappings, criminal elements in the South East and South West are also having a field day. In fact, kidnapping has now become a big and lucrative business.\u201d\n\nCiting recent statistics released by Neil Young Associates International \u2013 a specialist crisis prevention and response consultancy group \u2013 the lawmaker noted that Nigeria accounted for 26 percent of kidnapping and ransom incidents globally.\n\nSimilarly, Amosun said that a Vanguard report published online on the July 13, 2021, states that an average of 13 persons were abducted daily in Nigeria in the first half of 2021, bringing to 2,371 the number of reported persons kidnapped in the country within the first six months of the year.\n\nHe bemoaned the worrisome development, warning that the trend has the potential of negatively affecting Nigeria\u2019s Foreign Direct Investment.\n\nThe lawmaker stated that the bill, therefore, seeks to introduce stiffer punishment for the offence of abduction, wrongful restraint and confinement for ransom.\n\n\u201cThis Bill also provides more punitive measures for ancillary crimes flowing from the commission of the crime of abduction, like death or grievous harm.\n\n\u201cTo achieve the deterrent effect, life imprisonments is proposed for the offence of kidnapping, particularly where death results from the act.\n\n\u201cThe law is made stricter by ensuring that recipients of any proceeds of the act of kidnapping are heavily sanctioned with term of imprisonment of up to 30 years\u201d, Amosun said.\n\nThe bill, according to him, also proposes to give the Inspector General of Police wider powers to enable adequate policing of the crime of kidnapping.\n\nAfter an exhaustive debate, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, thereafter referred the Bill to the Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters for further legislative inputs.\n\nThe Committee which is chaired by Senator Michael Opeyemi Bamidele was given four weeks to report back to the upper chamber.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate President on Tuesday referred President Buhari\u2019s request to approve $4.054bn, \u20ac710m external borrowing, and $125m grant component captured for projects under the 2018 \u2013 2021 borrowing plan to the Committee on Local and Foreign Debts.\n\nThe Committee chaired by Senator Clifford Ordia was given one week to report back to the Senate.\n\nBuhari in a letter dated August 24, 2021, explained that the projects listed in the 2018-2021 Federal Government Borrowing Plan are to be financed through sovereign loans from the World Bank, French Development Agency (AFD), China-Exim Bank, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Credit Suisse Group and Standard Chatered/China Export and Credit (SINOSURE) in the total sum of USD4,054,476,863.00; Euro 710,000,000.00 and Grant Component of USD125,000,000.00.\n\nHe added that the amount would be used to fund Federal and States Government projects cut across key sectors such as Infrastructure, Health, Agriculture and Food Security, Energy, Education and Human Capital Development and COVID-19 Response efforts.",

          "text": "By Chukwuemeka Opara/Abakaliki\n\nGov. David Umahi of Ebonyi has revealed that Federal ministries have tagged the entire south east as a red zone because of insecurity.\n\nUmahi made this known when inaugurating the new leadership of the South-East Traditional Rulers Council, headed by Eze Charles Mkpuma, the Chairman of the council in Ebonyi.\n\nHe said the classification is not in the zone\u2019s best interest as it will deprive the area of federal projects.\n\nAccording to him, the insecurity in the zone, occasioned by agitations for self-determination, amounts to \u201cself-inflicted injury\u201d by the people.\n\n\u201cThe declaration of southeast as a red zone by these ministries means that what is due to us would be difficult to come.\n\n\u201cIt is time for the zone\u2019s leaders and people to collectively say no to the killings in the zone because we no longer see the real agenda of the agitations.\n\n\u201cThe people should support governors from the zone and other leaders to permanently stop this bloodshed because we know the parents and communities of the perpetrators of the heinous acts,\u201d the governor said.\n\nHe further said the agitation for secession had been hijacked by cultists, kidnappers and other criminal elements, hence the need for the acclaimed freedom fighters to critically review the situation.\n\n\u201cIt is presently difficult for trucks with goods from other parts of the country to come to the zone as we did not harmonise adequately to determine areas of comparative advantage,\u201d he said.\n\nUmahi reiterated his stance that the Federal Government should continue to collect and distribute proceeds from the Value Added Tax.\n\nHe commended the immediate-past Chairman of the zonal council, Igwe Nnaemeka Achebe, the Obi of Onitsha, for his quality leadership and urged his successor to build on his legacies.\n\nAchebe thanked the southeast traditional rulers for their support during his tenure and urged them to extend similar gesture to his successor.\n\n\u201cI am delighted over the unity that exists among traditional rulers in the zone and I seek greater support to the traditional institution to effectively discharge its mandate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new zonal chairman, Mkpuma, expressed gratitude to his colleagues for finding him worthy to serve them and pledged to justify the confidence they reposed in him.\n\n\u201cI will work for the improved unity and welfare of our members and ensure that we contribute effectively in solving the numerous challenges confronting our zone,\u201d he said.",

They can continue to perform such roles without being in the board.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to not that administratively, the representatives of the ministries in the board will be Directors \u2013 being same rank with Directors in the institution. This may bring some complications in some decision making especially on issues of staff related matters.\u201d\n\nHe also sought an amendment to Sections 11(3) and 34(3) to be replaced with a new section that provides that appointments to the Board of the Commission or Authority under section 2 shall be made by the President, while those made pursuant to subsection (2)(a), (b) and (c) of section shall be subject to confirmation by the Senate.\n\nThe President further requested that Section 41(2) of the Petroleum Industry Act be replaced with a new section as \u201cthere shall be five (5) executive directors for the Authority whose appointment shall comply with the rules of the Federal Civil Service with each responsible for one of the following.\u201d\n\nThe President in the amendment proposal, underscored the need to exempt serving public officers from the established confirmation process for political appointments.\n\nThis he noted ,will ensure effective management of the regulatory institutions through uniform implementation of public service rules for employees of the Authority",

          "text": "A coalition of civil society organisations and Abuja Grassroots Projects AGP have vowed to stage a mass protest with the intention of shutting down the Federal Capital Territory FCT, should the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria , Godwin Emefiele fails to resign before Thursday, September 23, 2021.\n\nCoordinator of AGP, Comrade Ahmadul Yusuf in a press briefing said that they desire to support the call for the resignation of the Governor was as a result of his inability to stabilise the country\u2019s economy, added that he has used his hidden agenda to discredit President Muhammad Buhari\u2019s administration through his anti peoples oriented policies.\n\nThe groups blamed the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele\u2019s economy policies for impoverishing Nigerians, thereby demanding that President Buhari should harken to voice of Nigerian youths by immediately sacking the CBN Governor to save the country from total collapse.\n\n\u201cWe are making this demand because it has become necessary following the extensive review of the tenure of Mr Emefiele, as the head of our apex bank, which has come to the sad conclusion that he should humbly step aside and allow a more competent person to step in to save our country from total collapse.\n\n\u201cHowever, if he insist on staying put in the office as the CBN boss, we will shutdown the entire CBN office and ensure he resigns because enough is enough. Nigeria\u2019s economy is going down the drain, people are suffering because of the failed economy of this country, which is as a result of the failed policies of Emefiele\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cWe have made our investigation and gathered that he is working with the opposition political party to frustrate this administration. We also learnt that he has a secret plan to sponsor a presidential candidate against the wish of this administration.\n\n\u201cSo, we are in support of the early demand made by Arewa Youth Assembly Speaker, Mohammed Salihu who stated that his organisation has given Mr Emefiele three options to either resign voluntarily, get sacked by President Buhari or youths will occupy the CBN premises in their numbers until he resigns,\u201d he said.\n\nThey also lamented that the Central Bank under Mr. Emiefele has performed so woefully that the Nigerian economy that was termed one of the fastest growing on the globe before his emergence as governor, has become a mirage compared to the smallest economy in Africa.\n\n\u201cEveryone can attest to the fact that since Mr. Emiefele took over the leadership of the apex bank of Nigeria, the Naira, which is our official currency of transactions was exchanging against the dollar for $1 to \u20a6170 but today, it has gone from bad to worst, that $1 is now N550. This is sad!\n\n\u201cMost pitiable fact is that the naira runs at parity with the CFA, which used to be 1000CFA to \u20a6365, and by projections, it can only go worst, all this is a result of incompetence on the side of the management of the CBN occasioned by greed, corruption unfriendly policies and the lack of desire to do what is right.\n\n\u201cThe failure coefficient of Mr Emiefele is beyond imagination, yet the government turned deaf ears when there was a public call for Mr President not to reappoint him for a second term in office, today, the fear of many Nigerians is manifesting in how fast the Nigerian economy is taking a nose dive, reasons the rise in inflation is at it all time high,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "At least 20 per cent of the full-time workforce in Nigeria lost employment during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, a new report released on Tuesday has revealed.\n\nThe report tagged \u2018The Impact of COVID-19 on Business Enterprises in Nigeria\u2019, was jointly released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nBased on in-depth interviews with almost 3,000 businesses from both formal and informal sectors across major industries of the economy, the report assesses the impact of COVID-19 on business enterprises in the country.\n\n\u201cWhile there have been promising signs of recovery this year, COVID-19 has had an outsized socio-economic impact on Nigeria,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cFrom disruptions in supply chains to ongoing supply and demand shocks and a drop in consumer confidence, these challenges are expected to leave a lasting impact on the businesses and enterprises that make up the backbone of the economy.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Is Not Interested In Naming, Shaming Terrorism Sponsors \u2013 Presidency\n\nThe report also highlighted the significant decline in revenue faced by enterprises and establishments across the country due to the pandemic.\n\nIt indicated that 81 per cent of enterprises interviewed, experienced a decline in revenue and 73 per cent stated that they faced liquidity challenges due to secondary impacts of the pandemic in 2020.\n\nData from the report showed that the median loss in revenue remained at 44 per cent, in comparison to 2019 revenues while about 60 per cent of enterprises surveyed experienced an increase in operational costs, with the price of raw materials and logistics being the top two contributors to the increase.\n\nOther operational challenges included access to credit and capital, high expenditure on utilities, and inadequate social safety net, especially for informal enterprises.\n\nIn addition, the report revealed that one in three business enterprises surveyed indicated that some businesses have permanently closed due to operational challenges resulting from the pandemic.\n\nAdjusting To The New Normal\n\nIn his remarks, the Statistician-General of the Federation, Dr Simon Harry, highlighted the importance of the survey results.\n\n\u201cAs the economy begins to show signs of gradual growth, this report contains important information that can guide policymakers in their interventions to mitigate the negative socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 in the country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI wish to thank UNDP for collaborating with the National Bureau of Statistics on this important report and I urge other development partners to emulate this worthy endeavour by partnering with the Bureau in matters relating to data generation in the country.\n\n\u201cAlthough the report findings highlight the complex challenges the economy continues to face because of COVID-19, it also tells a powerful story of innovation, resilience, and strength as Nigerian businesses leverage their ingenuity to adjust to this new normal.\u201d\n\nUNDP Resident Representative, Mr Mohamed Yahya, on his part, said, \u201cAs Nigeria mobilises to recover from the devastating health and socio-economic impact of the pandemic, this report will be a critical tool in informing targeted policymaking and programme interventions for both medium and long-term planning as the country rebuilds.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, businesses are likely to continue experiencing the impact of the pandemic even after the easing of public health measures.\n\nDespite reduced restrictions at the time of the interviews, 74 per cent of enterprises still reported a decrease in production levels when compared to the same time in 2019.\n\nRead some quick facts in the report below:",

          "text": "President Joe Biden told the world on Tuesday that the United States is not seeking a new Cold War with China as he vowed to pivot from post-9/11 conflicts and take a global leadership role on crises from climate to Covid.\n\nAddressing the UN General Assembly for the first time as President, Biden promised to work to advance democracy and alliances, despite friction with Europe over France\u2019s loss of a mega-contract.\n\nThe Biden administration has identified a rising and authoritarian China as the paramount challenge of the 21st century, but in his United Nations debut, he made clear he was not trying to sow divisions.\n\n\u201cWe are not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cThe United States is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to share challenges even if we have intense disagreement in other areas.\u201d\n\nBiden did not mention China by name, other than voicing alarm about human rights in Xinjiang, where experts say more than one million people from the Uyghur and other mostly Muslim populations are incarcerated.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping is set to address the General Assembly later Tuesday but by video in light of Covid-19 precautions.\n\nBiden declared himself to be the first US president in 20 years not to be running a war after his controversial pullout of troops from Afghanistan, where the Taliban swiftly took over.\n\nInstead, America is \u201copening a new era of relentless diplomacy\u201d in which military power must be the \u201ctool of last resort.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mission must be clear and achievable, undertaken with informed consent of the American people and whenever possible in partnership with our allies,\u201d Biden said from the UN rostrum where previous US presidents, notably including George W. Bush, have pushed for military action.\n\n\u2018Recipe For Trouble\u2019\n\nOpening the General Assembly, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned of growing divisions between the United States and China and urged dialogue.\n\n\u201cI fear our world is creeping towards two different sets of economic, trade, financial and technology rules, two divergent approaches in the development of artificial intelligence \u2014 and ultimately two different military and geopolitical strategies,\u201d Guterres said.\n\n\u201cThis is a recipe for trouble. It would be far less predictable than the Cold War.\u201d\n\nThe UN General Assembly is meeting in person for the first time in two years but at limited capacity and with pandemic precautions.\n\nThe measures include replacing the microphone after each speaker \u2014 likely welcome news for the 78-year-old Biden who spoke after Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who defied guidance only to attend if vaccinated.\n\nBiden has called a virtual summit on Wednesday on defeating the pandemic and teased that he will announce \u201cadditional commitments.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe seek to advance the fight against Covid-19 and hold ourselves accountable around specific targets on three key challenges: saving lives now, vaccinating the world, and building back better,\u201d Biden said.\n\nHe also said Washington would double financing on climate change \u2014 a key element in reaching an ambitious new accord in November at a UN conference in Glasgow as temperatures and severe weather rise dangerously.\n\nThe United Nations says there is a $20 billion shortfall in the $100 billion fund that developed countries promised to mobilize annually from 2020-2025 for helping poorer nations adapt to climate change.\n\nFriction With Europe\n\nBiden will end a busy diplomatic week with an unprecedented four-way summit at the White House with the leaders of Australia, India and Japan \u2014 the so-called \u201cQuad\u201d widely seen as a united front against China.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s efforts to shore up alliances have faced one sudden and strong hurdle: France.\n\nParis recalled its ambassador to Washington in fury after Australia canceled a multibillion-dollar contract for French conventional submarines in favor of US nuclear versions as part of a new alliance announced with Washington and London.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has said he will not meet one-on-one in New York with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and has described Biden\u2019s diplomatic style as \u201cbrutality.\u201d\n\nThe White House appears confident it can calm the spat, with Biden set to speak by telephone to French President Emmanuel Macron, who is not attending UNGA due to Covid precautions.\n\nBut German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who openly rejoiced in Biden\u2019s defeat of Donald Trump, voiced solidarity with France and called the submarine decision \u201cdisappointing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was never under any illusion that we wouldn\u2019t have problems with the new American president,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nNigeria\u2019s President, Muhammadu Buhari, who is expected to address the assembly on Friday, is among about a hundred world leaders who attended the opening ceremony today.",

          "text": "The Taliban have asked to address world leaders at the United Nations in New York this week and nominated their Doha-based spokesman Suhail Shaheen as Afghanistan\u2019s U.N. ambassador, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nTaliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi made the request in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday. Muttaqi asked to speak during the annual high-level meeting of the General Assembly, which finishes on Monday.\n\nGuterres\u2019 spokesperson, Farhan Haq, confirmed Muttaqi\u2019s letter. The move sets up a showdown with Ghulam Isaczai, the U.N. ambassador in New York representing Afghanistan\u2019s government ousted last month by the Taliban.\n\nHaq said the rival requests for Afghanistan\u2019s U.N. seat had been sent to a nine-member credentials committee, whose members include the United States, China and Russia. The committee is unlikely to meet on the issue before Monday, so it is doubtful that the Taliban foreign minister will address the world body.\n\nEventual U.N. acceptance of the ambassador of the Taliban would be an important step in the hardline Islamist group\u2019s bid for international recognition, which could help unlock badly needed funds for the cash-strapped Afghan economy.\n\nGuterres has said that the Taliban\u2019s desire for international recognition is the only leverage other countries have to press for inclusive government and respect for rights, particularly for women, in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban letter said Isaczai\u2019s mission \u201cis considered over and that he no longer represents Afghanistan,\u201d said Haq.\n\nUntil a decision is made by the credentials committee Isaczai will remain in the seat, according to the General Assembly rules. He is currently scheduled to address the final day of the meeting on Sept. 27, but it was not immediately clear if any countries might object in the wake of the Taliban letter.\n\nThe committee traditionally meets in October or November to assess the credentials of all U.N. members before submitting a report for General Assembly approval before the end of the year. The committee and General Assembly usually operate by consensus on credentials, diplomats said.\n\nOthers members of the committee are the Bahamas, Bhutan, Chile, Namibia, Sierra Leone and Sweden.\n\nWhen the Taliban last ruled between 1996 and 2001 the ambassador of the Afghan government they toppled remained the U.N. representative after the credentials committee deferred its decision on rival claims to the seat.\n\nThe decision was postponed \u201con the understanding that the current representatives of Afghanistan accredited to the United Nations would continue to participate in the work of the General Assembly,\u201d according to the committee report.",

          "text": "Facebook has released a report stating that it has spent more than $13 billion on safety and security efforts since the 2016 US election, and now has 40 000 employees working on those issues.\n\nThe 40 000 safety and security workers include outside contractors who focus on content moderation.\n\nThe new statistics meant to demonstrate how seriously the company takes safety and security issues.\n\nThis report comes after a blog post and a series of stories last week in the Wall Street Journal used leaked documents to show that despite hefty investments, Facebook struggles to combat a myriad of serious issues, including Covid-19 misinformation and illegal human trafficking.\n\nThe documents showed that Facebook\u2019s internal researchers often identified serious problems with inappropriate content or user behaviour on the company\u2019s services, but Facebook routinely failed to fix them.

          "text": "Barely two months after raising dividends by almost 40 percent and starting a $2 billion share buyback, Shell has again pledged to give its shareholders and investors an unexpected $7 billion payout on shale deal.\n\nThe cash pledge by Royal Dutch Shell Plc comes after the company promised to give them three quarters of the proceeds from the sale of Permian shale oil fields to ConocoPhillips.\n\nThis development shows that the energy giant is working hard to regain the faith of investors after making a historic cut to its payout last year in the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cFor investors elsewhere, a divestment immediately allocated into a buyback to the tune of $7 billion, with balance sheet strengthening on top, is rare,\u201d analysts from Bernstein Research said in a note. It \u201cproves without any doubt that Shell are focused on winning shareholders back.\u201d\n\nShell\u2019s upstream director, Wael Sawan, said in an interview after the deal was announced, \u201cOf the $9.5 billion Shell will receive from Monday\u2019s sale of the Permian, $2.5 billion will go toward debt reduction. For the remainder, the base case is for that to go as share buybacks\u201d.\n\nThe final decision will be made by the company\u2019s board, likely in the fourth quarter when the transaction formally closes, he said. The $7 billion payout will be in addition to the company\u2019s prior pledge to distribute 20 percent to 30 percent of cash flow from operations to investors, Shell said in a statement.\n\nThe world\u2019s top oil producers and US shale explorers have increasingly focused on shareholder returns over growth, following years of expansion. Oil prices near the highest level in three years have provided them with abundant cash to do that.\n\n\u201cBeing able to transact with a healthy, robust oil price compared to where it has been in the last few years, and in a market that is hotly consolidating at the moment, is a prudent opportunity for us to grab,\u201d Sawan said. The deal gives Shell the equivalent of more than a decade\u2019s worth of cash flow from the Permian assets, he said.\n\nThe deal will give ConocoPhillips additional daily production in 2022 of about 200 000 barrels of oil equivalent, it said Monday in a statement. That will make the Houston-based company one of the Permian\u2019s biggest producers.\n\nOmotayo Araoye",
