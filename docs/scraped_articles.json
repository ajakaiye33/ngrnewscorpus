We are challenging all Nigerian students in secondary schools to show interest in science and take up career in science.

We can put them into use and build a sustainable economy that can make Nigeria one of the greatest nations in the world.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are tired of importing goods into Nigeria. The only way we can put all the minerals into use is to have people with requisite skills that will convert the minerals into use,\u2019\u2019 Onu said.\n\nThe Awardees are 1st position, Maryam Olufunmilayo Ogunbayo (Pen Resource Academy) Gombe state; 2nd position, Gbolahan Azeem Ayinde (African Church Grammar School) Ogun state and 3rd position, Uchendu Mmesomachukwu Judith (UNIBEN Demonstration Secondary school) Edo state.\n\nIn all, twenty-three (23) out of the thirty-six (36) states of the federation participated in the competition.\n\nThe competition which is in its 6th edition started at the Local government Area level, where the best contestants emerged to represent their states for the final contest.\n\nAnnouncing the winners, the Chief examiner, Prof. Nno Nno of Federal University of Science and Technology, Minna, said the competition was based on Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology and was keenly contested by 23 three states in the federation, from where the three winners emerged.\n\nHe said the examination was upgraded from manual to electronic method this year which was part of the strategies designed to make the contest more transparent and devoid of human interference.\n\nThe Minister, while presenting the certificate to the winners said President Mohammadu Buhari will on march 14th, 2022 present the prizes for the scholarship to the winners.\n\nThe winners are to choose any Nigerian university of their choice to study any course of their choice from undergraduate to Ph.D. level.",

He was taken to a diagnostic centre,\u201d Oromoni Snr said.\n\nThe father of the deceased revealed that his son was not taken to the hospital on Nov. 24, 2021 by the family and that he arrived Lagos from Delta at 6.00 p.m. on Nov. 25, 2021 after he was alerted by his family that his son was in a critical state.\n\nHe revealed that after he arrived Lagos, he took his son back to Dowen College, arriving at the school at 7. 00 p.m. to pack his belongings.\n\nHe said on Nov. 26, 2021, he left for Warri, Delta, with his son and arrived in the evening and that Oromoni Jnr was not taken to the hospital on that day.\n\n\u201cOn Nov. 26, 27 and 28 2021, he was treated in my house on doctor\u2019s directives.\n\n\u201cOn Nov. 29, he was taken to St Louis Laboratory for a scan. We were referred by the doctor to go there.\n\n\u201cI was not there on that day because I had rushed to my house in Asaba, Delta to pick up something and I came back the next morning, which is Nov. 30, 2021.\n\n\u201cHe died on Nov. 30, 2021; I was already in Warri when he died. I was in the hospital when the doctor confirmed to us that he did not make it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe witness further revealed that after Oromoni Jnr was confirmed dead, the family wanted to bury him immediately.\n\n\u201cFrom the clinic, they were taking him for burial. I called them and they brought him back in the Hilux that they were using to convey him and they parked in front of my gate.\n\n\u201cThe police came and took pictures and videos of the body and after that they asked me to take him to the mortuary and not bury him,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing the revelation of the witness, Omoaka requested that a series of interviews Oromoni Snr had granted to the press (Arise TV, the Punch Newspapers and BBC Pidgin) be played at the inquest.\n\nIn the various footage, the witness was alleging that his son was dragged, severely beaten, his stomach stumped upon by some senior students of the school.\n\nResponding to more questions, Oromoni Snr revealed that he had never been to his son\u2019s hostel at Dowen College.\n\nHe, however, accepted that other students would have heard his son cry out if he was being beaten by alleged bullies.\n\nThe Coroner, Mr Mikhail Kadiri, adjourned proceedings until Feb. 15 for continuation of the cross-examination.\n\nRecall that it was alleged that the 12-year-old Oromoni died on Nov. 30, 2021 from injuries sustained in an attack by five senior students of Dowen College for allegedly refusing to join a cult.",

          "text": "A Lagos State High Court sitting at the Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) has heard how a text message written in poor English raised suspicion about the fate of the late Super TV Chief Executive Officer Usifo Ataga.\n\nAtaga\u2019s friend and co-founder of Super TV, Mr Rahman Saliu, said the deceased was fluent in English but the SMS sent to him from Ataga\u2019s phone contained uncharacteristic errors.\n\nThe SMS, sent by his suspected killer(s) to Saliu while a search was ongoing for Ataga\u2019s whereabouts reads: \u201cI saw your missed call; I took some drugs that can made me sleeping.\u201d\n\nSaliu testified as the fifth prosecution witness in the ongoing trial of Chidinma Ojukwu, the prime suspect in Ataga\u2019s murder.\n\nOjukwu, a 300-level, Mass Communication student of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), is facing trial alongside her sister, Chioma Egbuchu and one Adedapo Quadri, for Ataga\u2019s murder.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nLed in evidence by Lagos State Deputy Director of Public Prosecution (DDPP) Mrs A. O. Oluwafemi, Saliu wept as he described how Ataga was killed.\n\nHe told the court that the deceased was tied up, on both hands and legs and \u201ckilled like a chicken\u201d with multiple stab wounds to the ribs and surgery-like cuts to the neck.\n\nSaliu, a network engineer, programmer and developer, told the court that he met the late Michael Usifo Ataga, 10 years ago, in the course of building the Super TV App.\n\nThe witness explained that Ataga, as CEO, usually chaired virtual management meetings on Mondays and Executive (EXCO) meetings on Tuesdays by Microsoft link.\n\nHe said Ataga called him on Monday 14, June 2021 that he was having stomach pain but he advised him to take his drugs and rest.\n\nSaliu said he had a task that needed to be completed before the management meeting so he didn\u2019t bother to call Ataga back until he was done.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn Tuesday, I wanted him (the deceased) to come to the meeting to give him the completed task, so I started calling. My first call was at 11am, on June 15, 2021, I wanted to give him the brief that the task was easy in order to relieve him of his high blood pressure.\n\n\u201cI started calling him, he didn\u2019t pick up his call nor did he return my message; I was surprised because the only thing he wants to hear is the billing App, with MTN, that it was now working.\n\n\u201cMichael didn\u2019t pick his call; everybody started reaching out to me because the only way they could get him was through me and the only way they could reach me was through him. He still did not pick up my call; this was about 3:30pm on June 15, 2021.\n\n\u201cThen I got a WhatsApp message from him. After reading the message, I said to myself this is not Michael talking to me. The message read \u2018I saw your missed call; I took some drugs that can made me sleeping\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe construction of that message was not Michael\u2019s because Michael was very fluent in English. I knew that was not Michael\u2019s typing; it was someone else.\n\n\u201cThen I sent him a screenshot of the billing system in the Super TV App, that it was working and his response to me was \u2018Ok, great.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat was when I knew something was happening because Michael would have jumped up, picked up his phone and called me immediately.\u201d\n\nHe and Ataga\u2019s driver and Personal Assistant Gambo visited some of the deceased\u2019s favourite spots but he was not there.\n\nThey called his cook at his house on Banana Island but was informed that Ataga had left home since Friday, June 12, 2021.\n\n\u201cHis 50th birthday was supposed to be celebrated on Thursday in Abuja; I raised the alarm on June 16th 2021, when we didn\u2019t know his whereabouts. His phone was still going through but he could not be reached,\u201d he added.\n\nRahman recounted how he started getting calls from Ataga\u2019s family members who wanted to wish him happy birthday including Ataga\u2019s wife, Brenda, who called him on Thursday morning asking of the deceased\u2019s whereabouts.\n\nHe explained that Ataga\u2019s phone was traced to the University of Lagos, and together with a team of policemen, a search began for Ataga\u2019s black Range Rover.\n\nThey also tracked Ataga\u2019s phones via their GPS coordinates.\n\nOutgoing payment transaction information from Ataga\u2019s bank account led the search to the Airbnb apartment where he was killed.\n\nOne transaction was to a bank account with the name \u201cChidinma Ojukwu Adaora.\u201d\n\nThe witness said Ataga\u2019s wife learnt of her husband\u2019s death before him and when she broke the news to him: \u201cI fainted; it took the Police to resuscitate me.\u201d\n\nSaliu said when he got to the apartment where Ataga\u2019s corpse was, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to believe that Michael was dead, I saw Michael\u2019s belongings that the police brought out; we were not allowed inside.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to the mortuary, I saw Michael\u2019s body. Michael was killed like a chicken; I saw a very big cut at the back of his neck. The wickedness for me is that the day I was with Michael\u2019s corpse, they were still taking money from his account. That was 17th June 2021, exactly the day he was 50 years old.\n\n\u201cThere were subsequent USSD transactions on his account until Brenda and I decided to close the account. I started tracking Chidinma, I started looking at Michael\u2019s calls from 9mobile and MTN, Chidinma was calling him with a WhatsApp number.\n\n\u201cI traced the money that was transferred by Michael to Chidinma\u2019s bank account and I supplied all the information to the Police at Panti. Around 1am, on June 23, 2021, on a Wednesday I got a message from Panti, that Chidinma has been arrested.\n\nJustice Yetunde Adesanya adjourned till February 17th for continuation of trial.",

Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nIn the last one month, ASUU national officers, zones and branches mobilised and sensitised members in public universities about the Federal Government failure to address their demands.\n\nASUU zones and branches held press briefings and told Nigerians to hold the Federal Government responsible if after the NEC meeting, the union opts for a strike.\n\nOne of the lingering issues between the government and the union include renegotiation of the 2009 ASUU-FGN Agreement, which ASUU insists should be reviewed every three years.\n\nHowever, nine months after the renegotiation concluded in May 2021, ASUU said the government has refused to sign and implement the contents of the renegotiated agreement.\n\nSome students and parents, who spoke to Daily Sun, expressed fears about what might be the outcome of the ASUU NEC meeting.\n\nIt was, however, learnt that ASUU national president, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke, would today (Monday) address newsmen on the outcome of the NEC meeting.\n\nIt was also learnt that the union may first declare a warning strike after the meeting in Lagos and should the government not yield to its demands declare a full scale industrial action.\n\nA 300 level student of Sociology, University of Abuja, Cecelia Eke fearing another strike as outcome of the meeting said: \u201cNot again please! I have spent extra years in school due to incessant ASUU strike, in addition to COVID-19 that disrupted our academic calendar in 2020. One of my course mate was forced to withdraw from our school to start a fresh programme in a private university after the COVID-19 lockdown and ASUU strike that started before then.\u201d\n\nDaniel Ayu, whose son is studying at the University of Nigeria (UNN) said he\u2019s closely monitoring the situation and won\u2019t hesitate to withdraw his son and enroll him in a private university.\n\nHe appealed to ASUU NEC not to consider the option of strike as it would have more devastating effect on students who would suffer delayed and disrupted academic programmes.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nJoshua Okechukwu, who is studying Electrical/Electronics Engineering at the Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUT), said he expects ASUU to resolve the issues they have with the government without shutting down universities in protest.\n\nOkechukwu said a strike would become a major drawback to his academic pursuit.\n\nHis mother, Mrs. Ngozi Ugwu, pleaded with ASUU to adopt other tactics in dealing with the government without dragging students and parents down with a strike.\n\nA student of Alex Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu Alike Ikwo,Ebonyi State, Miss Precious Ndubuisi, accused ASUU of destroying the nation\u2019s education sector through incessant industrial actions.\n\nNdubuisi, a final year student of Mass Communication lamented that their academic calendar had been severally disrupted over the years by ASUU strikes.\n\nJoseph Unah, said there was need for the government to find a permanent solution to the incessant ASUU strikes.\n\nUniversity students and parents in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, have, however, begged ASUU not to embark on its planned strike.\n\nMrs. Roseline Gabriel, an educationist, who lamented the plight of students in government-owned higher institutions said: , \u201cWhen I look back where we started, where we are now and where we\u2019ll be in the future, you pity this country. If Federal Government is committed to the development of our education system, ASUU wouldn\u2019t be complaining and threatening Nigerian students and parents with strike.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction, a student of the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA), Iyanda Elijah expressed fear over the planned strike saying if embarked upon, it would truncate his academic programme and those of many students.\n\nAlso, a parent, Pastor Olumuyiwa Alade said the strike if embarked upon would have financial implications on him as his son who is a final year student at the Adekunle Ajasin University Akungba-Akoko would have his academic programme delayed by a year.\n\nA student in the Faculty of Arts, Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, Faith Alofe, expressed the concern that the outcome of ASUU NEC meeting may likely be an indefinite strike, saying that that would disrupt the calendar already laid out by the school for a smooth session as well destabilise her plans.\n\n\u201cI will not be able to graduate this year as planned if the strike takes longer than usual and it will draw me back on my already laid out plan for the year,\u2019\u2019 she said.",

          "text": "By Kingsley Nwezeh\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Mr Usman Baba, Monday ordered the arrest of suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari and four police officers over their involvement in tampering with exhibits in a case of illicit drug trafficking, official corruption and criminal conspiracy among other charges.\n\nThe IG also ordered the immediate transfer of case to the Nigerian Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).\n\nHe charged NDLEA to investigate the indicted officers of the agency involved in the alleged crime.\n\nThe police officers include, DCP Abba Kyari, ACP Sunday Ubuah, ASP Bawa James, ASP John Umoru (at large), Inspr. Simon Agrigba and John Nuhu.\n\nNDLEA had earlier on Monday declared the suspended DCP Abba Kyari wanted for allegedly operating a drug cartel. At a press conference addressed by NDLEA Spokesman, Femi Babafemi, in Abuja, the agency presented a video where Kyari was seen in the car of one of the NDLEA operatives, offering bribe in dollars.\n\nThe Police statement signed by CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi reads:\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Police Force has arrested DCP Abba Kyari and four other police officers for their involvement in an alleged case of criminal conspiracy, discreditable, unethical, and unprofessional conduct, official corruption and tampering with exhibits in a case of illicit drug trafficking involving a perpetual transnational drug cartel. The arrest of the officers was sequel to pieces of information received from the leadership of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) on 10th February, 2022.\n\n\u201cIn line with standard administrative procedure of the Force, the Inspector General of Police ordered a high-level, discreet, and in-house investigation into the allegations. The interim investigations report revealed that two (2) international drug couriers identified as Chibunna Patrick Umeibe and Emeka Alphonsus, both males, were arrested at Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu on the 19th of January, 2022 upon their arrival from Addis Ababa aboard an Ethiopian Airlines flight ET917. The arrest led to the recovery of substantial quantity of powdery substance suspected to be cocaine from the two narcotic couriers. The operation which was intelligence-driven, was undertaken by a Unit of the Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT).\n\n\u201cAlthough the case and the two suspects were subsequently transferred to the NDLEA on the 25th January, 2022, the findings of the in-house investigation ordered by the Inspector General of Police established reasonable grounds for strong suspicion that the IRT officers involved in the operation could have been involved in some underhand and unprofessional dealings as well as official corruption which compromised ethical standards in their dealings with the suspects and exhibits recovered.\n\n\u201cBeyond this, the Police investigation also established that the international narcotics cartel involved in this case have strong ties with some officers of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu who are on their pay roll. The two arrested drug couriers confirmed that the modus is for the transnational drug barons to conspire with the NDLEA officers on duty and send them their pre-boarding photographs for identification, seamless clearance, and unhindered passage out of the airport with the narcotics being trafficked.\n\n\u201cThe two arrested drug couriers also confirmed that they have been enjoying this relationship with the NDLEA officers at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport since 2021 and had in this instant case of 19th January, 2022, been identified and cleared by the NDLEA officers as customary, having received their pre-departure photographs and other details prior to their arrival in Enugu, and were on their way out with the narcotics when they were apprehended by the Police.\n\n\u201cThe Police investigations report also indicted DCP Abba Kyari, who had been on suspension for his alleged involvement in a different fraud case being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), for complicity in the allegation of official corruption, tampering with narcotics exhibit and sundry unprofessional conducts that negate the standard administrative and investigative protocols of the Force as well as extant criminal laws. It is to be emphasised that DCP Abba Kyari\u2019s involvement in these allegation occurred while his suspension from service was subsisting.\n\n\u201cOn the strength of the findings of the in-house Police Investigation Panel, the Inspector-General of Police has ordered the immediate arrest and transfer of all the indicted police officers to the NDLEA authorities for conclusive investigation, while appropriate disciplinary actions are also being initiated against them by the Force leadership.\n\n\u201d The concerned officers include DCP Abba Kyari, ACP Sunday Ubuah, ASP Bawa James, ASP John Umoru (at large), Inspr. Simon Agrigba and John Nuhu. They have all been, accordingly, handed over today 14th February, 2022 to the NDLEA authorities.\n\nIn so doing, the Inspector General of Police has also formally requested that the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency should ensure the identification, arrest and investigation of the Agency\u2019s officers who have also been found to be colluding with the international drug cartel involved in this case towards advancing the anti-narcotics agenda of the federal Government.\n\n\u201cThe Inspector General of Police assures the public of his administration\u2019s commitment to upholding the tenets and values of policing in line with the agenda of ethical regeneration, restoration of professional standard, enhancement of the anti-corruption drive, respect for the rule of law and inter-agency collaboration in the drive to stabilise the internal security order of the country\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "TEXT OF PRESS BRIEFING BY THE NATIONAL DRUG LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY, NDLEA, ON MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2022.\n\nGentlemen of the press, there is no better way to start this press briefing than to remind us about the enormity of the drug problem Nigeria has on its hand and the imperative of all well-meaning Nigerians to play a positive role in curbing the illicit drug menace.\n\nEven before the damning findings of the 2018 National Drug Use and Health Survey, Nigeria\u2019s drug problem was getting close to epidemic proportion. And if anything, the arrests and seizures by NDLEA in the past 12 months is an indication that the country\u2019s drug problem was grossly underestimated before President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s resolve to strengthen the NDLEA and the subsequent launch of offensive action by the Agency to clean the society of the menace.\n\nAnd in just 12 months, even the most cynical of Nigerians now agree that the country is really in a drug quagmire and therefore appreciates the relentless efforts of NDLEA operatives.\n\nUnfortunately, some law enforcement agents who should be partners in the pursuit of the President\u2019s mandate are at the forefront of breaking the law, as they aid and abet drug trafficking in the country.\n\nToday, we are forced to declare one of such law enforcement agents wanted in the person of suspended DCP Abba Kyari, the erstwhile Commander of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) at the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigerian Police Force.\n\nWith the intelligence at our disposal, the Agency believes strongly that DCP Kyari is a member of a drug cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug pipeline, and he needs to answer questions that crop up in an ongoing drug case in which he is the principal actor. His failure to cooperate forced the hand of the Agency and that is the reason for this press briefing.\n\nLet me give a synopsis of what transpired.\n\nThe saga started on Friday, January 21, 2022, when DCP Kyari initiated a call to one of the NDLEA officers in Abuja at 2:12 pm. When the officer returned the call two minutes later, Kyari informed him he was coming to see him, to discuss an operational matter after the Juma\u2019at service.\n\nHe appeared at the agreed venue of the meeting with the officer and went straight to the crux of the matter. This was it: His team had intercepted and arrested some traffickers that came into the country from Ethiopia with, according to him, 25kg of cocaine. He proposed a drug deal whereby he and his team are to take 15kg of the cocaine and leave 10kg for the prosecution of the suspects arrested with the illicit drug in Enugu. In the meantime, the purloined cocaine will be replaced with a dummy worth 15kg. He asked the NDLEA officer to persuade men of the FCT Command, to play along as well.\n\nNow, anybody who is in touch with the reality of the renewed drug war by NDLEA since January 18, 2021, would know that that was a tall order because our officers and men have rededicated themselves to the war against illicit drugs and what Kyari was asking for was not tenable, not in this new dispensation, not with the new NDLEA. We can recall that one of our officers was in the same situation in May 2021 when a drug kingpin, Ejiofor Felix Enwereaku, flew from Brazil to Nigeria to negotiate the release of a 27.95 kg shipment of cocaine intercepted at the MMIA. The drug lord offered a bribe of $24, 500, but our officer placed duty above pecuniary interest. We all know how the episode ended. That is the ethos of the new NDLEA. And our officer proved it again this time by reporting to the authorities.\n\nBy 11: 05 am on Monday, January 24, after the Agency gave the officer the green light to play along, he and Kyari began a WhatsApp call for the rest of the day. The officer conveyed \u201ctheir\u201d willingness to play the game.\n\nAt this point, Kyari disclosed that the 15kg (already taken out) was shared between the informants that provided information for the seizure and he and his men of the IRT of the Nigerian Police. According to him, the informants were given 7kg while his team took 8kg which was already sold. He then offered to pay the NDLEA team (that is the officer and the FCT commander) by selling, on their behalf, half of the remaining 10kg, thereby further reducing the original cocaine for the prosecution to just 5kg. At N7m per kilogram, the proceed from the 5kg would amount to N35m, at the exchange rate of N570 per dollar being the black market rate for the day, January 24, 2022. In effect, he would be delivering $61, 400 to the NDLEA team. He put pressure on our officer to wrap up the arrangement with the commander of the FCT Command to take custody of the drug and suspects from his men who were on ground in Abuja. At the time, he was speaking from Lagos, where he allegedly travelled for private business.\n\nThe next day January 25, Kyari offered to send his younger brother to deliver the payment while his men deliver the suspects, but our officer turned down the suggestion, insisting he would rather deal with him in person and was therefore prepared to wait for him to return from Lagos.\n\nAnd by 5:23 pm, Kyari was in Abuja and met with the officer at the same rendezvous where they had the first meeting. In their discussion, he disclosed how his team received the information from a double-crosser who betrayed the traffickers to him, showing a sordid connection between law enforcement agents and the drug underworld; he narrated how acting on the tip-off, his team departed Abuja to Enugu and arrested the traffickers, removed part of the consignment on his instruction and replaced same with dummies. He also indicated how to identify the remnant of the original cocaine that would be delivered to NDLEA, five original packages marked with red dots. The reason for this was to avoid the dummies being subjected to test. He forwarded a picture of the marked original cocaine package. According to the plan, once the 5kg cocaine has been tested in the presence of the suspects and confirmed positive, there would be no need to test the remaining ones, being dummies.\n\nHe also brought with him the money from the sale of the 5kg share of the NDLEA team, a total of $61,400. Our officer, however, preferred to take the money inside his car. Well, the car was wired with sound and video recorders. And the moment was documented, part of which I will play for you at the end of this briefing.\n\nSo we have a trove of intelligence, hard facts, from chats to photos and video and a detailed transcript of the communication between him and the NDLEA officer.\n\nThis is not the place to delve into the details. But it is disheartening to hear straight from the horse\u2019s mouth the kind of sleaze engaged in by this team of rogue law enforcement agents led by Kyari, the members of whom he described this way: \u201cthe boys are very, very sharp, they are very loyal.\u201d\n\nIt is disheartening to hear him say of this rogue team, and I quote: \u201cI do take good care of them, and this kind of work is done by only that team.\u201d\n\nIt is equally disheartening to hear him give details of another similar operation which they pulled off, three weeks ago, according to him.\n\nWell, I am not here to wash his dirty linen in the public. But I want us to understand how we arrive at this juncture whereby we are having this press briefing.\n\nNDLEA has the mandate to take custody of suspects and consignments of drugs seized by other arms of law enforcement. And there is a standard protocol for such transfer. This we duly followed. The suspects and drugs were delivered to us on February 8 but the last part of the process, yet to be completed, is the debriefing of Kyari.\n\nGentlemen of the press, DCP Abba Kyari was invited by NDLEA for debriefing on Thursday February 10 through two main channels because there is a whole lot of questions begging for answers. The invitation was legitimate and formal according to our protocol. But up till the close of office hours on Friday, February 11, he refused to respond. Up till this moment, he hasn\u2019t responded.\n\nWe are a law-abiding agency of government. We follow due process. In that vein, we will not detain suspects beyond the stipulated period according to the law before we charge them to court. And Kyari must be debriefed before the suspects are arraigned in court.\n\nHaving failed to honour the official invitation, NDLEA has no option but to declare DCP Abba Kyari of the Nigerian Police WANTED, right from this very moment.\n\nI must say this publicly. We are not unaware of threats to the lives of NDLEA officers involved in this investigation, even as we continue to do our best to protect our officers and men in the line of duty.\n\nWe are making this strong statement to those contemplating harmful action against NDLEA officers. They would only succeed in compounding their problems in the event of the murder of or harm to officers and men of NDLEA.\n\nThank you.\n\nWatch video of the sting operation\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He said Kyari was yet to respond to the invitation.\n\nHe said it was unfortunate that a security operative that was expected to join in the fight against illicit drugs in the country had become the arrow head of those working against anti drug war and presidential order to fight drug to a standstill.\n\nAccording to Babafemi, the NDLEA had no option than to declare Kyari wanted for failure to honour invitation extended to him on the matter.\n\nBabafemi, who presented a video where Kyari was seen in the car of one of the NDLEA operatives, offering him bribe in dollars, said Kyari was also recorded when he said he was in control of some officers whom he employed in running the cartel.\n\nHe said though the lives of some operatives of the anti-drug agency was threatened, they could not but expose the cartel run by the suspended police officer.\n\nDCP Kyari was suspended by police authorities pending the outcome of an investigation into his alleged connection with international fraudster Ramon Abbas \u201cHushpuppi, who is currently standing trial for fraud in US.\n\nThe suspended police chief is also wanted in the US over links to Hushpipi.\n\nMinister of Justice Abubakar Malami recently hinted at a possible extradition of Kyari to US because a prima facie case had been established against him.\n\nWatch video of the sting operation",

          "title": "Facebook under fire for poor treatment of African content moderators",
          "text": "Meta-owned Facebook has come under fire for the treatment of African content moderators according to a recent TIME article.\n\nTIME revealed that content moderators in Nairobi were subject to poor pay and working conditions by Sama, a company responsible for Facebook\u2019s Sub-Saharan Africa content moderation since 2019. Sama also provides data labeling services for tech giants like Google, Microsoft.\n\nIn 2021, Facebook said it spent more than $5 billion on safety measures. It contracts the services of more than 15,000 content moderators globally, most of whom are employed by third-parties like Sama.\n\n\u201cThe work that we do is a kind of mental torture,\u201d one employee, who currently works as a Facebook content moderator for Sama, told TIME. \u201cWhatever I am living on is hand-to-mouth. I can\u2019t save a cent. Sometimes I feel I want to resign. But then I ask myself: what will my baby eat?\u201d\n\nThese working conditions led 6 Ethiopians to resign in January. Recall that Facebook is struggling to reduce the influence of content on its platform which is leading to real-world violence in Ethiopia. According to TIME, at least two Sama content moderators resigned after being diagnosed with mental illnesses including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. Many others described how they had been traumatized by the work but were unable to obtain formal diagnoses due to their inability to afford access to quality mental healthcare. Some described continuing with work despite trauma because they had no other options.\n\nIn the summer of 2019, instead of negotiating when content moderators threatened to strike unless they were given better pay and working conditions, Sama responded by flying two highly-paid executives from San Francisco to Nairobi to deal with the uprising.\n\nSouth African Daniel Motaung, the attempted strike\u2019s leader who was in the process of formally filing trade union papers, was fired shortly after. He was accused by Sama of taking action that would put the relationship between the company and Facebook at \u201cgreat risk.\u201d Sama told other participants in the labor action effort that they were expendable and said they should either resign or get back to work, several employees told TIME. The workers abandoned the protest before the seven days were up, and there was no pay increase.\n\nSama denied that there was any strike or labor action.\n\nAccording to payslips seen by TIME, Sama pays foreign employees monthly pre-tax salaries of around 60,000 Kenyan shillings ($528), which includes a monthly bonus for relocating from elsewhere in Africa. After tax, this equates to around $440 per month, or a take-home wage of roughly $2.20 per hour, based on a 45-hour work week. Sama employees from within Kenya, who are not paid the monthly relocation bonus, receive a take-home wage equivalent to around $1.46 per hour after tax.\n\nThe average salary at Sama including benefits was approximately 2.5 times the Kenyan minimum wage, according to a 2021 study carried out by three MIT researchers. But these wages only cover the basic costs of living, workers say, and don\u2019t allow them to save or improve their financial situations.\n\nEmployees also complained of working long hours\u2014up to nine hours per day including breaks, and their screen time is monitored. According to several copies of Sama content moderators\u2019 performance reviews, TIME revealed that the moderators were measured against target metrics for average time spent and quality. This evidence contradicts the public statement that Facebook has made about not setting expectations on its contractors.\n\n\u201cA common misconception about content reviewers is that they\u2019re driven by quotas and pressured to make hasty decisions,\u201d Ellen Silver, Facebook\u2019s vice president of operations, said in a 2018 blog post. \u201cLet me be clear: content reviewers aren\u2019t required to evaluate any set number of posts \u2026 We encourage reviewers to take the time they need.\u201d\n\nA Meta spokesperson, Ben Walters, corroborated this statement.\n\nThe Social media giant has also put some features in place to help protect moderators, like the option to render videos in black and white or add blurring. But one Sama employee said he doesn\u2019t use these options because of the pressure to meet quotas. \u201cHow can you clearly see whether content is violating or not unless you can see it clearly? If it\u2019s black and white or blurred, I cannot tell,\u201d the employee said. \u201cSome people use the option, but I don\u2019t. Because if I wrongly action that [content], I will be marked down.\u201d\n\nThis report adds to a seemingly endless series of public controversies relating to Facebook in recent years. Despite claiming innocence in this case, it\u2019s imperative the social media giant holds its contractors like Sama to higher standards or else its name will be dragged in the mud.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "YC\u2019s backing of its first Namibian startup shows investors are paying attention to the country",
          "text": "When the COVID lockdown was announced in March 2020, people stampeded shops to buy many months\u2019 worth of food and supplies to the extent that many economies experienced shortages with food products, medical materials, toilet paper, and even home workout equipment. The lockdown was the closest thing to an apocalypse most people had experienced up to that point, and they wanted to be prepared.\n\nIn Namibia, the pandemic also affected retail shops. The government had locked down the country without making adequate palliative plans to support its people during the period. Taxis didn\u2019t run and shop owners couldn\u2019t transport themselves to and fro their suppliers for goods.\n\nIn the midst of the crisis, it soon became apparent that Namibia had a broken supply chain.\n\nOne man, David Akinin, who once worked in the construction industry as a founder, decided to intervene. He loaded his truck with food and essential supplies and drove around, selling them to people\u2014a sort of mobile retail shop. They were grateful for his intervention. But it wasn\u2019t enough; informal shops needed to reopen.\n\nAkinin\u2019s idea to provide food and essentials to people during lockdown gave birth to a company\u2014Jabu. \u201cWhen you\u2019re building something and people start thanking you for it, you know you\u2019ve found something great,\u201d Akinin told TechCabal on a call.\n\nJabu partnered with local and multinational suppliers to deliver their goods directly to informal retailers across Namibia. In the process, they faced a challenge: it was difficult to locate retailers who didn\u2019t have registered or verified addresses. The startup then worked with local community leaders to register retailers in their area and log the GPS location of each shop in the Jabu app. Within 2 weeks they identified the location of 1,000 shops.\n\nHeadquartered in Namibia, with operations in Zambia, Jabu is a data-driven e-commerce startup that helps small retailers with sourcing products and inventory management. Its platform connects over 6,000 retailers to local and international suppliers; and digitises their orders, payments, and logistics. The startup currently operates out of 5 cities and 9 sites.\n\nIn January this year, Jabu raised $3.2 million in seed funding, led by Afore Capital, with participation from Y Combinator, FJ Labs, Quiet Capital, Kli Capital, Pareto Capital, and unnamed angel investors.\n\nThe funding makes Jabu the first Namibian startup to be backed by YC.\n\nSceptical investors\n\nAkinin, who is founder and CEO of Jabu, is originally from Venezuela but has lived in Namibia for 9 years. When he got on the call with TechCabal, he was outdoors, seated in a veranda overlooking vibrant greenery. He was in Zambia, he said, where Jabu had opened an office in November last year. He would later reveal that it had been raining a lot in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, affecting Jabu\u2019s fleet operations.\n\nThe supply chain problem Jabu has set out to solve is a thorny one, and the solution it is building is critical to economic development. Yet, for a long time, the startup struggled to attract investment. \u201cOur first challenge was getting investors to recognise the country,\u201d Akinin said. \u201cI\u2019m sure a lot of people, on their first call, looked up Namibia on the map!\u201d\n\nInvestors Akinin approached were concerned about Jabu\u2019s potential to scale in Namibia, a country whose economy went into recession in 2016 and has been struggling to recover ever since.\n\nAt the onset of the pandemic, the African Development Bank Group (ADBG) projected that the Namibian economy would shrink by 7.9% in 2020, due to an expected decline in activity in mining, agriculture, construction, hospitality, and tourism. Post-lockdown, the decline actually happened. Namibia\u2019s GDP dropped by 8.5% in 2020, and the population of its poor has now hit a record high of 1.6 million persons.\n\nNow, although the economy is expected to make a rebound, albeit a slow one\u2014with growth projected at 1.2% in 2021 and 2.4% in 2022\u2014one can see that the country has had a rough few years, which may have caused it to miss out on the Great Venture Capitalist Influx Africa has recorded in the last 3\u20134 years.\n\nMoreover, it is well known that venture capitalists (VC) channel most of their African investment towards startups in South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, and Kenya. These countries\u2014dubbed the Big Four\u2014are Africa\u2019s busiest tech markets; compared to them, Namibia has a tiny population\u20142.5 million persons, where Nigeria has 206 million, Egypt 102 million, South Africa 59 million, and Kenya 53 million.\n\nAnd so, it is against this backdrop that investors were concerned about Jabu\u2019s scalability. Their recurring question was whether Namibia could produce a startup that could be worth $100 million in returns, and Akinin\u2019s answer\u2014precise each time\u2014was yes.\n\n\u201cA huge responsibility\u201d\n\nReflecting on Jabu being the first Namibian startup to be backed by YC, Akinin said, \u201cIt feels like such a huge responsibility, for us, towards an ecosystem that has been trying, for a long time, to raise awareness about the great things happening in Namibia. But it\u2019s a good opportunity to bring people into the Namibian ecosystem and onto our platform. It\u2019s inspiration for other companies still pushing hard and hoping to get more money this year.\u201d\n\nAkinin believes that the Namibian startup scene will get more funding attention now because there is an \u201can openness to innovation\u201d from both local founders and investors. \u201cInvestors around the world are opening their eyes to the understanding that there is opportunity in Namibia. I served as an ambassador of what\u2019s happening on the ground and was fortunate to have been able to share that story with investors.\u201d\n\nA tale of 2 countries\n\nFor a young startup, Akinin and his team remain undaunted by the challenges associated with operating in 2 different markets. For starters, they are dealing with unstable infrastructure in both Zambia and Namibia. And while there are frequent power outages in Lusaka, unlike in Windhoek, in both countries, more than half of Jabu\u2019s customers are in places without tarred roads, making logistics difficult: \u201cYou can see why the supply chain does not exist, in the first place,\u201d Akinin said. \u201cBecause there are no roads to the places we need to reach. We\u2019ve had to map roads that didn\u2019t exist previously in order to create a route to market.\u201d\n\nIn Lusaka, incessant rains have made movement on potholed roads near-impossible\u2014\u201cIt has got to the point where I\u2019m willing to invest in paving the road in front of our warehouse, just so that our vehicles can move smoothly.\u201d\n\nHe described Lusaka as a \u201cbillboard city\u201d but is unsure yet how to leverage that fact for Jabu\u2019s growth in the country. \u201cThere\u2019s advertising everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cMarketing and branding are a really different experience to what we have in Windhoek. We\u2019re very excited about getting to know it and taking some learnings from it back to Namibia.\u201d\n\nOn to the next round\n\nAfrican e-commerce startups have recorded an impressive spike in VC funding since 2019, raising nearly $90 million dollars in 2020, up from $47.5 million in 2019. Between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021, the total value of raises by e-commerce startups hit $140 million. The spike in funding may have been triggered by the lockdown, as the pandemic emphasised the gaps in the supply chain of many industries, forcing e-commerce entrepreneurs to innovate around the problem.\n\nFollowing its recent raise, Jabu is looking to expand to other countries in Southern Africa\u2014Botswana, South Africa, Lesotho, and Eswatini. The path to this expansion is still being developed and fine-tuned by the team. For now, however, Akinin\u2019s focus is on raising for Series A and consolidating his company\u2019s operations in Zambia.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunication between a business and its customers is essential for business survival. From customer onboarding to retention, a company\u2019s ability to communicate clearly, effectively, and swiftly could be the difference between its growth and decline and consequent death.\n\nIronically, communication aids business growth and, if done correctly, ensures there are more people to relate with, increasing the communication burden.\n\nPeople communicate differently and have preferred modes of communication. It, therefore, behoves a business to understand every customers\u2019 preference and reach them through it.\n\nA daunting task, but one startup wants to make it easier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSendchamp is a software company on a mission to help businesses improve customer relations by reducing the technicalities involved. The startup was founded by Goodness Kayode (CEO) and Damilola Olotu (CTO) after realising how confusing the customer management process was in the companies where they had worked.\n\nKayode started noticing the loopholes in customer management platforms when he consulted for a fintech company to create an onboarding communication process. He had to combine tools like Mailchimp, GetGist and HelpCrunch because they each only provided one mode of communication, which meant more spending on customer communication.\n\nWhile these platforms could help businesses communicate with customers effectively, there were still significant setbacks, their lack of versatility being one of the major ones.\n\nAccording to Kayode, a business communicates in three stages: the first gets customers on board while the second and third support and retain them, respectively.\n\nThe lack of versatility means that these platforms could only do one of the three, which means businesses have to use different platforms at every point in time \u2014 a costly process. For example, some platforms only offer emailing services, while others are great for live chats.\n\nSendchamp, however, wants to combine all these services into one \u2014 a unified message delivery platform or multichannel communication tool that allows users to deliver messages across multiple channels, including SMS, WhatsApp, Email, and voice.\n\nIt also offers a customer relations management (CRM) platform solution that allows technical and non-technical people to manage customer relations effectively.\n\nThese solutions already exist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSendchamp Co-Founders, (L-R) Goodness Kayode and Damilola Olotu\n\nFor anyone new to the customer relations and communication scene, the solutions Sendchamp is offering might seem new, but they already exist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his conversation with Techpoint Africa, Kayode noted that while unified message delivery platforms like Sendchamp exist, they were out of the reach of African businesses.\n\n\u201cWe have a global solution provider that is ready to provide this, but how do we pay them? With card limits and high exchange rates, it becomes challenging to use these existing platforms.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the payment issues, some of them can only be used by technical business owners, leaving out those who do not have technical backgrounds.\n\n\u201cWe are building a simple multichannel communication tool that allows businesses to onboard, engage, retain, or support customers from just one place. We are also focusing on non-technical people in marketing and sales,\u201d Kayode said.\n\nHaving consulted for several companies, he has concluded that customers like flexibility when communicating with a business.\n\n\u201cCustomers do not want to be restricted; they want the flexibility to reach out to businesses via different channels, be it WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram, or even SMS. For example, if you send an email to someone that\u2019s into agent banking, you might not get engagements, but if you reached out to them via SMS, you\u2019d likely get responses because that\u2019s what they\u2019re used to.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Sendchamp raised $100,000 in an angel round in December 2021. So far, it has helped businesses using its platform reach 300,000 customers and delivered three million messages.\n\nWhile only present in Nigeria, Kayode said users from Kenya have begun to show an interest in using the platform. Although Sendchamp does not have local integration in Kenya and other African countries, businesses there can still use the platform, albeit with limited functionality.\n\nHandling privacy issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSendchamp website\n\n\u201cTo make money as a business, you have to reach out to customers; it is the ABC of every business,\u201d Kayode said.\n\nHe cited an example of Computer Village, Lagos and how businessmen and women called out to passers-by trying to communicate what they sell and the services they offer.\n\nUsing the same example, he pointed out that communication doesn\u2019t end at just getting the customer to buy, as retaining a customer is as crucial as getting a customer.\n\n\u201cSo the reason why a customer is going to remember that you exist is communication.\u201d\n\nWith so much communication to be done, how does Sendchamp handle privacy?\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we use Enterprise Grid systems to prevent a data breach. It secures information transferred between customers and businesses.\u201d\n\nEnterprise Grid is a solution created by American communication company, Slack. It includes security and governance functionalities that help secure communication within an enterprise.\n\nIn addition to security features such as Enterprise Grid, Kayode said there are terms of use that ensure no data is sold or linked to any dataset.\n\nGlobally, the unified communications market was worth $78.33 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $344.84 billion by 2028. Sendchamp wants to be a significant part of that market as Kayode believes that every business in Africa will use Sendchamp to boost customer relations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

It appears Ghanaians can now travel through 44,000 airports, using their National ID cards \u2014 Ghana Card \u2014 as an e-passport.\n\nBut let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves, though. Some people seem to have mistaken \u201ctravel through\u201d to mean \u201ctravel to\u201d. But as The United Nations\u2019 International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) \u2014 the body said to have given the go-ahead \u2014 said on Friday, February 11, 2022, the latter is most definitely not the case.\n\nAccording to the ICAO, it doesn\u2019t have the authority to \u201ccertify the use of a State\u2019s Identity Card for international travel in place of a passport.\u201d Essentially, all states have the sovereign power to decide how you enter and exit their borders. In this case, instead of using their passports, Ghanaians can enter Ghana using their National ID card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe West African nation appears to be on a digital identity campaign. Remember this: Ghanaians to begin re-registration of SIM cards with Ghana Card or risk getting their SIMs blocked\n\nI have one question, though. Can\u2019t Nigerian leaders see that we are literally this close to losing the Nigeria-Ghana Jollof wars?\n\nAway from that, it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s day! And I \u2014 more like Oluwanifemi \u2014 have something for the lovers (if we don\u2019t get nuked by Putin\u2019s Russia).\n\nFor the rest of us singles, we\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nThe arduous task of accessible healthcare in Africa, and\n\nThe art of communicating with customers\n\nWeb3, but for love\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last few years, every Valentine\u2019s day, social media has been filled with images of flowery messages sent to lovers, romantic getaways to Dubai or the Maldives and sometimes, surprise marriage proposals.\n\nBut in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic stormed the world, giving most lovers the unique long-distance relationship experience. People have had to rethink their romantic plans for Valentine\u2019s. Planning a trip around Europe? COVID. Want to go out on a date? COVID.\n\nWith the pandemic, however, new ways to create romantic moments meant lots of digital interaction: Zoom dates, virtual movie nights, and even online tours with the Airbnb experience \u2014 with social distancing, of course.\n\nNow, with the Web3 and metaverse craze gaining momentum, it appears that we most definitely haven\u2019t seen the end of digital romance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWould you enjoy going on a date in the metaverse? Or getting a token named after you as a Valentine\u2019s gift? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d like the last one, though. But, Oluwanifemi has curated some romantic gift ideas for you, Web3 style. Don\u2019t forget to check them out later today.\n\nP.S. Rumor has it that couples are likely to break up on Valentine\u2019s day. You never know if you are giving the wrong gifts. \ud83d\ude09\n\nAccessible healthcare for Africans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tyck via Iwaria\n\nDon\u2019t judge me; I\u2019m not too fond of hospitals. Today I Iearnt something new which I\u2019m about to share with you guys: the difference between primary and secondary healthcare.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, \u201cPHC (primary healthcare) is a whole-of-society approach to health that aims at ensuring the highest possible level of health and well-being and their equitable distribution by focusing on people\u2019s needs and as early as possible along the continuum from health promotion and disease prevention to treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care, and as close as feasible to people\u2019s everyday environment.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pallipedia, secondary healthcare, on the other hand, refers to \u201cHospitals and outpatient specialist clinics to which people go, after referral from primary health care services. These services are generally more specialised and further from where people live.\u201d\n\nSo, primary healthcare basically refers to essential health care that should be made accessible to everyone. It\u2019s very grassroots and community-based and focuses on the equitable and cost-effective distribution of health services and the prevention of illnesses.\n\nSecondary healthcare is more complicated than that and would involve \u201cmore\u201d serious diseases or conditions. Here you\u2019ll find operating theatres, radiotherapy, pathology labs, and so on.\n\nIn Africa, however, access to primary healthcare is hampered by low budgeting, little staffing, and sometimes bureaucratic bottlenecks.\n\nSome African entrepreneurs are trying to bridge this gap, and we\u2019ve seen startups like RelianceHMO, Wellahealth, DabaDoc, and Dokitar spring up.\n\nChimgozirim had a chat with Njabulo Skhosana, founder of South African healthtech startup, Healthdart, to understand how it hopes to make primary healthcare accessible to Africans. This is another story to look forward to today.\n\nCommunicating with your customers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from being in it to make a profit, businesses are run to serve their customers. We tend to repeat the phrase, \u201cthe customer is always right,\u201d or \u201cthe customer is king\u201d because we know how important they are to the business\u2019s success.\n\nBut there\u2019s one thing that usually appears to be a stumbling block in the business-customer relationship, communication. Business owners need to be careful how they pass across information to their customers. But more than this, there\u2019s also the issue of different communication channels.\n\nSome people prefer to send/receive emails, while some would instead send text messages. Others would rather communicate via Instagram Direct Messages. How do you cater to this fragmented list?\n\nWell, Nigeria-based Sendchamp is creating a unified message delivery platform that allows businesses to communicate to customers across multiple channels.\n\nBolu spoke with Goodness Kayode, CEO of Sendchamp, to learn more about how the company intends to play in the over $78 billion unified communications market. Another story you can look forward to today.\n\nLast week on Techpoint\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThis week is productive!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking physical time for love and intimacy can be challenging, especially when we are distracted by the things that place a demand on our time. And the many options that come with alternative connections through social networking platforms and other tech don\u2019t make it any easier; if anything, they blur the line between the real and the unreal.\n\nWhat do you do when Valentine\u2019s Day is around the corner, and you want to get your love a gift they will appreciate, but you can\u2019t ask them since that will ruin the surprise? Or you\u2019re miles away from the love of your life, and the best you could manage is a virtual call, but you craved for more?\n\nThe only sane options would be to engage the services of your lover\u2019s friends and acquaintances or wait till the next time you can see the love of your life.\n\nNow imagine a future where all these become less of an option because several innovations finding solutions to real-life problems are coming at us fast?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some ideas you could consider to have a swell Valentine\u2019s Day while we await those days.\n\nGifting non-fungible tokens (NFTs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent forms of Valentine\u2019s Day packages have been in our faces since the year began. These bundled packages come at outrageous prices, often more expensive than the total cost of the individual items.\n\nBeyond this craze, you could consider getting your loved ones NFTs. But I would only recommend this if you\u2019re both blockchain enthusiasts \u2014 this is an important condition that would not ruin what should be a romantic gesture.\n\nI\u2019m tempted to paint a picture of my reaction if I got an NFT as a birthday or Valentine\u2019s present, but I\u2019ll pass. After all, this isn\u2019t about me. So, let\u2019s move on.\n\nWhat if you get a personalised NFT in the form of an exquisite illustration with an inscription of your lover\u2019s name from Anthony Azekwoh? How about joining the whitelist for one of Gustav Klimt\u2019s \u2018The Kiss\u2019 digital masterpieces. Interestingly, gifting NFTs will happen sooner than later because several NFT marketplaces are now available.\n\nMeanwhile, NFT is not such a complex concept, get to know more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVR, like several other emerging technologies, has great potential to blur the lines between what\u2019s real and what\u2019s virtual and, to a large extent, take away the barriers to intimacy. Some companies in the hospitality sector already provide dining experiences in VR, but they cost a lot.\n\nImagine a dinner date at one of your favourite restaurants, complete with all the glam and glimmer. After a two-course meal and a few drinks, you two cuddle up on a sofa, ready to watch your favourite love movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo scenarios can play out here.\n\nYou eat and drink across each other at a table and later get into the immersive world of a movie where you both can create your adventures while holding hands.\n\nBut what if neither of you is physically present on that date?\n\nYou could book a virtual date at a luxury hot spot anywhere in the world, where all you have to do is either wear VR gear or, for a more immersive experience, use a full-scale VR room at different locations. With this, every gesture in real life is translated into your action in that virtual world, and you get to feel everything.\n\nIs this something you\u2019d love to try?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetaverse Magna\n\nWhat\u2019s the buzzword? Metaverse. Although the concept is yet to take form, having a dinner date in the metaverse is not hard to imagine. Of course, it goes beyond having screen time with the love of your life or the regular 3D immersive world that VR offers. It is on a more advanced level.\n\nWhat do you think of having your digital avatar living a separate life in a different realm, booking a dinner date, paying for it, and having it customised to your taste? Yes, my plan is for your imagination to run wild. Go for it!\n\nDrone gift delivery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do you intend to spend your Valentine\u2019s Day? If one of your plans is to send gifts to a loved one, top of your worries is probably getting a reliable delivery service to deliver your flowers, stuffed bears, or food trays. Next is hoping your gifts arrive in one piece.\n\nWith the bad experiences associated with on-demand dispatch riders and delivery services, drone delivery should be considered. This is a common option in Africa\u2019s logistics space, particularly in healthcare, where there are a few use cases like drug delivery.\n\nDrone delivery offers speed because traffic congestion and inaccessible roads don\u2019t pose problems. However, there is a high possibility of theft as drones can be hacked and hijacked.\n\nWould you consider this option if it were available on your online shopping platform?\n\nAI shopping assistant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Andrea De Santis on Unsplash\n\n\u201cHey, Google, what do I get for my boyfriend for Valentine\u2019s Day?\u201d\n\nAs I thought, my google assistant led me to a search page with a sea of generic \u2018what to gets\u2019, which didn\u2019t help much because I still had to go through them to decide what fits.\n\nWhat if there were an AI assistant that crawls your lovers\u2019 Internet footprints \u2014 including google searches and social media activities \u2014 and text messages with their consent to inform suggestions on what to get? With all the data at its disposal, you can be sure to get close to perfect guesses.\n\nNot only that, but the assistant will also search the Internet for merchants that will have the product available at the least possible price. Think Honey or AliExpress shopping assistant, AliHelper.\n\nThinking about it now, a lot of privacy concerns will definitely arise from this especially when it\u2019s done without the other person\u2019s consent to preserve the surprise. But what do they say, \u201cAll is fair in love and war.\u201d Isn\u2019t it?\n\nContemplate for a minute, or two, how addictive love tech innovations can become. Could they replace the need for physical human interaction? As with all things new, especially tech, the possibilities are endless. However, only time will tell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster. Twitter\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They are not interested; they are interested in their own profits. That led us to this arrangement of the Ossiomo power plant, which is working and we are enjoying it here in Government House.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why we cannot connect you to that 24-hour power supply. We are fortunately in the next round of electrification of EBS.\n\n\u201cYou know we\u2019ve done the first 80km, we are going to be doing another 60km. We will be extending the line towards Ikpoba Hill to Auchi Road and will be able to connect you. We had purchased some terrestrial equipment that was destroyed as a result of a storm thunder strike last year.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cI agree with you that we must begin to say more now especially as we head towards 2023 general elections. We are going to be reinstituting the quarterly media briefing. Next to my office, I am building an ultra-modern studio. I am equipping it with very high-end digital cameras so that we will have a venue. It\u2019s going to commence from next quarter.\n\n\u201cWe are going to have every agency of government to have a plan, have its own key performance indicators, and their score cards. They must be able to tell us what they are expected to deliver every year on a quarterly basis and everybody must be free to interrogate the performance of every agency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means you have to also do an evaluation of every person working in government. In terms of the health insurance scheme, I really want to indulge you to key into it, I really don\u2019t see why they can\u2019t provide you free medical services, please explore that,\u201d he charged.\n\nEarlier in his address, Alenkhe reassured the governor of the collaboration of journalists in the state in ensuring the realization of the Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) Agenda.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

We are resolute about reclaiming our party from those who think they can continue to abuse our legacies or even want us to be second fiddles in the party we worked and laboured for. This is our pride and we will sustain it.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you that God is with us. I urge all of our supporters to come all out and back us. Do not have any fears. We are the authentic APC in Osun. If in Lagos, the governor did not do well and the party decided not to return him for a second term, why can\u2019t it be so in Osun? They know what they have done to us is bad and they want to continue the impunity. We will not accept it.\n\n\u201cDo not be disturbed by their threats. Come out en-masse and vote for our aspirant.

          "title": "Re- Tension in Ebonyi over Governorship Zoning, By Abia Onyike",
          "text": "PREAMBLE\n\nOn the 10th of February, 2022, some of my friends and political associates drew my attention to a news story that was trending in the Opera News platform. The title of the news which was presented as features was titled, \u201cTension in Ebonyi over Governorship zoning\u201d. The reporter/writer of the features article cited many sources including myself, but I noticed that I was not only quoted out of context, he probably distorted some facts to arrive at his pre-mediated conclusions.\n\nThe fact, however, is that I promised some of those who called me that I will clear the air on my thoughts regarding the build-up to the 2023 general elections.This my write-up is not only a rejoinder to the article in question but an expose of my own views on the subject matter which may have been distorted beyond comprehension by the article under reference.\n\nGOV. UMAHI\u2019S \u2018EXECUTIVE ORDER\u2019 ON ZONING OF GOVERNORSHIP\n\nGov. David Umahi, in his usual manner of talking, adumbrated his thoughts on the zoning argument two weeks ago when he ordered that the ban on politics had been lifted. He spoke through the State Commissioner for Information, Barr. Uchenna Oji.\n\nThe Governor was quoted to have \u201cexpressed his determination to consult widely especially with the House of Assembly, the Exco, Elders Council, Founding Fathers, Women Organizations, CAN and other relevant groups with a view to getting opinions on where the Governorship position shall be zoned to\u201d.\n\nAfter stating the above, the Governor contradicted himself by stating that : \u201cEbonyi South having benefited from the principle of zoning, shall not be allowed to contest\u201d. Then he threatened that, his \u201cadministration\u2019s support shall be for Abakaliki block\u201d. This is Umahi\u2019s typical style of selling out his people on a sycophantic style, in order to curry the favour of others. His statements are neither logical nor consistent. Ebonyi Central recently benefited under former Gov. Martin Elechi, who handed over to Gov. Umahi in 2015. But Umahi never consulted Ebonyi South leaders before his careless talk, which has become his stock in trade. After all, as Chairman of South-East Governors Forum, he has a terrible reputation as someone who easily sells out Ndigbo for his selfish aggrandizement.\n\nWho gave Gov. Umahi the authorization to decree on the issue of zoning. Is he the political party? Or was he speaking for APC? Can he also speak for PDP or other parties in the state?\n\nEven at that, he has banned Ebonyi South, but finds it difficult to say which zone, between North and Central, should produce it. He is being economical with the truth. He is afraid to hit the nail on the head. He lacks the moral authority to stand firm, hence he prefers to prevaricate.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that Umahi\u2019s resort to block politics will create new problems if he doesn\u2019t watch his utterances. It can remind people of the old Abakaliki and Afikpo blocks and resurrect the unresolved issues sorrounding the Ebonyi Charter of Equity.\n\nIn their seperate comments on the zoning issue, two former Governors, Sen. Sam Egwu and Chief Martin Elechi have been reported to support a return to Ebonyi North zone, from where the zoning arrangement started in 1999.\n\nBut Sen. Obinna Ogba, in his new year Press Conference on 1st January, 2022, opined that the zoning arrangement can not be seen as sacrosanct and that \u201cit cannot be binding as the aspirants were at liberty to contest\u201d\u2026\n\nMy own contribution was that we should all be mindful of our political history in all that we do or say. Dr. Sam Egwu and Chief Martin Elechi are quite right in their support for Ebonyi North and it is difficult to debunk them, if we are to remain logical in our sequencing of events. However, if you support that view, then it means that even Ebonyi Central may be disqualified from contesting. But politics is not as straight forward as mathematics.\n\nTHE JOURNEY SO FAR\n\nSince 1999, it has proved difficult to confine the political contest to particular zones. In the 1999 Guber election, Dr. Sam Egwu of PDP defeated Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu of APP. In 2007, Chief Martin Elechi was declared winner against Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu of ANPP. Even in 2015 when Engr. David Umahi of PDP won as Governor, his opponent was Chief Edward Nkwegu of APC.\n\nBased on these narratives, it is self-evident that it has not been easy to decree on issues relating to jungle politics. Nobody can succeed in suppressing the innate political desires and aspirations of the people. Is it not better to allow for open contest than to bottle up political agitations?\n\nIt is my considered view that even if you come up to say that it is the turn of Ebonyi North zone, you may not succeed in stopping everyone from the Central Zone from contesting. And if you cannot stop anyone from Central, then you cannot summon the moral strength to argue against an aspirant from Ebonyi South zone.\n\nECHOES OF EBONYI CHARTER OF EQUITY\n\nJust last week, some Elders of Ebonyi South zone met and made a vigorous argument that the Ebonyi Charter of Equity is yet to be implemented as envisioned by the Founding Fathers of the State. According to their Press statement, the Charter was drafted and documented but not signed. It was based on a gentleman agreement that power shall rotate between Abakaliki and Afikpo blocks. According to them, when Ebonyi state was created on 1st October, 1996, Abakaliki had six LGAs while Afikpo had four LGAs. Later on, three new LGAs were created, namely Ebonyi, Ezza North and Ivo. So, Abakaliki had eight while Afikpo became five. Abakaliki was later split into two Senatorial districts.\n\nIn the current debate over the zoning if the Governorship seat, echoes of Ebonyi Charter of Equity have started to rent the air. As someone who was active in the last stanza of Ebonyi State Movement (1994-96), I was privy to certain meetings where efforts were made by the Leaders of the Movement to have the Ebonyi Charter of Equity endorsed so as to become a working document. But that did not materialize. In the last two meetings held at the residences of Chief Anthony Ekoh in Abakaliki and Chief Chris Nwankwo in Enugu in January/February, 1996, the leaders agreed on virtually everything but could not append their signatures to the draft on the Charter of Equity which was painstakingly produced by the Committee which included Chief Barr. Okeagu Ogada, Chief Hyacinth Ikpo etc. etc. So, Ebonyi State Movement with Chief Martin Elechi as Chairman and Dr. Ikechukwu Igbo as Secretary, managed to secure the creation of the state with the powerful inputs and influence of other prominent sons and daughters of Ebonyi such as late Ezeogo Dr. Akanu Ibiam, Dr. Offia Nwali, Sen. Chief Chris Nwankwo, Sen. Andrew Nwankwo, Chief Francis Oji, Chief Anthony Ekoh, Dr. Agom Eze, Osuu S.C.Oduko, Dr Chigozie Ogbu, Dr. Emmanuel Oko Isu, Chief Lawrence Nwuruku, Chief Frank Nchita Ogbuewu, Dr. Selina Oko, Dr. Mrs. Uche Azikiwe, Princess Alu Ibiam, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, S.O.Mgbada, Chief Aja Nwachukwu, Chief Henry Ude( Ajimbest) etc. etc.\n\nThough the document on the Charter of Equity was not endorsed, there was an agreement that if Abakaliki became the capital of the new state, the first civilian Governor would come from Afikpo block. However, when the state was created with Abakaliki as capital, new political maneuvers took over. Incidentally, Abakaliki block produced the Governor for 16 years before the present Governor( from Afikpo block) was elected in 2015. Based on this reality, there are those who believe that it may not be out of place to allow another person from Afikpo block to do another tenure.\n\nIn a democracy, all voices are allowed to ventilate their feelings. My message to all politicians and leaders is that they should moderate their actions and utterances with a modicum of responsibility. Those who ignore the lessons of history are bound to repeat it or in the long run, are often ignored by history itself.\n\nAbia Onyike, a former commissioner for information in Ebonyi State, wrote from Abakaliki",

Who told you that, if puts his acts together, he may not win the 2023 gubernatorial election even in a mushroom political party?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cGovernor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike needs not bring his successor early. Aside of his political wizardry, Rivers State is predominantly PDP.\n\n\u201cUbima have an aphorism that says, the snail said he sets his journey early knowing that he has no legs.\n\n\u201cTill now, the public doesn\u2019t know the Rivers APC gubernatorial aspirants. They are waiting for when Oga will endorse; as wont to be the case, in the past. That style failed us in 2015 and in 2019.\n\n\u201cWho is still living in the fool\u2019s paradise of federal might?! There\u2019s no worse tragedy than self-delusion. By now, Rivers APC gubernatorial aspirants should openly be consulting and reaching out, to be known by the public.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDike called on the Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi to declare interest for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nHe said: \u201cBecause of his pan- Nigerian inclination and most importantly, his giant stride in the rail way sector. If he declares, the APC and President Buhari should support him win the primaries.\u201d",

We are not those who play God. We are resolute about reclaiming our party from those who think they can continue to abuse our legacies or even want us to be second fiddle in the party we worked and laboured for.\n\nAregbesola said the party is back in the hands of true progressives who will work assiduously to win in the July 16 governorship election in the state.\n\nHe stated that those at the helm of affairs have also jettisoned true democracy and the principles which the party and its heroes stand for.\n\nThe former governor also noted that the Rasaq Salinsile-led party executives are the authentic APC in Osun.\n\n\u201cAnyone who was with us when we started the journey to reclaim Osun for the progressives in 2004 would know we fought very hard for this victory we have today.\n\n\u201cWe went through several challenges then but through thick and thin, we were able to succeed. This time around, we will succeed.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to allow a free-flow of democratic process to interplay here.

The operation which was intelligence-driven, was undertaken by a Unit of the IRT.\n\n\u201cAlthough the case and the two suspects were subsequently transferred to the NDLEA on January 25, 2022, the findings of the in-house investigation ordered by the Inspector General of Police established reasonable grounds for strong suspicion that the IRT officers involved in the operation could have been involved in some underhand and unprofessional dealings as well as official corruption which compromised ethical standards in their dealings with the suspects and exhibits recovered.\n\n\u201cBeyond this, the Police investigation also established that the international narcotics cartel involved in this case have strong ties with some officers of the NDLEA at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, who are on their pay roll.\n\n\u201cThe two arrested drug couriers confirmed that the modus is for the transnational drug barons to conspire with the NDLEA officers on duty and send them their pre-boarding photographs for identification, seamless clearance, and unhindered passage out of the airport with the narcotics being trafficked.\n\n\u201cThe two arrested drug couriers also confirmed that they have been enjoying this relationship with the NDLEA officers at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport since 2021 and had in this instant case on January 19, 2022, been identified and cleared by the NDLEA officers as customary, having received their pre-departure photographs and other details prior to their arrival in Enugu, and were on their way out with the narcotics when they were apprehended by the Police.\u201d\n\nThe statement further stated that, \u201cThe Police investigations report also indicted DCP Abba Kyari, who had been on suspension for his alleged involvement in a different fraud case being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), for complicity in the allegation of official corruption, tampering with narcotics exhibit and sundry unprofessional conducts that negate the standard administrative and investigative protocols of the Force as well as extant criminal laws.\n\n\u201cIt is to be emphasised that DCP Abba Kyari\u2019s involvement in these allegation occurred while his suspension from service was subsisting. On the strength of the findings of the in-house Police Investigation Panel, the IGP has ordered the immediate arrest and transfer of all the indicted police officers to the NDLEA authorities for conclusive investigation, while appropriate disciplinary actions are also being initiated against them by the Force leadership.\n\n\u201cThe concerned officers include DCP Abba Kyari, ACP Sunday Ubuah, ASP Bawa James, ASP John Umoru (at large), Inspector Simon Agrigba, and John Nuhu. They have all been, accordingly, handed over today February 14, 2022 to the NDLEA authorities.\n\n\u201cIn so doing, the Inspector General of Police has also formally requested that the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency should ensure the identification, arrest and investigation of the Agency\u2019s officers who have also been found to be colluding with the international drug cartel involved in this case towards advancing the anti-narcotics agenda of the federal government.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the Inspector General of Police assures the public of his administration\u2019s commitment to upholding the tenets and values of policing in line with the agenda of ethical regeneration, restoration of professional standard, enhancement of the anti-corruption drive, respect for the rule of law and inter-agency collaboration in the drive to stabilise the internal security order of the country.",

          "text": "The police have arrested a suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari, and four other police officers.\n\nOthers arrested alongside Kyari include ACP Sunday Ubuah, ASP Bawa James, Inspector Simon Agrigba, and Inspector John Nuhu, while the fifth suspect, ASP John Umoru, is still at large.\n\nThey were arrested on Monday for their involvement in an alleged case of criminal conspiracy, discreditable, unethical and unprofessional conduct, official corruption, and tampering with exhibits in a case of illicit drug trafficking involving a perpetual transnational drug cartel, the police said.\n\nDeputy Force Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, who confirmed their arrest in a statement in Abuja, revealed that they have been handed over to authorities of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).\n\nRELATED\n\nWanted Abba Kyari, Four Others Now In Our Custody \u2013 NDLEA\n\nNDLEA Declares Abba Kyari Wanted For Drug Trafficking\n\n\u201cThe arrest of the officers was sequel to pieces of information received from the leadership of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) on 10th February 2022,\u201d said Adejobi who is a Chief Superintendent of Police. \u201cIn line with standard administrative procedure of the Force, the Inspector General of Police ordered a high-level, discreet, and in-house investigation into the allegations.\n\n\u201cThe interim investigations report revealed that two international drug couriers identified as Chibunna Patrick Umeibe and Emeka Alphonsus, both males, were arrested at Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu on the 19th of January 2022 upon their arrival from Addis Ababa aboard an Ethiopian Airlines flight ET917.\n\n\u201cThe arrest led to the recovery of a substantial quantity of powdery substance suspected to be cocaine from the two narcotic couriers. The operation which was intelligence-driven was undertaken by a unit of the Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT).\u201d\n\n\ufeff\n\nStrong Ties\n\nWhile the case and the two suspects were transferred to the NDLEA on January 25, Adejobi explained that the findings of the in-house investigation ordered by the police chief established \u201creasonable grounds for strong suspicion\u201d that the IRT officers involved in the operation could have been involved in some underhand and unprofessional dealings, as well as official corruption which compromised ethical standards in their dealings with the suspects and exhibits recovered.\n\nHe added that beyond this, the police investigation also established that the international narcotics cartel involved in the case had \u201cstrong ties\u201d with some officers of the NDLEA at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu who were said to be on their payroll.\n\nThe two arrested drug couriers, according to the police spokesman, confirmed that the modus is for the transnational drug barons to conspire with the NDLEA officers on duty and send them their pre-boarding photographs for identification, seamless clearance, and unhindered passage out of the airport with the narcotics being trafficked.\n\n\u201cThe two arrested drug couriers also confirmed that they have been enjoying this relationship with the NDLEA officers at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport since 2021 and had in this instant case of 19th January 2022, been identified and cleared by the NDLEA officers as customary, having received their pre-departure photographs and other details prior to their arrival in Enugu, and were on their way out with the narcotics when they were apprehended by the police,\u201d Adejobi recounted.\n\n\u201cThe police investigations report also indicted DCP Abba Kyari, who has been on suspension for his alleged involvement in a different fraud case being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), for complicity in the allegation of official corruption, tampering with narcotics exhibit and sundry unprofessional conducts that negate the standard administrative and investigative protocols of the force, as well as extant criminal laws.\n\n\u201cIt is to be emphasised that DCP Abba Kyari\u2019s involvement in these allegations occurred while his suspension from service was subsisting. On the strength of the findings of the in-house Police Investigation Panel, the Inspector-General of Police ordered the immediate arrest and transfer of all the indicted police officers to the NDLEA authorities for conclusive investigation, while appropriate disciplinary actions are also being initiated against them by the Force leadership.\n\n\u201cThe concerned officers include DCP Abba Kyari, ACP Sunday Ubuah, ASP Bawa James, ASP John Umoru (at large), Inspr. Simon Agrigba and John Nuhu. They have all been, accordingly, handed over today 14th February 2022 to the NDLEA authorities.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the police spokesman said the IGP has formally requested the NDLEA Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to ensure the identification, arrest, and investigation of the anti-drug agency\u2019s officers found to be colluding with the international drug cartel involved in the case.\n\nThe police chief assured Nigerians of the force\u2019s commitment to upholding the tenets and values of policing, in line with the agenda of ethical regeneration, restoration of professional standard, enhancement of the anti-corruption drive, and respect for the rule of law and inter-agency collaboration in the drive to stabilise the internal security order of the country.",

          "title": "NDLEA Declares Abba Kyari Wanted For Drug Trafficking",
          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe National Drug Law Enforcement Agency has declared suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, wanted over alleged links with drug trafficking.\n\nNDLEA spokesperson Femi Babafemi made the announcement during a press conference in Abuja on Monday.\n\nBefore his suspension over links with convicted fraudster Hushpuppi, Mr Kyari was the Commander of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) at the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigerian Police Force.\n\nREAD ALSO: ASUU Declares One-Month Warning Strike\n\nAccording to the NDLEA, he is wanted over his involvement in a 25 kilograms Cocaine deal.\n\nThe Agency said it declared Mr Kyari wanted after all efforts to get him to honour formal invitations for his interrogation failed.\n\nIt bemoaned a situation where those who are supposed to support current efforts to stem the tide of illicit drug trafficking and abuse are themselves neck deep in the menace.\n\n\u201cThere is no better way to start this press briefing than to remind us about the enormity of the drug problem Nigeria has on its hand and the imperative of all well-meaning Nigerians to play a positive role in curbing the illicit drug menace,\u201d Mr Babafemi said on Monday.\n\n\u201cEven before the damning findings of the 2018 National Drug Use and Health Survey, Nigeria\u2019s drug problem was getting close to epidemic proportion. And if anything, the arrests and seizures by NDLEA in the past 12 months is an indication that the country\u2019s drug problem was grossly underestimated before President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s resolve to strengthen the NDLEA and the subsequent launch of offensive action by the Agency to clean the society of the menace.\n\n\u201cAnd in just 12 months, even the most cynical of Nigerians now agree that the country is really in a drug quagmire and therefore appreciates the relentless efforts of NDLEA operatives.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, some law enforcement agents who should be partners in the pursuit of the President\u2019s mandate are at the forefront of breaking the law, as they aid and abet drug trafficking in the country.\n\n\u201cToday, we are forced to declare one of such law enforcement agents wanted in the person of suspended DCP Abba Kyari, the erstwhile Commander of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) at the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigerian Police Force.\n\n\u201cWith the intelligence at our disposal, the Agency believes strongly that DCP Kyari is a member of a drug cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug pipeline, and he needs to answer questions that crop up in an ongoing drug case in which he is the principal actor. His failure to cooperate forced the hand of the Agency and that is the reason for this press briefing.\u201d\n\nThe drug deal\n\nAccording to the NDLEA, Kyari had initiated a call to one of its officers on Friday, January 21, 2022.\n\n\u201cWhen the officer returned the call two minutes later, Kyari informed him he was coming to see him, to discuss an operational matter after the Juma\u2019at service,\u201d Mr Babafemi said.\n\n\u201cHe appeared at the agreed venue of the meeting with the officer and went straight to the crux of the matter. This was it: His team had intercepted and arrested some traffickers that came into the country from Ethiopia with, according to him, 25kg of cocaine. He proposed a drug deal whereby he and his team are to take 15kg of the cocaine and leave 10kg for the prosecution of the suspects arrested with the illicit drug in Enugu. In the meantime, the purloined cocaine will be replaced with a dummy worth 15kg. He asked the NDLEA officer to persuade men of the FCT Command, to play along as well.\n\n\u201cBy 11: 05 am on Monday, January 24, after the Agency gave the officer the green light to play along, he and Kyari began a WhatsApp call for the rest of the day. The officer conveyed \u201ctheir\u201d willingness to play the game.\n\n\u201cAt this point, Kyari disclosed that the 15kg (already taken out) was shared between the informants that provided information for the seizure and himself and his men of the IRT of the Nigerian Police. According to him, the informants were given 7kg while his team took 8kg which was already sold.\n\n\u201cHe then offered to pay the NDLEA team (that is the officer and the FCT commander) by selling, on their behalf, half of the remaining 10kg, thereby further reducing the original cocaine for the prosecution to just 5kg. At N7m per kilogram, the proceed from the 5kg would amount to N35m, at the exchange rate of N570 per dollar being the black market rate for the day, January 24, 2022. In effect, he would be delivering $61, 400 to the NDLEA team. He put pressure on our officer to wrap up the arrangement with the commander of the FCT Command to take custody of the drug and suspects from his men who were on ground in Abuja. At the time, he was speaking from Lagos, where he allegedly travelled for private business.\n\n\u201cThe next day January 25, Kyari offered to send his younger brother to deliver the payment while his men deliver the suspects, but our officer turned down the suggestion, insisting he would rather deal with him in person and was therefore prepared to wait for him to return from Lagos.\n\n\u201cAnd by 5: 23 pm, Kyari was in Abuja and met with the officer at the same rendezvous where they had the first meeting. In their discussion, he disclosed how his team received the information from a double-crosser who betrayed the traffickers to him, showing a sordid connection between law enforcement agents and the drug underworld; he narrated how acting on the tip-off, his team departed Abuja to Enugu and arrested the traffickers, removed part of the consignment on his instruction and replaced same with dummies. He also indicated how to identify the remnant of the original cocaine that would be delivered to NDLEA, five original packages marked with red dots. The reason for this was to avoid the dummies being subjected to test. He forwarded a picture of the marked original cocaine package. According to the plan, once the 5kg cocaine has been tested in the presence of the suspects and confirmed positive, there would be no need to test the remaining ones, being dummies.\n\n\u201cHe also brought with him the money from the sale of the 5kg share of the NDLEA team, a total of $61, 400. Our officer, however, preferred to take the money inside his car. Well, the car was wired with sound and video recorders.\u201d\n\nWhile explaining that relevant channels of communication were duly followed in the demand for Kyari without any result, the NDLEA said it cannot continue to keep other suspects in the case indefinitely while the principal suspect fails to honour official invitation.\n\n\u201cNDLEA has the mandate to take custody of suspects and consignments of drugs seized by other arms of law enforcement,\u201d Mr Babafemi said. \u201cAnd there is a standard protocol for such transfer. This we duly followed. The suspects and drugs were delivered to us on February 8 but the last part of the process, yet to be completed, is the debriefing of Kyari.\n\n\u201cDCP Abba Kyari was invited by NDLEA for debriefing on Thursday February 10 through two main channels because there is a whole lot of questions begging for answers. The invitation was legitimate and formal according to our protocol. But up till the close of office hours on Friday, February 11, he refused to respond. Up till this moment, he hasn\u2019t responded. We are a law-abiding agency of government. We follow due process. In that vein, we will not detain suspects beyond the stipulated period according to the law before we charge them to court. And Kyari must be debriefed before the suspects are arraigned in court.\n\n\u201cHaving failed to honour the official invitation, NDLEA has no option but to declare DCP Abba Kyari of the Nigerian Police WANTED, right from this very moment.\n\nThe NDLEA said that it\u2019s not unaware of threats to the lives of its officers involved in the case, assuring that it would do everything to protect its officers.\n\n\u201cWe are not unaware of threats to the lives of NDLEA officers involved in this investigation, even as we continue to do our best to protect our officers and men in the line of duty.\n\n\u201cWe are making this strong statement to those contemplating harmful action against NDLEA officers. They would only succeed in compounding their problems in the event of the murder of or harm to officers and men of NDLEA.\u201d",

We don\u2019t want our academic calendars disrupted but our demands are not met,\u201d he added.\n\nThe ASUU chairman also said ASUU NEC faulted the creation of new universities.\n\nOsodeke asked the Federal Government to call the Vice-Chancellor of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Prof. Eyitope Ogunbodede, to order over the unpaid Earned Academic Allowances of its members in the university.\n\n\u201cWe have an agreed template with FG but the VC refused to pay. Failure to pay using that template is a misappropriation. He should be cautioned,\u201d the ASUU president said. Members of the union\u2019s National Executive Council had held marathon meetings since Saturday at the University of Lagos titled, \u2018NEC for NEC.\u2019 ASUU had sensitised and mobilised lecturers and students across all universities on the reason the union might likely go on strike. The union had expressed grievances over the failure of the Federal Government to fulfil some of the agreements it made as far back as 2009. ASUU had on November 15, 2021, given the federal government a three-week ultimatum over the failure to meet the demands. The lecturers threatened to embark on another round of industrial action following the alleged \u201cgovernment\u2019s unfaithfulness\u201d in the implementation of the Memorandum of Action it signed with the union, leading to the suspension of the 2020 strike action. After the union\u2019s National Executive Council meeting at the University of Abuja on November 13 and 14, ASUU President, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke, lamented that despite meeting with the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, on October 14, 2021, on issues, including funding for revitalisation of public universities, earned academic allowances, University Transparency Accountability Solution; promotion arrears, renegotiation of 2009 ASUU-FGN Agreement, and the inconsistencies in Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System Payment, none of its demands had been met. Following the threat, the Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, promised that the union would be paid.",
