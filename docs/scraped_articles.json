          "title": "Electoral Act faces delay at National Assembly, harmonisation yet to start",
          "text": "There were strong indications on Thursday that the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill would suffer further delay at the National Assembly as the Senate and the House of Representatives had yet to refer different versions of the bill to the Conference Committee.\n\nThe Senate and the House had on Wednesday reviewed the bill for which the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had withheld assent over the restriction of political parties to direct primaries in the selection of candidates for elections.\n\nBuhari had vetoed the bill and sent it back to the National Assembly over the restriction of political parties to direct primaries, insisting that the parties should be allowed to choose from different options. However, in a later interview on Channels Television, the President said the option of consensus must be included before he would sign the bill.\n\nThe House, however, focused only on the President\u2019s letter alone, arguing that its rules mandated it to focus only on the letter. The lawmakers consequently amended Section 87 of the Electoral Act, 2010, which is Clause 84 of the electoral bill, by inserting the indirect primary option.\n\nThe Senate, however, not only added indirect primary, but also consensus adoption of candidates for elections by a political party.\n\nBy passing different amendments to the bill, the Senate and the House will have to refer the versions to a conference committee to harmonise the differences and report back for final passage and transmission to the President for assent.\n\nAfter the passage on Wednesday, the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, had said the National Assembly would transmit the revised bill to Buhari for assent this week.\n\nLawan, in an interview with State House correspondents on Monday after a meeting with the President at the Presidential Villa in Abuja, however, said if the \u201ccleaning process\u201d took more than a day to complete, then it would be represented to Buhari early next week.\n\nHowever, as of Thursday, neither the Senate nor the House had referred the bills to the conference committee.\n\nReferrals are usually done by the presiding officers in plenary.\n\nThe next sitting by both chambers is on Tuesday, which means the harmonisation process cannot begin before next week.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, state governors under the aegis of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum hailed the Senate for including the consensus option in the bill.\n\nThe governors subsequently asked the House to follow suit but the lower legislative chamber snubbed the demand.\n\nThe NGF Chairman and Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, who spoke to journalists after the governors\u2019 meeting, urged the House of Representatives to do the needful quickly so that the President could sign the bill.\n\nHowever, the lawmaker representing Kebbi South Senatorial District, Senator Bala Ibn Na\u2019Allah, defended the Senate\u2019s decision to include the provision for consensus, adding that it would promote democracy.\n\nHe alleged that the inclusion of mandatory direct primary in the Electoral Act Amendment Bill was the idea of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nNa\u2019Allah further stated that he was told that the provision was meant for a particular individual hence the bill did not go through a thorough process before it was forwarded to the President.\n\n\u201cWe are hearing that that law (direct primary) was intended for an individual. I don\u2019t know. I honestly don\u2019t know but I must say and maintain that the process was not painstaking enough,\u201d said Na\u2019Allah on Channels Television\u2019s Sunrise Daily programme on Thursday.\n\nNa\u2019Allah added that during the discussions at the committee level, the issue of direct primaries was never brought up. The senator said it was when the bill was to be passed before the House that Gbajabiamila included the clause.\n\n\u201cThe issue of direct primary came at the dying minute on the floor of the House of Representatives when they were considering the report of the Committee on Electoral Matters. What it means is that it was never discussed or adopted by the committee of the House, but that it came as an amendment allegedly because I don\u2019t have the records by the Speaker of the House of Representatives,\u201d he added.\n\nNa\u2019Allah stated that the second argument by Gbajabiamila that the direct primary had become necessary in order to protect federal lawmakers from overbearing governors showed that the proposed law was done for personal reasons.\n\nThe senator argued that this was evidence that the law was not done in the interest of Nigerians as such, but for self preservation, which was at variance with the oath of public office.\n\nIn his reaction on the floor of the House, however, a furious Gbajabiamila lamented that some lawmakers were disparaging the National Assembly on television.\n\nHe, however, failed to mention Na\u2019Allah\u2019s name.\n\nThe Speaker said, \u201cHonourable colleagues, I am constrained to say at this point that I watched with dismay this morning some members of this National Assembly exercising their freedom of expression and speech, and that is well within their rights. But when you exercise such freedom, be careful not to mislead the public; be careful not to malign this institution unjustifiably.\n\n\u201cThis leadership has allowed people to express their opinions at all times; I have no problems with that. But when you begin to call the institution, which you are a part of, names and unwittingly maligning even yourself, we need to draw a line, especially when you are peddling untruths. And I just thought it was important that we mention this so (that) in the future, we will be guided both by the freedom of expression and by the truth.\n\n\u201cIt was a show of disgrace as far as I\u2019m concerned. I don\u2019t care what anybody says, the things that were uttered by members of this National Assembly was a show of disgrace! I am extremely disappointed.\u201d\n\nHowever, a member of the House, Uzoma Nkem-Abonta (PDP/Abia), who had gone on television to accuse the National Assembly of being controlled by the executive, apologised on the floor of the House.\n\nGbajabiamila, while accepting the apology, advised members to be very circumspect when they go out in public and express their personal opinions.\n\nMeanwhile, some civil society organisations such as YIAGA Africa, Coalition in Defence of Nigerian Democracy and Constitution, and the Centre for Transparency Advocacy have told The PUNCH that the decision of the Senate and House of Representatives to pass different versions of the electoral bill might lead to delay in presidential assent.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with The PUNCH, the Director of Programmes, YIAGA Africa, Cynthia Mbamalu, said the country \u201cwas running out of time\u201d and that there would be an \u201curgent\u201d need for the immediate harmonisation of the bill.\n\nShe said, \u201cIt is commendable to see that the National Assembly prioritised the review of the Electoral Bill, 2021 and ensured the re-committal of the bill to review Clause 84 on the direct primaries on their resumption.\n\n\u201cWhile this is a positive development, the Senate and the House of Representatives passed different versions of the review to Clause 84 on direct primaries. Considering that we are running out of time, there is an urgent need for the immediate harmonisation of the bill before re-transmitting to the President for assent.\u201d\n\nThe Convener, Coalition in Defence of Nigerian Democracy and Constitution, Dare Ariyo-Atoye, in a separate interview with The PUNCH, agreed with Mbamalu. He added that the failure of the lawmakers to harmonise the bill on time might lead to presidential assent delay.\n\n\u201cWell, while we hope that this is not a part of their delay tactics, it is important to know that we are running out of time and there is a need for the lawmakers to meet and make sure that the bill is harmonised on time. Failure to do this may lead to a delay in presidential assent,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe Director, Centre for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwabushi said, \u201cWhat this has shown Nigerians is that if a bill is at the National Assembly and it is taking like 20 years to be passed, it is a deliberate attempt.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Amidst tight security, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), on Thursday, inaugurated some projects executed by Governor Nasir El-Rufai as part of activities lined up for his two-day official visit to Kaduna State.\n\nBuhari flew into Kaduna on Wednesday night from Banjul, The Gambia, where he attended the inauguration of President Adama Barrow for his second term in office.\n\nAt Kafanchan in the Jema\u2019a Local Government Area of the state, the President landed at the rebuilt multi-purpose Murtala Mohammed Square at exactly 11.45am and inaugurated the complex.\n\nWhile inaugurating the Kawo Bridge, the President recalled how he was almost bombed near the bridge while travelling to Katsina in July 2014.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cThey wanted to blow me (up). But my escort somehow stopped them. Before we came to this bridge, they became so desperate and there was a small market or something like this here.\n\n\u201cThey exploded (detonated) the device (bomb). God protected us and here I am again. Thank you very much your Excellency and remarkably you became my governor. I don\u2019t think I have any input. Zainab Ahmed became my minister of finance. I didn\u2019t know you\u2019re from the gentleman I respect and went to his house. This is a fabulous coincidence and I thank God for it. Therefore, I have taken your loyalty for granted.\u201d\n\nEarlier while inaugurating the ultra modern sports and shopping complex at the Murtala Square, Kaduna, the President showered encomiums on the governor, saying El-Rufai was writing his names in \u201chistory in letters of gold,\u201d because of the laudable projects under the urban renewal projects in the state.\n\nBuhari said though he is from Daura in Katsina State, there was the likelihood of him living in Kaduna State after 2023 when he must have left office.\n\nHe praised the governor, saying that he had done well in transforming the state beyond recognition.\n\nThe President also made a pledge to the people of Kafanchan in Southern Kaduna of the possibility of establishing an air force base in the area to fortify security in the southern part of the state.\n\nBuhari stated this at the palace of the Emir of Jema\u2019a, Alhaji Muhammadu Isa Muhammadu, shortly after inaugurating four township roads constructed by the Kaduna State Government under its urban renewal programme in Kafanchan.\n\nThe President also said the government would look into the possibility of modernising the Kafanchan railway station to boost rail and commercial activities in the area.\n\nThe Emir, who commended the President and the governor for ensuring peace, security and infrastructural development in his domain, said Kafanchan had for ages been a commercial centre of repute in Southern Kaduna.\n\nThe monarch also requested for an air force base in Kafanchan to strengthen the present security network in the area.\n\nThe President hailed El-Rufai for committing himself to changing the face of the state.\n\nWhile noting the impact of the urban renewal programme of the state government, Buhari said he could no longer find his way around Kaduna even though he lived in the city for long.\n\nSome of the 19 completed urban renewal road projects inaugurated by Buhari are the reconstructed Kawo Flyover, an almost one kilometre long dual carriageway with three ground rotaries; the 5.6km Aliyu Makama Road; the multi-storey Basic Education Mega School on Lokoja Road in Rigasa; and the dualised Yakubu Gowon Way and Leventis Underpass in the metropolis.\n\nThe President also inaugurated the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Mando as well as the fertiliser blending plant of the Barbedos Group.\n\nEl-Rufai introduced the Kaduna State Urban Renewal Programme in June 2019, which commenced in Kaduna before those of Kafanchan and Zaria started.\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cThe goal of the urban renewal programme is to regenerate Kaduna, Kafanchan and Zaria, the three major cities in the state.\n\n\u201cThese unprecedented investments in urban infrastructure are to consolidate the state\u2019s position as an investment destination, improve its economic competitiveness and promote the welfare of the residents.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Road transport: Lagos gridlock surmountable -Commissioner",
          "text": "..As Lagos Traffic Radio, LASTMA hold maiden engagement forum\n\n\u2026Awards presented to outstanding programmes dept staff\n\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nLagos State Government has said that the traffic congestion across the metropolis is surmountable as strategic interventions are being deployed to tackle the menace.\n\nCommissioner for Information and Strategy in Lagos State, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso, stated this at the maiden Lagos Traffic Radio 96.1FM and the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority, LASTMA, engagement forum, with the theme: \u2018Repositioning of Traffic Information Agencies for Better Performance\u2019, held at LTV ground, Agindigbi, Ikeja, Lagos.\n\nOmotoso, who described the congestion in Lagos as surmountable, however, urged motorists to be patient with the state government over series of ongoing projects across the state, saying it aimed at easing off menace of traffic congestion.\n\nHe stressed that the project were been executed to beat the 2022 June and July rainfalls, \u201cbecause this is the right opportunity of the dry season to deliver the job. We are only appealing for understanding on the part of the public on the need to exercise patience.\u201d\n\nOmotoso stated: \u201cLet me say this loud and clear: I will not join the rank of those who describe the Lagos traffic as a monster, bandying all manner of suspicious findings. Lagos is not in the rank of London, which has become \u201cthe most congested\u201d as the world recovers from COVID-19. London drivers lost last year an average of 148hours to congestion at \u00a31,211 per driver, according to INRIX.\n\n\u201cThe \u201c2021 Global Traffic Scorecard\u201d states that London tops the list, followed by Paris, Brussels, Moscow, New York, Chicago and Rome. The others in the top ten are Bogota, Colombia, Palermo (Italy) and Istanbul (Turkey).\n\n\u201cThat Lagos is not here, not even in the first 20, means that Sanwo-Olu administration is not joking with traffic management.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the engagement, Omotoso \u201cThis for me, is a potent avenue for capacity building for the two prime agencies. This is, indeed, very significant because the engagement provides a potent platform for the two organisations to synergize, strategise and build on your hitherto work relationship, which has delivered laudable impact in the management of traffic challenges.\n\n\u201cI must state here that the establishment of both agencies is a strategic intervention for traffic decongestion. The birth of LASTMA in the year 2000 has helped in managing the chaotic traffic that characterised Lagos in the 1970s to 2000.\u201d\n\nHe further stressed that since LASTMA\u2019s advent on the transportation scene, traffic management had gone a notch higher, reducing build-ups, which used to stretch several miles in the metropolis. He added that the Agency had also helped in reforming drivers through strict application of the road traffic law and promptly dealing with crashes in the ever-busy roads in Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nCommissioner of Transportation, Dr. Frederic Oladehinde, described the role of both agencies as life-saving, not only to residents of the State, but also motorists plying the various roads and high ways across the metropolis.\n\nRepresented by the Director of Transportation in the Ministry, Azeeez Toriola, the Commissioner said the present administration will not rest on its oars until road users enjoy free flow of traffic movement and this is evident in the various investments in transport infrastructure in the State.\n\nOn his part, the Head of Service (HoS), in the Lagos State Government, Hakeem Muri-Okunola, represented by Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Kamar Olowoshago, stated that the parley was indeed a laudable initiative, where issues relating to effective traffic management in the State could be exhaustively examined and relevant issues duly identified, distilled and refocused.\n\nHe added that: \u201cThe theme of the engagement, \u2018Repositioning of Traffic Information Agencies for Better Performances\u2019 cannot, therefore, be more appropriate. It would be stating the obvious to observe that one of the focal points of the T.H.E.M.E.S Agenda of the present Administration is Traffic Management and Transportation which is, indeed, the first pillar of the Agenda.\n\n\u201cRoad Transportation, as we all know, is the most commonly used form of transportation in the world. And the importance of a forum such as this is further underscored by the status of Lagos as a mega City and one of the fastest growing cities in the world. Therefore, engagement fora such as this one, I believe, would offer various stakeholders in transportation sector the opportunity to come up with different workable ideas that would be beneficial to the Traffic Information Agencies in the State.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he added that transportation challenges in Lagos is a collective responsibility, therefore, he admonished that everything should not be left to government alone, as each and everyone had a vital role to play in ensuring a safe and secure road transportation system across the state.\n\nGeneral Manager of Lagos Traffic Radio, Tayo Akanle, said the event was unique because it was the first time such an official engagement would be holding between the two Agencies, despite the cordial relationship which started 10 years ago. He said, arguably, both agencies formed one of the strongest partnerships in the Lagos State Public Service as at today.\n\nHe assured that the dire need to interrogate the process of bringing forth traffic information, to come up with practicable solutions to challenges therein and ultimately improve the service delivery while adding value to motorists /commuters in Lagos, which was basically the reason for the engagement, would be robustly explored.\n\nThe highpoint of the event was the presentation of awards to outstanding programmes department staff of both Agencies.\n\nOutstanding Programmes Officer of the Year 2021 award was presented to Mr. Adeshina Adeosun; Mr. Micah Aruocha (aka MC Ice); Mr. Akan Usen; Mrs. Adebowale Yusuff (aka Iya Sharwama) and Mrs. Folashade Temitope Aderohunmu.\n\nIn the category of Outstanding Traffic Reporter of the Year, the awards, Mr. Olayiwola Olanrewaju; Mr. Awotola Victor Olatunde; Mr. Awotungase Sulaiman Adelaja-Asst. Comptroller, LASTMA; Mr. Awotola Victor Olatunde and Mr. Ogunwale Adetoye Gbolahan, emerged winners.",

          "title": "There should be plan to sustain rice revolution \u2013 Onamade",
          "text": "Onamade\n\nAs President Muhammadu Buhari, Tuesday unveiled the mega Rice Pyramids in Abuja, the Global Director of Bellefu Digital Agro Connect owners of bellefu.com, Olabowale Onamade, said as commendable as the rice project spearheaded by the Central Bank of Nigeria is that the government should also pay attention to other areas of the agricultural sector like post harvest.\n\nHere is an excerpt from the interview\n\nOn sustaining the rice revolution project\n\nNigeria and Nigerians have had a lot of abandoned projects scattered all over the country. Several projects have become moribund due to a lack of consistency in government policy formulation and implementation.\n\nWhen a particular government begins a project or formulates a policy and could not complete the project or fully implement the policy before the end of its tenure, the incoming administration abandons such project/policy and starts its project which may not be completed as well before the expiration of its tenure.\n\nA good example of this is the LAKE RICE. Where is Lake Rice today? The Lagos state government under former Governor Akinwunmi Ambode signed a partnership with his Kebbi State counterpart, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu. The MoU between the two states for the supply of LAKE (an acronym of Lagos and Kebbi) RICE was birthed in 2016.\n\nREAD ALSO:Reps\u2019 new bill prescribes 10 year jail terms for illegal Ponzi scheme promoters\n\nImmediately Ambode left office, and barely four years after the launch of the LAKE RICE, it has completely gone off the markets.\n\nTo where? Why? These are questions Lagosians and many other Nigerians still ask but with no answer from anywhere or anyone. So, what is the future of the rice pyramids after this present government leave office?\n\nOn Post Harvest Loss\n\nIn Nigeria, POSTHARVEST LOSSES, PHL, is responsible for wiping out as much as half of the harvests for some crops, particularly perishable crops such as tomatoes, vegetables, and fruits. Some of these losses occur on the farm, during harvest, gathering, and others occur while the commodities are in transit, during offloading, due to poor handling, and in varying degrees in the entire process from farm to fork. It does not end at just perishables, but even commodities such as grains.\n\nPost-harvest losses in Nigeria have been estimated to range between 5 and 20 per cent for grains; 20 per cent for fish and as high as between 50 and 60 per cent for tubers, fruits and vegetables.\n\nPost-harvest loss is not just a crop thing, it affects even dairy, where if one milks a cow and it is not properly preserved or processed within three hours, it will go completely bad.\n\nTo handle these losses, more cold storage rooms, silos and other modern storage facilities need to be provided by the government.\n\nBellefu.com being a digital marketing platform for agricultural produce/products has the potential of helping farmers reduce postharvest losses as it establishes a strong connection among farmers (local and international) and other members of the agricultural family/community.\n\nAs per rice in Nigeria, it is currently the leading food crop and is cultivated in all the agro-ecological zones, from the Sahel of the far north, through the Savannah grassland of the north-central to the mangrove and swampy ecologies of the south.\n\nIn 2016, the total estimated paddy production in Nigeria was 17.5 million metric tons (MMT) which is equivalent to 5.7 MMT milled rice. This is 1.3 MMT lower than the projected 7.0 MMT national consumption demands.\n\nThis implies that Nigeria is progressing towards achieving self-sufficiency in rice if this data is compared with 3.5 MMT milled rice production in 2010.\n\nBut about 10% \u2013 30% or more of this increase does not reach the final consumers largely due to inefficient post-harvest management practices.\n\nHuge post harvest grain loss (PHGL) and postharvest grain quality loss (PGQL) have been reported and significant efforts have been made towards reducing them and improving food security, but this is hampered by a lack of simple, cost-effective, adaptable and well-defined practical postharvest management practices and technologies.\n\nOn how Postharvest Loss can be handled\n\nAccording to a study, the main hotspots for post-harvest losses are harvesting and parboiling followed by losses occurring during milling. To handle this issue of PHL effectively, the provision of modern storage and processing facilities such as rice destoners, metal silos and Purdue Improved Crop Storage by the government and NGOs at subsidized rates can help.\n\nFurthermore, UTILIZATION OF RICE HARVESTING/PROCESSING BY-PRODUCTS \u2013 the husk, the straw and the bran \u2013 should be considered. Rice bran contains 10\u221223% bran oil. The oily nature makes bran an excellent binder for animal feeds.\n\nBran oil, once stabilized and extracted, is a high-quality vegetable oil for cooking or eating. The conventional use of rice bran is as an ingredient for animal feeds, in particular ruminants and poultry. In recent years, however, advances in stabilization techniques have been made which has led to new uses for bran and its derivatives, most notably bran oil for cooking and waxes for cosmetic products. Common products from rice husk are solid fuel (i.e., loose form, briquettes, and pellets), carbonized rice husk produced after burning, and the remaining rice husk ash after combustion.\n\nRice straw can be used in carbonization, composting, fodder, and production of biogas among others.\n\nIt is instructive to note that bellefu.com has a training platform where farmers in Nigeria can be trained and exposed to various innovations in agriculture to make good use of the by-products of various agricultural products.\n\nbellefu.com organizes webinars twice a month and farmers can take advantage of these opportunities to learn and increase their knowledge base.",
          "summary": "On how Postharvest Loss can be handledAccording to a study, the main hotspots for post-harvest losses are harvesting and parboiling followed by losses occurring during milling.\nRice bran contains 10\u221223% bran oil.\nBran oil, once stabilized and extracted, is a high-quality vegetable oil for cooking or eating.\nThe conventional use of rice bran is as an ingredient for animal feeds, in particular ruminants and poultry.\nCommon products from rice husk are solid fuel (i.e., loose form, briquettes, and pellets), carbonized rice husk produced after burning, and the remaining rice husk ash after combustion.",

          "text": "From Uche Usim, Abuja\n\nFollowing years of inactivity of the concessioned six Inland Container Depots (ICDs) located in each geo-political zone of Nigeria, the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) on Wednesday, held a meeting with the Nigerian Shippers\u2019 Council (NSC) who are the owners of the project and the concessionaires.\n\nThe meeting, which was at the instance of the ICRC, the agency of government under the Presidency charged with the responsibility of regulating all government concessions and Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), sought to find solutions to the factors hindering the completion of the dry ports whose contracts were signed since 2006.\n\nActing Director General of the Commission Mr Michael Ohiani at the meeting stressed that 16 years after the concession contracts were signed, some of the ICDs were still at five per cent completion while only two had gotten to 55 per cent and 68 per cent, hence the need for the meeting.\n\nAlso at the meeting was Dr Jobson Ewalefoh, ICRC\u2019s Director of Contract Compliance Department and his team.\n\nSpeaking further, the Ag. DG said, \u201cWe want to rub minds and come up with how we can make progress: what are the challenges taking into consideration that these projects have already gotten Mr President\u2019s attention and more so, we need to decongest our seaports. Also when completed, these ICDs will bring the required benefit to our citizens and our country Nigeria\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are not unaware that at the material time that the contracts were signed, ICRC as a Commission had not been set up, so no proper Outline Business Cases (OBCs) were done for the projects like we now do, but I want us to have a frank discussion so that we can chart a way forward.\u201d\n\nThe Commission reminded the concessionaires and NSC that by its Act, it is to take custody of all PPP contracts including the ones for the ICDs.\n\nThe concessionaires and states where the ports are located include Oyo State (Ibadan) with 50,000 Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs), by Catamaran Logistics Ltd; Abia State (Isiala Ngwa) with 50,000 TEUs by Eastgate Ltd; Plateau State (Jos) with 20,000 TEUs by Duncan Maritime Nig. Ltd; Kano State (Dala) with 20,000 TEUs by Dala Inland Dry Port Ltd.; Katsina State (Funtua) with 10,000 TEUs by Equatorial Marine Oil and Gas Ltd. and Borno state (Maiduguri) with 10,000 TEUs by Migfo Nigeria Ltd.\n\nBased on the last assessment presented to the ICRC by the NSC, the percentage progress made by the concessionaires were: Oyo state \u2013 10%, Abia state \u2013 5%, Plateau State 29.7%, Kano state \u2013 55%, Katsina State \u2013 68% and Borno State \u2013 5%.\n\nHowever, the concessionaires told the ICRC that the 16 years journey had been fraught with various challenges which had hampered any progress that could have been recorded.\n\nThe concessionaires complained of poor cooperation from state governments who mostly delay in meeting their own part of the agreement, for instance in the area of land provision.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nAnother major challenge they emphasised was the lack of narrow gauge rail lines in and out of the dry ports which they noted was important to make the operation of the ports efficient. They added that access to funds also remained a major issue even as banks and foreign investors make unreasonable demands for assets and bank bonds before the release of funds.\n\nThe concessionaires unanimously stressed the need for the ports being constructed to be given the status of port of origin and destination and also to be registered with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) upon completion.\n\nIn view of the delay in execution, the concessionaires stressed the need for a new agreement, pointing out that an agreement started in 2017 between them and the NSC but it was yet to be cleared by the Federal Ministry of Justice on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Transportation.\n\nThey however commended the ICRC for its intervention and also appreciated the NSC for their support so far, noting that they were confident that under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, the contracts will be sorted out.\n\nThe concessionaires pledged their commitment to seeing the concession to conclusion and the ports operational even as two of the concessionaires, Equatorial Marine Oil and Gas Ltd for the Katsina ports and Dala Inland Dry Port for the Kano Ports declared that their ports will commence operation before the third quarter of 2022.\n\nMr Usman Iya Abbas, Managing Director of Equatorial Marine Oil and Gas Ltd informed the ICRC team that the Funtua port was already at over 85 per cent completion and was ready to launch before the end of the second quarter of 2022.\n\n\u201cWe hope to commission this project before the end of the second quarter and the ports will become functional immediately. We are lucky to have great relationships in the shipping industry and with major shipping lines.\n\nAhmed Rabiu, Managing Director of the Dala Inland Dry Port Limited, concessionaires of the Kano Inland Port also hinted that the construction of the container depot was already nearing completion. He assured that the company was working assiduously to ensure project completion and take off before the end of March 2022.\n\nOn his part, Dr Ewalefoh of the ICRC who chaired the technical session of the meeting assured the concessionaires of the continuous support of the Commission, charging them however to send a detailed update of the contract status reports to the ICRC.\n\nHe further enjoined the other four concessionaires who were yet to make remarkable progress in their contract execution to emulate the milestone recorded by the other two who were finalizing their constructions, so that the ports can yield the economic benefits for which the concessions were granted.",

Nnamdi Kanu) pursuant to his unlawful expulsion from Kenya to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAn order mandating and compelling the Nigerian government to forthwith release Nnamdi Kanu from detention and to restore him to his liberty, same being his state of being as of 19th June, 2021 and to thereupon repatriate him to Britain, his country of domicile and citizenship.An order mandating and compelling the Nigerian government to issue an official letter of apology to Nnamdi Kanu for the infringement of his fundamental rights, and publication of said letter of apology in three national dailies.\u201d\n\nAfter the suit was heard and concluded on December 10 last year, Justice Anya fixed yesterday for judgment. In a judgment that lasted for an hour, the judge said his court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate in the applicant\u2019s reliefs Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6.

That he is in detention today was because they said he jumped bail, but with the court\u2019s ruling, that issue will be put to rest.\u201d\n\nEjimakor said he may approach another court, or the Appeal Court, in respect of the rendition matter which the Abia High Court declined jurisdiction.",

          "title": "Topship goes from being an Instagram business to a YCombinator company",
          "text": "\u201cOur overarching goal is to make shipping in and out of Africa as easy as booking an Uber or Airbnb,\u201d Moses Enenwali, founder and CEO of Topship, a Nigerian logistics startup digitising Africa\u2019s shipping experience, told TechCabal over a call.\n\nThat\u2019s an ambitious statement from a company that was operating only on Instagram just 18 months ago.\n\nOn January 14, the company announced that it got into the 2022 Winter Batch of Y Combinator (YC) and has updated its LinkedIn profile name to include \u201c(YC W22)\u201d\u2014a signature identity tag for YC companies.\n\nYC brings validation to companies it backs and, besides, the accelerator\u2019s usual $125K investment\u2014now $500K\u2014the programme exposes startups to global attention, high-level strategic advice, and a lifetime of high-networth connections.\n\nBut how did an Instagram business pivot into becoming a tech startup and then get into YC, the world\u2019s biggest accelerator programme with a 1.5% acceptance rate?\n\nFor Enenwali, it\u2019s the culmination of years of toiling as an employee and months of aggressive legwork as a founder.\n\nThe journey began in 2014 after Enenwali returned to Nigeria from the UK and went straight into the busy world of consulting at Ernst & Young, where he would work for almost a year and a half before moving on to Africa Courier Express (ACE), a Lagos-based logistics business founded by a co-founder of Jumia and Lidya, Tunde Kehinde. At ACE, Enenwali was a senior client manager.\n\nThough the role was his first professional job in logistics, it wasn\u2019t his first experience in the sector. Back in university, Enenwali had run a side business called Timewall Company, where he imported and distributed coffee beans sourced from Plateau State, Nigeria, in the UK.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfter ACE, he joined another logistics startup Sendbox, a YC-backed Nigerian company that provides deliveries for e-commerce and social commerce sellers locally and internationally. Enenwali spent over 4 years at Sendbox and wore a lot of hats including growth, product, and partnerships. By the time he quit to focus on building Topship, he was already fully exposed to the fragmented nature of shipping to and from Africa.\n\n\u201cI spoke to a lot of people and realised that not a single person has had a delightful shipping experience [to and fro Africa]. The complaints were majorly around transparency, loss or damage of orders, difficulty of accessing shipping services, ridiculous pricing, and heavy customs duties,\u201d said Enenwali.\n\nSo, in June 2020, Enenwali started Topship as a one-man shop, opened an Instagram account and started helping people to move parcels locally. Then he started reaching out to merchants shipping within and beyond Africa. He\u2019d also visit merchants physically to prospect them.\n\nCOVID disrupted a lot of things and logistics was one of the industries that took the heaviest blow. So, leveraging on this gap to give people good shipping deals was Enenwali\u2019s trump card.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult enterprise but not an impossible one,\u201d he said.\n\nBecoming a tech startup\n\nTopship continued to gain traction under the radar; satisfied customers referred their friends and acquaintances to this new Instagram platform helping folks to ship seamlessly.\n\nThis continued until March last year when Enenwali had a clear grasp of the business\u2019s use case and thought he could build a Flexport for Africans. But to be Africa\u2019s Flexport, Topship had to be a full technology company, so Enenwali decided to build software that handles the end-to-end process. The company then raised $300K pre-seed, brought in Junaid Babatunde as co-founder and CTO, and built a small team that would accelerate its digital transformation.\n\nTopship now has a web app that allows merchants and individuals to book a door-to-door shipment. It has also extended its shipping offerings from only parcels to include cargos and freight to and from anywhere in the world.\n\nSince launching, Enenwali said the company has onboarded over 1,800 users, and 700 of them are active businesses that have been vetted and verified. These businesses regularly use Topship for their local and international shipment. The remaining users are mostly individual users who only do one-time shipping, or ship at intervals. Enenwali also mentioned that the company has completed 7,000 shipments and is currently maintaining a 100% year-on-year growth rate.\n\nOn revenue, Enenwali said the company has 3 sources of income: it sells shipping insurance to its users; charges a markup fee on every transaction; and also charges for clearing customs when applicable.\n\nTopship is not the only African tech startup trying to digitise the shipping experience: there are a couple of them including Kenyan\u2019s Sote, Nigerian MVX, OnePort 365, the CEO\u2019s former employer Sendbox, and more. But Enenwali doesn\u2019t see them as competitors; to him they are potential partners. He believes this legacy sector is one big broken giant that would take a whole village to fix. So, everybody building in that space is contributing to the underlying infrastructure needed for mass adoption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not competing against any startup because, trust me, nobody has it all figured out. We\u2019re all competing against the current traditional system of moving goods to and from Africa,\u201d Enenweli said when asked about competition. \u201cWe are currently building an infrastructure and, once we\u2019re done, tech startups that are trying to solve the same problem would be able to plug into what we\u2019ve built and serve their users.\u201d\n\nThe Topship team understands that to bring their big plan to fruition, it has to engage a lot of third parties at every stop in the value chain. There\u2019s a lot of manual heavy lifting going on behind the scenes that needs to be handled by partners. Enenwali confirmed that to create a trustworthy end-to-end seamless experience, they have partnered with a lot of stakeholders across the world and, now, its users can ship globally.\n\nThough the company keeps experimenting and arriving at different iterations of its solution, the CEO believes that if Flexport can do it, Topship, too, can.\n\nFlexport, the San Francisco-based shipping giant, was part of the YC 2014 Winter Batch and went on to raise $20 million after graduation. In 2020, it generated $1.7 billion in revenue.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious Topship is really going all-in on its adoption of the Flexport model; it\u2019s already a tech-enabled business and in YC, just like Flexport. But will it scale and raise $20 million? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, what\u2019s certain is Enenwali\u2019s passion and confidence about fixing the broken shipping chain for Africans.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Moni Africa leverages social trust to finance mobile money agents",
          "text": "Over the past few years, the agency banking industry in Nigeria has grown by leaps and bounds, driven by a group of fintech players\u2014including OPay, TeamApt, and Paga\u2014that dominate the landscape as well as commercial banks. The latter boasts extensive agent networks for last-mile delivery of financial services, especially in areas where it makes little economic sense to set up branches.\n\nAgency banking is a branch of mobile payments and a major enabler in Nigeria has been the central bank-led Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities (SANEF) initiative, which makes it relatively easy to become an agent. Essentially, anyone with a shop can serve as an agent for a bank or a mobile payments company. Today, at least 60% of Nigerian agent outlets double as retail stores and informal traders with a POS device in their possession.\n\nWith more than 230,000 agents in Nigeria, as of 2019, the growing network is a crucial distribution channel for financial services while providing a means of livelihood for the agents themselves. But to operate profitably, constant access to working capital, in cash, is required almost every time as the bulk of transactions done through POS are withdrawals. However, most agents do not have such liquidity and end up accruing 20\u201330% in expense to rebalance and manage liquidity.\n\nFemi Iromini, a former World Bank consultant, first learned about this problem in early 2020, through a family friend who\u2019d started a mobile money business, which he invested in, and noticed was always in need of cash. \u201cAfter two to three months of launch, the business had expanded but there was always that demand for cash to meet transaction targets,\u201d Iromini said in an interview.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFollowing a conversation in November 2020 with a cluster of mobile money agents in the Shapati community in Lekki-Ajah, Lagos, one thing was clear to Iromini: liquidity is a major challenge plaguing the mobile money ecosystem. He then teamed up with Dapo Sobayo, who has experience in transforming legacy systems to digital from co-building businesses like Zedvance and SEL Capital, to launch Moni\u2014a float-as-a-service startup that offers low-interest loans to communities of mobile money agents through a referral and trust vetting system\u2014last year.\n\n\u201cWhen we met them, the pain was there. Several complaints of long queues at banks,\u201d Iromini told TechCabal. \u201cIf you start a mobile money business with \u20a6200,000, you might need to visit the bank almost daily because you\u2019ll run out of cash.\u201d This can be daunting in areas where bank branches are scarce and agency banking is needed the most. Agents face a significant risk of theft and long queues while journeying to rebalance their accounts and might lose the customers\u2019 trust when they frequently turn down cash requests.\n\n99.9% repayment rate\u2026so far\n\nAcross Africa, many startups are solving the float problem for small businesses in one form or another. What makes Moni Africa unique is that while its peers rely on databases of local credit bureaus to give out loans (and record alarming default rates of at least 30%), the startup operates a community lending system it claims has helped achieve a 99.9% repayment rate.\n\nUnder this system, Iromini explains that groups of lenders, usually women and traders, have communal relations, share joint responsibility for loans collectively taken, and make sure one another doesn\u2019t default to ensure the sustainability of the line of credit.\n\nMoni was built on this fundamental socioeconomic behavior, that emerging markets are naturally community-based, as against lending based on statements of accounts or credit ratings, which most underbanked agents don\u2019t have. The startup instead leverages an algorithm developed around social trust and social underwriting that\u2019s seen the platform achieve a highly impressive repayment rate.\n\n\u201cSocial intelligence is something you can\u2019t get from statements of accounts so we are able to combine that offline intel with our online intel. We\u2019ve had a case where an agent wanted to use the loan obtained for a wedding but through social intelligence, we were able to stop it,\u201d Sobayo, who serves as the startup\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), said.\n\nThe social underwriting model by Moni operates alongside a referral plan through which agents are continuously compensated on every loan repaid by every agent they refer. This gives them a sense of extra caution with referrals as not only is their commission at stake if the agent defaults, they might also not be able to access loans subsequently.\n\n\u201cIn our agent referral plan, we don\u2019t do automatic or express selection. Our algorithm selects 1% of 1% who are trustworthy. Once invited to the platform, we give you a business performance test and we have a simple benchmark of what your numbers should be like if you\u2019ve been doing business for a certain number of years,\u201d the CTO added.\n\nMoni Africa co-founders, Femi Iromini (left) and Dapo Sobayo.\n\nStarting out, Moni disbursed over 1,000 loans using WhatsApp and Google form before eventually building out the mobile platform that fulfils agent credit requests in less than 5 minutes.\n\nIn less than a year since it launched, Moni has spread across all states in Nigeria and has also expanded to Benin Republic and Guinea. The platform has been able to disburse over $5 million (\u20a62 billion) through 10,000 loans to thousands of agents, with a team strength of 12-13 members; 60% of which are focused on engineering.\n\nMoni Africa claims its revenue has grown 50% month-on-month so far and most of its agents, about 70% of which are women, have grown their businesses by 3x. \u201cMost agents on the Moni network start with an average working capital of \u20a6100,000 but grow to like \u20a6700,000 or \u20a61 million,\u201d Iromini said.\n\nIts 0.1% default rate, according to the CEO, can be attributed to the platform\u2019s community-based model and interest rate which supports the unit economics of a mobile money agent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a quality network of agents that love our product and have built that social trust with our brand so we can distribute other products like savings, commerce, payments, etc. through them because trust is a currency you spend,\u201d he said.\n\nMoni Africa recently got admitted into YCombinator and has closed a pre-seed round from leading investors such as MAGIC Fund, Voltron Capital, Ventures Platform, ex-Managing Partner of Softbank\u2019s Latin America fund, Murtaza Ahmed, Ventures Kinetics, Aidi Ventures, Kola Aina, among others. In the long run, the startup plans to expand its community-finance model beyond mobile money agents to different SMEs across Africa.\n\n\u201cMAGIC is delighted to back Moni as they solve a major pain point of agent banking networks, across Africa \u2014 liquidity. The infusion of social trust into Moni\u2019s products is unique and we\u2019re confident that the team will build an economic infrastructure that would impact underserved sectors across Africa,\u201d said Temi Awogboro, the Fund\u2019s General Partner, Africa.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What exactly is Web3?",
          "text": "Venture capitalists (VCs) and investors in Silicon Valley are saying the internet will evolve to become a place where users will be able to run their own servers, control how their data is used and shared by third parties, own digital property, and have access to a seamless and borderless payment system based entirely on the internet. But not many people have a clear picture of this great vision.\n\nTo explain it in one word, Web3 is all about decentralisation\u2014from platforms Meta, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon; governments; and the traditional financial system. By placing power in the hands of individuals instead, Web3 promises to deepen the democratisation of the internet.\n\nTo help you understand this promised new dispensation of the internet, let\u2019s take you through the origins of the previous and current versions of it.\n\nA brief history of the internet\n\nWeb 1.0 (Web1), the earliest version of the internet, existed roughly between the early 1990s and mid-2000s and was characterised by web pages that were static or read-only. This version of the internet was built by web developers to deliver mostly texts and graphics to participants, who could only consume the content but not interact with it. This version is considered decentralised because it used open-source internet protocols from the 1970s and 1980s, where anyone could build on them without permission from any quarters.\n\nAfter Web1, came Web2\u2014the version we have now\u2014which is a product of the Dotcom Bubble burst, where the initial rush of investments in internet-based companies yielded losses. This was historic as it helped filter out shams and highlight the real success stories, which laid the foundation for subsequent successful internet companies. While Web2 can be explained to be when the internet became an interactive and a social web\u2014where everyone with access to it could create content\u2014it is much more than that.\n\nA year and a half after the term \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d was popularised, there was still a lot of debate as to what it meant. At some point, it was even labelled a meaningless marketing buzzword. (You might have heard this said about Web3 now.)\n\nWeb 2.0 is characterised by tech companies that build their own platform on the free layer of the internet and lock it in while providing a rich user experience that prevents users from wanting to leave. In this version of the internet, apps are built in a way that allows users to become creators. YouTube, Google, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media are some popular examples of Web 2.0 applications.\n\nWeb2 companies build sleek and revolutionary apps that become popular quickly, and as the app\u2019s popularity increases, so does its user base. While users can access these applications for free, they pay by inadvertently offering up their personal data, which Web2 companies sell to advertisers and sometimes political campaigners. Consequently, some of these companies have grown to become the most valuable in history\u2014in less than two decades.\n\nSince these web apps are controlled by a single internet company, users can only use them as long as the company wants them to. This is one of the reasons ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, decided to abandon centralised systems and, subsequently, create the widely used cryptocurrency. The Russian-Canadian programmer wrote on his personal website: \u201cI happily played World of Warcraft during 2007\u20132010, but one day, Blizzard [the maker of the game] removed the damage component from my beloved warlock\u2019s Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realised what horrors centralised services can bring.\u201d\n\nAll these confer so much power on these companies and make data breaches more dangerous and frequent. Additionally, governments have used centralisation to bully internet companies to censor or shut down the accounts of dissidents. This is usually because the government knows the exact company and centralised servers it is targeting.\n\nIs Web3 the next version of the internet?\n\n\u201cWeb3\u201d was coined in 2014 by Gavin Wood, president and founder of Web3 Foundation, and he said then that it was going to be the next version of the internet. At the time, Wood had just developed ethereum, the cryptocurrency whose prominence and market size is behind only bitcoin.\n\nWeb3 will be built on the blockchain\u2014a network of multiple servers (peer-to-peer nodes) working independently from different parts of the world. But what is truly enticing about Web3 is its strong financial implications\u2014also tied to cryptocurrency. Proponents of Web3 believe it will remake the way the world works\u2014reshaping organisations, money, value, rights, the internet, and even liberal democracy.\n\nAt the core of Web3 is decentralised finance (DeFi), which aims to take power away from traditional governmental institutions and corporations. The term \u201cDeFi\u201d was coined in a Telegram group by a community of software developers and entrepreneurs who sought a name for a new financial system that would be automated, outstrip traditional banks, and place a premium on individualism (as against institutions) by using a blockchain. As a matter of fact, black people are quite certain that DeFi or crypto presents the key to a better future for them. So, it\u2019s not surprising that they would seek refuge in a system that doesn\u2019t centre their exploiters.\n\nWeb3 intends to disrupt the way startups, businesses, and organisations are run, through decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs)\u2014a social community of like-minded people who create rules and regulations embedded in programming code called a smart contract and may issue governance tokens. In comparison to traditional companies, DAOs have a democratised organisation. The governance of DAOs is based on community. All the members of a DAO need to vote for any changes to be implemented.\n\nIn DAOs, decisions regarding the design of products and spending of funds can be made only if members vote and an agreement is reached. In September last year, the Blockchain Nigeria User Group, a group of blockchain developers, created one of Africa\u2019s first DAOs, called BNUGDao.\n\nThat brings us to decentralised applications (dApps), which are powered by smart contracts\u2014a decentralised network, instead of a single server. A dApp may feel like your regular app, but it uses the ethereum blockchain for data storage and smart contract for its app logic. Examples of dApps include OpenSea, Rarible, Metamask, Audius, etc.\n\nWho are Web3\u2019s champions?\n\nIn this thread republished as an article, Andreessen Horowitz partner, Chris Dixon, who has been called the \u201cKing of Web3\u201d, in an argument in favour of Web3, wrote: \u201cTokens align network participants to work together towards a common goal\u2014the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This fixes the core problem of centralised networks, where the value is accumulated by one company, and the company ends up fighting its own users and partners.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that Dixon\u2019s firm has invested a massive amount of money in cryptocurrency companies and stands to gain heavily from the success of Web3. This is, in fact, why some other tech founders like Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk believe that it is just a marketing ploy by rich investors to further enrich themselves.\n\nWhile some believe that the decentralisation that Web3 proposes will come from ethereum, at the polarising end are people like Jack Dorsey who believe that bitcoin, not ethereum, is the only cryptocurrency that is truly decentralised.\n\nOne more problem: This version of the internet could be difficult for ordinary users to adopt, as they would need high technical literacy to use blockchain-based internet products. That is why Nigerian crypto entrepreneur, Yele Bademosi, started out his Web3 development plan in Africa with Breach, a platform that uses newsletters, blog posts, quizzes, etc to teach Africans complex Web3 topics.\n\n\u201cTo those who don\u2019t believe, everything is too early until it\u2019s not. My general focus is on builders and believers. And through the products that we build and the traction that we will get, we get more believers over time,\u201d said Bademosi, who is also the founder of Nestcoin, an African company that is building in the Web3 ecosystem with products like a pay-to-earn-crypto game, Metaverse Magna; the earlier-mentioned publication Breach; and a DAO.\n\nAn internet version where it\u2019s easier to monetise content?\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent time on Twitter, you must have seen discussions on why Web3 technology, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) powered by ethereum, are either useful or worthless evidence of ownership of digital assets. In case you don\u2019t know, NFT uses blockchain technology to allow individuals and artists to claim ownership and sell their digital assets.\n\nLast week, OpenSea raised $300 million and is now valued at $13 billion. The company, which was founded in 2017, hugely benefited from the huge investment in NFT that dominated last year and facilitated $14 billion worth of transactions, representing a massive increase from a now meagre $22 million recorded in 2020. It is important to note that OpenSea charges a 2.5% transaction fee and, this year already, trading volume has passed $1 billion.\n\nAfrican creators, like others around the world, have benefited from NFT: Nigerian artist Jacon Oshinachi sold 3 NFT arts worth $70,000 in just 10 days; South African artist Norman O\u2019Flynn sold the country\u2019s first-ever NFT for around $35,000 in March; and, in April, Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge sold highlights of his career as NFTs for $50,000. Projects like Art X\u2019s Reloading\u2026, in partnership with digital art marketplace SuperRare, are part of an effort to support the unprecedented rise of NFTs on the continent.\n\nProponents of Web3 believe it is a perfect opportunity for content creators to monetise their content. \u201cBlockchain is going to allow information that shouldn\u2019t be free to not be free,\u201d explained Mike Novogratz, an entrepreneur who has half of his $700 million net worth in crypto assets.\n\nWeb3 wants to make it so that content creators make money. Web3 promises to give creators a fair share of what they contribute. By using the NFT technology games like Axie Infinity, Web3 has made it possible for people to make a living from playing\u2014as much as $2,000 monthly.\n\nAn opportunity for builders\n\nWeb3 is an opportunity to build an entirely new tech ecosystem crypto. \u201cWhen I moved back to Nigeria in 2015, there was a lot going on in the ecosystem\u2014community related activities, developers training programmes, early-stage investors putting money in early-stage founders. I think it\u2019s the same thing all over again. We need to build an ecosystem,\u201d said Bademosi.\n\nNFT gaming is a huge part of Web3, and like Metaverse Magna, Thrill Digital has built a crypto gaming product, Astra, that will allow players to win real-life luxury fashion.\n\nThese startups will go ahead to hire hundreds of designers and developers to build out these ideas. A huge opportunity such as this will create opportunities for developers on the continent and prompt more of them to learn relevant languages and stacks. This will increase Africa\u2019s chances of not only supplying the world with developers that can build emerging technology products\u2014as there is a deficit\u2014but also building out crypto-native products that will scale globally.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s new deal with Twitter is not a win for the government or citizens",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s new deal with Twitter is its government\u2019s most recent effort to control social media. While experts tell us that this is a failed attempt at the project, they warn that the deal will definitely have a bearing on internet freedom in the country.\n\nThe Nigerian government banned Twitter for 7 months and only lifted the ban last week after it claimed Twitter has agreed to certain terms. The social media company has, reportedly, agreed to register as a legal entity in Nigeria, pay taxes, and cooperate with Nigeria, through the Partner Support and Enforcement Portal, to regulate harmful content.\n\nTomiwa Ilori, an internet freedom researcher, says the Twitter ban sets a very bad precedent for internet freedom in the country, and if freedom of information requests and lawsuits seeking to get accurate, official, and economic explanations for the government\u2019s actions are not filed now, \u201cwe might have opened up the online right of Nigerians to express [themselves only according] to the whims of politicians.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, like in other parts of Africa, laws made by the government to regulate violent, harmful, and fake speech are used to stifle legitimate online speech.\n\nWhile explaining that he isn\u2019t aware of the exact law that the government relied on for the Twitter ban, Ilori said the Nigerian Communications Act\u2019s (NCA) long history of being weaponised to block access to internet websites makes it a prime suspect. \u201cMy guess is that they used the provisions of sections 146 and 148 of the NCA to get the telcos to block access to Twitter, as they have done in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne major issue with these NCA provisions is that the government gets to decide what is in the public interest or is an emergency, as the basis of their request to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). There is no judicial review, human rights impact assessment of proposed actions before and after such requests, or public access to requests made to the internet service providers (ISPs) by the NCC. It is also important to note that ISPs do not push back or carry out necessary assessments before compliance.\u201d\n\nThe lifting of the ban is not a win for Nigerians\n\nIlori explained that the lifting of the ban means that Nigerians need to start thinking about terms of legal reforms for online expression in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI think the portal could be a great avenue for bridging sides. Having a dedicated means of reporting speech capable of causing violence and harm by proximate actors could help forestall violence. But who are these actors? I ask, because Twitter and the government should not be the only ones determining the nature and type of expression that Nigerians are allowed to share,\u201d Ilori says.\n\nIlori believes that there is a need to expand the content governance arrangement to include civil society actors, experts, and activists.\n\nThe government memo which contained the terms of lifting the ban states that the Portal would serve as a channel for law enforcement agencies to submit a report with a legal justification where it suspects that content violates Nigerian laws.\n\nHowever, Ilori thinks that the government\u2019s power in the agreement is secondary and the actual moderation of content would lie with Twitter.\n\nIt\u2019s not a win for the government either\n\nFor Gbenga Sesan, executive director of Paradigm Initiative, a digital rights group, the government didn\u2019t score any points with the Portal, as it has existed for a while now; it only looks like a win for the Nigerian government because it hasn\u2019t used it before.\n\nAccording to Twitter\u2019s Transparency Report\u2014a report that gives insights into information and removal requests from around the world, by country\u2014Nigeria has made zero removal requests and just 7 information requests, at the time of reporting. However, India has made 12,435 legal removal requests, 67 court orders, and 12,368 other legal demands, representing 6% of global removal requests. According to the report, Twitter complied with 12.4% of India\u2019s requests.\n\nIn February last year, India\u2019s government enacted a fresh social media rule that made social media companies like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and others more accountable to legal requests. This law allows the government to tag content as \u201cunlawful\u201d while forcing messaging service providers to identify posters of specific messages.\n\nThis regulation has its origin in the Indian government\u2019s semisweet relationship with Twitter. The government asked Twitter to take down some content it alleged was spreading misinformation about farmers protesting agricultural reform. But, to the chagrin of the Indian government, Twitter partially complied and restored access to some of the accounts it had blocked \u201cin a manner that we believe was inconsistent with Indian law,\u201d Twitter wrote at the time.\n\nThis, Sesan said, was the reason the Nigerian government has repeatedly tried to enact social media bills. But failed. First came the Frivolous Petitions Bill, which seeks to prevent the spread of falsehood on social media, with jail time and a $10,000 fine. Like subsequent remakes of the bill, it was withdrawn, after 6 months of widespread public criticism.\n\n\u201cSocial media bills\u201d as they would later be called, have been resurrected, over the years, in the form of 2 other bills: the Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation Bill and the National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Speech Bill.\n\nBut Sesan says Nigeria\u2019s internet restriction tactics are miles behind India\u2019s because the latter drew up regulations; Twitter will only respond to legal requests backed by legislation. \u201cIndia drew up new laws on social media that were specific. Nigeria made similar demands, but there is no bill in parliament making that case.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "With its API infrastructure and agent network, Insurpass wants to increase insurance adoption in Nigeria",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a Nigerian concerned about getting insurance coverage for your health, house, car, or other assets, there are probably not more than two million of you in the country, going by 2020 population data. Per a 2018 statistic from the National Financial Inclusion Strategy Report, only 1.9% of Nigerian adults had an insurance policy. This is a similar scenario in other African countries.\n\nThere\u2019s a massive market for insurance in Africa. Or should we instead say that the continent could have a high grossing insurance market in the near future, mainly because of its growing young and middle-class population? But again, there are mitigating factors like ignorance, poverty rate, cultural biases, and lack of access to information and facilities.\n\nThese fundamental issues are what insurance companies seek to address alongside focusing on their core services, which can be a hard nut to crack. Sometimes, the process of getting these insurance covers can be gruelling, and hence, discouraging.\n\nSeun Ayegbusi, an entrepreneur with a background in business development, was experienced such a situation when he wanted to get a life insurance premium cover for his dad in a bank. Prompted by the unpleasant situation, he decided to leverage his knack for entrepreneurship, his interest in tech tools, and his experience working in the tech space to do something about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, he admits that with the present state of things in Nigeria, technology alone isn\u2019t enough to solve the issue of low insurance penetration. Thus, the best that tech can do is to be an enabler.\n\n\u201cI discovered that, first of all, before technology can be of help to insurance, we have to solve the issue of insurance penetration in Nigeria, that is, making insurance accessible.\u201d\n\nBut, instead of choosing the traditional method of addressing the problem and adding a pinch of automation, Aiyebusi decided to go full-on tech. With the help of his Co-founder, Tobiloba Odejinmi (CTO), a full-stack senior software engineer, he built an even more robust solution following the route of what we now see with the new solutions on the African fintech scene, an API insurtech solution called Insurpass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R Tobi Odejinmi(Co-founder/CTO), Seun Ayegbusi (Co-founder/CEO) Source: Supplied\n\n\u201cThis solution allows us to turn other businesses into distribution channels for insurance by making our services available on third-party applications. We are creating access through digital partnerships with third-party businesses to democratise access to insurance.\u201d\n\nBuilding where there\u2019s trust\n\nThis infrastructure will help non-insurance platforms to expose their numerous customers, who are probably uninsured, to various insurance covers for health, education, and assets without having them worry about a stressful procedure.\n\nAyegbusi clarifies that Insurpass is not an insurance company. The API infrastructure only aggregates other insurance companies, including the details of all their available products, and simultaneously allows customers to purchase the product, make payment, and acquire relevant documents directly from the third-party platform.\n\nAccording to him, this was a smart move as it helped the startup navigate distrust towards insurance. For context, a customer engaging the services of a non-insurance company, say a bank, for years, would trust the company more when the suggestion to welcome an insurance option is presented to them.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean developing an insurance brokerage platform was never an option. Initially, the founders\u2019 idea was to build a web application that would ideally serve as a forum to offer insurance products to customers. They only decided at some point to choose an uncharted course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA balanced approach\n\nInsurpass runs a functional web application as a product where customers can go directly to purchase their insurance packages. Called BimaCred, the platform is steadily growing its revenue through commissions and boasting of having served over 3,000 customers within two months of launch. According to Ayegbusi, running both BimaCred and Insurpass simultaneously was necessary for two reasons.\n\n\u201cSo that we can go to market with the product. Apart from the API approach, we decided to have an approach that allows us to sell directly to customers while we\u2019re waiting for integration to be completed on third-party platforms,\u201d and secondly, \u201cto be able to prove to partners that our API actually works. Because it\u2019s the Insurpass API that powers this web application.\u201d\n\nBimaCred makes money like the conventional broker agency. It gets a brokerage commission for every insurance product sold on the platform, as negotiated with the Insurance company. This is also the same model adapted for Insurpass.\n\nAyegbusi believes that the sustainability of Insurpass\u2019 current model lies in its potential to collaborate with other viable players, a process it has actively pursued since it officially launched in September 2021. At the moment, he can confirm partnerships with major financial service providers, insurance companies, tech startups, point of sale agents, and other stakeholders that can push insurance penetration with their influence.\n\nGrowth prospects and first-mover edge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL \u2013 R, Tobi Odejinmi (Co-founder/CTO), Lorretta Okoli, Seun Ayegbusi(Co-founder/CEO), Gloria Agboifoh (Head of Business Development & Partnership) Source: Supplied\n\nRegarding funding, the startup raised an undisclosed fund from a US-based VC fund, Tekedia Capital, in October 2021, which it has so far directed towards developing its core value offering while developing supporting products.\n\nAlthough still in its early moments, Insurpass wants to accomplish big things by the end of Q1 2022. In the next three months, the startup will explore micro-pension, micro-savings, and micro-investment.\n\nWith these, the startup wants to provide third-party platforms with an API solution that will allow them to offer micro-pension, micro-savings, and micro-investment services either as a core product or an add-on service.\n\nExplaining why this is necessary in the early days of the business, Ayegbusi submits that it would make Insurpass\u2019 solutions inclusive as it considers the underserved who might not have Internet-enabled phones to access digital savings, lending, and investment opportunities. This further helps it fulfil its promise to democratise insurance. These APIs will be driven by the already existing network of POS agents who provide financial services within unreached neighbourhoods.\n\nBesides using existing POS agents, Insurpass also intends to launch its agency platform, which would be insurance-specific POS terminals.\n\nSpeaking about Insurpass\u2019 growth, Ayegbusi expresses pride at how he and his team have taken the bull by the horns to become Nigeria\u2019s first API insurtech startup. For him, they are pulling resources to leverage this first-mover advantage. With the space now attracting similar solutions, the founder boasts of the company\u2019s exceptional services, which businesses that have been identified as key stakeholders in insurance are willing to associate with.\n\nWithin a short time, leading insurance companies like AXA Mansard, Leadway Assurance, Universal Insurance PLC, and Tangerine Life, and one other insurance company have already come on board. The startup has also sealed partnership deals with traditional banks like FCMB and digital banks like VBank. Meanwhile, the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), Unified Payments, First Bank, WEMA Bank, TeamApt, and Transtura are considering using Insurpass\u2019 services.\n\nThe startup has built a team of professionals taking charge of product, engineering, business development, marketing, and customer relationship. Ayegbusi confirms that he achieved this by selling the startup\u2019s vision to people who then bought into it and committed themselves to the startup.\n\nA stint in everything-tech\n\nThough none of the past ventures has been this successful, Ayegbusi briefly states that Insurpass isn\u2019t his first rodeo. In collaboration with other entrepreneurs, he has run businesses in HR, mobility, digital banking, and the digital lending space. Although none of these scaled, he has been able to lean on the lessons from these failures.\n\nHe looks back at how the inability to move from ideation to execution, not understanding the pain point of the market, not keeping it simple, and lack of funding, held them back.\n\nAyegbusi has been playing in the insurtech space since 2018; today, he has become a thought leader.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

This edition, like the first, focuses on the Nigerian technology space.\n\nAfter covering the African innovation and technology space for the past six years, Techpoint Africa started its Awards to honour and acknowledge players (companies and individuals alike) in the Nigerian startup and technology space.\n\nBefore highlighting and breaking down the Awards processes, let\u2019s highlight the three categories:\n\nNomination-only: Awards in this category are judged by an independent team of external judges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditorial Choice: Awards in this category are judged by the Techpoint editorial team.\n\nAudience Choice: Awards in this category are exclusively decided by audience nominations.\n\nHere\u2019s the procedure\n\nDetermine categories\n\nThe first stage, an in-house procedure carried out by the Techpoint editorial team, is determining the award categories, the industries, and what will be judged by the audience, the group of external judges, or the Techpoint editorial team.\n\nFour external judges \u2014 a tech entrepreneur and one person each from tech media, a venture capital firm, and the ecosystem \u2014 are also chosen at this stage.\n\nPreliminary nominations\n\nWe call upon the general public at this stage to nominate companies and individuals across various categories. The nomination phase usually lasts between six to eight weeks.\n\nThe Techpoint Hall of Fame is a no-nomination category.\n\nSide note: induction into the Techpoint Hall of Fame will happen every five years.\n\nScreen valid entries\n\nAfter closing the preliminary nominations, an in-house committee screens the nominations for spam and invalid entries. At the end of this exercise, the committee arrives at the top five companies or individuals in each category which are then announced in an article on our platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRequest for figures from finalists\n\nFinalists in each category are requested to share their figures and statistics covering the period under review. However, this doesn\u2019t apply to finalists in the Audience Choice categories.\n\nAt this stage, we sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) stipulating that any revelation by the finalists would only be used for the Awards. The editorial team is involved in most of the process and is bound by this NDA, which the independent external judges also sign.\n\nScreening by external judges and the Techpoint editorial team\n\nWe collate the responses from the company finalists and share them with the external judges who grade companies based on what was shared.\n\nCompanies that don\u2019t share the requested details are disqualified as there\u2019s nothing for the external judges to score.\n\nThe external judges only grade startups in the nomination-only categories, while the Techpoint editorial team grades the Editorial Choice categories.\n\nAnnounce external judges\n\nThe announcement of external judges happens after the judging process to ensure third parties do not influence their decisions.\n\nCollate results\n\nThe results for all categories are collated, and the company with the highest score in each category is declared the winner. Each member of the editorial team votes if there is a tie between two or more finalists in a category to get a winner.\n\nAnnounce winners\n\nThe final stage of the Awards process is announcing the winners, which usually happens as part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s flagship event, Techpoint Build.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYinka Awosanya Mobile & African Tech Enthusiast \u2502 Data Analyst \u2502 Music\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Ghana Plots to become West Africa\u2019s Gas Hub in threat to Nigeria\n\nGhana\u2019s state-owned oil company is progressing with plans to sell liquefied natural gas throughout West Africa in a move that will test Nigeria\u2019s dominance and her failure to better position the country\u2019s energy credentials.\n\nAlready shipments of the fuel are beginning to flow to a specially built import terminal.\n\nGhana\u2019s Tema LNG Terminal Co. is expected to start commercial operations at the plant in the second quarter of this year and can help create an energy hub for the region, Hamis Ussif, manager for gas at Ghana National Petroleum Corp. said in a Bloomberg interview in the capital, Accra. GNPC will buy the LNG from Tema and sell it onward.\n\nSome West African nations are embracing the use of natural gas as part of an effort to bring electricity to more people who live there but Nigeria with its significant gas endowments has been unable to ensure a steady supply of gas around the sub-region.\n\nWhile the use of fossil fuels is criticized for contributing to climate change, local producers have said that the continent only accounts for 3percent of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nGNPC is working with partners interested in building infrastructure to sell LNG to domestic users and those within the sub-region looking to boost power, Ussif said.\n\n\u201cThe options available include a mix of pipelines, barges, and trucks where feasible to reduce the cost of transporting to our neighbors.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s already been a request from Benin, a nearby nation, to increase gas supply, Ussif said.\n\nGhana has a 17-year contract for 225 million standard cubic feet a day of gas from the Tema terminal, which is backed by Helios Investment Partners and African Infrastructure Investment Managers with LNG supplied by Shell.\n\nAlso this week, Ghana permitted the nation\u2019s banks to accept overseas bonds as collateral in a bid to revive credit growth and spur economic activity in the post covid pandemic era.\n\nInvestments in offshore debt securities sold by foreign governments, companies and multilateral development banks can be used as collateral for loans, the central bank said.\n\nRead also: Cooking gas price to drop as NLNG supplies 100% LPG to domestic market\n\nThe securities must be denominated in dollar, pound, euro, or yen and need to be rated AA or above, the Bank of Ghana said in a statement on its website.\n\nCredit in West Africa\u2019s second-biggest economy expanded at about 6.7percent in the first 10 months of 2021, the slowest pace in three years as the pandemic decimated demand.\n\nThe central bank\u2019s move may be attractive for overseas companies seeking to expand in the $68.5 billion economy, which accelerated 6.6percent in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cForeign companies into manufacturing, real estate, and construction may be encouraged,\u201d Benjamin Dzoboku, chief operating officer at Republic Bank said by phone, adding that it may not help local firms because they won\u2019t have such investments.\n\nIt could drive loan-growth rate by an additional 100 to 200 basis points in the coming months, he said.\n\nLenders must desist from accepting debt securities issued by their local or international affiliates, the regulator said.\n\n\u201cWith the foreign bonds you\u2019re assured of your liquidity and if you use them to secure a loan in Ghana you can nourish your business well in Ghana and still have your foreign fixed-income back,\u201d Dzoboku said.",

The implementation of the DEC Tools will also assist the Service in determining entities that fall within the SEP threshold and relevant turnover generated from Nigeria. This tool will go live shortly,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a percentage of GDP, Nigeria only generates 7 percent in tax revenue, less than half of the frontier market average of 15 percent. Only a handful of tax eligible Nigerians are captured in the records thereby costing the government badly-needed non-oil revenue.\n\nNami however assured that efforts were ongoing to ensure that the Service achieved 100 percent automation of all its tax administration processes with the aim of blocking revenue leakages thereby revolutionising revenue generation in Nigeria.\n\nThe Service will also deploy technological tools in assessing entities that fall within the Significant Economic Presence (SEP) threshold and relevant turnover generated from Nigeria.\n\nThe FIRS in 2021 leveraged on the amendments to its Establishment Act to embark on a major infrastructure overhaul, focusing on the deployment of technology for the automation of its processes and procedures, thereby deploying its home-grown integrated tax administration system, TaxPro Max, according to Nami.\n\n\u201cThe Service will focus on compliance and enforcement strategies in 2022, by leveraging on intelligence, strategic data mining and analysis, to enhance audit and investigation functions and implementing the penalty regimes in accordance with the laws,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cthe Service is poised to ensure prosecution of recalcitrant taxpayers in 2022.\u201d\n\nHe concluded by urging taxpayers, tax consultants, tax collection agents and other stakeholders in the tax system to partner the FIRS in 2022 to make taxation and tax revenue collection a pivot for economic growth and national development, stating that no society can grow without its citizens paying their taxes.\n\nRead also: The essentiality of trust and trust building for digital platforms in Nigeria\n\nMeanwhile, in a statement yesterday by Johannes Wojuola, the special assistant to Nami on media, he said the FIRS executive chairman in an address earlier had noted that in the 2021, the Service had leveraged the amendments to its Establishment Act to embark on \u201ca major infrastructure overhaul, focusing on the deployment of technology for the automation of its processes and procedures,\u201d thereby deploying its home-grown integrated tax administration system, TaxPro Max.\n\nAccording to Wojuola, the Service \u201cwill focus on compliance and enforcement strategies in 2022, by leveraging on intelligence, strategic data mining and analysis, to enhance audit and investigation functions and implement the penalty regimes in accordance with the laws,\u201d noting, \u201cthe Service is poised to ensure prosecution of recalcitrant taxpayers in 2022.\u201d",

For example,in Bangladesh, the ocean economy consists of the following broad and growing economic sectors; living resources, minerals,energy, transport trade, tourism and recreation, carbon sequestration and coastal protection. These industries and ecosystem services do not develop in isolation, but rather interact as an economic ecosystem\u201d the VP said.\n\nIn his opening remark, Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi said the blue economy is capable of improving government revenue, create employments and grow the gross domestic product of Nigeria.\n\nAmaechi who was represented by Dr Magdalene Ajani, Permanent Secretary of the ministry also expressed optimism in the copious benefits derivable from a well exploited marine environment\n\nSpeaking at the event, Dr. Paul Adalikwu, Secretary General of Maritime Organisation of West and Central Africa (MOWCA) lauded initiative of the expansion while recommending inclusion of financial institutions like the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN), African Development Bank (AfDB) and key financial institutions that will contribute meaningfully to realizing Nigeria\u2019s Blue Economy objective.\n\nAside maritime agencies like Nigerian Ports Authority, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, Maritime Academy of Nigeria, the expanded committee also comprised of ten state governors including Rivers, Lagos, Delta, Akwa Ibom, Borno, Ogun, Ondo, Cross River, Bayelsa and Edo States.\n\nOther members are Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Power, Finance, Environment, Trade and Investment, Agriculture and Water Resources , Chief of Naval Staff, Comptroller General of Customs, Lake Chad Basin Commission, Nigeria Economic Summit Group and others.\n\n...",

          "text": "In a bid to combat the menace of Ponzi schemes and ensure that the apex regulator of the capital market is well equipped to stem the tide, the National Assembly is proposing a Bill that will empower the Securities and Exchange Commission to impose stiffer punishment on promoters of Ponzi schemes and other unregistered investment schemes.\n\nThis is part of an amendment to the Investment and Securities Act 2007, being proposed by the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Second reading of the Bill was done on Thursday at the House of Representatives by Hon. Babangida Ibrahim representing MalumFashi/Kafur Federal Constituency in Katsina State.\n\nThe amendment is titled \u201cA Bill for an Act to Repeal the Investments and Securities Act, 2007 and Enact the Investments and Securities Bill to Establish Securities and Exchange Commission as the Apex Regulatory Authority for the Nigerian Capital Market as well as Regulation of the Market to ensure Capital Formation, the Protection of the Market to ensure Capital Formation, the Protection of Investors, Maintain Fair, Efficient and Transparent Market and Reduction of Systematic Risk; and for Related Matters,\u201d\n\nAccording to Hon. Ibrahim, there has been a lot of complains by Nigerians on the activities of these schemes that promise unreasonably high returns and at the end of the day they fleece Nigerians of their hard earned money hence the need for more regulations to monitor them.\n\nUnder the proposed law, \u2018A bill to repeal the Investment and Securities Act 2007 and to enact the Investments and Securities Act, 2021\u2019 which passed the second reading at the floor of the House of Representatives yesterday, SEC will be empowered to address the challenges of Ponzi schemes.\n\nSection 195 (1) of the Bill empowers SEC thus: \u201cThe Commission shall have the power to enter and seal up all prohibited schemes and shall obtain an Order of court to freeze and forfeit all assets of such schemes to the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201c(2)The cost and expenses incurred under subsection (1) above shall be a first charge from the funds and properties of the illegal scheme including assets of its owners, promoters and or managers, whether acquired legitimately or otherwise.\u201c(3) For the purposes of this Bill, \u201cprohibited scheme\u201d including those commonly known as a \u201cPonzi or Pyramid scheme\u201d means: (a) Any investment scheme that pays existing contributors with funds collected from new contributors to the scheme promising high returns with little or no risk: i) Whether or not the scheme limits the number of persons who may participate therein, either expressly or by the application of conditions affecting the eligibility of a person to enter into, or receive compensation under the scheme; or ii) Whether the scheme is operated at a physical address or through the internet or other electronic means. (b) Any scheme where participants attempt to make money by recruiting new participants usually where: (i) the promoter promises a high return in a short period of time, and (ii) no genuine product or service is actually sold; or(iii) the primary emphasis is on recruiting new participants\n\n\u201c(4) The promoter(s) and operator(s) of any entity engaged in a prohibited scheme commits an offence and is liable upon conviction to imprisonment for a term of ten (10) years or a fine of N5,000,000 or both\u201d.\n\nAccording to Hon. Ibrahim \u201cThe current ISA 2007 is old and we all know a lot has happened between that time and now like technological advancements. The capital market has to be dynamic in today\u2019s world in a bid to contribute its quota to national development and that is one of the reasons why we are pushing this.\n\n\u201cA lot of things have happened between that time and now hence the need for an amendment. When that Law came into existence we did not have derivatives and commodities markets like we do now, these are some of the issues that are necessitating this amendment. The plan is to make this Bill a little bit flexible so some national government can be able to approach the capital market to source for fund either for developmental projects \u201che added.\n\nAnother part of the amendment is to increase the period within which a claim for compensation could be made for the Investor Protection Fund to six years from the date of occurrence of the defalcation, revocation, cancellation, insolvency or bankruptcy of the dealing firm. The period in the current Act is six months.\n\nThe objectives of an Investor Protection Fund is to compensate investors who suffer pecuniary loss arising from the insolvency, bankruptcy or negligence of a dealing member firm of a securities exchange; defalcation committed by a dealing member firm or any of its directors, officers, employees or representatives in relation to securities, money or any property entrusted to, or received or deemed received by the dealing member firm in the course of its business as a capital market operator; and revocation or cancellation of the registration of a dealing member firm.\n\nAccording to the proposed amendment, two new subsections have been introduced to complement the existing provisions on the manner in which a claim to the investor protection fund can be made.\n\nThis is a departure from Section 213 (2) of the 2007 Act, which requires a claim for compensation to be made in the first instance to the securities exchange.\n\nIn addition, subsection (4) of the Act has been modified to take care of such preconditions for compensation as may have been prescribed by the Board of Trustees.\n\nSpecifically, it added that a verified claim must be paid by the investor protection fund to an investor within 14 days of such verification by the securities exchange.\n\nIt said, \u201cA claim for compensation under this part of the Bill shall be made in writing to the board of trustees within 6 years from the date of occurrence of the defalcation, revocation or cancellation of the registration of the dealing member firm and insolvency or bankruptcy of the dealing member firm, and any claim which is not so made shall be barred unless the Commission otherwise determines.\n\n\u201cNo action for damages shall lie against a securities exchange or against any member or employee of a securities exchange or of a board of trustees or management sub-committee by reason of any notice published in good faith and without malice for the purposes of this section.\u201d\n\nHon. Ibrahim expressed the optimism that when the Bill is passed into law, it would empower the SEC with the necessary backing to effectively regulate the capital market and emphasize the independence of the Commission in line with the requirements of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "The lawmaker representing Kebbi South Senatorial District, Senator Bala Ibn Na\u2019Allah, says the inclusion of mandatory direct primary in the Electoral Act Amendment Bill was the idea of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nHe further stated that he was told that the provision was meant for a particular individual hence the bill did not go through a thorough process before it was forwarded to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for assent.\n\n\u201cWe are hearing that that law (direct primary) was intended for an individual. I don\u2019t know. I honestly don\u2019t know but I must say and maintain that the process was not painstaking enough,\u201d said Na\u2019Allah on Channels Television\u2019s Sunrise Daily programme on Thursday.\n\nNa\u2019Allah said that during the discussions at the committee level, the issue of direct primaries was never brought up. The senator said it was when the bill was to be passed before the House that Gbajabiamila included the clause.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe issue of direct primary came at the dying minute on the floor of the House of Representatives when they were considering the report of the committee of electoral matters. What it means is that it was never discussed or adopted by the committee of the House but that it came as an amendment allegedly because I don\u2019t have the records, by the Speaker of the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nNa\u2019Allah said the second argument by Gbajabiamila that the direct primary had become necessary in order to protect federal lawmakers from overbearing governors, showed that the proposed law was done for personal reasons.\n\nThe senator argued that this was evidence that the law was not done in the interest of Nigerians as such but for self-preservation which was at variance with the oath of public office.\n\nHe added, \u201cAnd I have seen the Speaker doing whatever was humanly possible to defend that position. But what would prove me right is that in one breath, I heard the Speaker saying that because of the rate of return at the National Assembly, there was the need to protect the members of the National Assembly from the influence of governors, therefore the resort to direct primaries.\n\n\u201cNow, the catch there is that personal interest was allowed in the process. That is the catch because he particularly said the turnover of members is very disturbing and that there is the need to protect members of the National Assembly from the governors.\n\n\u201cIn the first place, that argument will fall flat because it means that decision was taken to promote personal interest against the oath of office that we have taken as members of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nThe senator said a Supreme Court judgment had given parties the power to run their affairs as they see fit.\n\nHe argued that forcing parties to limit their options to direct primaries was against the spirit of that judgment which Gbajabiamila as a lawyer ought to have known.\n\nIn his reaction on the floor of the House, however, a furious Gbajabiamila at the opening of plenary on Thursday lamented that some lawmakers were disparaging the National Assembly on television.\n\nHe, however, failed to mention Na\u2019Allah\u2019s name.\n\nThe Speaker said, \u201cHonourable colleagues, I am constrained to say at this point that I watched with dismay this morning, some members of this National Assembly exercising their freedom of expression and speech, and that is well within their right. But when you exercise such freedom, be careful not to mislead the public; be careful not to malign, unjustifiably, this institution.\n\n\u201cThis leadership has allowed people to express their opinions at all times; I have no problem with that. But when you begin to call the institution which you are a part of names, unwittingly maligning even yourself, we need to draw a line especially when you are peddling untruths. And I just thought it was important that we mention this so (that) in future we will be guided both by the freedom of expression and by the truth.\n\n\u201cIt was a show of disgrace as far as I\u2019m concerned \u2013 I don\u2019t care what anybody says \u2013 the things that were uttered by members of this National Assembly. A show of disgrace! (I am) extremely disappointed.\u201d\n\nHowever, a member of the House, Uzoma Nkem-Abonta (PDP/Abia), who had gone on television to accuse the National Assembly of being controlled by the executive, apologised on the floor of the House.\n\nThe lawmaker said, \u201cI was on a programme on Channels where matters that are very topical that happened here were discussed. I never intended to ridicule the House; I wouldn\u2019t have; not even a House that I have fought so hard and worked so hard to build and have been part of.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila, while accepting the apology, advised members to be very circumspect when they go out in public and express their own personal opinions.

          "text": "By AZUH AMATUS\n\nOn January 20, the United States and Nigeria signed a historic Memorandum of Understanding that launches a Cultural Property Agreement between both nations. Ambassador Mary Beth Leonard and Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed signed the agreement at a ceremony attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs Geoffrey Onyeama and U.S. Embassy representatives.\n\nIn Nigeria, cultural property continues to be subject to the threat of pillage, destruction, and loss due to excavation, criminal activity, natural disasters, and subsistence digging. The agreement will facilitate continued cooperation with Nigerian law enforcement agencies and support efforts to identify, intercept, repatriate, and protect cultural property and related heritage. The agreement will also promote the exchange of archaeological materials for scientific, cultural, and educational purposes with the aim of increasing public awareness for Nigerian cultural heritage.\n\nThis agreement will enhance our already strong cooperation to preserve and maintain Nigerian cultural landmarks and sites through the Ambassador\u2019s Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP). Over the past decade, the United States has partnered with the Nigerian government and state institutions to fund projects totaling over a million dollars including the $125,000 AFCP grant awarded in November 2021 to digitally survey and document the Busanyin Shrine located within the Osun Osogbo Sacred Grove. Another major investment consists of the $400,000 AFCP grant for the conservation of the late 14th-Century Sungbo\u2019s Eredo monument, which will use three-dimensional laser scanning technology to generate a precise topographic map covering a thousand square kilometers of the area occupied by the monument.\n\nCultural Property Agreements are administered worldwide by the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs in partnership with other governments desiring enhanced cooperation in that field. These bilateral agreements support U.S. government efforts across different agencies and organizations to protect and preserve cultural heritage in host countries. This includes denying critical financing to organizations that engage in illicit trade of artifacts and other cultural objects of value. The U.S. has signed Cultural Property Agreements with several countries in Africa including Egypt, Libya, Mali, and Morocco.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s agreement is about learning from the past and about recording through it our partnership to preserve, restore, and protect Nigeria\u2019s diverse cultural heritage,\u201d said Ambassador Leonard during her remarks at the ceremony.\n\nFor more information, please contact the U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Section at: [email protected].\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "By AZUH AMATUS\n\nOn January 20, the United States and Nigeria signed a historic Memorandum of Understanding that launches a Cultural Property Agreement between both nations. Ambassador Mary Beth Leonard and Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed signed the agreement at a ceremony attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs Geoffrey Onyeama and U.S. Embassy representatives.\n\nIn Nigeria, cultural property continues to be subject to the threat of pillage, destruction, and loss due to excavation, criminal activity, natural disasters, and subsistence digging. The agreement will facilitate continued cooperation with Nigerian law enforcement agencies and support efforts to identify, intercept, repatriate, and protect cultural property and related heritage. The agreement will also promote the exchange of archaeological materials for scientific, cultural, and educational purposes with the aim of increasing public awareness for Nigerian cultural heritage.\n\nThis agreement will enhance our already strong cooperation to preserve and maintain Nigerian cultural landmarks and sites through the Ambassador\u2019s Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP). Over the past decade, the United States has partnered with the Nigerian government and state institutions to fund projects totaling over a million dollars including the $125,000 AFCP grant awarded in November 2021 to digitally survey and document the Busanyin Shrine located within the Osun Osogbo Sacred Grove. Another major investment consists of the $400,000 AFCP grant for the conservation of the late 14th-Century Sungbo\u2019s Eredo monument, which will use three-dimensional laser scanning technology to generate a precise topographic map covering a thousand square kilometers of the area occupied by the monument.\n\nCultural Property Agreements are administered worldwide by the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs in partnership with other governments desiring enhanced cooperation in that field. These bilateral agreements support U.S. government efforts across different agencies and organizations to protect and preserve cultural heritage in host countries. This includes denying critical financing to organizations that engage in illicit trade of artifacts and other cultural objects of value. The U.S. has signed Cultural Property Agreements with several countries in Africa including Egypt, Libya, Mali, and Morocco.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s agreement is about learning from the past and about recording through it our partnership to preserve, restore, and protect Nigeria\u2019s diverse cultural heritage,\u201d said Ambassador Leonard during her remarks at the ceremony.\n\nFor more information, please contact the U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Section at: [email protected].\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

We are looking forward to seeing you replicate it for Nigeria \u201d\n\nSani Bello thanked the former Lagos state governor for sympathising with Niger State and its people over the incessant banditry and terrorism.\n\n\u201d Lagos is a country within a country and we saw the foundation you laid there. We are looking forward to seeing you replicate it for Nigeria \u201c\n\nHe said no where is safe in the country and recounted how some villagers in Mashegu were murdered in cold blood by bandits while observing their early morning prayers in the Mosque.\n\n\u201cWhere are we safe?. In a place of worship, people can be killed. We are not dealing with human beings, but people whose heart has been cemented for evil. No amount of talking or dialogue can change them.\u201d\n\n\u201d Recently, they went to a village while they were observing their early morning prayers. They locked the door and started shooting indiscriminately, killing 18. Only those that forced the door open survived. Few days later they did same in another village.\u201d\n\nHe therefore advocated that time has come for the country to change its approach to the ongoing was against banditry and terrorism from conventional warfare to a technological driven warfare.\n\n\u201d Let\u2019s use technology even though it is expensive. The situation can be addressed that way\n\n\u201d The era of sending soldiers to the forest is over. When we can deploy drones to monitor movement of bandits and hit target effortlessly \u201d\n\nTinubu urged Nigerians not to see the ongoing security trend in the country as a hopeless situation noting that, with self belief and prayers, the situation can be remedied.\n\nThe APC National Leader, explained that in as much as Nigerians have hope they can turn the situation around by winning the war as no government wants no strife to derail it.\n\n\u201d We share in your grief. I am here for the people of Niger State, hearing and reading of disasters, banditry and cattle rustling every day, just like what happened on Wednesday again.\u201d\n\nTinubu announced a donation of N50 million to those affected by the banditry attacks.\n\nThe Former Lagos state Governor was accompanied by Senator Abu Fari from Katsina and two members of the House of Representatives, Ibrahim Abdullahi from Niger State and James Falake from Ikeja Federal constituency of Lagos State.",

          "text": "The first flights carrying fresh water and other aid to Tonga finally arrived Thursday after the Pacific nation\u2019s main airport runway was cleared of ash left by a huge volcanic eruption.\n\nNew Zealand and Australia each sent military transport planes that were carrying water containers, kits for temporary shelters, generators, hygiene supplies and communications equipment. The Australian plane also had a special sweeper to help keep the runway clear.\n\nThe deliveries were dropped off without the military personnel coming in contact with people at the airport in Tonga. That\u2019s because Tonga is desperate to make sure foreigners don\u2019t bring in the coronavirus. It has not had any outbreaks of COVID-19 and has reported just a single case since the pandemic began.\n\nRear Admiral James Gilmour, the commander of New Zealand\u2019s Joint Forces, said there had been a \u201cmammoth effort\u201d by Tongan troops \u201cto clear that runway by hand. And they\u2019ve achieved that this afternoon.\u201d\n\nAustralia said the assistance would help Tonga\u2019s government meet the community\u2019s needs and support the immediate clean-up efforts.\n\nJapan also said it would send emergency relief, including drinking water and equipment for cleaning away volcanic ash. Two C-130 Hercules aircraft and a transport vessel carrying two CH-47 Chinook helicopters would leave possibly Thursday, the Defense Ministry said.\n\nJapanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi told reporters that his ministry \u201cwill do everything we can for the disaster-hit people of Tonga.\u201d\n\nU.N. humanitarian officials report that about 84,000 people \u2014 more than 80% of Tonga\u2019s population \u2014 have been impacted by the volcano\u2019s eruption, U.N. spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric said, pointing to three deaths, injuries, loss of homes and polluted water.\n\nCommunications with Tonga remain limited after Saturday\u2019s eruption and tsunami appeared to have broken the single fiber-optic cable that connects Tonga with the rest of the world. That means most people haven\u2019t been able to use the internet or make phone calls abroad, although some local phone networks are still working.\n\nOne phone company, Digicel, said Thursday it had managed to restore the ability to make international calls from some places by using a satellite link, but that people would need to be patient due to high demand. It said it hoped to enhance its service over the coming days.\n\nA navy patrol ship from New Zealand is also expected to arrive later Thursday. It is carrying hydrographic equipment and divers, and also has a helicopter to assist with delivering supplies.\n\nOfficials said the ship\u2019s first task would be to check shipping channels and the structural integrity of the wharf in the capital, Nuku\u2019alofa, following the eruption and tsunami.\n\nAnother New Zealand navy ship carrying 250,000 liters (66,000 gallons) of water is on its way. The ship can also produce tens of thousands of liters of fresh water each day using a desalination plant.\n\nThree of Tonga\u2019s smaller islands suffered serious damage from tsunami waves, officials and the Red Cross said.\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s Dujarric said \u201call houses have apparently been destroyed on the island of Mango and only two houses remain on Fonoifua island, with extensive damage reported on Nomuka.\u201d He said evacuations are underway for people from the islands.\n\nAccording to Tongan census figures, Mango is home to 36 people, Fonoifua is home to 69 people, and Nomuka to 239. The majority of Tongans live on the main island of Tongatapu, where about 50 homes were destroyed.\n\nDujarric said the most pressing humanitarian needs are safe water, food and non-food items, and top priorities are reestablishing communication services including for international calls and the internet.\n\nTonga has so far avoided the widespread devastation that many initially feared.",

          "text": "Face masks will no longer be mandatory in public places and COVID-19 passports will be dropped for large events as infections level off in most parts of the country, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Wednesday.\n\nJohnson told lawmakers that the restrictions were being eased because government scientists think it is likely that the surge of infections prompted by the highly contagious omicron variant \u201chas now peaked nationally.\u201d\n\nWhile hospitals in northern England still are getting pressed by high caseloads and infections were still rising in schools, Johnson said hospital admissions and patients in intensive care units elsewhere in England were stabilizing or falling.\n\nThe government is no longer advising people to work from home, and compulsory face masks will be scrapped in secondary school classrooms starting Thursday.\n\nMandatory COVID-19 passes will not be needed to gain entry to large-scale events beginning Jan. 27. Face masks will no longer be legally required anywhere in England as of that day.\n\n\u201cWe will trust the judgment of the British people and no longer criminalize anyone who chooses not to wear one,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe restrictions were introduced in December to slow the rapid spread of the omicron variant and buy time for the population to get their booster vaccine shot.\n\nJohnson said Wednesday that more than 90% of those over age 60 in the U.K. have had booster shots.\n\nOfficial figures showed that COVID-19 infections have dropped in most parts of the U.K. for the first time since early December. The government reported 108,069 new cases on Wednesday, about half the daily number recorded over the holidays.\n\nThe requirement for those infected to self-isolate for five full days remains, but Johnson said that measure will also end in the coming weeks. He said while the self-isolation rule expires on March 24, he will seek to scrap it earlier if the virus data continues to improve.\n\nJohnson and Health Secretary Sajid Javid both suggested that the government is planning for a post-pandemic period when it can treat COVID-19 more like the flu.\n\n\u201cThere will soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether, just as we don\u2019t place legal obligations on people to isolate if they have flu,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nNonetheless, Johnson urged people to remain cautious in the last weeks of winter and stressed that the pandemic was \u201cnot over.\u201d\n\nThe news was welcomed by businesses, especially those relying on workers re-populating city centers, as well as hospitality and tourism. But some said officials need to give more details about their plans to cope with the coronavirus in the longer term. Johnson\u2019s spokesman said the government would publish such a plan \u201cshortly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a vital need now for greater consistency in how we live with the virus in the longer term. Swinging back and forth between restrictions and normality has been damaging,\u201d said Matthew Fell, chief policy director of the Confederation of British Industry.\n\nScotland and Wales, which set their own public health rules, have also announced similar easing of restrictions.\n\nBritain has the second-worst pandemic death toll in Europe after Russia, with over 153,000 confirmed virus-related deaths.",

Many of us are very concerned with the recent agitations, protests, and many citizens were so concerned, our constituents across the country are very concerned that the federal government will remove the petroleum subsidy.

          "text": "In line with his administration\u2019s commitment to traffic management and transportation, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has acquired two sets of 10-car new Talgo 330kmph speed trains for the Lagos Red Line rail project.\n\nTHISDAY reliably learnt that, the State government had wanted to purchase three sets that had been lying unused in Milwaukee for 11 years but got there to find that Egypt had acquired one of the trains.\n\nThe trains originally intended for a high-speed rail line to connect Madison and Milwaukee were enmeshed in complicated political issues before Lagos state government decided to acquire them.\n\nA statement on Wednesday, explained that Sanwo-Olu completed the acquisition deal of the trains at a public event inside the Milwaukee facilities of Spanish train manufacturer Talgo Incorporated in the United States, on Tuesday.\n\nThe trains would be heading to Lagos, Nigeria for the Red Line, a 37 km track rail project started by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu.\n\nThe red line would have 11 stations and when completed would be the first operational metro system in West Africa, the statement explained.\n\nLagos State Government had last November announced traffic diversion at Kayode Ogunmokun road in Mushin for a period of six weeks in continuation of the first phase of the Lagos Red Line Rail Mass Transit project from Oyingbo to Agbado.\n\nSpeaking at the event, who was accompanied by the Lagos State Commissioner for Transportation, Dr. Frederic Oladeinde; Special Adviser to the Governor on Works, Engr. Aramide Adeyoye and Managing Director of Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA), Engr. Abimbola Akinajo, said the state government was excited to complete the purchase of the two brand new trains. He said they were in Milwaukee to see things for themselves in respect of the purchase of the trains, adding that they had inspected the trains, seen their configuration and were satisfied that they fit into the tracks of the Red line in Lagos.\n\n\u201cA train is not something you can just go on the shelf and pick up. We are very lucky to get brand new trains. We have seen our beautiful white and red trains.\n\n\u201cCoincidentally, the rail line is called Red Line and you can see they have given us the colour. We are just going to brand it and put up our seal there.\n\n\u201cWe hope that this (purchase of the trains) will be the beginning of a mutually beneficial business relationship. Providing source of livelihood for our citizens is all about providing jobs for our people and that is what we are doing. It is about ensuring that we can build our economy; people can move from one location to another and businesses can grow.\n\n\u201cPart of what we have done in the last two and half years is to have what we call Integrated Urban Mass transportation system, where we will be using road infrastructure, waterway infrastructure and rail infrastructure so that we can move over 20 million Lagosians within and around the city,\u201d he said.\n\nThe acting Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, who received Sanwo-Olu and other government officials in the city, said: \u201cIt is a little bittersweet. I am sending my congratulations to the Governor of Lagos State in Nigeria, but also a little disappointed that we missed out on the opportunity to have those train sets operating here in Milwaukee and in Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking the CEO and President, Talgo USA Antonio Perez, said \u201cFor us, it is important that our trains are utilised. It doesn\u2019t make any good for the trains that we built to be stored and kept without passengers riding them.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu accompanied by the Lagos State delegation during the visit inspected the interior design of the newly acquired Talgo 330kmph intra-city metropolitan trains.\n\n\u201cSince the commencement of his administration on May 29, 2019, Governor Sanwo-Olu has maintained his administration\u2019s commitment to bringing the Red Line project to fruition during the lifetime of his government.\n\n\u201cThe governor has specifically promised Lagosians that the first phase of the Red Line will begin by the last quarter of 2022 or first quarter of 2023, with a capacity of 500,000 passengers daily,\u201d the statement added.\n\nIn 2009, Wisconsin\u2019s then-Governor, Jim Doyle, a Democrat, had announced a deal with Talgo for two new trains to be built in the state and used for a high-speed rail line between Milwaukee and Madison.\n\nIn the same year, Wisconsin was awarded $810 million for the project in a federal stimulus bill.\n\nBut the plan died off after Republican Scott Walker became governor. But by 2012, Talgo had built the trains, and sent an invoice to the state and later that year, Talgo terminated the contract and sued the state, kicking off a court dispute that lasted almost three years.\n\nHowever, some concerned Lagos residents are querying the whereabout of the Toronto subway cars that the government reportedly purchased 10 years ago for rail line in the state. The trains were then reported to have left Canada for Lagos, but nothing was heard about it thereafter.",
