          "text": "A revered Islamic cleric, Sheik Ahmad Gumi, has advised the Federal Government to support splinter groups among bandits as a way to end mass abductions of school pupils.\n\nGumi, who spoke to The PUNCH on the telephone on Wednesday on the abduction of 200 Islamiyya schoolchildren in the Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State, said many bandits were ready for a dialogue, adding that government could use them to fight the \u201cugly ones.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are always trying to do our best, but you see, you need two hands to shake. You know these people (bandits) need engagements from the government itself. If you dialogue with them without the involvement of the government, it is a problem.\n\n\u201cGovernment needs to be proactive with them. We have a lot of them that are ready to fight the bad ones. Use the bad to fight the ugly, and use the good to fight the bad ones when you\u2019re done with the ugly. Look at Boko Haram, who finished Shekau? Was it not the splinter group? So, it is easy.\n\n\u201cAll these agitations you see, if the government can do a splinter group and the splinter group is empowered, every man wants power and money, they will do your job. There are many ready to submit themselves. All the ones you see me meeting in the bush, they are all telling us, \u2018we are ready.\u2019\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

In fact, Sharia Commission has been created and Area courts have been abolished and replaced with Sharia courts.\n\n\u201cThe provision of Sharia courts and Sharia Commission without a corresponding Ecclesiastical courts and Commission to attend to the yearning of Christian citizens has served as a great marginalization, discrimination and/or source of conflict in terms of accessibility to employment because all the employees of the said Sharia Commission and Courts are all Muslims\u201d.\n\nCAN also recommended that the amendment should also declare null and void any law either Federal or State which intend to or has adopted a particular religion and its legal system or facilitate or create any religious educational body without a correspondence to carter for the interest of Christian religion.\n\n\u201cIn the alternative, the creation of Ecclesiastical Court or Tribunal along with its Commission and other Christian educational bodies to meet the interest of all Christian will enhance equality and inclusiveness in the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe Christian Association of Nigeria has observed that it is pertinent to implement the above stated recommendations due to the reasons that Christianity is one of the major religions in Nigeria and has its members across the federation.\n\n\u201cTherefore, allowing the recognition of Islamic religion and its legal system in the Constitution and its subsequent adoption by States is a clear discrimination against Christians and a gross violation of Section 10 of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe continuous recognition and adoption of the Islamic religion and its legal system by both Federal and States government without a correspondent Ecclesiastical Courts, Commission and Christian Educational Bodies is an injustice and a violation of the Constitutional rights of Christians access to employment opportunities\u201d, CAN further stressed.\n\nAccording to CAN, \u201cThe Ecclesiastical court will ensure that dispute among Clerics and even Christians pertaining to spiritual matters that involve sacraments, successors to personal properties, Christian Marriage, discipline, administration of church, ecclesiastical corporate bodies, tithes, benefits , question touching on oaths and vows are determine in accordance with the Biblical and Christian injunctions.\n\n\u201cThe foregoing position has been set out by CAN in order to persuade this Honourable Committee to adopt our position as submitted above. Doing this will be in the overall national interest and peaceful co-existence among Nigerian Citizens and particularly given sense of belonging to the Christians faithful.\u201d",

However, we are conducting this exercise in accordance with the extant legal order, which is the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, Section 9 of the Constitution empowers the National Assembly to alter the provisions of the Constitution and prescribes the manner in which it is to be done.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it does not make similar provision or provide mechanism for replacing or re-writing an entirely new Constitution.\n\n\u201cTo embark on any process without prior alteration of Section 9 of the Constitution to provide the mode through which an entirely new Constitution could be made, would amount to gross violation of our oath of allegiance to the Constitution.\n\n\u201cIn other words, it will take a new Constitutional amendment to be able to give Nigerians a most desired new Constitution. It would be unconstitutional to do otherwise.\u201d\n\nAmong requests made by participants at the hearing include the urgent need for a referendum to pave way for the emergence of a new constitution for the country.\n\nSome of the stakeholders also called for full financial autonomy for Local Governments, State legislatures and the judiciary in the country.\n\nThere were also calls for the creation of a ministry of Chieftaincy Affairs and the assignment of roles to traditional rulers in the constitution.\n\nThe need to make the Federal Capital City (FCC) administratively independent was also canvassed.\n\nThe original indigenous development association also called for a state status for the FCT and the appointment of an FCT indigene as a federal executive council members.",

Few years ago, the entire processes involved in an election were rigged and the commission has moved to apply technology to this process.\n\n\u201cA credible voter\u2019s register must ensure that a person only appear once in the register. So, we need to apply biometrics to the electoral process and we must start with biometric registration which will ensure the capacity to ensuring one man one vote.\n\n\u201cBetween 2011 and 2021 when we did optimization process, 15 million records were removed. It was a big duplication. Some of them didn\u2019t have their passport and so, we removed them. When we do verification, we first do the finger print.\n\n\u201cAlso, between 2015 and 2019, we registered about 15.7 million voters and only about one million were duplication. So, we are moving forward and improving.\n\n\u201cAll things being equal, we are planning and we are ready to start the continuous voter registration June 28.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe plan to commence the use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) and it is important to update the voter registration to include addition biometric requirement. It will no longer be finger print alone.\n\n\u201cWe are going to include facial capture which will strengthen the system.

So, in principle, every human being has the right to defend himself or herself.

          "text": "\u2022Accuses microblogging site of double standards\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nThe federal government yesterday accused the social media giant, Twitter, of double standards in its treatment of issues affecting Nigeria.\n\nIt warned that it would not allow the microblogging site to dictate to President Muhammadu Buhari his views on national issues.\n\nThe accusation followed the decision of Twitter to delete a controversial post by Buhari on the Nigerian civil war.\n\nThe president, in the post on Tuesday, had warned against insurrection, saying that those fomenting trouble in the South-east are in for a rude shock.\n\nBuhari, in a series of tweets on Tuesday via his verified Twitter handle @mbuhari had said: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian civil war. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nBuhari\u2019s statement, which was also tweeted, sparked outrage on the social media with some Nigerians reporting it to Twitter.\n\nHowever, some said the president sounded firm in his warning against perpetrators of violence in the South-east.\n\nBut yesterday, Twitter pulled down the tweet for violating its community standards.\n\nTwitter, in a comment, said: \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d\n\nThe federal government, however, kicked against the decision with the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, wondering why Tweeter would object to a submission by the president on national issues but would ignore provocative postings by the leader of the proscribed Independent People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu on its site.\n\nThe minister told journalist at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the State House, Abuja that Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is suspect.\n\nHe wondered if Twitter has ever deleted offensive tweets by Kanu.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspect. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the ENDSARS protests promoted tweets trying to raise funds for the ENDSARS protesters. It was the first to close the account of former President of US, Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd you see, when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during ENDSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened at the Capitol, it became insurrection. You see, we are not going to be fooled by anybody. We have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter mission in Nigeria citing those two examples is very suspect. What is their agenda?\n\n\u201cHow does Mr. President\u2019s speech that anybody who is destroying infrastructure, who is destroying police stations, who is destroying INEC offices should be ready for the consequences; is that inciting violence?\u201d\n\nWhile accepting the fact that Twitter may have its own rules, Mohammed said that should not stop Buhari from expressing his views against a banned organisation like IPOB inciting people to commit arson and the likes in the South-east.\n\nHe stated: \u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule. If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concerned about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges. If an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed. Two, any organisation that gives directives to its members to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that? We are the one guilty of double standards.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation \u2013 a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria, and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m saying that you cannot compare anybody with Kanu who boldly say, go and kill policemen.\n\nI think sometimes\u2026policemen are brothers, they are our uncle, they are children. We kill them their wives become widows, their children become orphans. And what is the offence of these policemen \u2013 because they are working to keep the country one. What about soldiers that are putting down their lives so that you and I can sleep? It is not acceptable anywhere in the world for anybody, anywhere, to stay in the comfort of wherever he is and now give directives to go and kill soldiers, go and kill policemen.\u201d\n\nAsked why Sheikh Ahmed Gumi whose comments were perceived as justifying Boko Haram actions has not been arrested, Mohammed asked who appointed Gumi as the go-between between government and Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cWho appointed Gumi middleman between government and Boko Haram? Listen, for me, unless you come and tell me this what Gumi said that is inciting that you are comparing to Kanu\u2026 anyway what we\u2019re discussing is different. We\u2019re discussing Twitter. If you want to ask any question about Gumi or any other person, go ahead but please, be objective,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said if government had resolved to pick up all those critical of the Buhari administration, the detention centres would have been full by now.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are so many people who have been spewing hate against Mr. President, against this governments. So if you want to comment, be fair; don\u2019t take a position, which is not objective. If we were to pick up everybody today who had been abusing this administration, the detention centres will be filled up and you will be the first person also to talk about lack of tolerance, lack of rule of law.\u201d\n\nReacting to Buhari\u2019s tweet, human rights activist, Aisha Yesufu, described as \u201cinsensitive\u201d the civil war analogy by the president.\n\nYesufu, in a video statement yesterday, said: \u201cMy name is Aisha Somtochukwu Yesufu. I am Igbo, a threat to the Igbo people is a threat to me. Any attack on the Igbo people is an attack on me. Any malignment of the Igbo people is a malignment to me. We are all Nigerians and no Nigerian is more Nigerian than the others.\n\n\u201cThe government must ensure that it deploys its resources and its apparatus equally to every section of this country.\n\n\u201cI totally condemn the tweet from the president where the president is threatening the Igbo people. He is threatening them with what happened in 1967. What happened in 1967 was a genocide; a crime against humanity and it must never ever be allowed to happen again.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cFor a president to come out today and use 1967 as a yardstick to threaten people with what happened then, with the 30 months of gruesomeness, with the 30 months of heinousness, with the 30 months of atrocities that were meted out on human beings, on fellow brothers and sisters, on children in this country, is inhumane, it is insensitive, it is callous, and it is unspeakable.\u201d\n\nFormer Ekiti State Governor, Mr. Ayodele Fayose, however, called on Twitter to hold presidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu and Mohammed accountable for the controversial \u2018civil war\u2019 post.\n\nReacting in a string of tweets, Fayose wrote: \u201cA president who cannot address his own people in time of crisis can certainly not be the one tweeting on the crisis. Twitter should rather hold Garba Shehu, Lai Mohammed and co (others) accountable.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that those using the president\u2019s powers for him do not know when and where to stop their power. Regrettably, Twitter may not know that Buhari is not the one operating the handle.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Ezeife: South-east Violence, Plot to Undermine Clamour for Igbo Presidency",
          "text": "\u2022Editors express concern over growing insecurity\n\nBy Alex Enumah\n\nA former Governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife, yesterday accused sponsors of the ongoing violence in the South-east of plotting to forestall elections in 2023 with the sole aim of thwarting the clamour by the zone to produce the next president.\n\nEzeife, while featuring on ARISE NEWS CHANNEL, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, however, exonerated members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN) from the recent killings of police personnel and the torching of public institutions in the zone.\n\nHe spoke hours after the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) expressed concern over the growing insecurity in the country and advised government at all levels to activate their structures in tackling the challenges.\n\nEzeife described the insurrection in the South-east as an attempt to provoke indigenes of the South-east.\n\nHe added that their findings showed that those behind the killings and destruction of public institutions such as offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) are not Igbo.\n\nHe said: \u201cWho are the people burning INEC\u2019s offices, who are killing the police? There is the impression that some people even within the government are guilty of organising such threat and blaming it on IPOB and ESN.\n\n\u201cNow we know that more than 80 per cent of the people caught by the CCTV are not from the South-east.\n\nWas it a design to blame it on IPOB and ESN? We are learning more now that there is a design to provoke the East.\u201d\n\nHe, however, could not identify the sponsors but suspected that some of them might be in government going by some of the findings by South-east leaders.\n\nHe stated that a South-east governor who had earlier accused IPOB and ESN of executing the attacks had since exonerated the secessionist group.\n\nHe also expressed reservation that the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, could hold the groups responsible for the violence without evidence.\n\nHe said: \u201cIPOB does not have tradition of shedding blood or burning down things. It is not Igbo tradition to shoot police, burn down houses. During the ENDSARS protests, people attributed what was happening in Lagos to some Igbo people and it was later discovered to be untrue.\n\n\u201cThose who are sponsoring this destruction don\u2019t want election; they don\u2019t want president from South-east zone and would even want to scatter the Anambra election and go for emergency situation and appoint someone.\n\n\u201cNigeria should understand what is going on and not jump into conclusion.\u201d\n\nWhile not justifying the activities of IPOB and its leader, Ezeife stated that the federal government by its alleged continued marginalisation of the South-east, is pushing Igbo out of Nigeria.\n\nHe listed some of the injustices the youths are fighting to include the absence of tangible federal government projects in the area as well as the alleged disregard for the principle of federal character in appointments, to the detriment of the Igbo.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has been working hard pushing the Igbo out of Nigeria. The young men are reacting to what is coming from the federal government. Whether it is project location, we don\u2019t have any in Igboland; whether it is appointment, you don\u2019t find it but if it is retirement, we\u2019re dominant.\u201d\n\nEzeife also alleged that many Igbo businesses are being crippled by the government.\n\nHe dismissed insinuation that the Igbo cannot speak with one voice when it comes to presenting a candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nAccording to him, the South-east has many individuals that can govern the country and the zone is currently working hard to win the support of other zones to clinch the presidency in 2023.\n\nOn the ongoing public hearing to review the constitution, the former governor urged legislators to stop wasting their time and public resources because what the people need now is a new constitution.\n\nEditors Express Concern over Growing Insecurity\n\nMeanwhile, the NGE has expressed concern over the growing insecurity in the country and advised government at all levels to activate their structures in tackling the challenges.\n\nIt also called for an enabling political and economic environment for the media to discharge their constitutional and social responsibilities.\n\nIt added that creating a conducive environment for the media to thrive would guarantee and sustain democratic space, sustainable development and provide incentives for social/democratic change.\n\nThe guild, in a communiqu\u00e9 issued and signed by its President, Mr. Mustapha Isah, and General Secretary, Mr. Iyobosa Uwugiaren, at the end of its 2021 Biennial Convention in Kano, called on the federal government to, as a matter of urgency, expunge, repeal or amend as may be appropriate, all existing obnoxious media laws that are inimical to press freedom.\n\nIt also urged editors and journalists to continue to subscribe to and uphold the journalism code of ethics \u2013 as developed by the Nigerian Press Organisation (NPO).\n\n\u2018\u2019The guild observes the need for the Nigerian mass media to exercise their freedom to operate freely with a sense of responsibility. And considering the spikes in the levels of insecurity across the length and breadth of the country, it is high time for the media to set the agenda and lead the country\u2019s drive to sustaining national cohesion.\n\n\u2018\u2019While observing Nigeria\u2019s consistent deterioration in the Global Press Freedom Index since 2005, the guild notes that it is worrisome that the slide is happening in a democracy, whereby the guild has had cause in recent times to issue three press statements on the threats of closure and imposition of fines on some broadcast stations by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC),\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 added.\n\nThe guild noted that the huge disruption the COVID-19 pandemic has created globally, saying that the disruption has also had negative effects on the Nigerian media industry, leading to drop in revenues.\n\n\u2018\u2019For the media to respond to these challenges creatively, there is urgent need for the media managers to evolve diversification, designing of a dynamic management system, producing innovative contents, restructuring their production technologies and adapting new funding and business models.\n\n\u2018\u2019Considering that the role of information dissemination by the mass media is an essential public and social service, the guild calls on government to consider mitigating the media\u2019s operational costs and economic challenges by floating a national media subsidy regime, including tax holidays and waivers, lifting of licence fees for the broadcast media and offsetting debts of government media agencies in the country,\u2019\u2019 the guild stated.\n\nThe guild\u2019s national convention, which attracted over 300 editors and media owners across the country, also expressed concern over the prevalence and massive elevation of fake news, disinformation and propaganda due to the mishandlings of the social media platforms by negative persons.\n\nThe guild harped on the need for Nigeria\u2019s media publics, particularly the youth whom the media must carry along, to use, decipher and rely on the conventional media for reliable and credible information in taking their decisions.\n\nThe safety of journalists also attracted the attention of the editors, as they called on both the public and the private media operators to devise measures inclusive of guaranteed welfare and insurance schemes for the safety and security of journalists working for them.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 added: \u2018\u2019Against the backdrop of the assailing new media trends, the guild highlights the essence of training and retraining of the Nigerian journalists to update their knowledge, skills and expertise of the profession \u2013 with a view to attaining the needed proficiency and competencies that are required to overcome the new media drifts that dragging journalism profession.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile commending Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State for keeping the state safe even in the midst of the prevailing insecurity in some parts of the country, the editors also appreciated the state government\u2019s phenomenal drive of infrastructure development; as well as the state government\u2019s determination to turn Kano into a modern city.\n\nThe guild thanked Ganduje and members of the state Executive Council for providing the enabling environment for the national convention to hold.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Barkindo: Oil industry\u2019s upstream spending slumped 30% in 2020\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said that the Nigerian oil and gas industry will require at least $40 billion in direct investments in basic infrastructure to achieve the federal government\u2019s much talked-about about \u201cDecade of Gas.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Secretary General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, said the cartel\u2019s latest assessment showed that capital investments in the upstream of the oil and gas industry fell by 30 per cent in 2020.\n\nNNPC said yesterday that it was targeting between 7.4 billion cubic feet to 10 billion cubit feet of gas in the next couple of years, compared to its current 1.6 bcf supply capacity.\n\nSpeaking at a virtual forum organised by the Association of Local Distributors of Gas (ALDG), tagged \u201cThe Decade of Gas: Unlocking Opportunities in the Domestic Gas Market,\u201d the Chief Operating Officer, Gas and Power, NNPC, Mr Yusuf Usman, stated that a major constraint in achieving local content through the programme is the difficult conditions placed by foreign lenders.\n\nHowever, he stated that the corporation expects to grow about 10 gas-based industries as it works towards the 10-year target.\n\nHe added that the figure on the quantum of funds needed is based on the submissions NNPC has received from potential investors.\n\nIn addition, he stated that about 39 thermal power plants were being targeted as opposed to the current 33.\n\nAccording to him, by the end of this year, the NNPC is projecting an added gas sales of about 600 mmscfd, compared to its current 1.6 bcf to hit 2.2 bcf by the end of 2021.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn terms of benefits, we will generate 45,000 megawatts of power in terms of gas use, creating massive employment and import substitution.\n\n\u201cThere are changes we need to look at to actualise the decade of gas. We see the huge amount of investment, both Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) that will come into the country upward of $40 billion or much more than that in order to achieve all the aggressive plans that that are outlined in the decade of gas.\n\n\u201cThis investment will come in the upstream, midstream and downstream, but there are challenges as well because there have been a lot of announcements around funding for fossil fuels and these are some of the things we have to look at as we go forward and we need to figure out the announcement vis-a-vis the foreign estimate that we expect.\u201d\n\nHe added that the corporation has a supply plan to deliver up to 4.5 bcf of gas into the market, while going forward, the country expects 7.4 bcf of gas.\n\nAccording to Usman, there are urgent plans to complete ongoing gas projects in the country, including the AKK project , which he described as one of the most aggressive and biggest pipeline infrastructure ever embarked upon by the country. The pipeline spans 614 km.\n\nHe said all the gas activities going on around the country were being handled by local construction companies and local providers of services due to the COVID-19 restrictions.\n\n\u201cGoing forward into 10 years, we expect to do another big pipeline that will take up gas from south, all the way into Ajaokuta and possibly we extend it all the way to Maiduguri,\u201d he said.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) will be passed this year, noting that the corporation is ready to adjust to the changes that the law will impose.\n\nUsman stated that by the corporation\u2019s projection, demand for gas to generate electricity in the country will consume between 60 to 70 per cent of the entire commodity produced, with the ongoing plan to generate 45,000MW.\n\n\u201cThe other challenge we have is the liquidity in the power sector, and there\u2019s a lot of work going on because it is a very huge market. If you see the demand projections that we have done, it is going to consume 60 to 70 per cent of the gas that we have.\n\n\u201cNot only that; without power, all the development programmes we are thinking of will be a mirage. It is an inevitable equation that we have to solve to move towards development and issues around it have to be resolved,\u201d he stated.\n\nUsman urged policy makers to answer the questions surrounding gas pricing, since Nigeria is interested in using gas as a source of revenue as well as balancing between investment and local content drive.\n\n\u201cAll these FDI come with conditionality before taking the money. That will put a limit to our local content drive. As you all know, the restrictions by itself affect the kind of projections that we look at,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stated that if Nigeria will achieve the decade of gas, it must transit to a willing-buyer willing-seller market.\n\nBesides, there must be a document with timelines as well as defined investment strategies on the announcement that is being made about the restriction for fossil fuel to achieve the decade of gas.\n\nBarkindo: Oil Industry\u2019s Upstream Spending Slumped 30% in 2020\n\nMeanwhile, the Secretary General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, has said that the cartel\u2019s latest assessment shows that capital investments in the upstream of the oil and gas industry fell by 30 per cent in 2020.\n\nHe said at the first meeting of the OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue that despite that, crude oil will continue to be relevant, especially in Africa.\n\nDescribing the future of Africa\u2019s oil industry as bright and the opportunities vast, Barkindo stated that the continent is currently home to five of the top 30 oil-producing countries in the world.\n\nAccording to him, oil is expected to retain the largest share of the global energy mix throughout the forecast period, providing nearly 28 per cent of global requirements in 2045, followed by gas at around 25 per cent and coal at roughly 20 per cent.\n\nIn 2019, Barkindo stated that the continent produced 8.5 mb/d of oil, which is around nine per cent of world\u2019s output.\n\nHe said at the end of 2019, Africa was estimated to have proven oil reserves amounting to around 126 billion barrels,with Nigeria holding the lion\u2019s share with 36.9 billion barrels, representing 29 per cent of Africa\u2019s reserves.\n\nBarkindo said demand in developing regions, including Africa, with its rapidly growing population and dynamic demographical shifts, would be intensified, and all forms of energy would be needed, not only to support the post-pandemic recovery but to satisfy long-term energy requirements.\n\n\u201cOne major issue looming in the long-term horizon is the lack of adequate industry investment.\n\n\u201cAccording to our latest assessments, upstream capital spending is estimated to have fallen in 2020 by a staggering 30 per cent or more.\n\n\u201cOur 2020 World Oil Outlook estimates that $12.6 trillion will be required between now and 2045 in the upstream, midstream and downstream.\n\n\u201cWe must continue to advocate a turnaround in this very upsetting trend. The very future of our industry is at stake,\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to him, oil and gas will continue to be a vital part of the energy needs to ensure future demand is met, adding that policies must change in that regard.\n\nHe stated that another issue of utmost concern in Africa is the scourge of energy poverty, which continues to impact millions across the continent.\n\nCiting OPEC data, Barkindo said an estimated 47 per cent of the population in Sub Saharan Africa had no electricity and approximately 85 per cent of people lacked access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking.\n\nHe stated that considering the richness of the continent\u2019s resources, both conventional and renewable, this situation is hard to accept.\n\nHe urged all stakeholders to unite on the issues to ensure an equitable distribution of energy that leaves no one behind.\n\n\u201cWhen all is said and done, access to energy, like education and health care, should not be considered a luxury but a human right.\n\n\u201cOPEC will continue to work closely with our member countries to advocate for real and lasting change on this issue,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Can TalentQL\u2019s six-month program fill Africa\u2019s need for senior developers?",
          "text": "Adewale Yusuf, the founder and former publisher of Techpoint, made what many saw as a bold move last year.\n\nNot only did he swap the uncertainty of tech media for the vulnerability of founding a tech startup, he chose Ile-Ife, a town 200 km removed from the chaos of Lagos, as the \u201cquiet location\u201d for his new adventure.\n\nYusuf, along with one Jobberman co-founder and a couple other people, started TalentQL, an outsourcing firm for companies in need of quality software developers.\n\n\u201cHire top vetted technical talent across Africa quickly and seamlessly,\u201d their website says. Part of the plan was to produce talents by building campuses that house co-working spaces, with dependable electricity and Internet.\n\nOf course this is no longer a novel startup idea. Indeed it might appear late in the day to be getting into the \u201ctech talent matching\u201d game. Andela, one might say, has been there, done that. There probably isn\u2019t much mineral left in that mine.\n\nBut Yusuf thinks there is and has garnered resources to explore the endless possibilities that exist in the ecosystem. They launched last November with $300,000 seed money from Zedcrest Capital, Kola Aina of Ventures Platform and Prosper Otemuyiwa, a co-founder at Eden. In March this year, they got accepted into Techstars Toronto.\n\nFun fact: Over 70% of @TalentQL's African clients are Fintech companies.\n\nWe've placed CTO/Technical Lead in over 50% of them. \u2014 Adewale Yusuf (@AdewaleYusuf_) May 28, 2021\n\nYusuf is \u201cconvinced that what we are doing at TalentQL will change the African talent landscape. We believe that talent is Africa\u2019s greatest export and as such needs to be developed and refined.\u201d\n\nAll well and good. But what kind of talent are we exporting and why does it need to be refined? The answer has come nearly eight months after launch.\n\nMeet \u201cPipeline by TalentQL\u201c\n\nThis week, TalentQL has announced a \u201cspecialised training program for Software Engineers in Africa.\u201d It is coolly named Pipeline by TalentQL.\n\nThe program is for mid-level African software engineers, defined by TalentQL as those with three years work experience. In six intensive months, each of them will access \u201cadvanced resources\u201d and will be mentored by top senior software engineers working in global organisations like Twitter, Tesla, Gitlab, Amazon and Google.\n\nAccording to Yusuf, the program is necessary because up to 90% of TalentQL\u2019s clients want senior software engineers. Africa may have about 700,000 professional software developers but many are not experienced enough to meet global demand.\n\nThat\u2019s a familiar line for anyone who has followed Andela\u2019s story. Once the poster child of African tech for organising bootcamps that churned out junior developers at no initial cost, Andela hit the reality-check button in September 2019.\n\nFor a period of nine months to May 2020, Andela laid off more than 500 junior to mid level developers as they trimmed down to focus on senior talent. They have now expanded their talent pool to include Latin America to more ably serve the senior talent need that Africa alone cannot solve.\n\nOn one hand, TalentQL\u2019s Pipeline is a welcome plan to plug the experience gap in Africa by upskilling mid-level engineers. Yusuf insists Pipeline isn\u2019t for juniors \u2013 while the likes of Decagon and Semicolon serve as entry points for novices.\n\nTalentQL\u2019s promise with the program is that those who participate can expect to gain skills that will make them highly valued by employers. In addition to technical competence, Pipeline participants will be taught important soft skills.\n\nTheir mission comes from a good place but will it work?\n\nSenior developers are not a monolith\n\nTo get a sense of what to expect from Pipeline, I asked Sheriff Shittu, who runs a platform for developers seeking jobs, for his thoughts. His first inquiry was to know if the intensive program will involve live projects.\n\nWhile a training can make developers more knowledgeable, it may not immediately translate to experience and readiness for senior roles.\n\nBut \u201cif I work on high-impact fast live projects, my growth will be faster than someone who lets on select projects for two years,\u201d Shittu says.\n\nFor a senior developer at a Nigerian fintech, these four pillars are necessary for maturity: communication, problem solving, mentorship abilities, and ownership.\n\n\u201cI have been a good communicator from day one of my job, but my problem-solving abilities were not as good as they are now. If you become good at solving problems independently then you can take ownership.\u201d\n\nDoes he think Pipeline\u2019s six-month program will get mid-level devs to the senior ladder? \u201cIt depends, people are different.\u201d\n\nInviting similar upskilling initiatives\n\nKeeping both options in view, it is possible for TalentQL to achieve its purpose with this program if it meets a threshold for practicality and participants can meaningfully accelerate their communication and problem solving expertise.\n\nThe other implication is that Pipeline won\u2019t be open to just any mid-level engineer who has worked for three years. There will be a screening process to choose only those who want to \u201cmake the jump to become Senior Software Developers,\u201d Yusuf says.\n\nAdewale Yusuf, TalentQL\u2019s founder\n\nWhich, as you may have deduced, means that solving Africa\u2019s shortage of senior developers will require more than one training of this sort.\n\nDecagon, which aims to train 10,000 developers in 10 years, currently graduates about 100 juniors a year from its campus. It is reasonable to expect a lower figure from TalentQL\u2019s Pipeline.\n\nYet, it could be a valuable experiment for the ecosystem in training senior developers.\n\nIt is a free program that hopes to get returns when participants find senior work; that might be a questionable tactic seeing it didn\u2019t work for Andela. But the justification here is that there is enough demand to absorb people who graduate.\n\nIf that proves to be true, it won\u2019t be long before competitors arise to get a share of the Pipeline pie.",

          "text": "A tweet by Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria\u2019s president, that seemed to imply certain people in the country will be dealt with violently caused a stir on Tuesday evening.\n\nAlmost immediately, there were calls for Buhari\u2019s tweet to be removed from the social media platform.\n\nTwitter answered that call on Wednesday afternoon. The tweet was part of a thread in which Buhari expressed displeasure at \u201cattacks on critical national infrastructure,\u201d including on facilities belonging to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nBuhari\u2019s deleted tweet was widely criticised as summoning the ghosts of the Nigeria civil war, a deadly three-year combat between the Nigerian government and a government in southeast Nigeria, which had seceded from the republic.\n\nThe Biafra war, as it is alternatively called, led to the death of nearly 1 million people, according to various accounts.\n\nWhile he may have intended to send a strong message against recent vandalism in the southeast supposedly led by the Indigenous People of Biafra, a proscribed militant group, Buhari\u2019s comment was interpreted as an affront and a threat to people in the region.\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War,\u201d the tweet read.\n\n\u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe controversial tweet was from what Buhari said in a televised meeting with the leadership of INEC. He did not seem to be reading from a script, according to a video recording.\n\nTwitter had never deleted tweets by the Nigerian president before. Given that Nigeria is the platform\u2019s biggest market in Africa, it marks a new paradigm in the role it plays shaping civic spaces and citizen-government relations in Africa.\n\nTwitter may have been nudged to take action on Buhari\u2019s tweet following complaints by multiple accounts. Peoples\u2019 Gazette, an online publication on political affairs, reports that Twitter initially said Buhari\u2019s tweet did not violate its policies but reversed itself later.\n\nIn a statement to TechCabal, Twitter said the tweet \u201cwas in violation of the Twitter Rules. The account owner will be required to delete the violative Tweet and spend 12 hours with their account in read-only mode.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Lai Mohammed, Nigeria\u2019s information minister, has accused Twitter of not being clear in its standard for deleting tweets, implying the US company has a longstanding bias against the Nigerian government.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very very suspect,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\n\u201cHas Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? The same Twitter that was funding #ENDSARS protesters\u2026 When people were burning Police stations and killing policemen, for Twitter it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened at the [US] Capitol, it became an insurrection.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria, citing those two examples, is very suspect. What is their agenda?\u201d\n\nLast October, Twitter became the platform where the world learned much about END SARS protests in Nigeria. Jack Dorsey, the company\u2019s CEO, expressed solidarity in a couple of tweets. But it is not clear that the company funded protesters in the way the minister alleges.",

          "text": "Small and medium scale enterprises in Africa receive about $70bn of credit each year. But the International Finance Corporation estimates that the gap exceeds $300bn.\n\nWhy does the gap exist? Michael Famoroti, chief economist at Stears gave two reasons during a recent TechCabal Live event on financing renewable energy companies in Africa.\n\nFirst, there is an information problem.\n\nCredit providers seem to lack enough information with which to assess the risk worthiness of many borrowers. This problem exists at the retail level as most bank customers who have tried to take personal loans will be aware.\n\nBut it is arguably a bigger problem for SMEs and startups whose businesses are typically regarded as high-risk and unproven.\n\nThe second reason Famoroti gave is that credit providers may not find enough value in the use proposed for the funds. In this case, creditors may play safe by lending to legacy industries like real estate or banking, while taking a skeptical approach to promising but new ventures. Like renewable energy for example.\n\nSo if you are setting up a renewable energy startup to provide electricity to the more than 50% of people living in SubSaharan Africa who lack access, how do you find funding?\n\nThe TechCabal Live event had Marly Diallo, Wiebe Boer and Christian Wessels in attendance as guests.\n\nDiallo runs BRT Energy, a startup that regenerates batteries by reducing lead-acid waste. She started her career in fintech and banking, but when it was time to raise money for BRT, she hid many roadblocks.\n\nIn BRT\u2019s early days, she met the criteria for a certain funding program. But because she could not produce three years of financial statements, she did not get access to the money.\n\nMarly\u2019s experience is not an anomaly.\n\nWessels, co-founder and CEO of Daystar Power, also has a banking background having worked at Barclays for years. Founded in 2017, Daystar now operates hybrid energy solutions that combine solar and generator sets in Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal and Ivory Coast.\n\nLast year, they raised $38 million in a Series B round but it was mainly from development finance institutions in Nordic countries. But Wessels still remembers the anxiety that came with sourcing funds locally.\n\n\u201cNigerian banks played zero role in our financing. That\u2019s not great because we don\u2019t like the idea that as a West Africa company, that we are getting money mainly from overseas.\n\n\u201cI mean, thank God we get the money but why is it that we need to rely on DFIs and European investors when what we are doing is locally valuable?\u201d\n\nSuch experiences scar founders and make it seem like there are no funding opportunities for renewable energy financing within Africa. But some organisations have come aboard bearing some hope.\n\nAll On is an independent, off-grid energy impact investment company. It was founded by Shell, the oil company, as a vehicle for giving back to Nigeria by making impact investments into the renewable energy sector. Shell provided the seed funding but doesn\u2019t make any money from the venture.\n\nWiebe Boer, All On\u2019s managing director, empathizes with founders who need funding but have little sources to reach out to. With banks an obvious \u201cwaste of time,\u201d he advises that family and friends will continue to be the first base for most founders.\n\nFrom there, it might be possible to access funding from All On\u2019s initiatives for projects at the ideation stage. At the moment, the firm partners with two organisations for this purpose: the Clean Tech Hub in Abuja and the Nigeria Climate Innovation Centre in Lagos. These initiatives give up to $10,000.\n\nAbove that is another stage of up to $50,000 debt investment for companies that are, for example, doing their first minigrid or importing solar equipment. All On does this in partnership with the US Africa Development Foundation. USADF matches All On\u2019s $50,000 loan with a grant of $50,000.\n\nAll On could invest further in startups that show promise after this stage. For example, Auxano, a solar equipment company, received the $50,000 loan in 2018. It performed well enough for All On to invest $1.5 million last September to help the startup scale its assembly plant over the next five years.\n\n\u201cIt really is about being credible from the beginning and delivering even at a small level. With that, investors can give you more money,\u201d Boer says.\n\nWhat Marly, the BRT founder, has learned is that a pilot program can be useful in showing how useful an investor\u2019s funds will be.\n\n\u201cYou need to prove your concept by doing pilots to get customers.You need to make sure that what you are pushing is adopted by the market,\u201d she said.\n\nWessels, who now has access to entrepreneurship support networks like Endeavor Nigeria that give Daystar access to more funding, says new founders will need much tenacity and patience along the way. But he hopes they persevere because \u201cultimately, there is a big market to serve.\u201d\n\nWatch the full video of the TechCabal Live event on financing an African renewable energy company here.",

By the end of April 2019, the PLR and the MLR spiked and climaxed at 18.23 and 30.89 percent.\n\nAstonishingly, the average saving rate fell to 3.91 percent, according to a study titled, \u2018An Appraisal of CBN Temporary Credit Initiatives: An exploratory Analysis,\u2019 written by Baba Yaaba.\n\nThis implies that while the cost of funds to banks was declining, lending rate was on the rise. This disparity was a clear signal of exploitation by the banks, which is no doubt unfriendly to growth, the publication stated.\n\nRead Also: Nigerian banks lend to customers at higher rate despite cheap funds\n\nResponding to the development, Ayodeji Ebo, head, retail investment, Chapel Hill Denham, says the main reason lending rate will be high is because of rates in the interbank and financial markets.\n\n\u201cRates are in double digits, hence no incentive to create risk assets that come with various risks. To take the risk, then must come with a premium,\u201d Ebo states.\n\nThe Overnight (O/N) inter-bank rate, which is the rate at which DMBs borrow and lend to one another, increased by 2.17 percent to close at 14.83 percent on Wednesday as against the last close of 12.66 percent on Tuesday.\n\nAlso, the Open Buy Back (OBB) rate, the money market instrument used to raise short-term capital, increased by 2.33 percent to close at 14.33 percent from 12 percent on the previous day.\n\nIn July 2019, the CBN increased the Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) to 60 percent, which led to private sector credit expansion by 3.46 percent to 2.11 percent at the end of July 2019 from -1.36 percent in June.\n\nThe trend continued until it climaxed at 13.57 percent at the end of the year. Arising from the adjustment in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) to 27.5 percent in January 2020, however, the private sector credit moderated to 12.57 percent.\n\nAs of fourth quarter of 2020, banks credit to the private sector rose by 2.56 percent to N20.37 trillion, the year that was bedevilled by the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) banking sector report released on April 2021 showed that total value of credit allocated by the bank stood at N20.37 trillion as of Q4 2020. Oil & Gas and Manufacturing sectors got credit allocation of N3.93 trillion and N3.19 trillion to record the highest credit allocation as at the period under review.\n\nThe reason for growth in banks\u2019 loan book was as a result of the implementation of the Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) policy of the CBN.",

          "text": "The United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, William F. Sweeney Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d), and Jonathan D. Larsen, Special Agent in Charge of the New York Field Office of the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation (\u201cIRS-CI\u201d), have announced the arrest of a Nigerian, Charles Onus for charges in connection with a scheme to conduct cyber intrusions of multiple user accounts maintained by a company that provides human resources and payroll services to employers across the United States, in order to steal payroll deposits.\n\nOnus, 34, according a statement published on the website of the US Justice Department, was previously arrested on April 14, 2021, in San Francisco and detained, and he will be presented later in Manhattan federal court before Magistrate Judge Sarah L. Cave. The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Paul G. Gardephe.\n\nManhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss, according to the statement, said: \u201cCharles Onus allegedly participated in a scheme that stole nearly $1 million by hacking into a payroll processing company\u2019s system to access user accounts and divert payroll to prepaid debit cards he controlled. As alleged, Onus did this as effectively as someone who commits bank burglary, but with no need for a blowtorch or bolt-cutters. Thanks to the FBI and IRS-CI, Onus is in custody and facing serious federal charges.\u201d\n\nFBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: \u201cCyber intrusions ripple through everything our society relies upon \u2013 this one impacted people\u2019s paychecks. The FBI\u2019s goal is to prevent cyber criminals from causing harm and holding them accountable, but we can\u2019t do it alone. Companies need to continuously improve their cyber hygiene and awareness. Taking steps like training the workforce to protect and frequently change passwords, and to use different login credentials across platforms, can have an impact. Each one of us, from the individual citizen to the biggest corporation, plays a critical role in defending the nation from cyberattacks.\u201d\n\nIRS-CI Special Agent in Charge Jonathan D. Larsen said: \u201cIRS Criminal Investigation will always work with our law enforcement partners to track down those who try to breach our country\u2019s tax and financial infrastructure. We will continually endeavor to bring to justice criminals who think they can comfortably steal from victims in America while hiding behind their computer screens.\u201d\n\nAccording to Justice Department, from at least in or about July 2017 through at least in or about 2018, Onus participated in a scheme to conduct cyber intrusions of multiple user accounts maintained by a company that provides human resources and payroll services to employers across the United States (the \u201cCompany\u201d), in order to steal payroll deposits processed by the Company.\n\nDuring the course of the scheme, unauthorized access was obtained to over 5,500 Company user accounts through a cyber intrusion technique referred to as \u201ccredential stuffing.\u201d During a credential stuffing attack, a cyber threat actor collects stolen credentials, or username and password pairs, obtained from other large-scale data breaches of other companies, the statement said.\n\nThe threat actor then systematically attempts to use those stolen credentials to obtain unauthorized access to accounts held by the same user with other companies and providers, to compromise accounts where the user has maintained the same password.\n\nAfter ONUS successfully gained unauthorized access to a Company user account, he changed the bank account information designated by the user of the account so that ONUS would receive the user\u2019s payroll to a prepaid debit card that was under ONUS\u2019s control.\n\nFrom at least in or about July 2017 through at least in or about 2018, at least approximately 5,500 Company user accounts were compromised and more than approximately $800,000 in payroll funds were fraudulently diverted to prepaid debit cards, including those under the control of ONUS. The compromised Company user accounts were associated with employers whose payroll was processed by the Company, including employers located in the Southern District of New York.\n\nOnus, a resident and national of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, was charged with one count of computer fraud for causing damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; one count of computer fraud for unauthorized access to a protected computer to further intended fraud, and one count of receipt of stolen money, each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; and one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory sentence of two years in prison to be served consecutively to any other sentence imposed.\n\nThe maximum potential sentences are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge.\n\nMs. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and IRS-CI.

          "title": "How Dave Umahi became enemy of Ebonyi people, By Abia Onyike",
          "text": "\u201cAll ambitions are lawful except those which climb upwards on the miseries of mankind\u2019\u2019. Joseph Conrad(1857-1924).\n\nIn the beginning:\n\nSaturday, the 29th day of May, 2021 marked the 6th anniversary of Gov. David Nweze Umahi\u2019s ascendancy into the Government House as the 3rd democratically elected Governor of Ebonyi state. The six years has been a horrible period in the life of Ebonyians. Visitors and foreigners who pass through Abakaliki or those who visit the Governor often tell stories about how the state has become an Eldorado or a bed of roses. Well, Umahi\u2019s 419 government may have deceived some people but he has merely succeeded in declaring himself the enemy of Ebonyi people based on the cumulative anti-people policies of his highly authoritarian and self-serving administration.\n\nThe people of Ebonyi state after six years of Umahi\u2019s fake leadership, have come to the realisation that he was merely after his pocket and the welfare of his family members. He is a man without central values. After he noticed that Ebonyians have deserted him, he threw caution to the winds and started behaving like a loose canon. He descended on the worthy leaders of the state- the same people who made him Governor in 2015. In 2014, as Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Chief Anyim Pius Anyim was instrumental to making things easier for Umahi to emerge as Governor of Ebonyi state. Anyim introduced him to some \u2018oracles\u2019 of economic and political power. The resources for his election was provided for him. And as the countdown to the 2015 Governorship elections gathered momentum, Umahi confided in some people that he needed the faces of people like Dr. Sam Egwu, the former Governor of the state to shore up his credibility to be able to win the election.\n\nUmahi then needed a sanctuary because the former Governor Chief Martin Elechi, whom Umahi served under as Deputy Governor(2011-2015) had described him as being \u201cworse than an armed robber\u2019\u2019 at the Abakaliki Township Stadium during a rally.\n\nUmahi fell out out of favour with Elechi. Today, Umahi has jumped ship and decamped from PDP to APC. Finding himself on a lonely road as the top PDP leaders in the state refused to follow him on his latest misadventure, Umahi declared war on them. He first accused them last year of being supporters of IPOB and now because the Ebonyi state members of the National Assembly raised alarm about the way Gov. Umahi was wrongly deploying the EbubeAgu Regional Security outfit to intimidate and threaten his real and imagined political opponents, Umahi reported them to the AIG Zone 9 who was at Government House Abakaliki on courtesy call.\n\nHe told the Police Chief to arrest the listed leaders of PDP and accused them of being behind the recent upsurge of criminal and violent crimes in the state. That was the height of cheap blackmail and abuse of official privilege and potrays Umahi as someone lacking in political maturity. He is someone who can sell his people for a pot of porridge and he may be willing to become the nemesis of his own people. Umahi displayed his inherent anarchic tendency. He is fond of threatening those who disagree with him on political issues. Sometimes he threatens to \u2018crush\u2019 and \u2018grind\u2019 them. For Umahi to do what he is doing now to Sen. Sam Egwu shows that he is a politician without pedigree. He is merely an upstart and a shameless opportunist.\n\n2. Gov. Umahi\u2019s tragedy of Populism: Administrative Recklessness, Grand Deceit and Massive Corruption.\n\nGov. Umahi wanted to package himself as a Messiah of sorts, a God-sent hero. But his love for money created terrible contradictions for the system he presides over. He is not a foundational man nor a pathfinder. Tyrants are worse than wicked men. And the Mammon spirit is the demonic drive behind all dictatorships in history. The Bible says that \u201c\u2026 the love of money is the root of all evil\u2019\u2019(1 Timothy 6:10). It is such fake populism that may have led him to desecrate the rules of the civil service, so as to be seen as a redeemer and charismatic leader- one who builds numerous cement roads without bitumen; and uses hand vibrators instead of modern vibrators to construct/compact roads, thereby leading to frequent road repairs.\n\nBut populism has its tragedy in politics. It can bring about abuse of people\u2019s basic rights and personality cultism where the leader sees himself as all-knowing. That is certainly Umahi\u2019s problem today. It is the problem of mediocre populism which has failed to anchor because of the prebendalism exhibited by the pseudo leader. Dr. Chuba Okadigbo referred to such characters like Umahi as \u201cpocket-size Napoleons and mid-night Hitlers,\u201d\n\nGovernor Umahi\u2019s government has become a disaster in the state. He does not tolerate any form of criticism, whether constructive or otherwise. He perceives himself as King Herod who must rule as he likes without recourse to the feelings of the people or the rules of engagement for public officers. That was why he beheaded the state civil service on assumption of office in 2015 and emasculated the Trade Unions/House Unions, through deliberate but illegitimate/illegal factionalization, bordering on barefaced tyranny, fraud, authoritarianism and totalitarianism. It was an act of micro treasonable felony for an elected officer to apply political hooliganism in undermining the rules of the civil service. He was the only Governor in Nigeria to have ruled his state without Permanent Secretaries from 2015 to 2019. He sacked the Perm Secs he inherited from the previous administration and refused to appoint new ones. The implication is that all the monies appropriated by Umahi in the four years under review in those Ministries, Departments and Agencies without Permanent Secretaries (Accounting Officers of the Ministries) have to be refunded by him because what he did amounted to misappropriation of public funds.\n\nIt is the worst form of systemic corruption in the history of Nigeria\u2019s public service. The practice of having Permanent Secretaries was never violated by Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Dr. M.I. Okpara(pioneer Premiers of Eastern Region, Dr. Akanu Ibiam(pioneer Governor of Eastern Region), Col.Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu(Military Governor of Eastern Region), Chief Sam Mbakwe (Governor of Old Imo state), Chief Jim Nwobodo(Governor, old Anambra state), Chief C.C.Onoh(Governor, old Anambra state), Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu( Governor, old Abia state), Commander Walter Aye Feghabor(first Military Administrator, Ebonyi state),AIG of Police Simeon Oduoye(Military Governor, Ebonyi state), Dr.Sam Ominyi Egwu(first civilian Governor, Ebonyi state and Chief Martin Elechi(second civilian Governor of Ebonyi state).\n\nThe duty of the Perm Secs is to advise the Commissioners about the rules of the service, but Umahi hated such advice. Of all these leaders, military and civilian, Umahi is the only one with the temerity to lynch and violate the conservative rules of the civil service. But the time when he must pay for it will come by 2023 when he leaves office and loses his immunity. Chief Sam Mbakwe worked with some of the most seasoned, charismatic, influential and powerful Perm Secs in history, such as S.C.A Nwapa, Francis Oji, G.C Okezie, N.C Okoronkwo, A.E.N Izuwa, Friday Okengwu, I.D Nwoga, Kele Okereke etc. and still emerged as the best Igbo Governor of his generation. His picture hangs elegantly in the \u201cIgbo Hall of Fame\u2019\u2019 with the pictures of other Igbo pioneers/pathfinders in the same place such as Olauda Equano, King Jaja of Opobo, Nnamdi Azikiwe, Michael Okpara, Akanu Ibiam, Aguiyi Ironsi, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, Chinua Achebe, Keneth Onwuka Dike, Eni Njoku, Z.C.Obi, Philip Emeagwali etc. For the Governors of the present republic, only three have been shortlisted for the Igbo Hall of Fame. They are Peter Obi, Sam Egwu and Achike Udenwa. One of them will be eventually picked after several years of thorough scrutiny. Umahi can never be allowed to come near the hall because trickstars are not worthy of such honours.\n\nAzikiwe\u2019s father, as at 1902 was already a trained teacher in Asaba. In 1903, he moved to Bonny where he met Lord Fredrick Lugard and followed him to Kano. Lugard appointed him his Secretary. They went to Zungeru where Nnamdi Azikiwe was born in 1904. From Zungeru they went to Calabar and by 1st January, 1914 they arrived Tinubu Square, Lagos to execute the historic Amalgamation of Nigeria. Then Ojukwu\u2019s father attended the Hope Waddel Training Institution(established in 1895) at a time when there were only eight secondary schools in Nigeria. He joined the Eastern Region Department of Agriculture and later left for John Holt where he was employed as a Sales Clerk. He resigned from there to set up Ojukwu Transport Company and later became the pioneer business mogul in Nigeria and first Director-General of Nigerian Stock Exchange and by the 1950s was Africa\u2019s first multi- billionaire. So, if their children, Emeka Ojukwu and Nnamdi Azikiwe with their powerful parentage, fame and high education could work with Perm Secs, why should some characters come from the pit of illiteracy to hold people to ransome in Ebonyi state? Infact the non-use or non-appointment of Permanent Secretaries is a violation of Section 208 of the Nigerian constitution. Umahi should examine the Circulars from the National Income and Wages Commission on the Appointment of Perm Secs to determine the amount to be refunded in respect of the first four years of his administration, from 2015-2019.\n\nAccording to a pamphlet issued by the Association of Concerned Ebonyi Citizens in Diaspora(ACECID), Vol.1, titled \u201c The Iron Fist of Poverty and Autocracy in Ebonyi State: Discovering Dave Umahi: His Deeds, Misdeeds, Truths and Untruths\u2019\u2019, \u201c Forget about the cosmetics, the decorations, bling bling lights and plastic Christmas trees\u2026mounting neon-lights and casting of concrete as a cover to retire billions into private pockets. What we are witnessing is gross maladministration, grand lacerny, callousness, cold heartedness, autocratic indifference to the sufferings that has endangered abject poverty and dehumanization upon the people of Ebonyi state.\u201d\n\nThe report went further to assert that: \u201cUmahi\u2019s authocratic personalization of power and needless privatization of state assets and resources to himself has played a perfect symphony of power grab, imperial domination and swagger. Vulgarity is the very definition of his style. He wants to remain the only man standing and towering above a rotten pile of poverty, suffering and helplessness.\u201d\n\nGov.Umahi\u2019s enemity with Ebonyi people was caused by himself. He embarked on four useless and wasteful projects worth billions of naira probably for siphoning funds into private pockets while the citizens wallowed in poverty. The projects include the new Government House project at Ochudo, the Ecumenical Centre, the Shopping Mall and the on-going construction of about a dozen flyovers in the state. Other useless and wasteful projects include the hotel building infront of Abakaliki Township stadium at Kpirikpiri which is still unoccupied several years after it was completed.\n\nUmahi spent huge sums of money renovating the Governor\u2019s residence in the old Government House, but suddenly came up with the idea of building a new Government House. This decision was considered very strange because the old Government House had no problem, it was located on top of a hill with a lake and with the headquarters of the Nigerian Police opposite it. What was Umahi looking for in Ochudo? The old Government Houses in Enugu, Umuahia and Owerri are still where the colonial authorities located them. The White House in Washingston DC in the United States is still standing where it was located 200 years ago. The problem with Umahi is that he has been running government since 2015 without any known seasoned Administrator by his side.\n\nIn fact he hates such people because he had made up his mind to run a lawless administration where looting can be made easy since there can be no in-built checks and balances. In 2015, before he started building the Shopping Mall, three private sector players came forward and bidded to build the Mall with private sector funding. Umahi waved them aside and preffered to waste Ebonyi public funds to build it and now he is confused about what to do next after making his own money from the building aspect of the job. He is always good in buildings but very poor in administering or managing institutions or businesses. And that is why Ebonyians call him the cement Governor. An Ebonyian told me that Umahi knows what he is doing.\n\nAccording to him, Umahi\u2019s development concentrates on the area where he has comparative advantage, ie. where he is very conversant with. But that is not what governance is all about. Now Umahi has failed to understand that developmet is a multi-sectoral process with diverse sectors such as the Civil service sector, Local Government and Rural Development Sector, Water Resources sector, Health Sector, Education Sector, Agriculture Sector, Commerce and Industry Sector, Human Capital Development Sector, Culture and Tourism Sector etc. Umahi has concentrated on only one sector- Infrastructure sector. This is akin to a child who went for examination and the instruction given to him was to attempt all questions. The boy ignored the instruction and concentrated on one particular question which he knew the answers very well. No matter how well he does on that question, he can never pass the examination. This is why Umahi is jittery because he has exposed himself as unintelligent in governance. No single state hospital is working in Ebonyi state. There is no pipe borne water in Ebonyi but every year #3 billion is appropriated for water supplies. Scholarships have been banned since Umahi came into office and the primary and secondary schools are declining and decaying because of poor funding. Umahi\u2019s government does not pay retirees their gratuities. Civil servants in the state have been placed on half salary since he came into office and their leave allowances and other statutory entitlements have been banned. When they are promoted, it comes without financial benefit. What a wicked and roguish government.\n\nUmahi has stopped due process in award of contracts and all the Departmental Tenders Boards and Procurement Council have either been banned or are manipulated out of context. Umahi\u2019s Commissioners are always under pressure from Umahi to get things done according to his whims and caprices, while the Commissioners themselves are always on the neck of civil servants to keep violating the civil service rules through all kinds of political pressures and administrative brigandage. The Local Government system has been bastardized and despoliated because of the insatiable greed of an authoritarian ruler. Council Chairmen are given mere stipends which cannot enable them to run the councils at the grassroots. Development Centres have gone into reticence and extinction. Local governments in Ebonyi state have been paralysed as the staff are no longer needed by Umahi who has taken over local government functions by himself. And he prides himself as one of the great leaders of our time. One wonders what he has done to make him think so highly of himself. Umahi\u2019s government cannot be compared to that of Dr.Sam Egwu. Under Egwu, Ebonyians witnessed a humane administration, which impacted on the lives of the people positively. Egwu pioneered all the sectors of development simultaneously and never practised family nepotism .\n\nInfact, Egwu\u2019s younger ones were intellectually promising and non of them took up any political appointment during his tenure. They respected themselves and allowed their brother to run his government with dignity and decency. In fact one of Egwu\u2019s younger brothers, Joe Egwu, proceeded to the United States of America for his post-graduate studies immediately his elder brother was sworn-in as Governor. But the way the Umahis manifested their level of hunger and abandoned all they were doing to become state dependants is unheard of. Furthermore, Gov. Umahi is a perfidious albion. He is extremely vainglorious, vindictive, viscious, dilettante, sadistic, meretricious, cantankerous, covetious, unnecessarily restless and over-zealously self-centred. That is why he has antagonised himself with the people and there is no peace in the state. It was Martin Luther King who said that \u201cwhere there is no justice there can be no peace\u2019\u2019. And St. Augustine said that \u201cany regime devoid of justice is nothing but a gang of robbers\u2019\u2019. Gov.Umahi\u2019s divide and rule tactics is at the heart of the insecurity in the state, but he can never know it because he is not a student of conflict and does not know how social systems operate. Immediately there is breakdown of law and order or inter-communal disturbances any where, he will blame others and begin to remove and suspend his appointees or even call on the police to arrest people at random, including elder statesmen, because he sees himself as the Rock of Gibralter who can never be arrested or removed.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t even know that the police are independent. Ebonyians are tired of Umahi\u2019s illiterate governance style but are only consoled that he has less than two years to go. The other day, Gov. Umahi sent words across to the people of Amagu in Abakaliki LGA who had concluded plans to celebrate their \u201cAmagu Day\u2019\u2019. The date was Saturday, 22nd May, 2021. The Community had planned to honour Sen. Sam Egwu, Rt. Hon. Sylvester Ogbaga and other distinguished sons and well-wishers of the community at the grand event. But Umahi the tyrant would have non of that. He sent a top politician from Izzi clan to go and warn the Traditional Institution there to stop any further preparations towards the event. He succeeded in scuttling it. He even threatened to seize their staff of office if they dared go against his directive.\n\nSometime last year, the Governor dethroned the Traditional Ruler of Nkalagu in Ishielu LGA and seized his official car from him. The Royal father was effectively deposed and replaced just because Sen.Obinna Ogba was showing interest in the 2023 governorship race and the Ezeogo was perceivrd to be close to Ogba. And even in the case of Amagu, we hear the target is Ogbaga for the same reason of showing guber interest. Is it not their right as citizens to aspire to any positions of their choice in a democratic system of government? What crime have they committed? Well, the main problem with Umahi is that he is loosing grip of Ebonyi state.\n\nWhen Sen.Ogba buried his father on 27th March, 2021, the ceremony witnessed the gathering of a mammoth crowd, with a galaxy of dignitaries which included serving and retired Governors, Ministers, Senators, House of Reps Members, Diplomats and others, headed by the number three citizen in Nigeria, the Senate President, Dr. Ahmed Lawan. Umahi could not attend the occasion for reasons best known to him. He missed out. Now he is afraid that such a grand gathering again at Amagu would finally send him out of reckoning. So he has devised a new method of stopping the gathering of the winning train in Ebonyi. He will soon get tired.\n\nThe ACECID pamphlet under review has documented that \u201cthe N12.7 billion Paris Club refund, N10 billion Infrastructure refund and $3million BESEDA fund were all in fixed deposit accounts\u2026\u2019\u2019. The report further states that \u201cN10 billion federal bailout fund; N8 billion loan from CBN on behalf of Ebonyi farmers over three years; $3 million BESDA fund; N24 billion from UBEB, N48 billion domestic loans, $65 million foreign loans, all stand unaccounted for\u201d. And Umahi is so secretive about public funds, which was why he appointed one of his cousins as the State Finance Commissioner.\n\nIn 2017, he imposed his brother as National Vice Chairman of the ruling party in the state ; another brother as the State Deputy Chairman of the party and yet another one as the defacto Attorney-General of the state. In 2015, when he became Governor, he quickly imposed his elder brother as the Traditional Ruler of his Community. As Chairman of South-East Governors Forum, he appointed his elder brother, Rtd. General Obi Umahi as the Chairman of South-East Security Advisory Committee. And now Austin Umahi, an unknown quantity has become Gov. Umahi\u2019s dreaded but shameless hatchetman/henchman.\n\nUmahi lacks the mental and psychological stability to run government independently unless his relations surround him. His level of nepotism is unprecedented. To further demonstrate his hawkish posturing, Gov. Umahi appeared on the SUNRISE morning programme of Channels Television station on 22nd April, 2021 where he called on security agents to arrest Nigerians who criticise government in the Social Media. Several human rihts groups lampooned him for the outburst. The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project(SERAP), a Lagos based human rights group called him to order, emphasizing that citizens have a right to criticize government and to hold the rulers accountable.\n\nIn Ebonyi state it has become commonplace for Gov. Umahi to declare his critics \u2018wanted\u2019. Once you criticise him or you do what he does not like, he will start announcements on the sate radio station that you have been declared wanted. Those declared wanted by Umahi in the recent past include Ene Odi and Barr. Silas Joseph Onu(State Publicity Secretary of PDP). In my own case, when I criticised him on 9th June, 2020, he made a special radio broadcast declaring me a COVID-19 patient and ordered that security agents should ensure that I was isolated in my residence for two weeks. The then Director of DSS sheepishly obeyed him and came to my house with armed security people to enforce Umahi\u2019s illegal order.\n\n3. Ebonyi State Poverty Threshold under Gov. Umahi\n\nIn 2020, the National Bureau of Statistics rated Ebonyi state as one of the ten poorest states in Nigeria. The states are: Sokoto, Katsina, Adamawa, Gombe, Jigawa, Plateau, Ebonyi, Bauchi, Kebbi and Zamfara. Ebonyi is actually the 7th poorest in Nigeria and the only state from Southern Nigeria in the list of poorest states. The report further stated that the factors responsible for the poverty were: bad government, unemployment and negligence of development priorities. These are actually the problems with Umahi. Infact a similar report released early this year indicates that Ebonyi state is the 3rd highest state in Nigeria in food inflation. Ebonyi\u2019s food inflation rating is 26.6%. Only Kogi (29.7%) and Sokoto(27%) surpass Ebonyi. Again, out of the three states mentioned, Ebonyi is the only one from Southern Nigeria.\n\nGov. Umahi\u2019s governance rating is terribly disastrous. Even with the lack of teachers in Ebonyi state schools, the last thing to suggest to Umahi is employment of teachers. Umahi preaches that people should go to private sector for employment, but he has destroyed the private sector in the state by seizing the market stalls of hundreds of traders who owned stalls in the old market.\n\nOut of frustration, majority of them, who are mainly non-indigenes are dying or suffering from strokes. Umahi has forgotten that the non-indigenes he is chasing about and maltreating were the same persons whose parents built up Abakaliki and made it stand as the capital of the state. Any time Gov.Umahi is asked a question regarding the terrible state of unemployment in the state, he begins to make disjointed and incoherent but deceptive statements, claiming that Ebonyi state is a huge construction site, how he built a shopping mall, international market and international airport to engage the youths. These are all balderdash(akuko ifo).\n\nHis recent fabrication claiming to have built the International Market is another fraud of the Umahi government. That market was built by Chief Martin Elechi, but Umahi\u2019s excessive greed could not allow him to hand it over to the Abakaliki Local Government who are the rightful owners/operators of the market. Umahi condescended from his Olympian height to personally seize the market, which is an aberration in the annals of governance in Nigeria. It is the responsibility of local governments to control markets but Umahi is all-knowing and can never let go. Even the sophisticated Onitsha Market, the biggest business emporium in West Africa, built by Drs Nnamdi Azikiwe and M.I.Okpara is run by Onitsha South LG. Umahi\u2019s brazen take-over of the constitutional responsibilities of the Local Governments was made possible through the selection(election) of pliable and surrogate characters as Council Chairmen in the state.\n\nGov. Umahi had appropriated all the revenue points in the state to himself in such a way that the Local Government Councils are left as mere spectators. He coerced the LGs to cede all their revenue points to the state government with the state acting as their contractors. So, the state collects the revenues and remits meagre sums to the Councils.\n\nGov. Umahi had promised that the old Abakpa market would be converted to Fruits and Vegetable market. But now he has put up advertisements to sell the land in metres, for N6 million per parcels and the old Building Materials land for N12 million. Now, many people in the state are not comfortable with the arrangement. Their argument is that Umahi has impoverished Ebonyians so terribly, and nobody will have the money to participate in the land acquisition except the Governor, his family members and cronies. That is an indirect way of taking over the land.\n\nWhy is Umahi neglecting the Agricultural sector and the Mineral resources sector in the state? Money sent in by the Central Bank as loans for farmers in 2018/2019 never got to the real farmers in good numbers. He thinks that bringing in Chinese patners to mine some sites for him is all there is to developing the huge mineral deposits in the state. He has no serious template on what to do with the huge mineral deposits in the state. Once he and his family members are alright, then Ebonyians can go to hell\n\nAnd the ACECID report, in reference to Umahi family members, noted that \u201cit is incredible that one family would insist on absolute dependence on the resources of the government of the state to the point that they are not capable of doing anything at all for themselves without dependence on the state funds\u2019\u2019. This is so because Umahi who preaches private sector to Ebonyi people recalled his blood brothers living in other parts of Nigeria to come back to Abakaliki in 2015 when he was elected Governor to come and chop. Gov. Umahi\u2019s neglect of the Education Sector has affected the youths of Ebonyi state.\n\nRight now, large numbers of Ebonyi youths have gone back to street trading. Several of them live in abject poverty in Asaba, Delta state, Benin in Edo state, Ilaje Costain area of Olodi, Apapa, Ejigbo, Moroko, Iyana Ipaja and other super slums in Lagos state, where more than 15 persons sleep in one room. Information from neighbouring West African countries like Togo and Benin Republic indicate that Ebonyi youths are the main street traders in those places, no thanks to Umahi\u2019s draconian policies which drove them out of schools.\n\nI am personally ashamed of Gov.Umahi\u2019s backward performance in office, as someone from the same Senatorial district with him. He has really let us down and depicted us as backward people, if the comments by Ebonyians from other parts of the state are anything to go by. The most annoying are his childish tantrums, references to Koboko horse-whips, his constant assault on the basic rights of citizens, which portrays him as a Zebrudaya politician.\n\nThe economy of Ebonyi state has been stifled by Umahi\u2019s individualism and personal aggrandizement. There is tremendous capital flight in the sate because Umahi buys all his building/construction materials(cement, rods etc) directly from the manufacturers in Lagos(Dangote etc) and yet imposes punitive/authoritarian levies and taxies on Abakaliki local traders whom he hardly patronizes. The Governor is the sole contractor of all government jobs, except he decides to sublet some to a few of his cronies. Most of the jobs are executed through direct labour, arranged by him or by companies owned and registered by his brothers at the CAC. Now, he has engaged his sycophants, charlatans and barbarians(who are mostly uneducated) to swoop on anybody who criticizes his evil policies. The Facebook has become their latest platform after the use of Traditional Rulers to ostracize his critics from their communities suffered a woeful failure. The man is certainly the enemy of the people.\n\n4. Gov.Umahi\u2019s Superiority Complex: A Study in Empty Arrogance.\n\nGov.Umahi should be advised to stop his unnecessary grandstanding. His childish culture of kneeling down on, and measuring roads or pointing at different sections of a project is a complete misunderstanding of what governance is all about. He is not a genius in anything. There are better and younger Engineers in the Ministry of Works to perform those duties. He was elected to govern and governance in the state is actually suffering while he keeps running from pillar to post. Afterall, nobody knew him in Nigeria as a wonderful road builder.\n\nIt was Dr. Sam Egwu who gave him the first set of roads he did in 2006/2007 and up till today, Umahi is yet to construct any smooth road in his career as a Civil Engineer. All the roads he builds are always rough and a threat to the tyre\u2019s lifespan. A typical example is the Abakaliki-Enugu Expressway, running from the PDP Secretariate to Onuebonyi River which was awarded to his Construction company, Brass when he was PDP State Chairman under Elechi. The cement roads he introduced will soon become death traps as the edges are yet to be dressed.\n\nWhen Gov. Elechi made Umahi the State Chairman of PDP, he gave him the freehand and latitude to run the party. True to type Umahi began to abuse the powers of that office. He became impudent, arrogant and uncontrollable. While building the state party secretariat, he simultaneously started building his Osborne La Palm Hotel in Abakaliki. Check the building materials used in the two places and observe the similarities and then use your tongue to count your teeth.\n\nToday, the people of Amike Aba axis who live along the Nodo-Ogbaga Road are living in terrible distress. They are the people who sold their lands to Umahi to build his hotel, but they are being punished because of Umahi\u2019s Marchiavellian antics. The Ogbaga road which they use for their transportation and economic activities has been abandoned by Umahi.\n\nUmahi\u2019s claims to being a superior human being played out when he was the State PDP Chair(2007-2011). Umahi querried the then Deputy Governor, Prof. Chigozie Ogbu, accusing him of hosting a meeting of political office holders from Ebonyi South Zone. The man who signed the querry for Umahi at the time was Prince Ugorji Ama Oti, who was the Ebonyi South PDP Vice Chairman. Even though Ogbu did not answer the querry because of Elechi\u2019s intervention, Umahi showed himself very early to be a desperate political gold-digger and one always willing to bite the fingers which fed him. Recall that Ogbu brought Umahi to Abakaliki to execute a contract during the second term of Sam Egwu when Ogbu was Deputy.\n\nBut when he(Umahi) became the Deputy Governor to Elechi in 2011, and handed over the party Chairmanship to Ama-Oti, he started lording it over the Prince and was dictating to him and could never have tolerated being queried by him. So you can see that Umahi lacks any iota of principle in everything he does. When he eventually emerged as Governor in 2015, and Barr. Onyekachi Nwebonyi became the Chairman of the party, Umahi went ahead to surround him with his blood rleations. Austin Umahi was super-imposed as the National Vice Chairman of PDP and Maxwell Umahi as the State Deputy Chairman of the party. The result was that tha party executive was pocketed by the Umahi family, which was the preparatory ground for the excessive monetisation of party primaries in 2014. The PDP in Ebonyi was a dead organization before Umahi defected to APC in November, 2020. Many PDP faithfuls heaved a sigh of relief and it was seen as good riddance to bad rubbish.\n\nIt is equally on record that Umahi as PDP State Chair, querried the former Secretary to the State Government(SSG), Chief F.O.U.Mbam,mni, for allegedly printing a sub-standard invitation card for the 2008 Children\u2019s Day Celebration for the office of the then First Lady, Mrs. Josephine Elechi. Umahi compelled Anaegbu Echara to appear before the State Working Committee(SWC) of the party, where he was drilled, harassed, intimidated and subjected to dehumanizing questioning. Umahi was inspired by his spirit of sycophancy, so as to be in the good books of the first family.\n\nAs the state party Chair, Umahi operated simultaneously as a contractor-businessman, which he still does today even as a sitting Governor. While dualizing the Spearer-in-Deo- Onuebonyi section of the Enugu-Abakaliki Expressway, he saw a car parked in the line of his work. Umahi ordered his workers to bury the vehicle. It has been stated by several Ebonyians who know the Umahis that Gov. Umahi is wicked but the most wicked amongst them is Austin Umahi.\n\n5. Gov.Umahi\u2019s Assault on the Education Sector.\n\nBefore Gov. Umahi came into office in 2015, Ebonyi state University was rated as one the best state universities in Nigeria. But immediately Gov.Umahi took over as Governor, he became restless and started disturbing the peace of the university. He even went to the extent of addressing the University academic staff, a practice that is unheard of in the university system. He reduced the monthly subvention of the university from #350m to N117m.\n\nAn insider in the university who wrote under the pen-name, Mazi Eziokwu bu Ndu on 24th October, 2020 commented that: \u201cthe relationship between Gov.Umahi and EBSU has been unholy and un-Godly, filled with nightmares and regrets. Gov. Umahi reduced Professors to TAs and STAs and changed them from university professors to \u201cDivine Mandate\u2019\u2019 pastors. The ranking of the university nose-dived terribly and the dreams of Sen. Sam Egwu and other patriotic Ebonyi leaders had been shattered by a shylock leader.\u201d\n\nOther atrocities committed by Umahi\u2019s government in EBSU include the demotion and suspension of lecturers for unjustifiable reasons and the reduction of their salaries by 50%. Then the #3billion TETFUND sent to the university for staff training and provision of infrastructure in the university was diverted to commence the building of the College of Medicine in Uburu. EBSU is still suffering from denial of staff promotions; refusal to increase academic staff capacity despite losses of several academic staff to federal universities and refusal to improve the university infrastructure despite increases in tuition fees by 100%. Meanwhile, the university is owing the university staff up to four months arrears of salaries. Then the Governor was said to have demanded that the academic staff of the university should forfeit 20% of their salaries or lose their salaries for the remaining period of this administration. Hiding under the subterfuge of a verification exercise, Umahi is now owing secondary school teachers about three months of salaries, thereby contributing to the poverty of the teachers, as their motivation to teach is drastically affected.\n\nUmahi\u2019s attack against the intelligentsia and the educational system is calculated to suit his parochial weltanschaung. Umahi has a very narrow window through which he views the world. His world outlook is phobic and he has phobia for investment in education and human resources. So, because of his fear of the intelligentsia, he thinks that the best thing to always do is to extinguish them.\n\nWhen the Academic Staff Union of Universities(ASUU ) gave indication of a strike action to press home its demands for improved working condition of its members, Gov.Umahi issued a statement proscribing ASUU, NASU and other unions in EBSU on 22nd October, 2020. He explained that \u201cthe decision was taken in order to ensure that academic and non-academic union activities do not negatively affect the resumption of EBSU and the commencement of academic and non-academic activities in the state-owned university.\u201d\n\nOn 25th October, 2020, ASUU National President, Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi described the proscription of ASUU by Umahi as an aberration, meaning that Umahi\u2019s action was eccentric, unusual and queer. He stated that it was \u201ca confirmation that some politicians have not outgrown the military hangover more than 20 years into civil governance\u2019\u2019. Then he concluded by saying that \u201cthe tragedy of our democracy is that most of those occupying elective positions today have doubtful democratic credentials. These members of the ruling class see the rest of us their subjects instead of free citizens and their principals. Nigeria\u2019s democracy will not take roots until we all rise to challenge this undemocratic disposition\u2019\u2019.\n\nThen on 5th April, 2021, Gov. Umahi announced that he was going to build three new state universities. First of all, he explained that the College of Medicine in Uburu would be converted to King David Umahi University of Medical Sciences, with a view to ending medical tourism in Nigeria. However, the claim about ending medical tourism in Nigeria is an empty claim. Umahi can only build but can never run any place. For instance, he can never pay the Doctors, Nurses and other Health professionals their jumbo salaries. He will become envious of the fat salaries and start talking of salary reduction and that will be the end of the story. And that is why after six years in office he cannot operationalize the General hospitals he renovated in the 13 LGAs in the state.\n\nBut tongues are wagging already that Gov. Umahi may have concluded plans to kake over the university as his personal asset. One may not be surprised if he went in that direction, otherwise why name the university after himself. And we hear he is making frantic efforts to let the institution commence classes in October, this year.\n\nThe other two universities he is planning to build are the University of Technology in Izzi and the Aeroneutical University, to be located at the International Cargo Airport under construction, in Ezzaland. Umahi is making a mockery of himself and can go ahead and build anything his imagination opens up to him. He is looking for a flimsy excuse to continue his cement construction, but never to use the constructed projects to help humanity. He constructs and collects his money, full stop.\n\nHow many state universities do they have in some of the more serious states in Nigeria, namely Lagos, Rivers, Kano, Akwa Ibom, Enugu, Anambra etc? They have only one state university each. Then one of the poorest states in Nigeria wants to have four state universities even when it cannot pay salaries to lecturers in the existing one at hand now. We hope Umahi is not getting mental. He should be examined thoroughly. He is no longer making sense in his actions and conversations.\n\n6. Gov. Umahi\u2019s Omnibus Exco and the payment of Severance Allowance.\n\nI was already concluding this piece when a report came in that Emperor Umahi had dissolved his cabinet. Though I didn\u2019t see it as a serious and significant event, I paused to take a critical look at the Governor\u2019s over-bloated Executive Council, which I consider as one of the main features of his highly incompetent and corrupt government. Umahi\u2019s Executive Council is an assemblage of all kinds of people: Commissioners, Senior Special Assistants(SSAs) and Special Advisers(SAs). He himself put the total number of the membership at 106.\n\nHe claimed to have dissolved 83 while 23 others were not affected. Umahi has about 27 Commissioners. He likes to celebrate mediocrity and his appointments into the council dramatizes such tendency. I believe that he created the omnibus council in order to undermine the strength and capacity of the statutory members of the council, namely the Commissioners. These are the ones manning the statutory ministries and not the concucted/mushroom ministries created by Umahi to suit his manipulations.\n\nHe brings in the mediocre elements into his oversized Council to make the meetings unnecessarily rowdy and noisy, thereby not creating room for rigorous debates and proper voting as is required when consensus is not arrived at. He prefers to populate the council;l with his chorus singers and most times decisions are imposed on the council using such slogans as: No be so, Na so. Umahi\u2019s council dissolution is a non-issue. He may call on them to reapply the way he did before. He would subject them to all kinds of humiliating drills, so that by the time he recalls them they would have been sychologically down-sized. He lacks the strength of character to carry out a far-reaching overhall of the cabinet. Afterall, most of those he appointed in 2015 are still in his government.\n\nHe likes to work with people with internal problems who would not look him in the face and tell him the blunt truth. Umahi tends to empower mediocres so as to get unalloyed loyalty from them. He is always fearful of intellectuals quite unlike former Governors Egwu and Elechi. Those Exco members who argued and disagreed with them openly based on policy principles were highly respected and admired by them. Egwu had only 13 Commissioners of Cabinet rank and one Commissioner without Portfolio(ie. a non-Ministerial Commissioner in the Governors office in-charge of Special Duties), bringing his entire Exco to 19(including himself, his Deputy, SSG, HOS and Principal Secretary).\n\nElechi had about 26 Exco members, because he permitted his SAs to attend Exco meetings.\n\nNow, Gov.Umahi has generated a new controversy in the payment of severance to Executive Council members, especially those who served under former Governor, Chief Martin Elechi. True to his character as someone who can never be useful to anysbody in life, Umahi has come up with some unthinkable and impossible conditionalities. First and foremost, we learnt he started paying those who served under Elechi\u2019s second tenure. And he introduced a discriminatory dimension to it. Only those who served for the whole four years from 2011-2015 will be paid. All those who were in office for less than four years cannot qualify according to Umahi. So, many of those who served under Elechi\u2019s second term have been technically disqualified from getting their severance allowance. This Umahi style is a horrible invention and unknown to the rules and practice of the public service. Even the idea of segmenting it and procrastinating the payment of those who served in Elechi\u2019s first term administration is absurd and sad.\n\nThe payment of the Severance Allowance should not be on the basis of discrimination. All those who served in that government should be paid no matter the length of their services. Serving a government at that level is not an easy assignment. What matters is the scope and intensity of the engagements and the sacrifices made and not a question of the length of service.\n\nAfterall the same Umahi who is here talking about the length of service is still holding on to the gratuities of those civil servants who worked for 35 years and retired whereas he collected 400 million just after his first four years in service. So, why the rabble-rousing? Umahi\u2019s approach is childish and illogical. It is akin to a situation whereby a team goes for the world cup with 23 players and when it comes to payment of the bonus, the Coach insists that only the eleven players who played full time of ninety minutes would be entitled to the bonus. Umahi should change his ways and stop being a torn in the flesh of other human beings. His name currently evokes anger, sadness, resentment, hatred and ignominy. It is a shame.\n\nAbia Onyike,\n\nFormer Commissioner for Information, Ebonyi state.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Vaccination Plans May Hit A Snag, Federal Govt Warns",
          "text": "The federal government has raised the alarm that Nigeria\u2019s vaccination programme against COVID-19 pandemic may hit a halt.\n\nMinister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, gave the hint on Thursday while speaking during the weekly ministerial press briefing, organised by the Presidential Communications Team in the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, virtually all the initial plans to vaccinate Nigerians were threatened by non-availability of products from expected sources.\n\nHe, however, explained that expected supplies may not come soon.\n\nEhanire disclosed that the previously planned timelines in the delivery of vaccines for the remaining part of the vaccination programme had changed as many of the producer countries, like India, are currently facing their own pandemic crisis and had suspended supplies outside their shores.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe access to vaccine has been very limited because there are countries that give us the vaccines, but who, at the moment, have only promised to deliver many months from now, they want to take care of their own needs first, their own citizens and their immediate environment.\n\n\u201cThe over 4 million doses we have received so far have all come from India and as you all know, India is facing serious challenges right now with COVID infection, massive COVID infection, which is necessitating their turning their vaccine production to themselves and to their neighbourhood and they have told us that they can\u2019t supply us yet until a bit later in the year.\n\n\u201cWell, let me tell you that there are several countries facing that problem, in that if you do not manufacture, you\u2019re not producing and those who produce don\u2019t give you, and even if you have paid, they will tell you to wait, we\u2019ll give you later, we don\u2019t have vaccine. Essentially, you are in a situation where you\u2019ll have to start looking for other answers.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe, however, explained that the federal government was not folding its arms and resigning to fate, but had been working on exploring other avenues of getting vaccines for Nigerians, itemizing a number of measure being taken until normal supplies are restored.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing now is approaching countries, which is called bilateral. Bilateral is that you approach certain countries that have surplus, or that have declared they have surplus and say, will you share with us. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re about to start doing.\n\n\u201cSome countries have announced publicly that they will share some of their vaccines. Right now, they are doing donations to make money available for COVAX, which is very good, but the problem is that all that money will not immediately translate into vaccines because you won\u2019t get it until months later.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re looking for those who want to share. There\u2019s one country that announced that they won\u2019t use AstraZeneca anymore, so we are going to contact that country and say if you\u2019re not going to use it, send it to us, we are using it and it\u2019s working well for us. That\u2019s one example.\n\n\u201cAnother example, I think, is the UK and France who said that they want to donate a certain percentage of their surplus vaccines, maybe they can also share with us. Those are things we want to do.\n\n\u201cWe have already mentioned it to some of those countries that we are ready, we want to write to them and say, share your vaccines directly with us. Some want to give it to COVAX, who will share to everybody. So those are the measures we\u2019re trying to take to bridge the gap, until regular supply begins.\u201d\n\nAsked to comment on the concern that the AstraZeneca product might be ineffective against the strain of the virus, which had been causing much death in India, he said there would be no need for panic on that.\n\nAnswering with an assumption, he opined that India, which is the main supplier of AstraZeneca, withheld supply because it decided to use its product to address the crisis at home, adding that if the product was ineffective against the strain, India would have rather shipped it out in rejection.\n\n\u201cThe AstraZeneca we got came from India and in their own outbreak, which they are having now, they are having a serious outbreak, they\u2019ve told us they will not supply us vaccine anymore, they will use it for their own citizens. It\u2019s that same vaccine, which means it must be effective against Indian variant, which you\u2019re asking about, otherwise they themselves will not withhold it for themselves. So it\u2019s effective.\n\n\u201cThe only variant where there\u2019s a question about the effectiveness of AstraZeneca is the so-called South African variant, for which countries are now using another vaccine, Johnson & Johnson, which we ourselves are also expecting here, perhaps in August happily.\n\n\u201cSo yes, that vaccine is effective against the India variant, otherwise they themselves will not use it anymore, they will be giving it away\u201d, he said.\n\nThe minister also said the federal government wants to get the actual price of COVID vaccine before submitting a supplementary budget to the national assembly.\n\nAccording to him, the actual price for the COVID-19 vaccine is still in rough stages.\n\nThere are different prices of the vaccines, and we don\u2019t really know exactly the one we\u2019re getting. And we also know that the ones we\u2019re getting from COVAX are at no cost to us.\n\nSo what we\u2019re doing is that the additional ones that we\u2019re going to get will take care of 50 million Nigerians, COVAX will take care of 20 million, they are even offering to take care of more than that, maybe up to 30 million,\u201d Ehanire said.\n\n\u201cThe prices vary. Some vaccines are in the neighbourhood of $20 or $30, and others are $5 or $6. So to really make a budget, we are working on rough sketch, some money have been earmarked. But Mr. President has also announced that there will be a supplementary budget. But we want to get a clearer picture first before you actually submit a budget.\n\n\u201cSo, we only have rough figures, and as soon as those figures are there, we can continue. We are also looking for perhaps, as I said, if we have to make the payments, we can find some money to do that. But when that budget time comes, we need some precise information.\u201d",

          "text": "The federal government has raised the alarm that Nigeria\u2019s vaccination programme against COVID-19 pandemic may hit a halt.\n\nMinister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, gave the hint on Thursday while speaking during the weekly ministerial press briefing, organised by the Presidential Communications Team in the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, virtually all the initial plans to vaccinate Nigerians were threatened by non-availability of products from expected sources.\n\nHe, however, explained that expected supplies may not come soon.\n\nEhanire disclosed that the previously planned timelines in the delivery of vaccines for the remaining part of the vaccination programme had changed as many of the producer countries, like India, are currently facing their own pandemic crisis and had suspended supplies outside their shores.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe access to vaccine has been very limited because there are countries that give us the vaccines, but who, at the moment, have only promised to deliver many months from now, they want to take care of their own needs first, their own citizens and their immediate environment.\n\n\u201cThe over 4 million doses we have received so far have all come from India and as you all know, India is facing serious challenges right now with COVID infection, massive COVID infection, which is necessitating their turning their vaccine production to themselves and to their neighbourhood and they have told us that they can\u2019t supply us yet until a bit later in the year.\n\n\u201cWell, let me tell you that there are several countries facing that problem, in that if you do not manufacture, you\u2019re not producing and those who produce don\u2019t give you, and even if you have paid, they will tell you to wait, we\u2019ll give you later, we don\u2019t have vaccine. Essentially, you are in a situation where you\u2019ll have to start looking for other answers.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe, however, explained that the federal government was not folding its arms and resigning to fate, but had been working on exploring other avenues of getting vaccines for Nigerians, itemizing a number of measure being taken until normal supplies are restored.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing now is approaching countries, which is called bilateral. Bilateral is that you approach certain countries that have surplus, or that have declared they have surplus and say, will you share with us. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re about to start doing.\n\n\u201cSome countries have announced publicly that they will share some of their vaccines. Right now, they are doing donations to make money available for COVAX, which is very good, but the problem is that all that money will not immediately translate into vaccines because you won\u2019t get it until months later.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re looking for those who want to share. There\u2019s one country that announced that they won\u2019t use AstraZeneca anymore, so we are going to contact that country and say if you\u2019re not going to use it, send it to us, we are using it and it\u2019s working well for us. That\u2019s one example.\n\n\u201cAnother example, I think, is the UK and France who said that they want to donate a certain percentage of their surplus vaccines, maybe they can also share with us. Those are things we want to do.\n\n\u201cWe have already mentioned it to some of those countries that we are ready, we want to write to them and say, share your vaccines directly with us. Some want to give it to COVAX, who will share to everybody. So those are the measures we\u2019re trying to take to bridge the gap, until regular supply begins.\u201d\n\nAsked to comment on the concern that the AstraZeneca product might be ineffective against the strain of the virus, which had been causing much death in India, he said there would be no need for panic on that.\n\nAnswering with an assumption, he opined that India, which is the main supplier of AstraZeneca, withheld supply because it decided to use its product to address the crisis at home, adding that if the product was ineffective against the strain, India would have rather shipped it out in rejection.\n\n\u201cThe AstraZeneca we got came from India and in their own outbreak, which they are having now, they are having a serious outbreak, they\u2019ve told us they will not supply us vaccine anymore, they will use it for their own citizens. It\u2019s that same vaccine, which means it must be effective against Indian variant, which you\u2019re asking about, otherwise they themselves will not withhold it for themselves. So it\u2019s effective.\n\n\u201cThe only variant where there\u2019s a question about the effectiveness of AstraZeneca is the so-called South African variant, for which countries are now using another vaccine, Johnson & Johnson, which we ourselves are also expecting here, perhaps in August happily.\n\n\u201cSo yes, that vaccine is effective against the India variant, otherwise they themselves will not use it anymore, they will be giving it away\u201d, he said.\n\nThe minister also said the federal government wants to get the actual price of COVID vaccine before submitting a supplementary budget to the national assembly.\n\nAccording to him, the actual price for the COVID-19 vaccine is still in rough stages.\n\nThere are different prices of the vaccines, and we don\u2019t really know exactly the one we\u2019re getting. And we also know that the ones we\u2019re getting from COVAX are at no cost to us.\n\nSo what we\u2019re doing is that the additional ones that we\u2019re going to get will take care of 50 million Nigerians, COVAX will take care of 20 million, they are even offering to take care of more than that, maybe up to 30 million,\u201d Ehanire said.\n\n\u201cThe prices vary. Some vaccines are in the neighbourhood of $20 or $30, and others are $5 or $6. So to really make a budget, we are working on rough sketch, some money have been earmarked. But Mr. President has also announced that there will be a supplementary budget. But we want to get a clearer picture first before you actually submit a budget.\n\n\u201cSo, we only have rough figures, and as soon as those figures are there, we can continue. We are also looking for perhaps, as I said, if we have to make the payments, we can find some money to do that. But when that budget time comes, we need some precise information.\u201d",

          "text": "*His Royal Majesty, King Alfred Diete-Spiff, Amayanabo of Twon Brass, speaks\n\nBy Gabriel Omonhinmin\n\nThe Amayanabo of Twon Brass in Bayelsa State, King Alfred Diete-Spiff, erstwhile Military Administrator of old Rivers State, during the regime of former Head of State General Yakubu Gowon, has cried out, saying \u201csome politicians alongside sub-contractors to the Nigeria Agip Oil Company (NAOC)\u201d instigated thugs that attacked his palace and vandalized his properties for no justifiable reasons.\n\nKing Diete-Spiff told Palace Watch: \u201cSince this ugly incident, my phones have been rigging ceaselessly overflowing with calls from across the globe, especially from concerned relatives, friends, associates and some of my children, who are mostly based in the United States of America.\n\n\u201cHonestly as we speak, I\u2019m yet to make sense out of the reasons or rationale, why some politicians should make me their target, and deliberately tell lies and instigated thugs to do what they did to me as their king in a kingdom and state I have served with all my life. I have no hard feelings over this particular incident as I have decided to leave everything to God.\n\n\u201cContrary to all the reports that a military man shot and killed one of the protesters during the vandalization of my palace, those reports are not correct, they are not the true reflections of what happened on that day in that particular place. As far as I know, nobody was killed during the attack.\n\n\u201cThe Military personnel that were around the place during the incident exercised lot of professionalism and restraints, which must be commended.\n\nWhile the Nigerian Police watched helplessly while the vandalisation took place refusing to do anything.\n\n\u201cSince the unfortunate protest tagged \u2018#End SARS\u2019 which took place in Nigeria earlier in the year.\n\nSome of the Nigerian police personnel seem to have lost interest in the performance of their duties, and this has in no small measure cowed the Nigerian police personnel.\n\nSome of them unfortunately, no longer have the confidence to carry out their day to day assignments of protecting lives and properties.\u201d\n\nThe monarch stressed that if something urgent was not done to address this ugly development, things will seriously go wrong in Nigeria.\n\nAs a matter of urgency, the Nigerian Police high command must do something to engender confidence in its personnel, he stated, noting that if things remain the way they are now or allowed to degenerate further, the entire country and society will no longer be safe and protected.\n\nThe traditional ruler, however, expressed thanks to God Almighty for keeping him and some members of his family, who were around during the incident safe alongside his domestic and palace staff.\n\nKing Diete-Spiff took time to explain to Palace Watch what led to the ugly incident in Twon Brass on Sunday 16th up to Tuesday 18th of May, 2021.\n\nHe said: \u201cdue to the general downturn in the nation\u2019s economy nay the world, during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC) could no longer meet up with some of its obligations to the communities in and around Twon Brass.\n\nIn the process, there were generally black-out or power outage in the whole areas. Most of the sub-contractors to Agip were not paid for the jobs done for some time, because Agip Oil Company was allegedly not paid its counterpart funding by the Nigerian government during the period in question.\n\nMost of the sub-contractors, who were supposed to show understanding during these very difficult period refused to see things with Agip Oil Company, in the process spreading false rumors and information. Meetings were held to douse the tension that was building up.\n\nSurprisingly, some politicians, who seem to be aggrieved for whatever reasons, which does not concern the palace, decided to capitalize on the situation and began to instigate the thugs and some employees of the sub-contractors who have not been paid for some months to take their aggression to the streets for no justifiable reasons in the process the palace was attacked and properties were destroyed.\n\nAll attempts to tell the protesters that there is very little or nothing the palace could do under that circumstances order than mediatory role that is ever ready to play, fell on deaf ears.\u201d\n\nThe Amayanabo further maintained that the power they hitherto complained about has since been restored in Twon Brass and environs, while several meetings are being held with all concerns, hence, the peace, that is gradually returning to the kingdom.\n\nHe said, as a traditional ruler, he has no option than to forgive all the people involved in the incident.\n\nHe added: \u201cin spite of this painful and ugly experience, I am more than ever before determined to forge a better bond with all members and sections of my kingdom.\n\nThis is the price traditional rulers have to pay as the most visible personalities in their various immediate communities.\n\n\u201cThe way and manner things are now in Nigeria, all efforts should be made to strengthen the third tier of government which is the local government councils across the country, for them to deliver services more effectively and efficiently.\n\nA situation where aggrieved or frustrated youths take their aggression to the traditional rulers of their communities, is dangerous and portends a lot of danger for the country as a whole.\n\nA lot more should be done as from now by the government at all levels to empower traditional rulers in particular, so that they will be in a position to intervene in some matters especially in situations like this.\n\nThe only way traditional rulers can play this role effectively, is for the traditional institutions to be empowered. The traditional rulers need a lot of money in the process.\u201d\n\nPalace Watch gathered that indigenes of the host community of Nigeria Agip Oil Company were protesting against what they called the protracted power outage in their communities, and the refusal to pay indigenous contractors for the job done for Agip and the failure of the company to meet its corporate social responsibility (CRS) to the people.\n\nThe Amayanabo said that he was, however consoled by the prompt condemnations of the incident by a cross section of Ijaw leaders and groups.\n\nFor example, the Twon Brass Chapter of the Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) condemned the attack saying it would not condone any disrespect to their monarch either from indigenes or foreigners.\n\nThe chairman of the group Mr. Hello Richard and other representatives of the Ijaw clan in a statement, said that their attention was drawn to the ugly incident, which was said to have been provoked by a military personnel, who allegedly shot a protester during what they tagged peaceful demonstrations by the people of Twon Brass Kingdom in Brass Local Government Area Council against Agip Oil Company.\n\nThey continued: \u201cFrom our findings, the protest, triggered into chaos after some persons hijacked it and started to foment trouble in the process, which eventually led to the attack on the Amayanabo\u2019s palace.\n\n\u201cWe further learnt that while trying to protect the monarch, a soldier allegedly shot one of the protesters in the leg and this particular incident, as to be expected, generated more tension in the community.\n\nThis shooting only took place when some persons hijacked the protest and destroyed part of the King\u2019s Palace.\u201d",

          "text": "On February 18, 1977, approximately 1,000 soldiers stormed a compound in Lagos. It belonged to the famed Afrobeat musician and critic of Nigeria\u2019s military government, Fela Kuti.\n\nDuring the raid, Kuti\u2019s 76-year-old mother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, was thrown from a second-storey window. She sustained injuries from which she never recovered and died at the General Hospital in Lagos on April 13, 1978.\n\nAt least two Nigerian news outlets reported her death with the headline: \u201cFela\u2019s Mum is Dead.\u201d\n\nBut Ransome-Kuti was not just \u201cFela\u2019s mum\u201d. The anti-colonial activist and feminist was, in many ways, the mother of the nation.\n\n\u2018No taxation without representation\u2019\n\nVenerable Victor Sotunde, now 88 and a retired priest from the Anglican Communion of Abeokuta in western Nigeria, remembers Ransome-Kuti from his days as a young boarding student at Abeokuta Grammar School. Her husband, Reverand Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, was the school\u2019s principal and the couple lived on the premises with their children.\n\n\u201cDuring morning devotion at school assembly, we saw her come downstairs with her towel always over her left shoulder, walk past us to go to the bathroom,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe could tell her husband, our principal, didn\u2019t like it because it was also during his inspection of students.\n\n\u201cShe was well-known to us youngsters, as the leader of the Abeokuta Women\u2019s Union (AWU),\u201d Sotunde explained. \u201cDue to her activism, she was given the traditional title of \u201cBeere\u201d, which is usually bestowed on female leaders, and translates as \u2018first of equals\u2019.\u201d\n\nUnder British colonial indirect rule, Nigeria had been divided into 24 provinces. For administrative reasons, each province comprised divisions and districts. Abeokuta province in southern Nigeria had two divisions \u2013 Egba and Egbado, which were divided into smaller districts. Each division and district was administered by a Sole Native Authority (SNA). Abeokuta town, where Ransome-Kuti was from, was the administrative headquarters for Egba division.\n\nAs the leader of the AWU, in the years before Nigeria declared independence from Britain in 1960, Ransome-Kuti often spoke to British district officials to explain her organisation\u2019s position \u2013 best captured by their slogan \u201cno to taxation without representation\u201d. At the meetings, she would speak in the Yoruba language, leaving officials scrambling for an interpreter.\n\nRansome-Kuti railed against what she said were unfair taxes levied on small traders \u2013 many of whom were women, who she led in colourful campaigns. After one victory over water rates in 1959, the Daily Times of Nigeria reported that thousands of supporters of the Federation of Nigerian Women\u2019s Union (NWU) \u2013 which had formed out of the AWU \u2013 danced around Abeokuta town.\n\nThe celebration had been triggered by the deferment of a proposed scheme in which women in Egba division would be asked to pay two shillings for water, while those in the districts paid one. This was too much for most women, who were either petty traders or unemployed.\n\nIt was Ransome-Kuti\u2019s latest victory in what was widely regarded as a war to end the unfair taxes imposed by the colonial government and implemented through the SNA. The SNA was headed by the traditional ruler of Abeokuta, Oba (Sir) Ladapo Ademola II.\n\nResistance\n\nThe women\u2019s revolt against taxation had been rumbling for more than a decade before the water rate victory.\n\nIn 1918, tax policies had been introduced that required women as young as 15, (the age at which they were considered marriageable) including those who were unemployed, to pay three shillings a year as income tax. Men, on the other hand, did not have to pay it until they were 18.\n\nIt was said government agents went about raiding homes and stripping girls of their clothes in order to assess their age for the purpose of taxation and, as the work was based on commission, extortion and abuse were rife.\n\nRansome-Kuti formed the AWU in 1946 to \u201cdefend, protect, preserve and promote the social, economic, cultural and political rights and interests of the women in Egbaland\u201d.\n\nHer aims and objectives were outlined in a document in 1947, called The AWU\u2019s Grievances, one of the sub-headings in which was \u201cStripped Naked\u201d. It contained a list of wrong-doings by the traditional ruler for \u201cmisusing his authority\u201d and by the administration for \u201cnot providing medical and educational facilities for women\u201d.\n\nA food price control policy had also been introduced by the colonial government during the second world war which, in addition to the tax, further hurt female petty traders. When they could not pay, their goods or produce were often seized by agents working on behalf of the SNA.\n\nAfter several years of complaints, the women mobilised under the leadership of Ransome-Kuti, and in December 1947, laid siege to the palace of Oba Ademola II, where they chanted war songs day and night, to demand the suspension of the tax.\n\nRansome-Kuti became known around the country for her activism. She had regular speaking engagements on women\u2019s rights both at home and overseas and toured her region, raising awareness about women\u2019s political and voting rights.\n\nHow it all began\n\nBorn on October 25, 1900, Ransome-Kuti attended the co-educational Abeokuta Grammar School, where she was the first female student to enrol.\n\nIn 1919, she went to Britain to study at Wincham Hall Schools for Girls in Cheshire, where she was taught subjects such as French, elocution, music and dress-making. But before she returned to Nigeria in 1922, she demonstrated the first sign of her rejection of British imperialism: Dropping her Christian names of Frances Abigail and adopting her Yoruba name \u2013 Oluwafunmilayo (shortened to Olufunmilayo or Funmilayo), meaning \u201cGod has given me joy\u201d.\n\nIn 1925, she married Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, an educationist and co-founder of the Nigerian Teachers Union. The couple had four children \u2013 Dolupo, Olikoye, Olufela (Fela) and Beko \u2013 and worked as teachers.\n\nIyalode Alaba Lawson, a community elder who became the first female president of the Abeokuta Chambers of Commerce, as well as of the National Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mine and Agriculture (NACCIMA), remembers Ransome-Kuti as a \u201cdisciplinarian\u201d at school. \u201cThe students who were older than us always said \u2018Mrs Kuti\u2019s class is strict\u2019,\u201d she recalled.\n\n\u201cMy father was also a student at the school and we heard them talk about the Ransome-Kutis and their brand of discipline. Though I was very young, I saw her drive a car and, as a woman in Abeokuta in those days, it was an unusual sight for us as young girls. Many of us took her as a role model because she walked with so much authority and was always dressed in our traditional clothes.\u201d\n\n\u2018Lioness of Lisabi\u2019\n\nIt was, however, the 1943 \u201cGreat Weep\u201d and 1948 tax revolt, which earned Ransome-Kuti the title \u201cLioness of Lisabi\u201d (Lisabi being the traditional hero of the Egba people) in the press.\n\nThe \u201cGreat Weep\u201d episode saw women shed tears over the burden of income tax. According to a March 1959 report in South Africa\u2019s Drum magazine: \u201cThousands of Abeokuta women went about shedding tears. The Alake (the title of the traditional ruler, Oba Ladapo Ademola II) and the authorities could do nothing to stop it, and gave way to the women\u2019s demands.\u201d\n\nIn December 1947, Ransome-Kuti\u2019s husband arranged a meeting of men from Abeokuta town, during which they decided to support the demands of their wives and urged the traditional ruler to explore other ways of generating revenue.\n\nThe meeting and the prolonged siege of his palace forced Oba Ademola II to act. He suspended the taxation of women and went into exile in Osogbo, a town more than 200km (124 miles) away.\n\nIn March 1959, Ransome-Kuti told Drum: \u201cSo we gave a hell of a time to the chiefs, the government, to all those who were responsible for the systematic pauperisation of the mass of the people.\u201d\n\n\u2018We had equality till Britain came\u2019\n\nBut there was no doubt as to where Ransome-Kuti laid the blame for the plight of Nigerian women. \u201cWe had equality till Britain came,\u201d she wrote in an article published in the British communist newspaper, The Daily Worker.\n\nIn it, she noted that before the British arrival in Nigeria, life was mainly agricultural and there was a fairer division of labour between men and women: \u201cThe men cultivated the land and it was chiefly the duty of women to reap.\n\nWomen owned property, traded and exercised considerable political and social influence in society.\n\nThey were responsible for crowning the Kings on Coronation days. Whatever disabilities there (existed) were endured by men and women alike. With the advent of British rule, slavery was abolished, and Christianity introduced into may parts of the country, but instead of the women being educated and assisted to live like human beings their condition deteriorated.\u201d\n\nIn pre-colonial societies and kingdoms, women occupied prominent positions in public administration and decision-making. But, with the arrival of male colonial administrators and civil servants, women were sidelined from their previous roles.\n\nIn 1947, Nnamdi Azikiwe of the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC), who would later become Nigeria\u2019s first president, invited Ransome-Kuti to travel to Britain to meet the secretary of state, Sir Arthur Creech Jones. She was the only woman in the seven-person delegation when she triumphantly boarded the Almanzora, which set sail from Lagos on June 26.\n\nThe purpose of their visit was to discuss the limitations of the 1946 Richards Constitution with British colonial officials. Named after Nigeria\u2019s governor-general, Sir Arthur Richards, it was the successor legal framework to the 1922 Clifford Constitution and was meant to ensure a better representation of Nigerians in the administration of the country.\n\nOne of the main objectives of the Constitution was to \u201csecure greater participation by Africans in the discussion of their own affairs\u201d. But it did not extend electoral representation to women and left the regulations on male-only suffrage just as they were in the previous Constitution.\n\nFurthermore, the Executive Council was still populated with British officials with only one Nigerian as an unofficial member. Thus the administration and decision-making in effect remained in the hands of the colonial government. This and other constitutional matters formed the crux of the delegation\u2019s mandate to Britain.\n\nAfter their return, despite some reports of disagreements among the delegation, Ransome-Kuti told the Nigerian Spokesman Newspaper at a reception held for them, the trip \u201cturned out to be money and time well-used, since the people\u2019s side of the case, for once, had been presented. I had an exciting time, sometimes three appointments in a day and before I left spoke with factory workers\u201d.\n\nIn 1949, Ransome-Kuti was nominated by citizens to represent Abeokuta at the provincial level of the General Constitutional Conference, which was scheduled to take place in January 1950. The aim of the conference was to collate the views of all Nigerians as part of a nationwide discussion on a new constitution. Ransome-Kuti was the only woman to deliberate on the proceedings at the provincial level on what ultimately became known as the 1951 MacPherson Constitution.\n\n\u2018She who must be obeyed\u2019\n\nBut not everyone agreed with Ransome-Kuti\u2019s activities and her opponents found willing allies in the male-owned press.\n\nThe Nigerian Tribune newspaper once called the AWU the \u201cTerrorist Women\u2019s Union of Abeokuta\u201d. The same newspaper featured the headlines: Mrs F Kuti Must Be Checked, and That Woman Again.\n\nOne article about the AWU, entitled Women May Seize Power stated: \u201cThere is growing suspicion that the women of Abeokuta mean to seize power and to bring the country absolutely under their own control, a large number of people are opposed to this idea and are urging that early steps be taken to end this move. Abeokuta is going the wrong way. Soon there will be a She-Who-Must-Be-obeyed.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: NECO appoints Ogborodi as new acting registrar\n\nThe content of some of the articles barely concealed the resentment of their male authors. The editorial leader entitled The Women are Ambitious, published in the Nigerian Tribune on February 11, 1950, stated: \u201cIt is gratifying to note that there is deep resentment among the Egba men of this dangerous ambition of their women. They and they alone can stop it; and it is necessary that they stop it, not only because of the loss of prestige in allowing their women to overwhelm them.\u201d\n\nAccording to an article by Nelson Ottah in 1959, which was published in Nigeria: The Birth of Africa\u2019s Greatest Country, other sections of the press showed a more grudging acceptance of women\u2019s activism under the leadership of Ransome-Kuti, describing them as \u201cthe petticoat fighters who had shown they were a force to be reckoned with\u201d.\n\nOba Ademola II, who had returned to his throne in 1950 after 28 months in exile, shared his views on Ransome-Kuti with Drum in 1959: \u201cThere is no satisfying Mrs Ransome-Kuti. Right now, she is up to another devilry. She is opposed to women of Abeokuta paying water rates. I am sure that if she would devote as much time to agitating for progressive measures as she does to everything that is conducive to disorder, she would become the greatest woman in Abeokuta, nay in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOf the tax protests which led to his abdication, he added: \u201cI could not hate Mrs. Ransome-Kuti then and I cannot hate her now, although she continues to cause me a great deal of trouble because, I suppose, I admire her guts. My only regret is that she is using her guts wrongly. With a bit of more level-headedness, there is nothing the little woman couldn\u2019t do for Abeokuta and for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSource: Aljazeera",

          "title": "The Giant of Africa is failing: The article that roiled Buhari\u2019s Aso Rock",
          "text": "By John Campbell and Robert I. Rotberg\n\nNigeria is in big trouble. If a state\u2019s first obligation to those it governs is to provide for their security and maintain a monopoly on the use of violence, then Nigeria has failed, even if some other aspects of the state still function. Criminals, separatists, and Islamist insurgents increasingly threaten the government\u2019s grip on power, as do rampant corruption, economic malaise, and rising poverty.\n\nMost failed states in Africa\u2014such as the Central African Republic, Somalia, and South Sudan\u2014are small or marginal; Nigeria, by contrast, boasts a growing population of 214 million. It is expected to become the world\u2019s third-largest country by population by 2050. And prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it had Africa\u2019s largest economy or its second-largest after South Africa (depending on how one measures). That is why state failure in Nigeria is having profound consequences for the entire region\u2014and beyond. It bodes especially ill for the stability and well-being of weak states in Nigeria\u2019s vicinity, as evidenced by the spread of jihadi and criminal groups to Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ivory Coast, Mali, and Niger.\n\nNigeria\u2019s collapse can be reversed, however. Increasingly, prominent Nigerian opinion-makers are calling for an alternative to the current administration\u2014whether through a national convention to rebuild the state from scratch, the breakup of Nigeria into smaller countries, or a domestic military takeover of the kind Nigeria has experienced repeatedly since independence in 1960. Many other Nigerians decry the government\u2019s inability to keep citizens safe but support its calls for external assistance in the form of economic and military aid.\n\nNigeria\u2019s international partners, especially the United States, must acknowledge that Nigeria is now a failed state. In recognition of that fact, they should deepen their engagement with the country and seek to hold the current administration accountable for its failures while also working with it to provide security and right the economy. In addition, they should engage and support Nigerian civil society as it forges what must ultimately be a Nigerian-led reconstruction effort.\n\nBuhari\u2019s government has proved woefully unprepared for these challenges. It has had trouble sustaining military operations far beyond Abuja, the capital city, and a few other areas where its authority is not directly challenged by criminal gangs, jihadis, or separatists. In shootouts with criminals and Islamists, the police and the security services are often outgunned.\n\nSuccess is by no means guaranteed. But the alternatives, including a descent into widespread warlordism, intensified ethnic and religious strife, and the establishment of jihadi safe havens, are contrary to Africa\u2019s interests and those of the United States. As Nigeria\u2019s security goes, so goes Africa\u2019s.\n\nFAILURE ON ALL FRONTS\n\nNigeria still retains some attributes of a viable state, especially with respect to international affairs. It maintains diplomatic missions around the world, and its national security services still function in some places and at some times, even though their leadership is regarded as corrupt. At home, the country\u2019s legislative body, the National Assembly, still meets, and the judiciary still operates, although without gaining the confidence of many Nigerians.\n\nBut the Nigerian state has long failed to provide its citizens with social services, and Nigerian politics is largely an elite sport disassociated from governance. The government does not or cannot tax the real wealth of the country, remains too dependent on revenue from oil and gas, and lurches from one fiscal crisis to another. Corruption is structural, too, casting nearly everyone as both perpetrator and victim.\n\nUnder the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, multiple overlapping security crises have transformed Nigeria from a weak state into a failed one. Buhari\u2019s government has struggled to quell various jihadi insurgencies, including the one waged by the militant group Boko Haram. The government has also failed to tamp down half a dozen or so other civil conflicts and clashes over land and water that have taken on ethnic or religious dimensions. Separatism is rising again in Yorubaland and in the areas that once made up Biafra, a region that fought a failed war of secession against Nigeria\u2019s government between 1967 and 1970. Kidnapping is rampant throughout the country, as is piracy in the Gulf of Guinea.\n\nBuhari\u2019s government has proved woefully unprepared for these challenges. It has had trouble sustaining military operations far beyond Abuja, the capital city, and a few other areas where its authority is not directly challenged by criminal gangs, jihadis, or separatists. In shootouts with criminals and Islamists, the police and the security services are often outgunned.\n\nRegional quasi-police forces and militias\u2014sometimes connected to state governments but rarely officially sanctioned\u2014exercise de facto authority in some areas. But in many others, the federal government has effectively ceded control to militants and criminals. Law and order have broken down, and schools have had to close in many rural areas. The COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant economic crisis\u2014compounded in Nigeria by the decline in international oil prices\u2014has only accelerated the country\u2019s descent into chaos, plunging millions into poverty and fueling the surge in lawlessness.\n\nA CHORUS OF DISSENT\n\nBuhari\u2019s government has called for international assistance to stem the tide of insecurity. At an April meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Buhari reportedly requested that the headquarters of the U.S. Africa Command be moved from Germany to Nigeria so that it would be closer to the fight against jihadi groups in the country\u2019s north. But while the Nigerian president might like the United States to involve itself more deeply in the campaign against Boko Haram, there is little indication that he is willing to address the deeper issues of governance, corruption, and economic mismanagement that have accelerated Nigeria\u2019s decline.\n\nPublic intellectuals, including the Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, for instance, have called for a sovereign national convention to be convened to rebuild the state from the ground up, replacing Nigeria\u2019s mixed state and federal system with a genuine federal democracy. More recently, the country\u2019s conference of Roman Catholic bishops called on the president to convene a council of notables to recommend new ways to devolve power. Aare Afe Babalola, a wealthy lawyer, is sponsoring \u201ca Summit of Hope,\u201d now backed by the Nigerian Bar Association, to \u201cprevent the country from disintegrating and drifting into anarchy.\u201d And the Ooni of Ife, one of the country\u2019s most senior traditional rulers and the co-chair of the National Tradition Council of Nigeria, has endorsed a similar proposal and is seeking the support of fellow traditional rulers.\n\nA growing number of prominent Nigerians argue that righting the ship of state is beyond the ability of Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nStill other Nigerian activists and intellectuals have seized on the deteriorating security situation to advocate reversing the \u201cmistake of 1914,\u201d when the British combined the homelands of some 350 distinct ethnic groups into a single artificial state.\n\nA growing number of prominent Nigerians argue that righting the ship of state is beyond the ability of Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nStill other Nigerian activists and intellectuals have seized on the deteriorating security situation to advocate reversing the \u201cmistake of 1914,\u201d when the British combined the homelands of some 350 distinct ethnic groups into a single artificial state. They aim to break up Nigeria into multiple independent states, each likely dominated by a specific ethnic group. Although such proposals may sound far-fetched, they are gaining steam, helping breathe new life into separatist movements in the old region of Biafra, in particular.\n\nAnd then there are those, such as the noted Nigerian lawyer and commentator Robert Clarke, who have called for a return to military rule. In the past, the army was viewed by most Nigerians\u2014and by itself\u2014as the ultimate guarantor of the country\u2019s existence. It has intervened seven times over the last 60 years, overthrowing elected and non-elected governments alike whenever the generals have judged the political process to have broken down (or to have threatened their interests). Each time, the military brass have justified their intervention as called for by the people, and crowds of Nigerians have frequently celebrated the arrival of military government and the departure of corrupt politicians. That is the well of memory from which those looking to the military to break the current stalemate are drawing.\n\nBuhari\u2019s administration has unsurprisingly rejected calls for a military intervention out of hand, claiming that politicians, traditional rulers, and religious leaders are trying to foment a coup. However, it is by no means clear that the upper reaches of the military\u2014or even the junior officer corps\u2014has the stomach to assume day-to-day governing responsibilities. For the time being, at least, it seems that Nigerians will have to endure escalating violence without much hope of relief from their national or state governments.\n\nMUDDLING THROUGH?\n\nNigeria is often celebrated for its ability to \u201cmuddle through\u201d emergencies, as it did during the 1967\u201370 civil war, the generation of military rule from 1975 to 1999, and the ups and downs of international oil prices and recurrent fiscal crises. Nigeria may still manage to muddle through the current crisis, but that seems increasingly unlikely given the level of insecurity and the potential for general elections in 2023 to spark still more discord and violence.\n\nNigeria\u2019s international partners can help avert that outcome\u2014and eventually, help reverse the process of state failure. As long as Buhari is in office, the United States should continue to publicly denounce his administration\u2019s human rights abuses and call out political leaders seeking to feather their own nests. It should also cancel the visas of Nigerian officials and business people at the first whiff of criminality or human rights offences.\n\nWashington should meet Nigeria\u2019s requests for military assistance with caution, however. Military and police aid should be contingent on real, measurable reform of those services, including a human rights component. But there is much the United States and other friends of Nigeria can do to help stabilize the country\u2019s economy, which has been buffeted by the fall in international energy prices. They should urge international financial institutions to support Nigeria\u2019s liberalization of its currency exchange rates and to help strengthen the independence of its central bank. Washington might also consider supporting Nigeria\u2019s efforts to fight corruption.\n\nAt the same time, the United States should support the push for a more ambitious Nigerian-led state reconstruction effort\u2014whatever form that might take. Through exchanges, conferences, technical advice, and other tools of \u201csoft diplomacy,\u201d the United States should aid civil society and Nigerian nongovernmental organizations in their efforts to strengthen the country\u2019s democracy. The U.S. Agency for International Development should pay special attention to bolstering Nigeria\u2019s underlying democratic ethos, in particular by supporting enhanced training for young political leaders and civil society activists.\n\nYet time is running out for Nigeria. The country could soon be in even worse shape. There are Islamist insurgents at the gates, along with other serious threats to internal peace and security. Nigerians are resilient, but their best efforts to reverse the collapse of the Nigerian state require immediate support.\n\n*This article was published by Foreign Affairs magazine on 31 May, 2021.",

He died on April 9, aged 99.\n\nIn a statement of condolence then, the Bidens paid tribute to the late Duke of Edinburgh. \u201cHis legacy will live on not only through his family, but in all the charitable endeavours he shaped,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe meeting with the president and first lady will come the day after the Queen\u2019s official birthday, and will follow the three-day summit of Group of Seven leaders in Cornwall, southwest England.\n\nThe G7 gathering starts Biden\u2019s first foreign tour since he took office in January. He will also make stops at a NATO summit in Brussels and in Geneva, for a June 16 summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nWith the exception of Lyndon B. Johnson, the Queen has met every US president during her 69-year reign. Donald Trump staged a controversial state visit to Britain in June 2019.\n\nThe official birthday celebration is normally marked by a military parade called \u201cTrooping the Colour\u201d, featuring hundreds of personnel from Britain\u2019s most prestigious regiments.\n\nBut it has been cancelled for a second year, owing to the pandemic.\n\nAFP",
