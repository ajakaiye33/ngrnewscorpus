          "text": ".\n\nThe Federal High Court in Abuja has stopped the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from ending voter registration on 30 June 2022.\n\nHonourable Justice Mobolaji Olajuwon (Court 10) today granted an order of interim injunction following the hearing of an argument on motion exparte by Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP).\n\nSERAP and 185 concerned Nigerians had early this month filed the lawsuit against INEC asking the court to \u201cdeclare unconstitutional, illegal, and incompatible with international standards the failure of the electoral body to extend the deadline for voter registration to allow eligible Nigerians to exercise their rights.\u201d\n\nIn the suit, SERAP had asked the court for \u201can order restraining INEC, its agents, privies, assigns, or any other person(s) claiming through it from discontinuing the continuous voters\u2019 registration exercise from the 30th June 2022 or any other date pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice.\u201d\n\nThe suit is adjourned to 29th June, 2022 for the hearing of the Motion on Notice for interlocutory injunction.\n\nThe suit followed the decision by INEC to extend the deadline for the conduct of primaries by political parties by six days, from June 3 to June 9. But the commission failed to also extend the online pre-registration which ended May 30 2022 and the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) ending 30 June 2022.\n\nIn the suit number FHC/L/CS/1034/2022 filed at the Federal High Court, Lagos, and transferred to Abuja, SERAP is asking the court to determine \u201cwhether the failure of INEC to extend the deadline for voter registration is not a violation of Nigerian Constitution, 1999 [as amended], the Electoral Act, and international standards.\u201d\n\nSERAP is asking the court for \u201ca declaration that the failure of INEC to extend the deadline for voter registration is a violation of eligible Nigerians\u2019 rights to participate freely in their own government, equality and equal protection.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also asking the court for \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel INEC to extend voter registration by a minimum of three months and take effective measures to ensure that eligible Nigerians are able to register to exercise their right to vote in the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nThe suit, read in part: \u201cEnforcing unrealistic voter registration deadline while extending the deadline for party primaries would deny and abridge the constitutional and international human rights of eligible voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cINEC mandates ought to be exercised in a fair, just and non-discriminatory manner. The extension of voter registration would ensure that Nigerian voters are treated equally and fairly. The future of Nigeria\u2019s democracy depends on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoters are also critical stakeholders in the electoral process. Treating all eligible Nigerian voters fairly would advance the people\u2019s right to vote and to participate in their own government.\u201d\n\n\u201cINEC must not only be independent and impartial in the exercise of its constitutional and statutory responsibilities, but must also be seen to be independent and impartial.\u201d\n\n\u201cExtending the voter registration exercise would also bolster voter confidence in the electoral process.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the people\u2019s most sacred rights is the right to vote. The commission has a constitutional and statutory responsibility to ensure the effective exercise of the right of all eligible voters to participate in their own government.\u201d\n\n\u201cExtending the deadline for party primaries without providing adequate time and opportunity for eligible voters to register and participate in the 2023 general elections would amount to an unfair and discriminatory treatment of Nigerian voters, and violate other human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cExtending the voter registration deadline would provide more time for eligible voters, including young people, the elderly, people living with disability, as well as those resident in states facing security challenges and living in IDP camps to participate in the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cExtending the deadline for voter registration would be entirely consistent with constitutional and international standards, and the Electoral Act. Any such extension would also not impact negatively on INEC\u2019s election calendar and activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe public perception of the independence and impartiality of INEC is essential for building public confidence in the electoral process, and ensuring the credibility and legitimacy of the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere Nigerians have doubts about the independence and impartiality of INEC, they are more likely to have less confidence in the electoral process thereby undermining democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cExtending the deadline for voter registration would also be justified, given reports of challenges in the voter registration exercise, especially for young people, the elderly, persons living with disabilities, and those resident in states facing security challenges and living in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe will of the people is expressed through democratic elections. This requires that people should be afforded adequate time and opportunity to register to vote. Extending the voter registration deadline is crucial for promoting the independence and impartiality of INEC and building public confidence in the electoral process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution 1999 (as amended) provides in Section 14(1)(c) that, \u2018the participation by the people in their government shall be ensured in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 9(6) of the Electoral Act 2022 provides that \u2018the registration of voters, updating and revision of the Register of Voters under this section shall not stop not later than 90 days before any election covered by this Act.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, and the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance guarantee the right to political participation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese human rights treaties also require states parties including Nigeria to ensure the independence and impartiality of national electoral bodies responsible for the management of elections, as well as to promote the establishment of the necessary conditions to foster citizen participation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe right of people to participate in their government is a fundamental feature of any democratic society, and any undue restriction of the right would strike at the heart of representative government.\u201d",

Most of the people who do entertaining business in the circular world are also Christians but they don\u2019t pass the message of Christ; they just pass may be illicit, drugs, sex or whatever.\n\n\u201cIn the gospel, we have the message if Christians will come together and get it right which we are trying to do you will find out that even in our sphere of Christianity there is a lot of revenue that can come in from it because (a) we have people who have talent out there and better than people who are into circular music and if the people into circular music are doing it right and bringing revenue for the economy and I believe Christian music can also do that. \u201c\n\nHe explained that the audition would enable them to select talented gospel singers who shall minister the gospel through songs in an unprecedented manner never before seen or experienced in the world.\n\nIhenayi said the audition is the forerunner to bigger events that would be the first of its kind globally.\n\nHe said the project is 5th Dimension Entertainment\u2019s way of contributing to making the world saner through gospel music.\n\nSpeaking, one of the Juries at the audition who is also a gospel musician, Mr Mike Abdul, explained that the audition was a platform to give a voice and place to upcoming artists in Nigeria,\n\nStating that the platform will also serve as a platform to mentor young artists, he urged young artists to grow beyond talents and use their music as a weapon to create positive values in the country.\n\nAbdul advised young Nigerian artists to infuse knowledge with their talents and not be discouraged.\n\n\u201cWe need to step into their culture, influence and make them know they can do better. If we don\u2019t do that, we would be creating chaos,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further commended the organisers and called for more such programmes.\n\nHe appealed to well-meaning Nigerians to help in sponsoring such initiatives, particularly programmes that support investments in the youths.\n\nOn his part, another jury who is also an actor, Mr. Iyke Michael recalled that the movie industry had infused various cultures and harnessed them to promote the country.\n\nHe said the choice of gospel music was to celebrate God\u2019s goodness, noting that a large percentage of music, including secular ones, has an undertone of glorifying God.\n\nSpeaking on the financial benefits of entertainment, he said apart from providing gainful employment for the youths, there are a lot of financial gains it brings to the country,\n\n\u201cA percentage of the youths have been gainfully employed. We are coming up with stories to promote our culture and this culture has moved and that is the dream we have for Christian gospel music. One major problem in Nigeria is how to be able to harness the many cultures that we have.\u201d\n\nOn his part, another Music Director, Julius Charles described the programme as amazing as it is a platform to nurture young Christian Gospel musicians.",

          "text": "Nigerians are now paying more for petrol despite the official price still fixed at N162.50 and N165 per litre.\n\nIndependent marketers, who started implementing a new price regime of between N170 to N190 at the weekend, insisted yesterday that it would be difficult for them to sell at the official pump price.\n\nBesides, scarcity of the product resurfaced in Lagos, Akure, Ado-Ekiti, Abeokuta, Jos, among other towns in the Southwest.\n\nThe situation in Abuja worsened at the weekend with long queues at the filling stations where petrol is sold.\n\nIn Lagos yesterday, many independent stations were shut, the few that were dispensing recorded long queues.\n\nIt also caused gridlocks on Ikorodu Road, Ikoyi, Ikeja, and Airport Road, among other places.\n\nIndependent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) in a statement by its Lagos State Depot (LSD) Secretary, Akeem Balogun, said: \u201cWith the current price, there is no way we can sell less than N180 per litre.\n\n\u201cMembers are hereby advised to sell at a sustainable price within their environment. Just make sure that the price is on your pump.\n\n\u201cKindly contact the Secretariat should you have any authority challenging your operations.\u201d\n\nThe chaos in the stations that dispensed fuel with a fewer number of pumps was worsened by jerry can-carrying residents in search of the product to power their generators.\n\nIn Lagos, the queues were most noticeable at filling stations owned by major marketers in traffic-prone areas like Oshodi, Ejigbo, Ikeja, Egbeda, Ikotun Igando, Iyanaiba and Satellite.\n\nNearly all stations operated by independent dealers in the commercial city did not open to motorists.\n\nMotorists in Osun, Kwara, Rivers, Delta, Edo, Kano, Katsina, Akwa Ibom, Cross River, Anambra, Enugu, Ebonyi, Benue, Nasarawa, Borno, Yobe, Imo, Abia and Gombe had no challenges purchasing fuel from both major and independent dealers, but petrol still sold between N165 and N180 per litre.\n\nA source in the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) attributed the scarcity to a dislocation in the supply chain.\n\nThe MOWAN source, who pleaded anonymity, explained that when there is a disruption of the supply chain, it \u201ctakes an average of almost two weeks to get it back to normal.\u201d\n\nHe added that NNPC Limited restored supply late yesterday, adding that motorists and commuters may have to cope till the early part of next week when normalcy is expected to return.\u201d\n\nBut IPMAN National Operations Controller, Mike Osatuyi, pointed out that the fuel being sold in the last one week by independent marketers was a part of the reserves they had.\n\nHe said: \u201cMarketers have been loading from the stock they had and we are running low on the product because we haven\u2019t received fresh supply. The situation will be worse if nothing is done urgently and when the old reserve we have runs out.\u201d\n\nBut IPMAN Chairman, Lagos Satellite Depot, Ejigbo, Akin Akinrinade, had before the statement announcing the increment, blamed the shutdown of stations operated by independent marketers.\n\nHe, however, explained to reporters in Lagos that IPMAN members resolved to shut down their operations because they could no longer operate at a loss and in a hostile environment.\n\nHe said the government fixed pump price at N165 per litre even when current realities showed that the minimum price should be N180.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs you can see, the queues are back and this is the second time we are witnessing it this year.\n\n\u201cHowever, this one is peculiar in the sense that for a particular reason, IPMAN members decided to shut their stations.\n\n\u201cThis is not because we are on strike, but because we can no longer do business under this condition.\u201d\n\nAkinrinade added that IPMAN members ought to be getting supply from the Pipelines and Product Marketing Company (PPMC), having made payments of over N1 billion since October 2021.\n\nHe said the products were yet to be delivered forcing members to patronise private depots and at the same time servicing borrowed funds.\n\nAkinrinade added that their plight was worsened by private depot owners who \u201cincreased the ex-depot price of PMS from N148.17 to N162 per litre.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen you factor in the handling charge, transportation and running cost of our stations, you will see that even within Lagos, the minimum we can retail petrol is about N180 per litre.\n\n\u201cWe want Nigerians to know that we are not out to sabotage the effort of the government because we know this hike in petroleum products prices is not peculiar to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has disrupted the supply chain and we know that the Nigerian government is doing its best to mitigate its impact on our nation.\u201d\n\nHe urged the government to direct the private depots to revert to the old ex-depot price for PMS or deregulate the downstream sector to allow market forces to determine the price.\n\nThe IPMAN boss further called for the resumption of pumping of products through the PPMC Ejigbo depot, saying it would enable IPMAN members to get supply at a cheaper cost.\n\nThe situation in Abuja remained the same yesterday as private depots were under lock and key due to a lack of supplies.\n\nOnly the overcrowded NNPC mega stations were seen by our reporters selling fuel to motorists\n\nIPMAN National Vice President, Alhaji Abubakar Maigandi said: \u201cMost of the private depots in Abuja and other places have no product. This is apart from the cost of the diesel, which is the main cause.\n\n\u201cIf care is not taken, this scarcity will bring serious hardship to the public.\u201d\n\nIn Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, long queues also resurfaced in the few stations that opened, leaving motorists and commuters lamenting.\n\nMany stations in the city were shut as they claimed not to have fuel to dispense.\n\nThe queues were seen at Rano filling station along Ado-Iworoko Road in the city and at BOVAS located at Bank Road along new Ado-Iyin Road.\n\nIn Ikere-Ekiti, the second largest town in Ekiti, filling stations were also shut down and a few that opened had long queues of vehicles.\n\nVehicle owners, tricycle operators and motorcyclists in Jos, the Plateau State capital also lamented as they bought fuel at N190 and N200 at the few independent stations that opened for business.\n\nOur reporter, who went to some of the f stations within the city, reported that the majority of the dealers barricaded their gates.\n\nAt the NNPC mega station along Secretariat junction, motorists lamented that they had been able to purchase fuel there in the past four days.\n\nNNPC spokesman, Garba Deen Muhammad, again could not be reached for comments as his mobile number was \u201cswitched off\u201d.\n\nThis is a common situation with Muhammad, who has always been evasive in responding to media inquiries about petrol scarcity.",
          "summary": "Nigerians are now paying more for petrol despite the official price still fixed at N162.50 and N165 per litre.\nIndependent marketers, who started implementing a new price regime of between N170 to N190 at the weekend, insisted yesterday that it would be difficult for them to sell at the official pump price.\nIn Lagos yesterday, many independent stations were shut, the few that were dispensing recorded long queues.\nHe said the government fixed pump price at N165 per litre even when current realities showed that the minimum price should be N180.\nThis is a common situation with Muhammad, who has always been evasive in responding to media inquiries about petrol scarcity.",

          "text": "Trend worrisome, says UK envoy\n\nExcited Buhari receives Oyebanji\n\nEkiti State Governor-elect Biodun Oyebanji yesterday disputed the allegation of vote buying during weekend election.\n\nHe said his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), was not involved in any unruly behaviour.\n\nOyebanji spoke with State House Correspondents after he was presented to President Muhammadu Buhari by APC National Chairman Abdullahi Adamu.\n\nCandidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) Chief Segun Oni alleged vote buying in the election and vowed to challenge the outcome at the tribunal.\n\nThe Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) also said they arrested some politicians trying to pay for votes during the election.\n\nAlso yesterday, the British High Commission described the trend as worrisome and alien to democracy but it hailed Ekiti voters for their peaceful conduct.\n\nOyebanji was led to Aso Villa, Abuja by party leaders, led by Adamu, Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi, Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, Jigawa State Governor Abubakar Badaru and Minister of Trade and Investment Niyi Adebayo.\n\nPresident Buhari, who said he keenly followed the poll, expressed delight with the orderly conduct.\n\n\u201cI loved how the APC governors mobilised, and supported you\u201d, the President told Oyebanji, adding: \u201cI think the party is very lucky, and things are getting better. I congratulate the Chairman, and I pray you sustain it.\u201d\n\nOn the allegation of vote buying, he said: \u201cWell, where I voted, I did not witness anything like that, but people are entitled to their opinion, but not to their facts.\n\n\u201cI will speak for myself. I canvassed for votes, I had a manifesto that I unveiled to Ekiti people and I canvassed based on that manifesto. I\u2019m a part of a government that has done so well. The last time I was here, I said that if performance will be an indicator for electoral success, we have nothing to fear.\n\n\u201cSo, as far as we are concerned in APC we did not involve in vote buying, but we\u2019ve done so well and we have a manifesto that pleases our people.\u201d\n\nAdamu ascribed the victory to God, and pledged that the feat would be replicated in Osun State next month.\n\nChairman of the Campaign Council for Ekiti, Badaru congratulated President Buhari on the successful outing, saying; \u201cYour unending effort to reposition the party is paying off. If we combine the votes of the candidates that came second and third, our candidate still beat them by a wide margin. APC is being daily endeared to Nigerians. Our gratitude goes to you, Mr President.\u201d\n\nThe Governor-elect, who thanked the President, said the election was a referendum on the party, \u201cand a clear, positive signal to the election in Osun, and the national one next year. APC is still the party of choice.\u201d\n\nOyebanji lauded the President for the leadership and the level playing field he provided,\u201d adding that he would be magnanimous in victory, as earlier advised by President Buhari.\n\nOyebanji said his victory was as a result of the work done by the APC-led administration in the state, adding that he campaigned effectively and presented a reasonable manifesto to the people.\n\nAdamu said that the allegation of vote-buying was raised by elements who were losing at the poll.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have noticed that over the last maybe four or five general elections in this country, this issue of vote buying has taken a center stage. One can only evidence what he saw, what he did and I\u2019m sure his excellency the governor-elect, responded in very good faith.\n\n\u201cSome of you asking this particular question did not go Ekiti. You were not there. Somebody who is losing the election flied a kite. \u2018Oh no, they are buying votes and all the kind of money they have, we don\u2019t have. That\u2019s why I\u2019m losing,\u2019 and you are helping to market that opinion.\u201d\n\nBritish High Commission hails Ekiti voters for peaceful conduct\n\nThe British High Commission congratulated the people of Ekiti State, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), security agencies, the civil society partners and other stakeholders for the successful conduct of the poll under the new legal framework.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, the high commission stated: \u201cOur team of observers on the ground noted commendable improvements in the electoral process, including the timely opening of polls, better functioning of the Biometric Voters Accreditation System (BVAS) devices for accrediting voters, and the transparent and efficient electronic transmission of polling unit results to INEC\u2019s results viewing portal.\u201d\n\nThe high commission, however, expressed concern about reports of vote-buying and called on the relevant authorities to hold any persons involved accountable.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe buying and selling of votes has no place in a democracy.\n\n\u201cWe urge any party or individual who is dissatisfied with the process to seek redress in a peaceful manner and through the appropriate legal channels.\u201d",

Buhari, however, advised Oyebanji to be magnanimous in victory, in a release yesterday by the president\u2019s media adviser, Femi Adesina.\n\n\n\nThe president said the APC candidate\u2019s victory was well-deserved, considering his contributions to the development of the state and the party before his nomination, but it was also an indication of the people\u2019s confidence in the ruling party.\n\nIn his acceptance speech at his Ikogosi-Ekiti country home, Oyebanji assured that he would not disappoint the people.\n\n\n\nThe assurance came as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the governorship election, Olabisi Kolawole, congratulated the winner, describing his victory as a popular choice to which he convincingly conceded defeat.\n\n\n\nMany prominent Nigerians hailed APC and its candidate over their victory at the poll. They included National Chairman of APC, Abdulahi Adamu; presidential candidate of the party, Bola Tinubu; President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; outgoing governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi; and Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo.\n\n\n\nWhile urging Oyebanji to be benevolent in victory in the interest of the people, Buhari also rejoiced with Adamu and the APC National Working Committee (NWC) for a successful outing, the first in the tenure of the newly elected executives of the party.\n\n\n\nThe president told the APC national chairman, \u201cThis is a good beginning for you and your team. The APC is getting stronger and more united. The victory of our party in Ekiti is an indication of the confidence of Nigerians in the ability of our great party to deliver quality governance to all.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuhari charged all APC members within and outside the country to see the victory in Ekiti State as a good omen for the 2023 general election and work diligently to ensure the party\u2019s success. He urged a continuation of the winning trend in the Osun State governorship poll in July.\n\n\n\nFelicitating with the people of Ekiti State for the smooth conduct of the election, Buhari affirmed that they were the real victors, as they were able to freely choose their leader for the next four years.\n\nHe also lauded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the law enforcement agencies for their conducts, and urged them to keep the momentum in future elections.\n\n\n\nOn his part, Oyebanji promised never to disappoint or betray the confidence reposed in him by Ekiti people. He said his victory marked a watershed in the history of the state, saying it would translate into prosperity and growth, as he builds and improves on the legacies of the previous administrations.\n\n\n\nThe APC governorship candidate polled an aggregate of 187, 057 votes to defeat Chief Segun Oni of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), who came a distant second with 82, 209 votes, while Kolawole of PDP scored 67, 457 votes to place third.\n\n\n\nOyebanji lauded the electorate in the state for the overwhelming confidence in him, and assured that he would hit the ground running with his agenda for growth and turnaround of the state.\n\nHe commended INEC and the security agencies for delivering to Ekiti State a free, fair and credible poll, in line with the decision of the majority of people in the state.\n\n\n\nCommending the other contestants in the election for adding credibility to the contest with their noble and enviable conducts, Oyebanji stated that before his inauguration on October 16, he would be meeting them to source ideas towards the development of the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cI thank all other aspirants and their respective political parties for the dignified way they carried out their campaigns, and for contributing to the credibility of the process.\n\n\n\n\u201cI will be seeking audience with you all in the coming days, to benefit from your wealth of ideas on how to develop our dear state \u2013 to complement our vision and blueprint for the accelerated development of Ekiti. You have all performed creditably and earned places of honour in the history of our state.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn those who lost their lives in some of the isolated violent incidents during the electioneering period, Oyebanji said, \u201cI use this opportunity to once again convey my condolences to the families of our kinsmen, who died in the pockets of pre-election violence. I join my voice with that of all well-meaning Ekiti kete to the call for full investigations into the incidences and ensure justice is done.\u201d\n\nKolawole: Your Victory is Popular Choice\n\nThe candidate of PDP in Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Ekiti State, Otunba Olabisi Kolawole, congratulated the APC candidate and winner of the election, Mr Biodun Oyebanji, saying his victory is a popular choice.\n\nIn a congratulatory letter he personally signed, Kolawole said, \u201cFollowing the announcement of your victory in the June 18 Ekiti governorship election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), I hereby write to congratulate you accordingly.\n\n\n\n\u201cI believe that power belongs to God and He bestows upon whoever he chooses. I also believe in popular choice that the unfettered expression of the peoples mandate as one of the crucial hallmarks of democratic principle and practice.\n\n\n\n\u201cDemocracy must, therefore, deliver to the people dividends of security or protection and enhance their social welfare and well-being basically, among other deliverables.\n\n\u201cThese were the motivation for my own ambition in the governorship of Ekiti State, which I feel strongly to reiterate here in view of the precarious situation of our people at the moment.\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease, take urgent actions aimed at redressing the plights of our people when you fully assume the mantle shortly. Finally, I wish you the guidance of the Almighty God in the onerous task ahead.\u201d\n\nAdamu: Ekiti Victory is Precursor of Future APC Victories\n\nNational Chairman of APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, yesterday, said the victory recorded in the Ekiti State governorship election by the party was a foretaste of expected victories in future polls. Adamu stated this in his letter of congratulations to the governor-elect, Mr. Biodun Oyebanji, signed by the senate president\u2019s Senior Special Assistant (SSA), Dr Samuel Jimba.\n\n\n\nAdamu said the victory recorded in the first election in his tenure as national chairman of APC was as a result of the popularity of Oyebanji\u2019s candidature, as well as the robust campaign strategy put in place by the party.\n\nHe paid tribute to the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, who, as leader of APC, provided guidance for the party as it went into the Ekiti election.\n\nThe senate president promised Buhari that the party would continue to be guided by wisdom in all future elections for the consolidation of his legacies.\n\nTinubu: Ekiti Victory Will Motivate APC for More in 2023\n\nPresidential candidate of APC, Senator Bola Tinubu, said the party\u2019s victory in the Ekiti State governorship election would spur it on to more victories in the coming elections. In a statement yesterday by his media office, Tinubu congratulated Oyebanji and the party for winning the governorship election. He also commended the APC governors and members of the NWC under Adamu\u2019s leadership for recording their first major electoral victory.\n\nHe charged them not to relent in their efforts, but to lead the party to greater victories in the 2023 general election.\n\nCommending Oyebanji for the steadfastness and passion he brought to the campaign, Tinubu said, \u201cI congratulate our governor-elect Abiodun Oyebanji and his deputy, Mrs. Monisade Afuye, for their great success at the election. This victory is our victory as members of the All Progressives Congress.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis feat should motivate and inspire us as we go for more victories in the coming elections. I must commend the now outgoing governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, and his team, whose progressive leadership in Ekiti made it possible for APC to retain government for the next four years. I am confident that the governor will finish well and strong.\n\n\u201cWhile thanking the people of Ekiti once again for standing by APC, I urge them and, indeed, the generality of Nigerians to continue to maintain their faith and confidence in our party.\u201d\n\nFayemi: Ekiti People Have Spoken Loud and Clear\n\nEkiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, congratulated the leadership of APC on the victory, and also lauded the Ekiti electorate, whom he said spoke loud and clear through the ballot box.\n\n\n\nIn a message of congratulations in Ado-Ekiti, yesterday, Fayemi described Oyebanji\u2019s victory as well-deserved, saying it is a befitting honour for a man, who, in the last three decades, has committed his time, energy, talent and resources to the development of the state.\n\n\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cEkiti people have spoken loud and clear. The outcome of the election has shown that Ekiti people are honourable people, who always support and reward leaders, who have served them diligently and faithfully.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that the new governor-elect will serve Ekiti people even more diligently, and create opportunities for other young people.\n\n\n\n\u201cHearty congratulations to our own BAO, the governor-elect, and a bigger congratulations to our party, APC. The biggest accolade goes to the good people of Ekiti State for their display of civility throughout the electioneering period.\u201d\n\nAdebayo: Ekiti Has Shown the World Maturity of Nigeria\u2019s Democracy\n\nMinister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo, congratulated the winner of Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Ekiti State, Biodun Oyebanji, saying by the peaceful conduct of the people, they have shown the world that democracy has matured in the country.\n\n\n\nAdebayo said the outcome of the election was the people\u2019s verdict on APC\u2019s performance in the last three and a half years, which put the state on the path of steady progress and development\n\nThe former governor of the state praised other contestants in the election for abiding by the rules of the game and allowing Ekiti people to make their decision on who should be their next governor. He called on them to accept the outcome of the election and team up with Oyebanji to continue the good work of the incumbent governor.\n\nSanwo-Olu: Oyebanji\u2019s Victory Testifies to APC\u2019s Good Works\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, congratulated Biodun Oyebanji, saying his victory is a testament to the good work the APC government in the state as well as the sterling qualities of its candidates.\n\nSanwo-Olu also congratulated he APC leadership at the federal and state levels, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Gboyega Akosile.\n\n\n\nThe governor said he did not doubt the party\u2019s victory because Ekiti people were progressives and would always vote for the party. He said the progressive nature of the Ekiti people as well as their culture of reciprocating good gestures were what played in Oyebanji\u2019s victory.\n\n\n\nSanwo-Olu stated, \u201cI must note that our party, the All Progressives Congress, and its government under the able leadership of Governor Kayode Fayemi has delivered beyond the expectations of the Ekiti people. I, therefore, believe it was only natural for the citizens to reciprocate by voting for our party.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur confidence was further buoyed by the quality of candidates presented for the governorship poll. The combination of Mr. Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji and his deputy, Mrs Monisade Christiana Afuye, is what Ekiti needs to continue with the great work started by the outgoing governor.\n\n\n\n\u201cI once again congratulate the winners for running a good race and emerging victorious. I also congratulate my brother-governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, who has set a winning template for the party, with good governance over the years.\u201d\n\nLawan: Ekiti is Indicative of 2023 General Election\n\nPresident of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, while congratulating the APC candidate in the Ekiti governorship election, Biodun Oyebanji, said the outcome of the exercise was indicative of what to expect in next year\u2019s general election.\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Ola Awoniyi, Lawan also congratulated APC, both at the state and national levels, and the people of Ekiti State on the peaceful and successful conduct of the poll, and for making the right choice. He said the outcome of the election further demonstrated the trust and confidence of Nigerians across the country in APC.\n\n\n\nLawan said democracy had continued to get stronger in Nigeria under the APC federal government led by President Muhammadu Buhari. He commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for delivering a poll that had been widely adjudged as free, fair, transparent and hitch-free, and wished the governor-elect God\u2019s guidance as he prepared for the onerous task ahead.\n\nAPC: Fayemi\u2019s Achievements Laid Foundation for Our Victory\n\nThe APC leadership has said the towering accomplishments of incumbent Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, provided a solid foundation for the decisive victory of the party in the just concluded governorship election in the state.\n\n\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Felix Morka, in a statement, said without a doubt, the well-deserved victory in Ekiti State was an eloquent testimony to the acceptance of the party under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, the sagacity of Adamu, and the uncommon commitment of members of the NWC.\n\nAPC said, not surprisingly, the opposition PDP came a distant third position in the election, despite its claim to a self-serving and self-assigned rescue mission in Nigeria. It stressed that the people of Ekiti State and, by extension, Nigerians were not, in any way, deceived by the ceaseless propaganda of a desperate party that only sought a return to power to continue its ruinous escapades.\n\n\n\nAPC stated, \u201cAs we savour the joy and euphoria of victory in the just-concluded gubernatorial election in Ekiti State, the All Progressives Congress (APC) wishes to congratulate and profoundly appreciate the wonderful people of Ekiti State for reaffirming their confidence in our party by rallying round the governor-elect, Biodun Oyebanji.\n\n\u201cIt bears mentioning that the towering accomplishments of incumbent Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode John Fayemi, provided a solid predicate for this decisive victory. We thank you for your service to your state and country.\u201d\n\n\n\nAPC urged the people of Ekiti State and Nigerians, in general, to sustain their support for the party by voting overwhelmingly for all APC candidates in subsequent elections.\n\nAkeredolu: BAO, APC Victory Symbolic\n\nChairman of the South-west Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ondo State, Mr. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), congratulated the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and winner of Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Ekiti State, Biodun Oyebanji, saying his victory is symbolic.\n\n\n\nAkeredolu also saluted the people of the state for the smooth conduct of the exercise.\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, the governor described the victory as an unequivocal testament to the acceptability of APC and the excellent performance of the incumbent, Dr. Kayode Fayemi.\n\n\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cI congratulate my brother, Biodun Oyebanji Abayomi, on this victory. I rejoice with our great party, the APC. I salute the people of Ekiti for their resilience and peaceful conduct. This victory is for the people of Ekiti State and all lovers of democracy across the country. It is a mark of renewed commitment of the people to our party, the APC.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo doubt, BAO\u2019s vast experience in public service is an asset that would be deployed for the good of the people of Ekiti State. As a former commissioner, Chief of Staff, and later Secretary to the State Government, the governor-elect is well equipped to take the state to the next level.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that BAO will consolidate on the gains of the outgoing administration of Governor Fayemi and leverage on the continuity of our party in government to further deliver dividends of good governance to the people.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is our first win since the emergence of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the presidential candidate of our party. This election is, however, symbolic as it shows the preparedness and commitment of our people to vote en masse for the APC in next year\u2019s general election.\u201d\n\nHouse Lauds INEC over Ekiti Governorship Election\n\nThe House of Representatives lauded INEC for the successful conduct of the governorship election in Ekiti State, which has been adjudged a triumph for democracy, according to metrics by independent domestic and foreign observers.\n\n\n\nThe lawmakers, in a statement by their spokesman, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, also commended the Nigeria Police, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), and other security agencies for keeping the peace and demonstrating vigilance against electoral malpractices.\n\n\n\nWhile assuring of their commitment to the improvement of the electoral processes, the House expressed optimism that the successful run of the election in Ekiti would inspire more Nigerians to vote in the 2023 general election.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cAs the first gubernatorial election to be conducted by INEC under the new Electoral Act 2022, the election presented a unique opportunity to assess the operational implications of some provisions of the newly issued INEC guidelines and the Electoral Act 2022, which was recently passed by the National Assembly under the leadership of the distinguished Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, and the Honourable Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\n\u201cAccording to reports from independent election observers, there was marked improvement in election logistics management, as well as the deployment of personnel and essential materials, such as the Voter Register, Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), voting cubicles, and ballot boxes, which resulted in early commencement of voting.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe House is also pleased with reports that the BVAS functioned properly in 94% of observed polling units, and was promptly fixed in the 6% of polling units where it malfunctioned. This, indeed, validates the faith that was placed in INEC to deploy election technology to improve our electoral system.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe House also seizes this opportunity to call on INEC to extend the June 30th voter registration deadline to accommodate the increasing number of Nigerians who wish to register to vote.\u201d\n\nIG Hails Ekiti Electorate, as PSC Salutes Police Performance\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Mr Usman Baba commended the electorate in Ekiti State for cooperating with the Nigeria Police and other security agencies in the governorship election.\n\n\n\nIn a similar vein, the Police Service Commission (PSC), which supervised the police officers deployed during the poll, confirmed that the election was largely peaceful and orderly and commended its men.\n\n\n\nThe IG also lauded the efforts of the police officers deployed for the poll, under the direct supervision of Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of election security, DIG Johnson Babatunde Kokumo.\n\nThe IG noted that the police officers conducted themselves professionally, which built trust with the electorate and, ultimately, led to a successful electoral process.\n\n\n\nA statement last night by the Force Headquarters said the IG emphasised that the timely situation reports released by the police effectively covered all communication gaps with the people and eliminated every iota of doubt regarding the massive security presence in the state.\n\n\n\nThe police chief, while admonishing Nigerians to toe the line of peaceful conduct in forthcoming elections, assured all citizens of improved management of security during electioneering processes. He called on well meaning Nigerians, particularly, the electorate and political actors, to accord necessary support to the police and other security agencies in the 2023 general election, and in the Osun State\u2019s off-season governorship election, slated for July.\n\n\n\nThe PSC, in a statement by its head of Press and Public Relations, Mr Ikechukwu Ani, affirmed that the Ekiti election was a huge improvement and good test-run for the 2023 elections.\n\nSERAP Urges INEC to Prosecute Vote Buyers or Face Legal Action\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) gave the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, seven days to gather information about reports of vote-buying, undue influence, intimidation, ballot box snatching, and other electoral offences by the three leading political parties in the just concluded governorship election in Ekiti State.\n\nSERAP also urged INEC to promptly and effectively prosecute those arrested, and bring to justice anyone who sponsored, aided and abetted them.\n\n\n\nIn a letter dated June 18, 2022 and signed by SERAP\u2019s Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said corruption of the ballot box intruded on the freedom of Nigerian voters to make up their minds and vote buying and other forms of electoral corruption froze out the less wealthy candidates and parties.\n\nSERAP said if voting was as important as INEC always claimed, now was the time to end the buying of democracy by wealthy politicians and their sponsors.\n\n\n\nThe letter read, in part, \u201cVote buying encourages poor governance and weakens citizens\u2019 capacity to hold their \u2018elected officials\u2019 accountable for their actions. When political candidates or their sponsors decide to buy the support of the people rather than contest fairly for their votes, there are possibilities that such candidates and sponsors will show a disregard for democratic rules and a disposition to adopt illegal means becomes inevitable.\n\n\u201cThere are reports of a brazen pattern of vote-buying and electoral bribery in several polling units during the just concluded Ekiti governorship election. There are reports of bargaining prices for votes and payments made in uncompleted buildings and bags of foodstuff being shared after votes have been cast.\n\n\n\n\u201cActing swiftly to address the brazen impunity and reports of vote-buying and electoral bribery and other electoral offences during the Ekiti State governorship election would also send a strong message to politicians that INEC, under your watch, would not tolerate such practices during the 2023 general election.\n\n\n\n\u201cProsecuting allegations of vote-buying, undue influence, ballot snatching, intimidation, and other electoral malpractices during the Ekiti State governorship election would be entirely consistent with the Nigerian Constitution, the Electoral Act, and the country\u2019s international human rights anti-corruption obligations.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within within days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall consider appropriate legal actions to compel INEC to comply with our request in the public interest.\u201d\n\nSituation Room Affirms Vote Buying Rampant in Ekiti Poll\n\nThe Situation Room, a civil society coalition, said it observed the incidence of vote buying and selling going on unabated during the election in Ekiti State.\n\n\n\nIn a statement issued by Convener of the Situation Room, Eneh Obi, the group said vote buying during the Ekiti election followed a familiar pattern of similar across the country, and in particular, the 2014 governorship election in the state.\n\n\n\nObi stated, \u201cThe description of this phenomenon as \u2018stomach Infrastructure\u2019 in the 2014 election has evolved into a new nomenclature now described as \u2018See and Buy\u2019. The ability of Ekiti politicians to make light of such a grave violation of extant law is most unfortunate. Situation Room strongly condemns this blatant violation of the electoral law.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, the Situation Room said the election was generally peaceful, with voters playing a key part in the peaceful election environment and commended voters for their comportment at the various polling centres.\n\nIt noted that INEC\u2019s strategy of voters\u2019 redistribution failed to address the problem of over concentration of voters in some polling units.\n\n\n\nAccording to the election monitoring group, a glaring example was the situation at Surajudeen School, Ado Dallimore (Ward 9), Ado Ekiti LGA, which had about five thousand registered voters shared between just two polling units.\n\n\n\nIt said some of the voters complained that their request for transfer of registration to their preferred polling units was not approved before this exercise.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Fintechs have continued to encroach on commercial banks\u2019 businesses, thereby threatening the operations and deposit mobilisation by the banks.\n\n\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee recently stated that the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and the Liquidity Ratio (LR) of the banking industry has remained above their prudential limits at 14.6 and 43.7 per cent, respectively. Also, the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of the industry stood at 5.3 per cent in April 2022, compared with its prudential limit of five per cent, reflecting sustained stability in the banking system, though there remains a need to bring this down to the prudential limit.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022EFCC arrests vote buyers\n\nKunle Aderinokun in Lagos, Chuks Okocha and Victor Ogunje in Ado-Ekiti\n\n\n\nThe governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti State, Mr. Biodun Oyebanji, was this early morning declared the winner of yesterday\u2019s governorship poll after sweeping 15 out of the 16 local government areas (LGAs) in the state.\n\nThe governorship election, which was held under a calm and peaceful atmosphere, also recorded a large turnout of voters.\n\nThe poll was however characterised by vote-buying in all the 16 LGAs in the state, leading to the intervention of the operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), who arrested some vote-buyers.\n\nAccording to the results announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Oyebanji scored 187,057 votes to defeat his main challenger and governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Mr. Segun Oni, who came a distant second with 82,211 votes, while the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr Bisi Kolawole garnered 67,457 votes to clinch the third position.\n\nHowever, while the APC and PDP won in 15 and one local government area, respectively, the SDP did not win any LGA.\n\nSixteen political parties participated in the election.\n\nAccording to the results announced by the Returning Officer, Prof. Oyebode Adebowale, APC won in Ado-Ekiti, Ikere, Emure, Ijero, Ilejemeje, Ekiti South West, Ekiti West, Ekiti East, Moba, Oye, Irepodun/Ifelodun, Ise/Orun, Aiyekire/Gbonyin, Ido-Osi, and Ikole LGAs.\n\nWhile Irepodun/Ifelodun is the LGA of former governor Ayo Fayose, who was the main backer of the PDP candidate, Ido-Osi is the LGA of the governorship candidate of SDP, Oni.\n\nIkole is the LGA of Kemi Elebute-Halle, the candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP).\n\nThe candidate of the PDP, Kolawole, was announced the winner in Efon Alaye LGA, while Oni of the SDP did not win a single LGA.\n\nThe winner of the governorship election, Oyebanji, is a former Secretary to the State Government (SSG), to Governor Kayode Fayemi.\n\nEFCC Arrests Vote Buyers, Election Calm, Peaceful\n\nFollowing the widespread vote-buying, which characterised the governorship election, the operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arrested persons suspected to be engaged in vote-buying in the poll.\n\nSome of the suspects were paraded at the Oke Ori Omi Area Division of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nThe suspects were reported to have been caught with bundles of cash allegedly used for vote-buying.\n\nSome other persons were also arrested at a private residence with a book containing details of voters of a certain voting area.\n\nThough the election was said to be calm and peaceful, sponsored thugs had a field day destroying ballot boxes in the stronghold of opposition parties in Ise Ekiti and Ilawe Ekiti Polling Units.\n\nBallot boxes in Ilasa, Polling Unit 001 in Ekiti East, another stronghold of the opposition party, were destroyed by sponsored thugs.\n\nThe Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room (Situation Room), which observed the election, said in a statement that it received reports of widespread vote-buying by political party agents across the 16 LGAs in the state.\n\n\u201cIn many instances, voters were induced with money ranging from N4,500 to N10,000 by asking them to flag completed ballot papers as proof of voting in a specified manner in what they term \u2018See and Buy\u2019. Situation Room strongly condemns this blatant violation of the electoral law,\u201d said the statement.\n\nSituation Room noted that the election was generally peaceful, with voters civilly conducting themselves in most of the polling units.\n\nIt, however, observed that the redistribution of voters done by INEC still did not take care of the issue of a huge population of voters in some polling units as many new polling units had abysmally low numbers while older polling units remain overcrowded.\n\n\u201cThere were also polling units sited in private residences such as PU006 Omiragunsin\u2019s House, Okemesi Ward 1, Ekiti West LGA and PU003 in front of Ezekiel\u2019s House Iroro/Ita Alafia Iroro Imegun, Ward 3 Araromi Omuo, Ekiti East LGA,\u201d the statement said.\n\nSituation Room, which commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), noted the early arrival of poll officials and election materials in 93 per cent of the polling units observed.\n\nAccording to the group, polls commenced before 9 a.m. in at least 88 per cent of the locations, which it described as an improvement of both the Anambra State Governorship Election 2021 and FCT Area Councils Elections 2022.\n\nSituation Room observed that the Bi-Modal Verification Accreditation System (BVAS) was functional in at least 76 per cent of the voting locations.\n\n\u201cHowever, there have been many reports of delays and malfunctioning BVAS machines in some voting units especially those with many registered voters. Examples of the locations where the machines malfunctioned are PU 002 Igbaletere by Mechanic Workshop, Ward 6 Ado Okeyinmi, Ado-Ekiti LGA where the Machine was going on and off intermittently, PU 007 LA Primary School Oke Afin, Otun Ward III and PU018 Igogo Ward II both in Moba LGA where the BVAS failed, and PU 014, Ward I Okemesi, Ekiti West LGA, amongst others. Furthermore, INEC\u2019s distribution of the BVAS devices was not proportionate to the population of registered voters by polling unit,\u201d the statement added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has asked INEC to prosecute all those involved in vote-buying in the governorship election.\n\nSERAP in a short tweet last night said the prosecution must not end with those caught in the act but must be extended to the politicians who funded their election malpractice.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Afropolitan wants to build a digital nation for Africans",
          "text": "Afropolitan, a startup that wants to build a digital nation for Africans, has raised pre-seed funding of $2.1 million, according to its co-founder, Eche Emole.\n\nFounded in 2016 by Eche Emole and Chika Uwazie, Afropolitan started out as an organisation that organised parties, events, and festivals for the African diaspora. In 2019, it made a name for itself after it organised parties for international travellers who had visited Ghana to attend the Year of Return event. That year, the number of international travellers peaked at 1.13 million, from 960,000 in 2018, which helped contribute an additional $1.9 billion to the Ghanaian economy.\n\nAfropolitan was on its way to organising another edition of its party in Beyond the Return in 2020 when the global pandemic broke out and countries went into lockdown and physical events ceased. But the traction it had gained in 2019 helped it pivot to media. It got on the audio platform, Clubhouse, and built a community of 50,000 black people.\n\nAfropolitan\u2019s inspiration for this digital nation can be traced to an article written by the former CTO of Coinbase, Balaji Srinivasan, in April 2021, titled \u201cHow to start a new country\u201d in the 21st century. Srinivasan envisions that this new country, the \u201cnetwork state,\u201d he calls it, will be \u201dbuilt on the cloud first. \u201cOur idea is to proceed cloud first, land last. Rather than starting with the physical territory, we start with the digital community. We recruit online for a group of people interested in founding a new virtual social network, a new city, and eventually a new country,\u201d he writes.\n\nSrinivasan conceives a network state as a digital nation built without the historical constraints of a physical nation, and that presents citizens with a fresh stab at societal and financial freedom.\n\n\u201cA network state is a social network with an agreed-upon leader, an integrated cryptocurrency, a definite purpose, a sense of national consciousness, and a plan to crowdfund territory,\u201d Balaji writes in another article.\n\nAlongside Srinivasan who later invested in the startup, there are over 25 other angel investors including Iyinoluwa Aboyeji of Future Africa, Olugbenga Agboola of Flutterwave, Elizabeth Yin of Hustle Fund, Shola Akinlade of Paystack, Ian Lee of Syndicate, Walter Baddoo of 4DX Ventures, Jason Njoku of IROKOtv, Tobenna Arodiogbu of CloudTrucks, Ngozi Dozie of Carbon, and Dare Obasanjo, Senior Product Manager at Meta. Hashed, Atlantica Ventures, RallyCap Ventures, Microtraction, and Cultur3 Capital are among the venture capital firms that participated in this round.\n\nEmole is convinced that Africa has the most need for a digital nation because of the numerous failed states on the continent. He explained that lingering poverty (which sees that 9 of the 10 countries with the highest poverty rates are African), coups d\u2019etat, civil wars and self-imposed autocratic leaders have starved Africa of viable socio-economic opportunities. Emole also said that #EndSARS, a 2-week protest against police brutality in his home country, Nigeria, made him realise that his country had competent people and yet that doesn\u2019t translate to good governance. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how well the standards are doing when the bad governance shows up. It affects everything around it. We\u2019ve tried engineering our way out of these problems, and it\u2019s not working,\u201d Emole said.\n\nAfropolitan team. Middle: Co-founders: Chika Uwazie and Eche Emole.\n\nEmole said that Afropolitan wants to solve the problem of scarcity that black people face globally, which manifests in an inability to access institutions, money, jobs, and quality living by creating a digital nation that can enable black people worldwide to build abundant lives.\n\nEmole envisions a digital nation as Facebook\u2014the biggest social media platform in the world with over almost 3 billion users\u2014filled with people with shared values and governed by a single cryptocurrency,\n\nAfropolitan\u2019s digital nation will be built in 4 phases. In the first phase, it will admit people into its community or decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO), with NFTs serving as digital passports. In the second phase, it will build a super app that will allow people to monitor their holdings, send money to anyone across borders, earn by contributing to the DAO, and buy goods and services from one another. The next phase is what is called a \u201cminimum viable state\u201d which will allow it to offer some government services\u2014case in point, help Africans stuck in the Russian-Ukraine crisis. Afterwards, it intends to push for full-scale sovereignty and acquire physical lands in cities across the world. \u201cThink a \u2018Chinatown/Afropolitan Town\u2019 in every city in the world where our members can establish a physical presence to create economic opportunities. Our network state will serve as the capital that governs these enclaves that will serve as embassies,\u201d Afropolitan said in a statement.\n\nOne of the VCs that invested in Afropolitan, Shima Capital, believes that Africa\u2019s population; macroeconomics and socioeconomic states are similar to the one that positioned the South East Asian region to capture value during the Web 2 technology boom. \u201cWe believe Africa is the next emerging economy that will significantly benefit from the technology paradigm shift from Web 2 to Web 3. For this value capture to take place, you need catalysts like Afropolitan,\u201d Shima Capital said.\n\n\u201cThe African diaspora represents roughly 150 million people, while the continent is home to nearly 1.5 billion, with 70% in sub-Saharan Africa under 30. As such, its demographics make Africa one of this century\u2019s most compelling growth stories; yet its intellectual, creative, and cultural capital remains overlooked, underfunded, and undervalued. Afropolitan aims to change that,\u201d Cultur3 Capital, said. It also said it believes in Afropolitan\u2019s community approach: \u201cTalking about \u2018community\u2019 is easy. Building it is hard. We at Cultur3 couldn\u2019t be more excited to support Afropolitan in its mission to serve the African diaspora\u2019s vast and deep talent. This community-first approach, combined with their unmatched network of Africa\u2019s top entrepreneurs, artists, and creators, will be the key that unlocks the region\u2019s vast yet underrepresented talent.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Abena, a voice assistant, wants to preserve African languages",
          "text": "Like many kids who grew up with an elderly relative, Nana Ghartey was used to helping his grandmother out around the house. He was 9 years old, and they lived together in Winneba, a small town in Ghana about 65 kilometres east of the capital city of Accra. Ghartey told TechCabal that because his grandmother didn\u2019t have the best eyesight and had trouble walking around, he regularly had to support her in completing basic tasks and functions: turning the lights in her home on and off, operating the radio and TV, and dialling numbers on her mobile phone on her behalf, and helping her check her phone credit balance. Another reason Ghartey needed to assist his grandmother was that she primarily speaks Fante, a tonal language native to the Akan tribe in Ghana and had trouble understanding the Western languages predominantly used by tech devices.\n\nBut in addition to being a dutiful young boy, Ghartey was also a budding computer geek. His late mother was a programmer at Wang Computers, so even as a toddler, Ghartey was used to being surrounded by them. With time, he slowly began to teach himself how to operate them; once he learned how to type, he was able to help his mum out with small tasks on Microsoft Word.\n\nGhartey, who is now 32, told TechCabal that he credits the needs of his grandmother during his adolescence and his early exposure to computers through his mother\u2019s profession as the inspiration and catalyst, respectively, of the artificial intelligence products he created, initially to help his grandmother out, Kofi, and the one he made for the wider public, Abena. They are the first voice assistants offered in Fante and Twi, respectively.\n\nFor all the opportunities technology affords to customise experiences by catering to users\u2019 needs with hyper-specificity, millions of Africans like Ghartey\u2019s grandmother, who either don\u2019t speak English or other Westernised languages or simply prefer not to, are often excluded from these benefits. The linguistic dominance of Western languages also threatens indigenous African languages; as big, Western-based tech companies spread their influence across Africa, both as service and product providers, and as job creators, indigenous languages are often deprioritised and nudged into the background.\n\nThe invention of the first voice assistant in 1992, Radio Rex, marked an era where computers developed the ability to translate on-screen actions or words into text. By 2010, the wealthiest American tech companies had launched language technologies: Siri was released that year, Google Now in 2012, and Alexa in 2014. But these voice technologies support only Western languages and are unavailable in African languages because of the low-revenue opportunities in African markets.\n\nIt\u2019s not as though these behemoth tech companies lack the means to build products that support indigenous African languages. And, to be fair, some have made efforts to catch up, slowly but surely, like Google Translate\u2019s addition of 10 African languages to the platform last month. Some language experts argue that these companies are the only entities, along with robust AI labs (though often the two are linked), that can solve what they characterise as a \u201clow resources\u201d problem.\n\nGhartey has his own theories about that.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they can\u2019t build such systems for African languages. Surely they can,\u201d he told TechCabal from Accra, where he now lives. \u201cThey\u2019ve prioritised the languages that they want to focus on first.\u201d\n\nSo rather than wait for big tech to do all of the problem solving, he\u2019s been working towards a solution for nearly a decade\u2014with a much smaller team and significantly fewer resources\u2014and has already made headway.\n\n\u201cWorking on voice tech for African languages has been a completely different ball game. Data set out there are based on religious text, so you end up building a system that has a bias for biblical words.\u201d\n\nBy the time Ghartey reached his teenage years, he was consumed by a desire to learn as much about computers as he could. In high school, he was the designated tech guy, often helping his classmates do things like connect to the internet on their phones. (This was 2005 when such functions weren\u2019t yet second nature.) Sometimes, because he wasn\u2019t allowed to use the campus computer lab, he skipped class and sneaked off to internet caf\u00e9s just to spend more time tinkering with them, he recalled to TechCabal. After years spent assisting his grandmother, he had become accustomed to using his skills to help anyone who needed it.\n\nHe still graduated, though, and went on to study Information Technology at the Ghana Telecom University in Accra. But Ghartey taught himself mobile app development and built desktop applications, websites, and eventually mobile games, none of which were part of his school curriculum, by reading the programming textbooks which an uncle who came visiting from the US had left behind. By the time graduation came around, Ghartey graduated top of his class and secured a scholarship to do a master\u2019s in software development, in a partnership programme between his alma mater in Accra and Coventry University, UK.\n\nHis prolonged stay in Accra meant that he would not be able to go back home to continue helping his grandmother. For a while, his younger sister stepped in to assist her, but eventually she moved out, too. Even after Ghartey received his master\u2019s, he stayed back in Accra and went on to build his mobile app development company, Mobobi LLC. But he knew he needed to come up with a solution to assist his grandmother in operating her tech devices and performing little chores, and quickly. After years of obsessive learning about computers, he knew the solution would be AI-driven, but at the time, he knew nothing about AI development.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. I remember the sleepless nights reading research papers and benchmarking frameworks and tools to find the right solution for my grandmother. I knew that if I intended to bootstrap and ship a production build to the masses, I\u2019d need to further hone my skills in AI, so I set on a mission to educate myself on what was required, \u201d Ghartey told TechCabal.\n\nFirst, he addressed the most immediate need: that of his grandmother. Using her voice and that of his sister\u2019s as data, he built Kofi, a voice assistant that supported Fante, his grandmother\u2019s preferred language and one spoken by 6 million Ghanaians. The product enabled her to use mobile apps without having to scroll through the home screen, which was difficult for her due to her impaired vision. All she had to do was tap the side of the button to launch the Kofi app, and she could instantly receive news updates, play music, stream radio programmes, and follow Twitter trends\u2014curated by the AI with human moderators to prevent misinformation\u2014without having a Twitter account.\n\nGhartey said that when he introduced her to Kofi and asked her to try it out, she initially thought she was interacting with a real person and became frustrated at times when the voice assistant didn\u2019t comply with some of her commands. Ghartey had to explain to her some of Kofi\u2019s limitations, but that process helped him recognise how useful a native voice assistant could be for the wider public. In order to serve them, he would need to build a voice assistant in Ghana\u2019s most widely spoken language: Twi.\n\nThis would prove to be a much larger undertaking than Kofi. First of all, Ghartey didn\u2019t have nearly as much data to work with initially, and he already knew the next iteration would require a large data set so that he could offer the product in several different dialects in order to avoid bias toward certain intonations. Secondly, Twi, like many other languages in the south of the Sahara, is tonal; accent marks dictate tones and make a difference in communication, which demanded even more research.\n\nAnother important factor to consider was access. In Winneba, where he lived with his grandmother, internet connection was patchy and inconsistent. Ghartey didn\u2019t want his users to worry about constantly having to purchase data in order to use the app, which meant that Abena would need to function offline. (For context, with Apple\u2019s Siri, this offline feature is only available to users with iOS 15.) Abena\u2019s offline operation was also an effort to cut costs on his end; online operation would have required a server that processed thousands of user requests from users in real time, and thus enormous computing power from costly cloud servers.\n\nBut Ghartey knew his efforts would be worth it. He spent 6 years building Abena AI, and released it in the Google Play Store this April as a Mobobi product. (At that point, Mobobi had already gained some traction for Real Piano Teacher, a popular game that has amassed more than 20 million downloads and is the first Ghanaian-made game on Google Play Pass.) Just like the features offered on Kofi, users can check trending news on Twitter; follow weather reports; check, transfer, and recharge their airtime balances; and transfer money with their preferred mobile payment app, all using voice commands on Abena AI. The offline mode also supports an in-app community feature that allows users to send text messages, images, and videos with each other.\n\nThe reception was immediately enthusiastic. Just a few days after launching Abena AI, a health influencer shared a demo of the app on Twitter, which catapulted it to trending topic popularity and demonstrated the need of a voice assistant offered in a language that was the second most spoken in the country after English.\n\nSimilar to the way his grandmother benefitted from Kofi, Ghartey realised that in addition to being more linguistically inclusive, Abena AI also served people with visual impairments who speak or preferred to speak Twi, many of whom were elders. They became fast fans of Abena AI, he said, because it made it easier for them to check and recharge their credits from their phones, which otherwise required tech-savviness or Western language literacy.\n\nOnce Abena AI was out in the world, it was time to refine it, a task that turned out to be just as challenging as building the voice assistant in the first place. He couldn\u2019t afford to pay professional linguists to help him with the training data for Twi, so he crowdsourced translation data from users by using third-party pop-up apps that requested translations. That proved unsuccessful when he discovered that the responses users provided were either inaccurate, or complete diversions of the words he asked them to translate. He tried incentivising users by offering to pay 5 cedis ($0.6) per translation, which worked for a while, but eventually he ran out of money. He remained tenacious, though, and eventually hired religious translators who worked on church-related translations in Twi. Still, he said he is always on the lookout for more ways to gather information about the language.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a work in progress,\u201d he said, adding that he accounts for the context of every word and crowdsources information about dialects from Abena AI app users. \u201cYou need lots of data to build these models.\u201d\n\nLike Google Nest and Amazon Echo\u2014both hardware using their respective company\u2019s voice recognition software\u2014Abena also functions as a home automation system. Abena AI works with smart lights, smart plugs, and other smart home devices.\n\nIn the nearest future, Ghartey is looking to ship an update that will see Abena support 5 more Ghanaian languages and hire professional natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning engineers to speed up his work and help him ship updates to other African languages like Swahili, Kinyarwanda, Afrikaans, Sesotho, and isiZulu.\n\nGhartey works on Abena AI for 3 hours on workdays, while working full time at his company Mobobi, to allow him to keep bootstrapping it.\n\n\u201cThe feedback from a few people who tried Abena AI out before it was released kept us going. That smile on a 60-year-old\u2019s face as he listened to his airtime being read out without stress\u2014it was paving the way for people to perform tasks easily, tasks they\u2019d never been able to do in the past,\u201d Ghartey said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "The rising incidents of tech talents leaving abroad amid global economic squeeze is a major challenge for businesses seeking for specialised skills in Africa\u2019s most populous nation, Nigeria.\n\nThe development, according to experts, is having negative impacts on organizations and businesses in the country like banks, contributing to glitches in transactions, among others.\n\nIn a recent statement, Abubakar Suleiman, the chief executive officer of Sterling Bank referred to the exit of these tech talents as a \u201cgreat resignation\u201d.\n\nBusinessDay reached out to experts in the tech ecosystem who outlined various ways businesses in Nigeria can retain talents.\n\nMuhammad Habib, a software engineer explained that the government have a crucial role to play in keeping tech talents from leaving the country.\n\n\u201cIf the Nigerian government and business can guarantee the security of her citizens and provide basic amenities like constant electricity. I think people will be happy to stay,\u201d he said.\n\nHabib also stated that most companies in Nigeria have to start seeing tech talents as part of the production process and add value to their work.\n\n\u201cUnethical behaviour at work has to stop if businesses really want to retain tech talents. As this may sound somehow, it happens in many workspaces where an intern developer is turned into an errand boy and girl all because they are searching for experience to develop themselves. Some are not even paid but have to tolerate the kind of behaviour from their bosses,\u201d Habib said.\n\nThe software engineer disclosed that most companies take advantage of the high unemployment rate in the country and give low remuneration, overusing their tech talents in the name of wanting to provide the best, which leads to unhealthy work and life balance. He said, \u201cif businesses can follow due process in software development like agile development process, flexible working hours and pay what the employee is worth, I think the migration will reduce.\u201d\n\nAkinola Olumide, Finacle and C24 scripting officer in one of Nigeria\u2019s tier one banks, noted that businesses in Nigeria have to adopt the practice of remote work in order to keep their tech talents.\n\nAccording to him, the covid-19 pandemic serves was an eye-opener for many tech talents as some were seen handling works for various companies at the same time. He stated that after the period, most developers started aiming higher and none wanted to return to physical jobs.\n\n\u201cCompanies should encourage the practice of remote work to retain their tech workers. Since the pandemic, developers or tech people no longer want to take jobs that are not remote. Any job offer I get these days that is not remote, I always decline it. The pandemic opened a lot of people\u2019s eyes that you can actually be more productive when you work from home and a lot of our banks and tech firms are starting to recall their staff back to work physically,\u201d Olumide said.\n\nHowever, the web developer did not shy away from the fact that most tech talents abused the work-from-home privilege as some were caught engaging in side hustle during work hours.\n\nHe said, \u201cA colleague was doing Uber driving business during work hours and unfortunately for him, he picked up a senior person while he was on a team meeting at work. But then its positives outweigh its negatives. Luckily now, there are inventories of monitoring tools that can be deployed on workstations to monitor uptime and work hours on a system while working from home.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that security personnel in the country also have a part to play in the area of retaining tech talents. He stated that they need to find a means to differentiate a fraudster and a tech developer.\n\nRead also: Tech talent exodus, glitches frustrate money transfers\n\n\u201cOur police and securities should start doing well also and know that everyone carrying a laptop is not a cybercriminal. When I was working at Surulere, I can\u2019t count the number of times I was stopped by the police. Even when I had my ID and the laptop clearly showed it belonged to a company,\u201d Olumide said.\n\nMeanwhile, a UK-based Nigerian tech engineer who pleaded to remain anonymous said the need for Nigerian companies to start employing a higher number of junior developers who will eventually take over from the senior colleagues when they have the need to go.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows very few Nigerian companies can afford to compete with what people are paid on freelancing platforms. So it should be expected that experienced people may still leave for other good opportunities. Nigerian companies need to start to value junior developers in terms of giving them the opportunity to work with their senior engineers, so that when the senior leaves, the junior would have learnt much and be able to fill in for the senior engineer before a new boss comes on board,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also disclosed that allowing the junior engineer to practice along with the senior colleague serves as a win-win for both the company and the junior developer.\n\nCiting the banks, he explained that the system is too rigid for developers like him. He said most Nigerian banks are still running in an old manner and, \u201cthis is a big issue for developers especially those that have worked outside the banking system. Some banks still do full onsite for their IT staff which is a problem for developers that are experienced because there are international companies that are willing to give them a token that is more than the salary paid by the Nigerian companies and with a good level of flexibility.\u201d\n\nThe engineer stated that Nigerian companies and businesses should also start paying their workers, especially tech talents, by the value they bring to the organization and not by the number of years spent in the industry or by age.\n\nMeanwhile, he explained that they should also give out rewarding incentives to their workers and give them reasons to always find value in what they do.",

The internal wrangling is the only thing that can stop us as it has stopped PDP in Ekiti State.\n\n\u201cIf we sue for peace in the party, we will certainly find one. We should try to resolve the internal wrangling within the party as no court case can bring peace unless we sit together to resolve our quarrel.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cOur aim is to be in power and to be the ruling party. Our collective interest should be our major focus, not our selfish interest which is at the root of the crisis of the party.\u201d\n\nObaseki urged leaders of the party to make ward meetings important and compulsory from this month.

Indeed democracy thrives when there is a well-informed and engaged citizenry. However, for a well-informed and engaged citizenry to exist, the media must not just inform the public, but analyze and present information and unbiased date that can and should shape policy.\n\nThe AUN-Premium Times Data Hub is is a unique collaboration between higher education and media to inject more data-driven analysis into civic discussions and journalism. The Development Hub will use data and analysis to build an evidence base for change.\n\nThe purpose of this Hub is to present data and analysis and a platform for discussion on every major sphere of development, including gender, poverty, education, health, economic growth and employment, governance and democracy, peace and security and the role of technology. On each platform, the best available data on Nigeria\u2019s current status will be presented and analysed and solutions to specific problems will be proposed.\n\nOur goal is to present and analyze data in a way that will educate you, our readers, guide you toward action and, over time, guide the decisions of policymakers. We hope to build an evidence base for positive economic, social and political change.\n\n\u2013 Margee M. Ensign",

          "text": "The Niger Delta United Congress (NDUC) has alleged that the sole administrator of the interventionist agency, Effiong Akwa, is working against the Niger Deltans\u2019 legitimate demand for the inauguration of a substantive board for NDDC, in accordance with the law setting up the Commission.\n\nIn a statement by Ebizomor Brisibe, and Edem Archibong, President and Secretary of NDUC respectively, the group wondered why it took Akwa \u201ctwo long weeks to make an embarrassing volte-face and eat his own words which are in print and online and can therefore be easily verified to know who is lying between him (Akwa) and our group.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to the group, \u201crather than apologise to the people of the Niger Delta region, whose foremost agency, NDDC, he is occupying in violation of the NDDC Act, Effiong Akwa, Sole Administrator of NDDC, in an unrestrained verbiage of egregious subterfuge was unhinged in his farcical denial and flip-flop on his ill-advised but widely villified statement that people should reduce the agitation on board and work with the current management of the NDDC.\u201d\n\nNDUC stated that \u201cin the syndicated media report, a vexatious flip-flop, in Punch of June 17, 2022, \u201cNDDC debunks newspaper report, says commission not opposed to new board,\u201d the embattled Akwa, made an embarrassing volte-face of flatly denying statements that he made since two weeks ago.\u201d\n\nBrisibe and Archibong noted that in the Punch report above, the NDDC issued a statement where it stated that \u201cWe wish to state categorically that Dr. Akwa, who was not present at the occasion, but was represented by his Special Adviser on Youths and Sports, Engr. Udengs Eradiri, did not make that statement at the online interaction.\u201d The group pointed out that the \u201ccontentious anti-Niger Delta statement that Effiong Akwa made but which he is denying and strenuously striving to extricate himself from\u201d is the statement that \u201cPeople should reduce the agitation on board and work with the current management of the NDDC.\u201d\n\nCiting several newspapers, NDUC stated that as can be verified from these newspaper reports \u2013 \u201cTrust Buhari on Niger Delta Devt, NDDC Boss Urges Stakeholders,\u201d ThisDay, June 6, 2022; \u201cNDDC: Forensic audit reveals can of worms, we\u2019re treating it \u2014 Akwa,\u201d Vanguard, June 6, 2022; \u201cBuhari will hand over reformed NDDC to Niger Delta,\u201d The Nation, Jun 6, 2022; and \u201cTrust Buhari on NDDC, Niger Delta, Akwa urges stakeholders,\u201d Blueprint, June 6, 2022, \u201cAkwa categorically made the above statement.\u201d According to the above newspaper reports, \u201cThe NDDC boss spoke during a webinar organised by his Special Adviser on Youths and Sports, Engr. Udengs Eradiri, and attended by hundreds of youths across the world.\u201d\n\nThe group also drew attention that \u201cfurther nail was pierced on Akwa\u2019s untenable denial in a story published by Vanguard newspaper on Saturday, June 18, 2022, entitled \u201cRow Over NDDC Board: N\u2019Delta stakeholders rebuff Akwa\u2019s plea on agitation,\u201d in which, according to the paper, \u201cLawyers, activists, puncture claim forensic audit will affect board inauguration.\u201d At the said webinar, the newspaper report quoted Akwa as stating that \u201cThe board will come when all the parameters have been put together so that going forward, the new NDDC can start on good footing. People should reduce the agitation on board and work with the current management of the NDDC\u201d.\n\nNiger Delta United Congress observed that \u201cAkwa is miffed that we called him out when we stated that in an unrestrained show of disregard for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, he (Akwa) had the effrontery to state that the Act establishing the commission was undergoing required reviews, we can no longer rely on the existing Act,\u201d and that \u201cpeople should reduce the agitation on board and work with the current management of the NDDC.\u201d\n\nThe group further noted that in his \u201cpuerile denial, Akwa also contradicted President Buhari\u201d when he (Akwa) stated that \u201cthe public should, therefore, disregard such spurious lies being masterminded, fabricated and orchestrated by persons who are positioning themselves and their associates for appointment into the Board of the NDDC.\u201d\n\nNDUC however pointed out that \u201cPresident Buhari, in exercise of his powers and in accordance with the law establishing NDDC forwarded the list of nominees for the NDDC Board to the Senate for confirmation on October 18, 2019. The Senate dutifully screened and confirmed the nominees of President Buhari as Board and Management of NDDC on November 5, 2019.\u201d\n\nAccording to the group, \u201cit is therefore the height of impunity, disrespect, and affront on President Muhammadu Buhari who personally promised to inaugurate the substantive Board of NDDC\u201d when Akwa states that \u201cpersons are positioning themselves and their associates for appointment into the Board of the NDDC.\u201d\n\nBrisibe and Archibong recalled that President Buhari, on June 24, 2021, while receiving the leadership of Ijaw National Congress (INC) at the State House in Abuja, promised that the NDDC Board would be inaugurated as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted, which report has been submitted to President Buhari since nine months ago on September 2, 2021.\n\nAt that occasion, President Buhari said that \u2018\u2018Based on the mismanagement that had previously bedeviled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021. I want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board will be inaugurated.\u201d\n\nThe group regretted however that The President has not yet fulfilled his promise nine months after submission of the audit report and the Ijaw National Congress (INC), \u201can authentic stakeholder in Niger Delta, which he received in audience when he made the above promise to Nigerians has been compelled to describe the delay in the inauguration of the NDDC Board as a clear betrayal of trust and display of state insensitivity on the Ijaw nation and Niger Delta region.\u201d\n\nNDUC restated that \u201cthis position of INC and other authentic Niger Delta stakeholders represent the collective position of Niger Deltans, not the subterfuge from a puppet and beneficiary of the current illegality in NDDC who unabashedly sings the deleterious tunes of his paymasters to suppress Niger Deltans and deprive them of a properly governed and representative NDDC with necessary checks and balances in accordance with the NDDC Act.\u201d\n\nBrisibe and Archibong pointed out that \u201cNDDC is regulated by its establishment Act which clearly stipulates how the agency should be governed. The ongoing contraption of administering the Commission by a Sole Administrator is a violation of the NDDC Act. What the NDDC Act provides is that the Board and Management (Managing Director and two Executive Directors) of the NDDC at any point in time should follow the provisions of the law which states that the Board and management is to be appointed by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate. In effect, the current Sole Administrator (Effiong Akwa), who is not recognized by the law setting up NDDC, the NDDC Act, therefore lacks the authority, and even moral standing to begin to pontificate on the \u201crequired reviews\u201d of a subsisting law which he currently violates by administering the NDDC as a Sole Administrator.\u201d\n\nNDUC said that rather \u201cwhat has subsisted in NDDC for the past two years is that there is an illegal sole administrator who is both Managing Director, Executive Director of Finance, and Executive Director Projects, in clear breach of NDDC Act which ensures separation of these duties to ensure checks and balances.\u201d\n\nAccording to the group, \u201cthe continued administration of the NDDC by an Interim Sole administrator (Effiong Akwa) is illegal because the NDDC Act has no provision for this illegality as the NDDC Act only provides that the Board and Management (Managing Director and two Executive Directors) of the NDDC at any point in time should follow the provisions of the law which states that the Board and management is to be appointed by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate. In effect, nobody is supposed to begin to administer the NDDC and utilise the huge funds accruing to it on a monthly basis without passing through this legal requirement as stipulated in the NDDC Act.\u201d\n\nBrisibe and Archibong stated that the \u201ccontinued illegality of the Sole administrator contraption administering NDDC in breach of the law, NDDC Act, is a national embarrassment that should be of grave concern to President Buhari, who should also not condone the arbitrary use of his name and office to justify the ongoing illegality in NDDC, most especially for his legacy when he leaves office in May 2023.\u201d\n\nAccording to the group, for a President who stated in October 2019 when he received in audience the governors of the nine constituent states of the NDDC that \u201cI try to follow the Act setting up these institutions,\u201d the Niger Delta region, the country and indeed the world expects him to \u201cend the illegality of further administering NDDC with a Sole Administrator which is in breach of NDDC Act \u2013 the law setting-up the Commission.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari should also be concerned about the disdain of the Niger Delta people over the manner the NDDC has been handled, most especially administering the Commission with illegal interim management/sole administrator contraptions for five years in his seven years in office, and therefore needs to end the ongoing illegality in NDDC if he is to be remembered for good in the Niger Delta,\u201d the group noted.\n\nNDUC regretted that \u201cwhereas the North East Development Commission (NEDC) has been allowed to function with its duly constituted Board in place in line with its NEDC Act thereby ensuring proper corporate governance, accountability, checks and balances and fair representation of its constituent states, the NDDC on the other hand has been run arbitrarily in the last three years by Interim committees/sole administrator in breach of the NDDC Act.\u201d\n\nThe group stated that presently, across the length and breadth of the Niger Delta region there are \u201cunending calls, demands and peaceful agitations of youths, men and women, political and traditional leaders and civil society organisations that the inauguration of the board of NDDC will ensure compliance with the NDDC Act, promote and sustain peace, equity and fairness, transparency and accountability, good governance and rapid development and transformation of the Niger Delta Region.\u201d\n\nBrisibe and Archibong observed that \u201cas a Commission established in 2000 by an Act of Parliament, the ongoing national embarrassment at NDDC should be of grave concern to the President, about his legacy when he leaves office in 2023 and thereby should persuade him to put an end to the illegality of further administering NDDC with a Sole Administrator that is not known to the law setting-up the Commission.\u201d\n\nNiger Delta United Congress affirmed that \u201cwhile we condemn in its entirety the unwarranted and unauthorized use of President Buhari\u2019s name and office to try and justify the ongoing illegality in NDDC, we align with the demands of authentic Niger Delta stakeholders and urge President Buhari to end the illegal sole administratorship at the NDDC; inaugurate the NDDC Governing Board in line with the NDDC Act to represent the nine constituent states, and thereby ensure proper corporate governance, checks and balances, accountability, transparency, and probity in managing the Commission.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has described the peaceful conduct of the Ekiti state governorship election and the consequent victory of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as a good omen for the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe APC candidate, Mr. Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji was announced winner of the election by the Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC) in Ado Ekiti Sunday, beating Chief Segun Oni of the Social Democratic Party(SDP) and Bisi Kolawole of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) to a distant second and third respectively.\n\nOyebanji won the election polling 187,057 votes to defeat Oni, his closest rival, who garnered 82,211 votes, while Kolawole got 67,457.\n\nBuhari speaks\n\nCongratulating the governor-elect in a statement, Sunday, President Buhari said Oyebanji\u2019s victory was well-deserved considering his contributions to the development of the state and the party, before his nomination as the standard bearer.\n\nWhile urging him to be magnanimous in victory in the interest of the people of the state, the president also rejoiced with the APC national chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and the National Working Committee (NWC) for the victory, the first under the tenure of the newly elected party executives.\n\n\u201cThis is a good beginning for you and your team. The APC is getting stronger and more united. The victory of our party in Ekiti is an indication of the confidence of Nigerians in the ability of our great party to deliver quality governance to all,\u201d he said.\n\nHe charged all APC members across and outside the country to see this as a good omen for the 2023 general elections and work assiduously to ensure the party\u2019s victory, continuing the trend with Osun state next month July.\n\nThe president also felicitated with the people of Ekiti state for the smooth conduct of the election, affirming that \u201cthey are the real victors as they have been able to freely choose their leader for the next four years.\u201d\n\nHe lauded INEC and the law enforcement agencies for the preparations put in place, urging them to keep the momentum for upcoming elections.\n\nTinubu too\n\nIn a similar message, the APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, said the feat in Ekiti governorship poll should motivate and inspire APC \u201cas we go for more victories in the coming elections.\u201d\n\nTinubu commended Oyebanji for the steadfastness and passion brought into the campaign, which he said paid off with the emphatic and outstanding victory.\n\nTinubu was also full of praise for the party\u2019s governors and the Adamu-led NWC for recording their first major electoral victory, charging them not to relent in their efforts to lead the party to greater victory in 2023 general elections.\n\nThe APC presidential candidate said: \u201cI congratulate our Governor-elect Abiodun Oyebanji and his Deputy, Mrs. Monisade Afuye, for their great success at the election.\n\n\u201cThis victory is our victory as members of the All Progressives Congress.\n\n\u201cI salute the people of Ekiti State for voting for progressive leadership and continuity. I commend the leadership of our party for leading APC to this major victory in Ekiti. Also deserving of praise are our party\u2019s governors led by their Chairman and Governor of Kebbi for their hard work and tenacity to achieve victory for the party.\n\n\u201cI must commend the now outgoing-Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, and his team whose progressive leadership in Ekiti made it possible for APC to retain government for the next four years. I am confident that the Governor will finish well and strong.\n\n\u201cWhile thanking the people of Ekiti once again for standing by APC, I urge them and indeed the generality of Nigerians to continue to maintain their faith and confidence in our party.\u201d\n\nTestimony of our acceptance \u2013 APC\n\nAlso, the APC said the victory clearly symbolised the acceptance of the party, the APC-led federal government and the party\u2019s leadership.\n\nThe party, however, mocked the opposition PDP for finishing a distant third position, saying Nigerians can no longer be deceived by its propaganda against the governing party.\n\nIn a statement by its national publicity secretary, Felix Morka, the APC said: \u201cAs we savour the joy and euphoria of victory in the just-concluded gubernatorial election in Ekiti state, the All Progressives Congress (APC) wishes to congratulate and profoundly appreciate the wonderful people of Ekiti state for reaffirming their confidence in our party by rallying round the Governor-Elect, Biodun Oyebanji.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, the well-deserved victory in Ekiti state is an eloquent testimony of the acceptance of our party under the visionary leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, the sagacity of our National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and the uncommon commitment of other members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of our great Party.\n\n\u201cIt bears mentioning that the towering accomplishments of incumbent Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode John Fayemi, provided a solid predicate for this decisive victory. We thank you for your service to your State and Country.\n\n\u201cWe pay a special tribute to the Governor Atiku Bagudu-led Campaign Council for discharging their assignment with extraordinary commitment and efficiency. We salute our dogged Presidential Candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, our APC Governors, National Secretary, Sen. Iyiola Omisore, among other party leaders, for their highly valued contribution to this success,\u201d the statement said.\n\nOn the PDP\u2019s performance at the poll, Morka said: \u201cUnsurprisingly, the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) finished a distant third position in the just-concluded election. Despite its claim to a self-serving and self-assigned rescue mission of Nigeria, the people of Ekiti State and, by extension, Nigerians are not, in any way, deceived by the ceaseless propaganda of a desperate party that only seeks a return to power to continue its ruinous escapades.\n\n\u201cAs we inch towards the 2023 general elections, we urge the people of Ekiti state and Nigerians, in general, to sustain their support for our party by voting overwhelmingly for all APC candidates as the party remains unwavering in its commitment to improving the quality of governance and standard of living of all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nFayemi, Bagudu excited\n\nSimilarly, Ekiti state Governor Kayode Fayemi and his Kebbi counterpart/Chairman Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Senator Atiku Bagudu, have enjoined the Governor- Elect Oyebanji to accord dividends of democracy a priority, saying he should perceive his victory at the poll as a call to service.\n\nBagudu said: \u201cI know that Oyebanji won\u2019t give Ekiti any course to regret. All we will do is to live up to the expectations of Ekiti people and Nigerians by making Ekiti a cynosure of all eyes and best destination of choice for investors and for people who are looking for a safe haven.\n\n\u201cYour character was rewarded by somebody who trusted in your capacity to serve. There are others that are capable, but he trusts in your capacity and character to step into his shoe.\u201d\n\nThe governors maintained that Oyebanji\u2019s victory buttressed the fact that Ekiti electorate were sophisticated enough to identify and went for the best and most sellable candidate.\n\nThey spoke yesterday in Ikogosi-Ekiti, Oyebanji\u2019s country home in Ekiti West local government area of the state while presenting the election results and declaration sheets to the candidate.\n\nBagudu was the Chairman, APC National Campaign Committee of the party, with Jigawa state Governor, Abubakar Badaru as the campaign Manager for the Ekiti election.\n\nPresenting the documents, Fayemi, described the victory as exciting, applauding President Buhari, the APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Tinubu and the PGF for their immense support during the electoral battle.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe worked hard; we planned and pulled all the strings because Ekiti is the precursor for our coming victories in 2023 and Osun States and this is because we have a sellable product. His trajectory has always been to make Ekiti better and this victory will be to the benefit of Ekiti people.\n\n\u201cWith him in the saddle, you may not likely see any abandoned project in our dear state. I really thank Ekiti people for investing this confidence in our party. They have never done it before. Our people believe in turn by turn, but that has changed now.\u201d\n\nFayemi also lauded the INEC for improving on its track records, saying what happened in Ekiti was like a miracle, taking cognisance of the serenity and calmness that pervaded the atmosphere during the election.\n\nGovernor Bagudu, who went down memory lane, revealed that for APC to have won the election with over 100,000 vote margin compared to less than 20,000 recorded in 2018, confirmed how well Fayemi had done in improving the lives of the populace.\n\n\u201cVictory is sweet but we still have to be humble in it. In 2018, Governor Fayemi won the candidate of the PDP with less than 20,000 votes. But this time, the governor-elect beat his nearest rival with over 100,000 votes.\n\n\u201cFour years ago, the major opposition won in four local governments, but that has been narrowed to only a local government.\n\n\u201cThat shows that from 12 local government areas we won in 2018 now APC won 15. This could not have happened if not for the good works done by Governor Fayemi and for the sellable candidate we paraded.\n\n\u201cWe thank the people of Ekiti State for recognising our contributions and for rewarding us with this victory\u201d, Bagudu stated.\n\n\u201cWe congratulate you on your election. Today\u2019s victory is a window to 2023, and the feat our presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu may likely achieve. May God give you the wherewithal to be able to deliver for Ekiti citizens\u201d, he said.\n\nOyebanji thanks all\n\nMeanwhile, Governor-Elect Oyebanji has expressed his appreciation to people of the state for the privilege given to him and Deputy Governor-Elect Mrs. Monisade Afuye to serve them.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe recognise that on October 16, 2022 when by the grace of God, we would be inaugurated into office, we are expected to immediately start to build on the legacies of those who came before us, and honourably govern our state in trust for the generations coming after us.\n\n\u201cIt is a duty we campaigned for, and accept with all solemnity and responsibility. In keeping with our covenant with you, we will work Together With You, to Keep Ekiti Working.\n\n\u201cI, together with Chief Mrs. Afuye, use this opportunity to express our gratitude to everyone who voted for us. We also recognise all those who did not vote for us, but whose participation in this important democratic ritual of the election enriched the process, especially with the gracious manner in which you accepted the outcome, and helped maintain the peace during and after the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that though we did not have your vote at this time, we would earn your trust and cooperation as we begin the journey of Keeping Ekiti working,\u201d Oyebanji said.\n\nThe governor-elect also said: \u201cI thank all other aspirants and their respective political parties for the dignified way they carried out their campaigns, and for contributing to the credibility of the process. I will be seeking audience with you all in the coming days, to benefit from your wealth of ideas on how to develop our dear state- to complement our vision and blueprint for the accelerated development of Ekiti. You have all performed creditably and earned places of honour in the history of our state.\n\n\u201cI thank our leaders: our dear president H.E. Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR: the national chairman of our great party the APC: Senator Abdullahi Adamu; as well as our presidential candidate for the 2023 general election, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu for this well-deserved victory for our party you supported us to achieve, and which hopefully signals what to expect in Osun State next month and the general elections next year.\n\n\u201cI thank all members of the National Working Committee of our party; I thank the Progressives Governors Forum, and the Chairman of the Ekiti Gubernatorial Campaign Council, H.E. Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, as well as all members of the council, for graciously supporting us to achieve this crucial victory.\u201d\n\nINEC declares\n\nAnnouncing the result Sunday in Ado Ekiti, INEC\u2019s returning officer, Prof Kayode Adebowale, declared Oyebanji winner, having scored the highest number of votes and won more than two-third of the election in 16 local government areas.\n\nOyebanji won 15 of the 16 local government areas, while Kolawole of the PDP won Efon local government area.\n\nThe APC governorship candidate polled an aggregate of 187, 057 votes to lead Oni of the SDP , who came distant second with 82, 209 votes to emerge second, while Kolawole placed third with 67, 457 votes.\n\nThe breakdown of results declared are as follows: Ekiti South-West LG: APC \u2013 9, 679, PDP \u2013 4,474 and SDP \u2013 4,577, Ekti West LG APC -15, 202, PDP \u2013 3,386 and SDP \u2013 3,863, Efon LG APC \u2013 4012, PDP \u2013 6,303 and SDP \u2013 339; IJERO LG APC \u2013 13,754, PDP \u2013 4897 and SDP \u2013 5006\n\n, IKERE LG APC \u2013 12,086,PDP \u2013 3,789 and SDP \u2013 1,943; Ilejemeje LG APC \u2013 4,357, PDP \u2013 1,157 and SDP \u2013 2,344.\n\nIn Irepodun/Ifelodun LG APC \u2013 13,125, PDP \u2013 4,712 and SDP \u2013 5010, Ise/ Orun LG APC \u2013 8,074, PDP \u2013 2,588 and SDP \u2013 5,909, Moba LG APC \u2013 11,609, PDP \u2013 3530 and SDP \u2013 4904.\n\nOye LG APC \u2013 13396, PDP \u2013 4122 and SDP \u2013 3591, Ado LG APC \u2013 23,831, PDP \u2013 7,575 and SDP \u2013 15,214, Ido/Osi LG APC \u2013 10,321, PDP \u2013 2,871 and SDP \u2013 9,489; , Emure LG APC \u2013 7,728, PDP \u2013 2,610 and SDP \u2013 3,445.\n\nIkole LG APC-16,417, PDP \u2013 6,266 and SDP \u2013 5,736, Gbonyin LG APC -11,247, PDP\u20133,947 and SDP \u2013 4,059 while in Ekiti East LG APC \u201312,099, PDP-5,230and SDP- 4,982.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn continued efforts to grow the economy through the mining sector, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite, Thursday, has wooed investors abroad with huge gold, lead-zinc, iron-ore and barite deposits in Nigeria.\n\nAdegbite made the revelations\n\nin his paper titled \u2018The Mechanisms of Transparency and Commitment in Mining Governance as Tool for Attracting Foreign Direct Investment to Nigeria\u2019 on the Nigerian Day at the \u20182022 Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada, PDAC, International Convention, Trade Show and Investors Exchange\u2019 in Toronto, Canada.\n\nHe also assured them of the Buhari-led administration\u2019s resolve to give the best of incentives never found anywhere in the world to interested and serious investors.\n\nHe made it clear that Nigeria\u2019s solid minerals are ranked among the best in quality and quantity as these minerals are rated highest in return on investment, because they are closer to surface and low cost in production.\n\nHe added that the Nigerian Government was seriously focusing on the solid minerals sector, which investors and investments bare top on its priority list as as far as policies are concerned which make the mining sector very business friendly because of mechanisms put in place to promote ease of doing business as this is built on strong policy and regulatory structure is very the years.\n\nMeanwhile, according to him, the robust structure, line by line, was the reason Nigeria has been seeking to attract investment into the sector.\n\nHowever, the Minister acknowledged the the fact that global economies have experienced unprecedented challenges since the break out of COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result the conference is holding in June.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria has been part of this event for several years because of our determination to see exponential growth of the mining sector\u2019s contribution to our GDP more than it has done in the past forty years.\n\n\u201cWe are here to collaborate and network with global leaders, professionals, investors, Chief Executives of junior, mid-tier and major mining companies. It is also on this premise that the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, in collaboration with industry stakeholders, vowed to pull resources and consolidate on the 2016 Roadmap for the Growth and Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry.\n\n\u201cIn pursuit of the goals set forth in the roadmap, the government initiated an ambitious reform regime in the sector, the flagship of which was the National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP, designed to rapidly generate bankable geoscientific data with the aim of de-risking the sector and attracting high caliber investments.\n\n\u201cTarget minerals under the first phase include Gold, Lead-Zinc, Iron Ore, and the Battery Minerals, among others. The contractors have executed and completed the exploration works on Gold, Platinum Group of Elements, PGEs, Lead-Zinc, Iron Ore and Barites.\n\n\u201cCurrently, there is an ongoing review of the Nigerian Minerals and Mining Act 2007, aimed at bringing legislation into conformity with global best practices, limiting the role of government to that of regulation, and creating the space for the private sector to maintain a more expansive presence in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe early evidence that our framework is on the right track is the inflow of notable investments.\n\n\u201cThese include Thor Exploration Limited\u2019s Segilola Gold Mine Project, in Osun State, which has an initial production capacity of 80,000 ounces of gold annually, representing the first large-scale Gold Mine in Nigeria.In June last year, we commissioned the Dukia Gold & Precious Metals Refinery, DGPMR, Project.\n\n\u201cThe company set out to be a foremost indigenous refiner and trader of gold and other precious metals. Its potential impact on the gold sector is nothing short of revolutionary.\n\n\u201cBy providing offtake opportunities through the establishment of Precious Metals Buying Centres, it serves as a spur for more small and medium scale mining investment, while its refinery symbolizes its focus on value addition in the gold and precious metals industry in Nigeria and West Africa.\n\n\u201cA similarly remarkable investment is the integrated Iron Ore Mining and Processing Plant set up by African Natural Resources and Mines Limited (ANRML) in Kaduna, which has an initial production capacity of 4.704 million tons of iron per annum and will scale up to 5.88 million tons per annum by 2025.\n\n\u201cIn line with the economic diversification plan of the Government, my Ministry has issued a Request for Qualifications for bidders interested in receiving concessions to begin the production of bitumen in Nigeria as the country possesses about 42 billion tons of proven reserves of bitumen, estimated to be the sixth largest in the world.\n\n\u201cThese blocks are located close to key ports for export purposes and import of mining equipment, and railways cutting across areas with bitumen deposits.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we seek for suitably qualified investors with pre-requisite experience, technological expertise and financial capacity for the development of bitumen resources in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAdegbite also made it known that, \u201cResults on Greenfields and Brownfields are on process to be declared for investment opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe have also commenced the process of retrieving Nigeria\u2019s colonial geological data from the United Kingdom by engaging the British Geological Survey, BGS, to build a national electronic geo-data archiving management system to be called the Nigerian Geo-Data Center at the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA.\n\n\u201cThis would provide easy access to geoscience data for prospective investors on potential areas to target for exploration and mining within and outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso, he made it known to that there are a lot of incentives enshrined in the Nigeria Minerals and Mining Act, 2007, which include:Customs and import duties waiver for plant, machinery and equipment imported for mining operations; Tax holidays of between three to five years as applicable;Free transferability of funds and permission to retain and use earned foreign exchange;Capital allowances of up to 95% of qualifying capital expenditure; Deductibility of Environmental Costs (money meant for environmental remediation will be tax free); and100% ownership of mineral properties.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, part of our modest efforts towards achieving the desired aim is repositioning the Mining Cadastre Office to promote transparency in mineral title administration.\n\n\u201cThe processes have been streamlined to enable investors to apply online and obtain licenses and leases within and outside Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFrom the revenue drive perspective, the Nigerian Mining Sector has demonstrated a marked improvement despite the challenges of the pandemic. The secret of the sudden jump can be attributed to the introduction of \u201cFirst Come, First Served\u201d and \u201cUse it or Lose it\u201d in the licensing administration,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe further stated that this has helped to re-organize, eliminate speculators, and led to the revocation of about 1,566 mineral titles, activated many dormant licenses and increased revenue inflow into the treasury.",

          "title": "Selling Petrol At N165 Unrealistic, Says IPMAN As Scarcity Hits Lagos",
          "text": "It was one of the unusual days in Lagos on Monday as many residents spent hours waiting on queues in filling stations at various locations in the state.\n\nThis was as a result of the scarcity of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol which affected businesses which depend on the product for power due to the erratic supply of electricity in the country.\n\nSimilarly, the number of commercial vehicles plying the roads was less compared to a regular business day, leaving many passengers stranded at various bus stops.\n\nWhile some were forced to pay extra fares for transportation, others opted to trek to their respective destinations, including offices, markets, and homes.\n\nAmid fears that the scarcity might be a result of industrial action by members of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), the union said it took a decision to go on strike.\n\nIn an interview with Channels Television, the Lagos Zonal Chairman of IPMAN, Akin Akinrinade, explained the rationale behind the fuel scarcity.\n\n\ufeff\n\nAccording to him, the situation across the state is as a result of the operating environment which has become hostile to their businesses.\n\nAkinrinade specifically stated that the petroleum marketers were not on strike as feared but have found it difficult to operate considering the dependence on diesel whose price has skyrocketed.\n\n\u201cMembers of Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria IPMAN have shut down their stations, not because we are striking; we are not on strike,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRather, the business environment has been very hostile to us such that we can no longer do business under this condition. For you to load a litre of petrol, you pay in N162 per litre.\u201d\n\nThe IPMAN official was quick to say the situation had nothing to do with the removal of subsidy or deregulation of the petroleum sector.\n\nHe listed the high cost of buying petrol at the depots, the high cost of diesel for running their station, and the increased cost of freight as the major factors responsible.\n\nAkinrinade stressed that it was no longer feasible to sell the product at the recommended price of N165 to a litre, adding that the landing cost of petrol was between N175 to N178 naira to the litre.\n\n\u201cYou now have to add the cost of transportation which is between N6 to N8, depending on the distance within Lagos,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf it is outside Lagos, it is much more than that.\n\n\u201cSo, if you add N8 to N162, you already have N170 and the government which is the regulator wants us to sell at N165; we have not even added the charges at the depot and the running cost at our stations.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what diesel says now, and you know how epileptic power supply is; we run on generator, using diesel at N800 per litre. There is no station in Lagos that uses less than 50 litres (of diesel) per day.\n\n\u201cSo, our members can no longer sell (petrol) at N165 per litre; in fact, there is no reasonable person in this business that can sell below N180 per litre, so it is not as if we are on strike,\u201d he concluded.",

          "text": "Ukraine\u2019s parliament has voted through two laws that will place severe restrictions on Russian books and music as Kyiv seeks to break many remaining cultural ties between the two countries following Moscow\u2019s invasion.\n\nOne law will forbid the printing of books by Russian citizens, unless they renounce their Russian passport and take Ukrainian citizenship. The ban will only apply to those who held Russian citizenship after the 1991 collapse of Soviet rule.\n\nIt will also ban the commercial import of books printed in Russia, Belarus and occupied Ukrainian territory, while also requiring special permission for the import of books in Russian from any other country.\n\nAnother law will prohibit the playing of music by post-1991 Russian citizens on media and on public transport, while also increasing quotas on Ukrainian-language speech and music content in TV and radio broadcasts.\n\nThe laws need to be signed by president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to take effect, and there is no indication that he opposes either. Both received broad support from across the chamber on Sunday, including from lawmakers who had traditionally been viewed as pro-Kremlin by most of Ukraine\u2019s media and civil society.\n\nUkraine\u2019s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, said he was \u201cglad to welcome\u201d the new restrictions.\n\n\u201cThe laws are designed to help Ukrainian authors share quality content with the widest possible audience, which after the Russian invasion do not accept any Russian creative product on a physical level,\u201d the Ukrainian cabinet\u2019s website quoted him as saying.\n\nThe new rules are the latest chapter in Ukraine\u2019s long path to shedding the legacy of hundreds of years of rule by Moscow.\n\nUkraine says this process, previously referred to as \u201cdecommunisation\u201d but now more often called \u201cderussification\u201d, is necessary to undo centuries of policies aimed at crushing Ukrainian identity.\n\nMoscow disagrees, saying Kyiv\u2019s policies to entrench the Ukrainian language in day-to-day life oppress Ukraine\u2019s large number of Russian speakers, whose rights it claims to be upholding in what it calls its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d.\n\nThis process gained momentum after Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of Crimea and support for separatist proxies in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas, but took on new dimensions after the start of the full-scale invasion on 24 February.\n\nHundreds of locations in Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, have already been earmarked for renaming to shed their associations with Russia, and a Soviet-era monument celebrating the friendship of the Ukrainian and Russian people was torn down in April, eliciting cheers from the assembled crowd.",
