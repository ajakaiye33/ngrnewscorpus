          "text": "The Management of Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company Plc says the Oyo State Government has illegally sealed off its offices following the disconnection of electricity supply to the State Secretariat which also houses the Governor\u2019s Office.\n\nThe electricity distribution company said the state owes it N450 million and it disconnected supply to the State Secretariat over its failure to pay but the company said the state, through its officials, retaliated by sealing its offices over some contrived debts.\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by the Chief Operating Officer, John Ayodele, on Wednesday and made available to our correspondent by the Lead, Media Relations of IBEDC, Busolami Tunwase.\n\nThe company said the state government claimed IBEDC is owing revenue bills and personal income hence the action, but Ayodele said this claim is quite suspicious.\n\nAyodele explained that the company, as part of efforts to get the outstanding paid, initiated several engagements through correspondences and physical meetings, but all these efforts yielded no positive result.\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cThe management of IBEDC hereby informs its esteemed customers of the retaliatory and illegal action of the Oyo State Government over the issue of its huge indebtedness.\n\n\u201cThe Oyo State Government on Wednesday 9 February 2022 commenced the sealing of our offices within the state over some suddenly contrived debts labelled revenue bills and personal income without due notification.\n\n\u201cThis issue of revenue bills and personal income arising now is quite suspicious.\n\n\u201cOyo State Government is owing IBEDC a whooping consumption outstanding of N450 million for over a period of three years.\n\n\u201cNo business in this country can run successfully with such a huge outstanding, the power we distribute to customers must be accounted for and paid for, we have no choice but to disconnect the Oyo State Secretariat, so it is worrisome to see that the government has sealed off our offices with this underhand and arm twisting tactics, instead of paying the debt owed.\n\n\u201cThis was not done in good faith and it would have a damaging effect on the business and service delivery to our customers.\u201d\n\nAyodele appealed to the State Governor, Seyi Makinde, to look into the matter in the interest of all concerned as this would further exacerbate the power challenges and pressure on residents and commercial activities within the state.\n\nHe said IBEDC engages in essential services to the public, and the effect of this arm twisting tactic can at best be imagined if not quickly arrested.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Federal Government says it had recruited 40, 000 police officers in the past four years, in an effort to re-energize and improve the personnel of the force to tackle increasing security challenges in the country.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari disclosed this in his remarks while declaring open a two-day retreat for Senior Police Officers in Uyo, on Tuesday.\n\nBuhari, who was represented by the Minister of Police Affairs, Dr Maigari Dingyadi, said the federal government also granted assent to the Nigerian Police Trust Fund Act and carried out an upward review of salaries and allowances of the rank and file, in a bid to boost the morale of the Force.\n\nHe said that other efforts aimed at improving service delivery in the force initiated by the Federal Government included; the establishment of a Task Force on need assessment of the Nigeria Police headed by Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nHe added that the FG also assented to the Nigerian Police Regulatory Bill 2020 as part of measures to reposition the police force.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cThis administration has prioritised the reform, re-equipment and re-engineering the Nigerian Police, being the lead and most critical agency in the nation\u2019s internal security architecture.\n\n\u201cIndeed, since the commencement of the current democratic journey in 1999, no government had shown so much commitment to the welfare and institutional advancement of the Nigerian Police than the current government of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cThis is evidenced by the Presidential assent that has been granted to the Nigerian Police Trust Fund bill and the promptness with which the Board of Trustees was inaugurated.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the Federal Government also approved the recruitment of 40, 000 police personnel over a period of four years, as a pathway towards addressing the huge manpower gap in policing the nation,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nThe President also commended the National Assembly and the Nigerian Governors Forum, for their support to the Police Force.\n\nHe assured that the federal government would continue to accord priority to efforts aimed at re-engineering and re-equipping the force to tackle increasing and complex security challenges of the country.\n\nEarlier, in his address of welcome, the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba, said the second Conference and Retreat for Senior Police Officers was borne out of the focus of the leadership to emphasize capacity building as a pathway to re-invigorating the Force\u2019s strategic leadership capacity to the optimal enhancement of service delivery.\n\nBaba said the senior police officers would utilize the forum to review the vision, mission and strategies of policing, as laid out following his appointment as the 21st indigenous IGP, as well as to assess the police reform initiatives of the Federal Government and the Force leadership.\n\nAccording to him, any organisation without a vision was bound to fail, so the retreat would align the officers with the current and evolving policing and internal security realities.\n\nThe IGP said the conference would also avail the senior police officers the opportunity to broaden their knowledge on the cutting-edge technology on new policing strategies.\n\n\u201cThe Retreat and Conference for strategic police managers was borne out of our leadership focus which emphasizes capacity building as a pathway to re-invigorating our strategic leadership capacity towards the enhancement of optimal police service delivery.\n\n\u201cIn cognizance of this reality, upon my assumption of the leadership of the Force, I undertook a comprehensive evaluation of our mandate, pattern and trend of crime, capabilities and gaps, expectations of the citizens and the Federal Government, our potentials, and existing strategies.\n\n\u201cThe outcome of this exercise convinced me of the need to commence a Police reform initiative that would be driven by a new policing theme, mission, vision, and strategies.\n\n\u201cHence, I redefined our Policing theme as to \u2018Protect with courage and serve with Compassion\u2019, while our new leadership vision is \u2018to restore police primacy in the internal security architecture of Nigeria.\n\n\u201dJust as we shall deliver to the nation a modernised, citizen-led, rule of law-guided, professional Police Force that Nigerians can truly trust and depend on to achieve the Policing mandate enshrined in Sections 4 and 5 of the Nigeria Police Act, 2020.\n\n\u201cTo achieve this vision, we are focusing on the following missions; Integration of cutting-edge technology and intelligence-led policing model to our operational and investigation functions.\n\n\u201dThis is with a view to strengthening our capacity to stabilise the internal security order, discourage pre-trial detention, and restore public confidence in the Force,\u201d Baba said.\n\nThe IGP said the police would continue to explore all available strategies in guaranteeing security and safety of Nigeria, according to its mandate.\n\nIn his remarks, Gov. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, urged the security agencies to do away with rivalry, collaborate and synergize, so as to ensure an effective and efficient security architecture.\n\nFayemi, who doubles as the Chairman of the Governors\u2019 Forum, advocated for what he described as multi-level policing to ensure efficiency.\n\nHe gave the assurance that the governors were ready at all times to support the police, to enable them to accomplish the task of securing the country.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that the Nigerian governors are ready at all times to support you to enable you to accomplish a safe and secure environment for all Nigerians. I believe that we can achieve this with concerted efforts,\u201d he said.\n\nGov. Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom, in his remarks, urged the participants to evolve more proactive ways of addressing the security challenges in the country, especially as the nation prepared for the general elections next year.\n\nEmmanuel also urged the participants to look into reasons why more young people in the country were involved in criminality now than before, so as to firmly address the menace in order to save the future generation.\n\n\u201cAs we move towards the election year, this Retreat cannot be more timely than now, therefore, it is my belief that the conference will bring out proper solutions, through ideas generation, to address the challenges of the time and for better policing of the country,\u201d Emmanuel said.\n\nHe pledged the state government\u2019s continued support and cooperation to the police and other security agencies in state, in view of their salient roles in states and national security.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the theme of the conference and Retreat was: \u201cThe New Police Vision \u2013 A Road Map for Stabilising Internal Security.\u201d\n\n(NAN)",

          "title": "Withdrawal of petrol with methanol cause of scarcity",
          "text": "From Uche Usim, (Abuja) and Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nAs long queues surfaced across Lagos and Abuja yesterday over sudden fuel scarcity, the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) has blamed the situation on the withdrawal of petrol discovered to have contained methanol above Nigeria\u2019s specification.\n\nAccording to a statement by the agency yesterday, the affected petrol was isolated and withdrawn from the market, including the loaded trucks in transit.\n\nMethanol is a regular additive in petrol and usually blended in an acceptable quantity.\n\nNMDPRA explained that the source supplier has been identified and appropriate actions would be taken.\n\nThe agency said its technical team, in conjunction with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Ltd and other industry stakeholders, would \u201cmonitor and ensure that quality petroleum products are adequately supplied and distributed nationwide.\u201d\n\nIt revealed that the NNPC Ltd and all oil marketing companies had been directed to sustain sufficient distribution of petrol in all retail outlets nationwide.\n\nThe NMDPRA said NNPC had intensified efforts at increasing the supply of petrol into the market \u201cin order to bridge any unforeseen supply gap.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, (IPMAN) has warned motorists against panic buying, saying petroleum products will be available from today.\n\nIts Vice President, Abubakar Maigandi, stated this yesterday as a guest on Arise TV news programme, Newsday. He said: \u201cThe government and the NNPC is (sic) on it. \u201cThere is no way we can sell those contaminated because it will affect motorists. But\u2026car owners should stop panic-buying. By God\u2019s grace, today or tomorrow, the product will be available nationwide.\u201d\n\nHe gave assurance that Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) wasworking seriously to see that they get the correct product so that the marketers wouldcontinue loading.\n\n\u201cAlready, we told all our marketers to stand by the various depots that they are loading. Immediately when we start receiving the uncontaminated products, the products will be available in most of our filling stations nationwide,\u201d he said.\n\nMaigandi did not mention who was to be held responsible for the contaminated petroleum products in circulation. He, however, said \u201cIPMAN buys its product through NNPC and private depots. In every business sometimes, \u201cthere must an issue and this has been already understanding (sic) without many damages,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso IPMAN National Operations Controller, Mr. Mike Osatuyi, disclosed that the contaminated product is being mopped-up, a development that has caused disruption in the distribution chain.\n\n\u2018\u2018The impact is quickly felt in Lagos because of its huge demand and consumption of petrol. Any disruption in the distribution chain is almost an immediate reaction unlike what obtains in other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC is doing its best at this critical time and we believe the effort will yield a positive action soon. I implore Nigerians to be patient and not engage in any form of panic buying,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOther marketers who spoke to Daily Sun in confidence for fear of being sanctioned by the regulator confirmed that there was indeed off-spec petrol in circulation.\n\nThe off-spec or contaminated petrol according to the marketers is petrol laden with graded water and already in the tanks of some major oil marketers which included; Ardova, MRS and Total with independent marketers such as NIPCO also involved.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nThey explained that since NNPC is the sole importer of petrol, they should be held liable and made to explain to Nigerians what happened.\n\nHowever, a reliable source in one of the agencies told Daily Sun that the contaminated petrol came in with some quantity of methanol and ethanol and that when tested, the result came out as being fit for use but when exposed to oxygen, it starts to react. The source added that the exposure to oxygen builds up sludge in the petrol, thus causing damage to car engines.\n\n\u2018\u2018I can confirm to you that we have received reports that this contaminated fuel has caused damage to vehicle engines. That is not in doubt.\n\nShe explained that both NNPC and the Nigerian Midstream Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) are both aware of this development and are taken steps to ensure that the situation is arrested.\n\nThe marketer further told Daily Sun that the volume of the contaminated fuel which made is way into the country is about 200 million litres.\n\nHe said the NNPC has given assurance that it would evacuate the contaminated fuel in the tanks of the affected depots while ensuring that they do not suffer any financial loss, they would be reimbursed for the bad product.\n\n\u2018\u2018For now, we are not loading out trucks until this issue is addressed in the interest of the consumers. This may take up till next week before it gets resolved. The result of fuel shortage is what has now translated to queues in some filling stations. But the truth is that, not all depots/fuel marketers are affected.\n\nMeanwhile, Some petroleum marketers say fuel scarcity will persist in Lagos and other parts of the country until depots are restocked with adequate and quality products.\n\nThe marketers who spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on the condition of anonymity equally blamed the current scarcity on the supply of a wrong specification of petrol in some parts of the country.\n\nThey noted that the directive to withdraw the product from the market even after distribution to many filling stations across Lagos and other areas created a supply shortfall, thereby, leading to panic buying.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd is working to ensure that this disruption to the supply chain is addressed as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cHowever, there is the challenge of logistics and how to compensate those who were supplied with the adulterated products.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC is working with marketers on this and once the depots are restocked, tankers will start loading and supply will improve across the country.\n\n\u201cUntil we are able to achieve this, queues will remain at the petrol stations because of the panic already created,\u2019\u2019 one of the top marketers told NAN.\n\nAn independent petroleum marketer (name withheld) said there had been complaints from some motorists on the fuel quality which made his station to stop selling for now.\n\n\u201cSome independent marketers are not hoarding products as is being alleged. Some of us were affected by the supply we got and we are trying to resolve the situation so that we can continue our business,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

Only a party that is determined to lose will field a northern candidate. You are now a movement of members of political parties coming together. What we stand for is fair and equitable power rotation. The only thing fair is that after eight years in the north, it should come to the south.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cSome of us believe in one Nigeria that\u2019s fair and equitable. We have a reason for it and it can be defended. Some people have argued that the presidency should be based on competence. Are they saying there are no competent ones in the south?\n\n\u201cMy brother governors from the south, all of us are determined. Whosoever we pick, for as long as it is south, we will support him. We are saying the president must come from the south. There are people who merit it in the South-South, South- East, and the South-West.\n\n\u201c I also support your approach. If you are able to mobilise the youths and do not allow the election to be rigged, then we will win. You should also get our women to support us.\u201d\n\nChairman of the movement, Dr. Bitrus, explained to the governor that:\u201cWe are passionate believers that power should rotate in this country and should move from the north to the south. We launched the 40 million ballot movement. That\u2019s the sensitisation of the youth. We launched it for our youths to key in.\n\n\u201cLeaders in the south and middle belt met in Abuja and agreed that power should rotate to the south, that the middle belt and the south should move against any party that fields any candidate outside the southern part of the country.\u201d\n\nOther members of the group were the co-chair, Gen. Collins Ihekire (Rtd) representing Ohaneze Ndigbo; National Organising Secretary of Afenifere, Abagun Kole Omololu; representative of Yoruba Council of Elders, Ayodele Oni; National Publicity Secretary of Afenfere, Jaye Ajayi; National Publicity Secretary of PANDEF, Ken.

Rather it is a bill that will help Nigerians to sufficiently prepare for the humongous task of political leadership.\n\n\u201cThe race for elective offices at both state and national level has become increasingly competitive. While this is good as a tenet of universal suffrage, it can also be counter-productive if people who are not sufficiently prepared educationally get into this elective offices. In this present day, studying up to a university degree anywhere in the world would have afforded any individual certain knowledge, skills and preparedness. A university degree is good place to benchmark the educational qualification into certain political offices. To agree otherwise, will in the long run do our polity and our youths a great disservice,\u201dOnanuga said.\n\nAfter the bill was passed for second reading, the deputy speaker, Idris Wase, who presided over yesterday\u2019s plenary, referred it to the Special Ad-hoc Committee for the Review of the 1999 Constitution( as amended).",

          "text": "\u2022371m litres in six cargoes, not 100m litres of petrol affected\n\n*Regulatory agency admits high sulphur content in contaminated product\n\n\u2022Bad fuel withdrawn from circulation, say independent marketers\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari was said to have yesterday expressed anger over the contaminated petrol in circulation across the country, a development that has disrupted the nation\u2019s fuel supply chain for several days.\n\nThe president was said to have therefore ordered that the Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), Mr. Farouk Ahmed, should be queried immediately.\n\nBuhari, who was said to be visibly worried over the situation, leading to the return of long fuel queues in parts of the country, especially in Abuja, Lagos, Ogun, Port Harcourt and others, instructed the Minister of State, Petroleum, Mr. Timipre Sylva, to ask Ahmed to explain how the product came into the country.\n\nAn impeccable presidency source told THISDAY that Buhari felt that the first point to begin to unravel how the product came into the country and invariably began circulating should be the agency, which by law acts as the \u201cpolice\u201d of the downstream and midstream sector.\n\nThe Authority was created in August 2021 in line with the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) and encompasses a merger of three defunct regulatory agencies: Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA), Petroleum Equalisation Fund (Management) Board (PEFMB), and the Midstream and Downstream Divisions of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR).\n\nIt is responsible for the regulation of the midstream and downstream petroleum operations in Nigeria which includes technical, operational, and commercial activities.\n\nAccording to the source, who asked not be named, the minister who was at the Presidential Villa to brief the president, following the growing outrage over the issue, was directed to, in a short while, send the query to the CEO of the agency.\n\n\u201cThis matter has become an embarrassment to this government. There\u2019s no question that these cargoes of petrol were bad, so he (Ahmed) is being queried over how the fuel came into the country and the president has so instructed,\u201d the presidency source explained.\n\nWhen THISDAY sought to know why the midstream/downstream should be issued a query while the likely importer, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) was seemingly being let off the hook, the source said while investigations were ongoing, the response of the agency would determine which other government agency or private individuals would be sanctioned.\n\n\u201cThe reason the midstream/downstream authority is being queried first is that for now the bulk stops at its desk. They are the first port of call. Ordinarily, they are expected to know how it came into the country.\n\n\u201cThis is because they are the police of the industry. How did it get past them into circulation? It is their job to know. They are the police which should stop bad fuel from coming into the country.\n\n\u201cSo, the NNPC has not been queried for now. The question now is who certified the product clean enough to come into the country?\n\n\u201cWhen the investigation is done, then the federal government will know where the blame lies, but for now, the NNPC is just a company and doesn\u2019t necessarily owe allegiance to government as it were, because it\u2019s now just like every other company with a profit motive.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand the authority is the regulator, they are supposed to flag any adulterated product so that it doesn\u2019t come into the country. For now , the question the government is asking is: How did it come into the country. Who gave the permission or go-ahead? That is the question for now, then other steps will follow.\n\n\u201cIt is on the basis of that the presidency can then apportion blames and sanction other culpable operators accordingly,\u201d the presidency source added.\n\nAccording to the source, the affected volume of products in circulation was more than the 100 million litres being bandied about, adding that it came in six cargoes.\n\n\u201cThe actual figure is 317 million litres that came in six cargoes. So, the argument that it is isolated does not hold water,\u201d the source alleged.\n\nThe current problematic supply of petrol has for days grounded movement in Abuja, Lagos and some other parts of the country, made worse by the shortage of inventory released from the sole importer, the NNPC.\n\nThe prevailing condition has ensured that in Abuja, especially, a majority of filling stations were shut even as motorists spent hours in the sun struggling to buy from the few that were open, causing serious traffic jams in parts of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThe particular cargoes with the issue were said to have high sulphur content, while marketers have been advised not to sell to consumers.\n\nIn addition, it was learnt that the queues returned partly because the gap which existed when depot owners started hoarding products before the announcement of retention of subsidy by the federal government had not smoothened.\n\nThis has challenged the lifting of products to, especially Abuja and other parts of the north from Lagos, THISDAY gathered.\n\nIn a statement on the matter yesterday, the Authority admitted that \u201climited quantity of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), commonly known as petrol, with methanol quantities above Nigeria\u2019s specification was discovered in the supply chain.\u201d\n\nWhile stressing that methanol is a regular additive in petrol and usually blended in an acceptable quantity, the NMDPRA stated that to ensure vehicular and equipment safety, the limited quantity of the impacted product has been isolated and withdrawn from the market, including the loaded trucks in transit.\n\n\u201cOur technical team in conjunction with NNPC Ltd and other industry stakeholders, will continue to monitor and ensure quality petroleum products are adequately supplied and distributed nationwide,\u201d it added.\n\nAccording to the agency, the \u201csource supplier\u201d has been identified and further commercial and appropriate actions shall be taken by the Authority and NNPC Ltd.\n\nIn addition, it noted that the NNPC Ltd and all oil marketing companies had been directed to sustain sufficient distribution of petrol in all retail outlets nationwide.\n\nSubsequently, the NDMPRA stated that the NNPC has intensified efforts at increasing the supply of the product into the market in order to bridge any unforeseen supply gap.\n\nMeanwhile, in separate interviews on Arise Television, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, National President of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Mr. Chinedu Okoronkwo and the Vice President of the union, Mr. Abubakar Maigandi, confirmed that the bad products were being withdrawn from circulation.\n\nWhile trying to play down the seriousness of the situation, Okoronkwo who absolved his members of any complicity in the matter, noted that \u201cin any given situation, business-wise, sometimes you might have ups and downs\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis time, we must let the world know that the Independent Marketers Association of Nigeria has never been part of any scarcity or whatever you may call it.\n\n\u201cOur own duty is to ensure that we get products and take to our station and retail to the masses. So moving forward, on the issue of this contaminated product, it is no more a hidden thing, but we have got an assurance from the NNPC that the fuel has been removed.\n\n\u201cAnd they have brought in new one now that we are now using. You know any ripples in the system for one or two days might exaggerate (extend) into one week,\u201d he posited.\n\nAccording to him, the hope was that the national oil company has now gotten its act together and had taken inventory of the contaminated product which had been withdrawn from circulation.\n\nHe argued that the complaints of vehicles breaking down had markedly subsided, meaning that good product was now in circulation, reassuring that the situation will normalise in days.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the market, you know that people are still buying now, which means the good one is coming into the system,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso in his remarks, Maigandi assured that: \u201cBy God\u2019s grace, today or tomorrow, the product will be available nationwide.\u201d\n\nOn the source of the bad fuel, he said: \u201cAll the marketers as you know, heavily depend on the NNPC. So we buy this product through the NNPC and private depots.\n\n\u201cThat is the source of our getting this product. But, you know, in every business, sometimes there must be an issue. And this issue has already been understood without much damage.\n\n\u201cAnd NNPC is working seriously to see that they get the correct product so that the marketers will continue loading. Already, we have told all our marketers to stand by and we have started receiving decontaminated products.\n\n\u201c You will see that the product will be available in most of our filling station nationwide. Normally we take precautionary measures immediately we bring the product into our filling stations,\u201d he explained.\n\nA day earlier, the South-West Zonal Chairman of IPMAN, Mr. Dele Tajudeen, had lamented that members of the association had suffered severe losses and may ask for damages from the authorities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says legal interpretations must bow to people\u2019s wish\n\n\u2022Cites Zamfara\u2019s case in 2019 polls\n\n\u2022Visits Hanifa\u2019s family in Kano, prays for the repose of her soul\n\nBy Ibrahim Shuaibu\n\n\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday, expressed worry about judicial interventions in election matters, concurring with rising calls for interrogation of the role of the judiciary, especially, the Supreme Court, in electoral issues, specifically, whether it has not been exceeding its remits.\n\nOsinbajo spoke at the 53rd Conference of the National Association of Law Teachers, held at Bayero University, Kano (BUK). The conference had the theme, \u201cLaw, Democracy and the Electoral Process.\u201d\n\nThe vice president said legal interpretation must always bow to the wish of the people, citing what he viewed as the unfortunate outcome of the 2019 elections in Zamfara State.\n\nOsinbajo visited the family of the five-year-old Hanifa Abubakar, who was killed by proprietor of Nobel Kids Academy, Kwanar Dakata, Nasarawa Local Government Area of the state, Abdulmalik Tanko. He condoled with the family and prayed God to give them the courage to bear the painful passing of their daughter.\n\nDelivering his lecture at the conference, Osinbajo insisted that appropriate interpretation of the law should always bow to the will of the electorate, because the idea of democracy was for the people to determine their leaders.\n\nCiting the 2019 elections in Zamfara State, he said, \u201cThe decision of the Supreme Court in the case of APC and Marafa, and that is a case, where the Supreme Court nullified the elections of all candidates of the APC and gave judgement in favour of the party, who were resoundingly defeated in the same election.\n\n\u201cIn that election in 2019, the trouble at the Supreme Court game was that the APC primaries that produced candidates that were voted for were invalid.\n\n\u201cAnd without recourse to the elections that had in the polls rejected all the other candidates in the other political parties, the Supreme Court declared candidates of parties other than the APC as winners of the various offices that were contested, as winners in that February 23rd and March 15 general election.\n\n\u201cThe court held that the APC votes cast by the Zamfara State electorate to select their preferred candidate to governor, senators, members of the House of Representatives, members of the House of Assembly were all, and I quote, \u2018wasted votes\u2019. Why? Because according to the court, APC did not conduct any valid primary elections and as such, had no candidates for any elections in the state.\n\n\u201cSo, here is a situation, where the party that lost every seat, from governorship to House of Assembly, was given all those seats on judicial pronouncements. For the voter, this decision must have at best been puzzling.\n\n\u201cFirst, the voter had no idea that the candidates of their preferred party were disqualified before voting. Indeed, at least, one court had declared the primaries valid and it was on that basis that INEC gave the go-ahead to the candidates to contest.\n\n\u201cSecondly, rather than giving seats to those that the electorate have rejected, ordering a rerun would probably have yielded a fairer result in the opinion of many of those, who went to the polls on that day. And I agree with my brother A.B Mahmoud SAN, that there is a real issue of whether the courts have not assumed a larger duty in election cases than was constitutionally intended.\u201d\n\nThe vice president, who maintained that the judiciary remained the pillar of democracy, said, \u201cIn other words, are our courts going beyond constitutional expectations in election cases? And it is important to emphasise this, because the whole idea of democracy is that the people determine who their leaders will be, the law, electoral processes \u2013 everything must bow to the will of the people.\u201d\n\nRecalling his teaching experience at the University of Lagos in 1981 as Lecturer II, with a salary of N620, Osinbajo, who is believed to be nursing presidential ambition, reiterated, \u201cThe appropriate interpretation must always bow to the will of the people. I am certain that these views will add to the deliberations at the conference.\u201d\n\nWhile declaring the conference opened earlier, Prof. Osinbajo noted that democracy and social justice are closely linked, in his prepared speech titled; The pursuit of Justice is What Helps Build a Good Society, Osinbajo stated that the cornerstone of democracy is the insistence that \u201cour society must be governed by the rule of law and not the whim of man.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs law teachers and legal practitioners, we are custodians of this truth. However, democracy cannot endure without social justice,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cthe pursuit of justice lies at the heart of the quest for the good of society.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThis makes the legal profession one of the cardinal vocations upon which civilization rests. Indeed, law is an instrument of pacific social engineering, the end of which is justice. When it is rooted in this postulate, it follows that the law and therefore democracy, are meant to serve beneficial social ends.\u201d\n\nAccording to the VP, \u201ca society in which an increasing number of people consider themselves alienated from legal institutions or perceive these legal institutions to be incapable of delivering justice for all cannot be stable and prosperous.\u201d\n\nWithout social justice, legal justice is ultimately unattainable, Prof. Osinbajo stated, adding that \u201cour idea of social justice also refers to the social and economic rights of the people.\u201d\n\nHe said these rights, according to the Constitution, include the right to food, shelter, employment, education and a reasonable national minimum living wage, care for the elderly, pensions, unemployment benefits and welfare for the physically challenged.\n\n\u201cThe degree to which citizens are in possession of their social and economic rights has a direct impact on the degree of their access to legal services and, thence, to justice. Our concern as teachers and practitioners of the law, therefore, must extend beyond the courtroom, beyond the precincts of our legal institutions, to the social reality in which these structures exist.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on government\u2019s role in ensuring growth of democracy and social justice in society, the Vice President noted that \u201cthe principle of the dignity of the human person implies that governments must be considerate, egalitarian and universal in the sense that they must serve everyone.\u201d\n\nAgain, he stated that this cardinal principle was a major reason for the Federal Government\u2019s Social Investment Programmes.\n\nThe VP said the Administration will continue to ramp up its efforts in social welfare and expanding universal health insurance to ensure \u201cthat our most vulnerable citizens are not abandoned to the vicissitudes of fate.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on the essence of democracy and the need to preserve democratic institutions in Nigeria and other parts of Africa, the Vice President noted that even as Nigeria has enjoyed 22 years of unbroken democracy, the country is still a young democracy.\n\n\u201cWe have witnessed a series of peaceful transitions of power. This is a huge credit to the democratic sensibilities of our people. Along the way, we are learning valuable lessons that can only make us better practitioners of liberty.\n\n\u201cMany of our institutions are still in their infancy, and we must carefully guide them into maturity. We recognize that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance,\u201d Prof. Osinbajo observed.\n\nHe noted that the Electoral Bill now in process is testament to the Administration\u2019s commitment towards improving Nigeria\u2019s electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe Bill itself has been the subject of robust engagement between the government and civil society. While some have expressed reservations about the time it is taking to enact the new law, we should remember that a truly inclusive democratic, deliberative process often takes time. I am confident that the legislation that emerges will be one that reflects a broad consensus between all the stakeholders,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Vice President added that \u201cwhile INEC continues to improve its capacity to conduct credible elections, particularly through the deployment of technology; we recognize that democracy is about much more than voting. It is also about constitutionalism, rule of law and respect for civil liberties. We must diligently work to uphold these principles.\n\n\u201cOur progress as a democracy must therefore also be prosecuted in terms of the struggle to reduce the basic problems of ill-health, malnutrition, illiteracy, and famine which daily afflict our people. Where social and economic rights are unsecured, people are unable to fully maximize their civil and political rights.\u201d\n\nIn his own speech, Governor Abdullahi Ganduje commended members of the judiciary for organising the conference at Bayero University, Kano, which focused on the role of the judiciary in the development of democracy across the country.\n\nOsinbajo, who used the opportunity of his engagement in Kano to visit Hanifa\u2019s family, condoled with the girl\u2019s parents. Ganduje and other government officials accompanied Osinbajo on the condolence visit.\n\nHanifa was kidnapped last December by her school proprietor, Tanko, who later killed her and buried her in the school compound. He is currently standing trial along with two other suspects at a Kano court on a four-count charge. Tanko was arrested while trying to collect part of a ransom he had negotiated after killing Hanifa.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022US, UK oppose move\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report\n\nThe Nigerian government is locked in a court battle with Britain\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA) over control of \u20ac180 million (\u00a3150 million) that was stashed abroad by Nigeria\u2019s former Head of State, late Gen. Sani Abacha.\n\nBy yesterday\u2019s official exchange rate of the British Pounds Sterling at N563, as seen on the website of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the money in contention is about N84.5 billion.\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s The Telegraph reported that the case was again poised to spark fresh questions about dirty money flowing through the City of London.\n\nIn the latest legal tussle over the money, generally known in Nigeria as \u201cAbacha loot\u201d, the report stated that Nigeria wanted the crime-fighting agency, NCA, to release funds that it froze at the request of US authorities.\n\nIn May 2020, the federal government confirmed the receipt of $311 million looted by a late dictator, Abacha, repatriated from the United States and Island of Jersey.\n\nAccording to Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, \u201cThe amount increased significantly from over $308 million to over $311 million because of the interest that accrued from February 3, 2020, to 28th April, 2020, when the fund was transferred to the CBN.\u201d\n\nIt came after the recovery of $322 million from Switzerland in 2018.\n\nAt the time, Malami noted that the government had committed that the asset would support and assist in expediting the construction of three major infrastructure projects across Nigeria, namely, Lagos \u2013 Ibadan Expressway, Abuja \u2013 Kano Road, and Second Niger Bridge.\n\nIt was estimated that from 2007 to 2020, about $1.5 billion had been returned to Nigeria from different parts of the world.\n\nAccording to the latest report, American prosecutors said the money could be traced back to a suspected $2.2 billion (\u00a31.6 billion) or more that was plundered by Abacha and his associates during the dictator\u2019s five-year reign.\n\nIn the complex issues surrounding the repatriation of the funds, the authorities in the US sought to return the money to \u201cthe people of Nigeria\u201d, under the so-called Kleptocracy Initiative.\n\nBut the Nigerian government was said have sought to \u201csidestep\u201d the process and obtain the funds directly through an application to the High Court, in a move opposed by UK and US authorities, documents seen by The Telegraph and SourceMaterial showed.\n\nAlthough Abacha died more than 20 years ago, the piles of treasure he looted from Nigerian coffers have kept cropping up, with at least $2 billion being thought to have stolen during his five years in power.\n\nThe former dictator\u2019s spoils have been linked to dozens of offshore bank accounts over the years, as investigators unravel the intricate web he and his associates spun across the globe.\n\nBritish and American authorities have been locked in talks over tens of millions of pounds of cash that investigators say can be traced to Abacha\u2019s plundering, the investigation found.\n\nThe case, which involves a serving Nigerian politician who was one of Abacha\u2019s top henchmen, includes cash in British bank accounts that has been frozen by the National Crime Agency.\n\nHowever, the Nigerian government has brought its own legal action against the NCA in a bid to end the tussle, it has emerged.\n\nThe report stated, \u201cIt is a complicated story with many twists and turns. But the on-going struggle for \u2018Abacha\u2019s loot\u2019 reveals the difficulty in recovering stolen funds, the frustrations of law enforcement, and the way people accused of corruption have relied on respectable law firms to argue their cases in court.\u201d\n\nOn the modus operandi used by Abachi to execute the looting, the report stated that after seizing power in a 1993 coup, Abacha set about using his position as Nigeria\u2019s head of state to place himself above the law and skim vast sums of money from the oil-rich nation.\n\nIn perhaps the most brazen example, he would tell advisers to make spurious requests to him for money to deal with national \u201cemergencies\u201d, according to US court documents.\n\nSigned letters would then be sent to the CBN, which would provide cash, travellers\u2019 cheques or arrange a wire transfer.\n\nThe report added, \u201cMoney was stuffed into boxes or bags and transported to Abacha\u2019s house, before associates arranged for it to be sent abroad.\n\n\u201cAt least $2 billion is thought to have been stolen this way, using more than 60 letters to the central bank.\n\n\u201cAbacha also arranged for the government to sell bonds to a company controlled by his allies before buying them back at vastly inflated prices, generating an illicit windfall of $282 million.\u201d\n\nSeparately, the report stated that Abacha and his associates extorted French engineering firm, Dumez Group, of $97 million and used his spoils to live a luxurious lifestyle.\n\n\u201cInside his many sprawling homes, he kept piles of glittering jewellery, including gold necklaces and rings, and at one stage as much as $100 million in cash,\u201d the report noted.\n\nHowever, the money Abacha and his associates plundered became the subject of an international search after the dictator\u2019s sudden death in 1998, aged 54.\n\nThe report stated that weeks after his death, Abacha\u2019s widow was caught trying to flee the country with 38 suitcases packed with money and his family later forfeited nearly $1 billion.\n\n\u201cYet the only clues hinting at where other stashes of money could be found were a few details of secret offshore bank accounts discovered by authorities,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cSince then, the Nigerians have sought foreign help to recover as much as possible, with more than $1 billion eventually returned from Switzerland alone,\u201d it added.\n\nThe effort has been hampered by the sheer complexity of Abacha\u2019s dealings as well as marathon legal battles that have dragged on for years, some involving former associates.\n\nOne of the remaining cases, brought by US prosecutors, aims to recover more than $480 million, the report stressed. In just one example of the web of transactions criss-crossing the globe, they outlined in court filings how money was laundered by Abacha and his associates through bank accounts in Lagos, London, New York, Paris, Zurich, and Geneva.\n\nThe assets were stashed in banks, including Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and Banque SBA, according to the lawsuit, although there was no suggestion that the banks were involved in any wrongdoing.\n\nThe Telegraph stated, \u201cThis legal action eventually resulted in a 2020 deal to repatriate about $321 million, which had been laundered through the US banking system and then held in accounts in Jersey under the name of Doraville Properties Corporation, a British Virgin Islands company, and Abacha\u2019s son, Mohammed.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the new development comes as Britain fights claims that it has been very tolerant of dirty money flowing through the City of London.\n\nUS officials said last month that they were concerned that deep links between the UK and several Russian oligarchs meant that sanctions issued against Moscow if it invades Ukraine could be rendered ineffective.\n\nLast Sunday, Briish Labour MP David Lammy accused ministers of doing too little to deal with corruption in Britain.\n\nLammy said, \u201cWe have to fix the dirty money problem we have, this huge problem of money laundering in London, of corruption and fraud.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much that (ministers) are not doing. Joe Biden knows it and he\u2019s concerned.\u201d\n\nBut simultaneously, another court tussle in the UK is happening in parallel. At stake is more than \u20ac90 million, some of which came from Abacha\u2019s security votes fraud, according to a High Court judgement issued in 2014.\n\nThe money is said to be controlled by a Singapore-based trust set up for the benefit of the family of Abubakar Bagudu, the serving governor of Kebbi State, who is accused of playing an \u201cinstrumental role\u201d in many of Abacha\u2019s corrupt schemes by US prosecutors.\n\nBagudu has always denied any wrongdoing. His office did not respond to a request for comment, the report said.\n\nHis brother, Ibrahim, is a director of two companies known as Blue Holdings that are owned by the Singapore trust.\n\nAccording to the Pandora Papers, a leaked cache of documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists last year, the Bagudu brothers enlisted Farrer & Co, an elite London law firm that has advised the Queen, to help them set up these businesses.\n\nThey moved \u20ac98 million from a British Virgin Islands trust to a new structure spanning Singapore and the Cook Islands.\n\nFarrer & Co said it carried out \u201cextensive due diligence\u201d on Bagudu and that it obtained approval from the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), the precursor to the NCA, to move the funds.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the case, the amount controlled by the Singapore trust may now have grown to as much as \u20ac180 million. It is kept in accounts at Waverton Investment Management and James Hambro & Partners, both based in London.\n\nThe NCA has been working with American authorities in a bid to confiscate the funds and return them to \u201cthe people of Nigeria,\u201d the report stated.\n\nHowever, the Nigerian government wants them to be returned directly to the country and the parties, including lawyers for Bagudu, have been holding negotiations about a possible settlement, court filings in the US show.\n\nBagudu struck a deal with the Nigerian government in 2003, in which he agreed to return a sum of money but made no admission of wrongdoing, and the agreement was reaffirmed by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in 2018. What this means, according to the report, is that almost 70 per cent of the UK money could be handed to Bagudu if returned.\n\nCourt filings showed the Nigerian government subsequently sought to unlock the funds and repatriate them in legal action against the NCA \u2013 a move that was opposed by the UK and US.\n\nThe country hired Kingsley Napley, the London law firm famed for representing a host of celebrities, including Rebekah Vardy, to represent it. The firm and the NCA both declined to comment, the report noted.\n\nThe report quoted Spotlight on Corruption, a non-profit campaign group, as saying that the case raises questions about whether, \u201claw enforcement is being paid and resourced enough to get its act together\u201d.\n\nIt accused the NCA of having effectively \u201ccleaned\u201d the money by approving the transfer to Singapore and warned against returning cash to Bagudu.\n\nHowever, Jonathan Benton, a former NCA senior detective who now runs consultancy Intelligent Sanctuary, said the case also underlined the sheer complexity of efforts to reclaim Abacha\u2019s loot.\n\nBenton stated, \u201cI care passionately about tackling corruption and it is important we hold people to account.\n\n\u201cBut it can be a challenging and drawn-out process and sometimes you have to be pragmatic. In those situations, the law allows you to negotiate. It is repugnant. But Nigeria desperately needs the money that Abacha stole.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "After more than five years in operation, Meta has announced it\u2019s shutting down Express Wi-Fi, a program designed to provide low-cost internet in developing countries through partnerships with local communities, mobile operators and businesses.\n\nThe shut down of Express Wi-Fi comes barely a year after Meta partnered with Eutelsat Konnect, a satellite operator, to expand the low-cost internet service in parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Zambia, Cameroon, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, South Africa and Uganda.\n\nNotably, in countries like Kenya, Express Wi-Fi has been unavailable since mid-December 2020. The service is currently active in over 30 countries across Africa, Asia and South America. Similar to this announcement, about a year ago, Google shut down project Loon, one of it\u2019s low-cost internet projects active in Kenya. A move that made people question the fate of internet projects in Africa by big corporations.\n\nLaunched in 2016, Express Wi-Fi program was designed as an improvement to Meta\u2019s earlier failed Free Basics program. It was designed to be inexpensive, starting at around 15 cents for 100MB or $5 for 20GB.\n\nMeta said that while it\u2019s winding down Express Wi-Fi, it\u2019s focusing on other projects around internet access.\n\n\u201cWhile we are concluding our work on this program to focus on developing other projects, we remain committed to working with partners across the telecom ecosystem to deliver better connectivity,\u201d a Meta spokesperson said in a statement. It promised to work with Express Wi-Fi partners to \u201cminimize the impact to their businesses while keeping networks running.\u201d\n\nThe company first revealed its plans to build a 37,000-kilometer subsea cable, named 2Africa, in May 2020, and it announced an expansion in 2021, which is expected to be completed in 2023 or 2024.\n\nMeta\u2019s different initiatives are part of its efforts to bridge the internet gap across emerging markets like Africa, where connectivity is lowest across the globe. Currently about 28% of sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s population is connected to mobile internet according to the 2021 GSMA mobile economy report. The end of Express Wi-Fi program signals a change in Meta\u2019s approach to delivering low-cost internet across Africa.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Paris-born Nigerian singer, Asa, was recently announced the Spotify EQUAL Global Music Programme ambassador for the month of February.\n\nIn April 2021, months after it expanded to 38 African countries, Spotify launched the Spotify EQUAL Music Programme in commemoration of International Women\u2019s Day. According to Spotify, the programme\u2014which consists of highlighted playlists created and marketed by Spotify\u2014was launched to highlight women creators on its platform and work towards equity for women in the audio industry.\n\nGlobally, charts are often dominated by male performers. From 2017 to 2019, for example, Hypebot reports that only 21% of performers on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 were women. Apple Music and Spotify, during the same period, had even less, with female performers representing only 19% of charts. In 2018, at Spotify\u2019s 10th-year anniversary, only 2 women\u2014Rihanna and Ariana Grande\u2014made the 10-year streaming charts. Critics have also commented on how the most visible and high-ranking playlists on Spotify are male-dominated. More recently, Spotify itself funded research that showed only 1 in 5 artistes on the charts are women. This research helped fuel the drive for its EQUAL Global Music Programme.\n\nSince its launch, the programme has curated 17 playlists featuring female artistes all over the globe. The EQUAL Africa playlist\u2014which has over 70,000 likes\u2014 has 50 songs from female artistes from all over the continent. This includes songs from Ghana-born singer, Gyakie, who has had over 13.5 million streams on Spotify, Nigeria\u2019s Ayra Starr who recently hit 1 million streams on the platform, Zambia\u2019s Titose, Morocco\u2019s Rhita Nattah, and Botswana\u2019s Sebina.\n\nAsa, who has over 375,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, is the latest on the list. Her recently released track, Mayana, will lead the EQUAL Africa playlist and also feature on the EQUAL Global playlist. Mayana already has over 560,000 streams on Spotify, and the addition to EQUAL playlists will boost it further.\n\nSpeaking about her selection, the singer said, \u201cI\u2019m honoured to be the Spotify EQUAL ambassador of the month. It\u2019s great to be part of something like this\u2014a movement that\u2019s new yet has always been. It\u2019s beautiful when we are celebrated and recognised for contributions to music and art over the years. In the lead-up to the release of my album \u2018V\u2019, this is awesome.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What\u2019s it like building in unpopular sectors?",
          "text": "Building a successful business in an unpopular sector is difficult globally, especially in Africa. In such sectors, there are almost no supporting communities and infrastructure to leverage for growth. So, founders interested in such sectors would have to build from scratch.\n\nBut, regardless of how difficult it is to build in Africa, some people have done it and are still doing it. Now the question is, how?\n\nOn January 22, 2021, Daniel Adeyemi, Senior Reporter at TechCabal, spoke with Judith Okonkwo, founder/CEO at Imisi 3D and one of the outliers who have built a successful venture in a sector that\u2019s not hugely celebrated, to answer this question, during the second episode of Building From Ground Up, Season 2 by the UK-Nigeria Tech Hub.\n\nImisi 3D, an Extended Reality (XR) creation lab that focuses on building the African XR ecosystem in Nigeria and beyond, was founded in 2017 in Lagos, Nigeria. And its core mission is to groom and grow a community of African AR/VR creators, create solutions using AR/VR, and provide educational and engagement experiences with AR/VR.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA slow lonely road\n\nJudith Okonwo, whose career spans 22 years across many industries and continents, comes from a business psychology background. When she founded Imisi 3D, some people thought her decision was ambitious, others thought it was silly. But 5 years on, Imisi3D is not only a successful venture, it has placed Nigeria and Africa in the global XR conversation.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to build an XR ecosystem and nobody was really seeing why such a thing should exist. It\u2019s a crazy idea,\u201d said Okonkwo. Regardless of which sector one\u2019s building, the early days are usually lonely and filled with trial and errors in product iterations and product-market fit.\n\nSeek knowledge and leveraging your network\n\nHaving in-depth knowledge about a business will make the building less strenuous. However, in a case where you don\u2019t know much about the territory, the best thing to do is to put yourself out there to seek real-life knowledge on how your solution will solve real-life problems. According to Okonkwo, the best way to keep your leg on the ground is by talking to people and asking for help when you need it.\n\n\u201cComing from my background, the first thing I needed to do was to learn, aggressively,\u201d said Okonkwo who is also a founding director of AR/VR Africa.\n\nAfter gaining knowledge, the next thing is to leverage your network for support. Remember the territory is unpopular with almost no existing infrastructural support, so your best chance at success lies with people.\n\nSell the vision clearly to your people\n\nNow that things are getting better and people are less dismissive of your \u201ccrazy\u201d idea, setting a clear goal that puts everybody on the same page is important. For Okonkwo, the vision was clear: an impact-driven venture that would create an advanced and thriving XR ecosystem across Africa, starting from Nigeria.\n\nOkonkwo said Imisi 3D got its first lab at CcHub because she was speaking to everybody that cared to listen\u2014sharing what the success of their venture would mean to the country and Africa at large. Having helped Andela launch, Okonkwo was exposed to the possibility of what Africa\u2019s young people could build when given a platform, so quickly defined her vision to do what Andela was doing but for XR.\n\n\u201cOur mission and goal is specific and written on the wall. It\u2019s important because we could see that XR is one future of computer, and we must be involved now if we want to be part of that future,\u201d Okonkwo said about the vision of Imisi3D.\n\nThe arrival of mass acceptance\n\nEntrepreneurs in unpopular territories are outliers; they are people who can project and see what the future holds and decide to build for that future. Although XR is as old as a century, it wasn\u2019t until recently that innovators started to think about commercialising this technology for the mass market.\n\nToday, there\u2019s a massive acceptance of the XR sector owning to the numerous conversation around blockchain and the metaverse, which is essentially a digital world powered by virtual reality. The buzz started in 2014 when Facebook acquired then 2-year-old Oculus for $2 billion to power its metaverse ambition. Last year Facebook rebranded as Meta, thus becoming a full XR company. Similarly, Apple also bought Space and NextVR, two different XR companies, to power its own metaverse ambition. In fact, almost all the big tech giants now understand the role XR will play in the future and are buying into it.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are now interested in the sector, it\u2019s no longer a crazy idea to want to build in this space,\u201d said Okonkwo. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a good thing, more people means more innovation and investment.\u201d For Okonkwo and her team, the future of computers has always been XR, from the beginning of their foray into the sector; the rest of us are only just joining in.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

By this time, you\u2019ve definitely seen enough valentine packages to last you a lifetime. My sincere condolences if you have no boo. My thoughts are with you, comrade.\n\nIn today\u2019s episode of Techpoint Digest, we\u2019ll be discussing an African robotics company, handling funeral arrangements with tech, and the rise of NFT theft.\n\nSolving African problems with robotics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating the Kalibotics Chessbot\n\nEveryone and their two-year-old niece is building a fintech startup, and I can\u2019t blame them. Investors are more willing to sign cheques for these companies than any other sector in Africa. However, other startups are building exciting tech solutions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKalibotics is a Nigerian robotics startup building products for the edtech, e-waste management, and agritech industries. Founded by a sibling duo, Olugbenga and Mayowa Abejirin, some of the startup\u2019s projects include a robotic arm that can make a cup of tea and an AI Chessbot (Tunde Onakoya, come outside).\n\nSince its launch, the company has attracted funding from various organisations, including Nigerian vice president, Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s March 8TH Initiative and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole sat down to chat with the co-founders to learn what it takes to build a robotics startup in Africa.

Source: Techbuild\n\nIn Africa, the death of a loved one is a significant event. Unlike most parts of the world, where funeral services can be completed in a day, funerals in Africa are likely to last several days, especially when the deceased is quite old.\n\nWith these festivities come huge expenses, and you\u2019ll be forgiven for mistaking a funeral procession for a bridal party. We don\u2019t do small funerals here. Due to this, in addition to the emotional stress of losing a loved one, the bereaved have to deal with logistics and financial difficulties.\n\nIn the past, that help was gotten from friends and family, but a startup wants to help people give their loved ones a befitting burial. Unsurprisingly, the startup \u2013 Sokna \u2013 is based in the country that gave us the Pharaohs and mummies \u2013 Egypt.\n\nNow to the surprise: The startup has recently raised $1m from investors in a seed round. Yes, you read that right. $1 million to help people bury the dead. Some investors include senior executives from Google, Facebook, and Twitter. In addition, Mentors Fund, SBX Capital, and ACE & Company participated.\n\nThe startup, which was launched in late 2020, has reportedly tripled in size in the last year, with over 50 full-time employees performing more than 2,500 funerals. Sokna offers services like cemetery set up, body preparation, repatriation, obituaries, and transportation to its customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCan NFT theft be stopped?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpeanSea: NFT marketplace\n\nSometimes, I feel that tech creates as many problems as it solves. Take social media, for example. While it has led to a more connected world and contributed to advocacy, it has also fuelled misinformation and online bullying.\n\nNFTs are the latest casualties. In 2021, the marketplace for NFTs grew to $22 billion. With the bank-breaking amounts they are sold for, it\u2019s perhaps not such a surprise that people began to pass off other people\u2019s art as NFTs.\n\nAja Trier, a digital artist, woke up on January 4 to her art being turned into not one but nearly 86,000 NFTs. But she\u2019s not alone. Lois van Baarle, a Dutch artist, also found more than 100 pieces of her art for sale as NFTs.\n\nArtists have received help taking down these stolen art from DeviantArt, an online art platform that notifies users of copyright infringement. However, the artists have to get it done themselves. For most artists, the process can be overwhelming as NFT platforms are not very responsive. Consequently, NFTTheft \u2014 a collective of artists highlighting fraudulent listings \u2014 has resorted to publicly shaming the marketplace, hoping that the art gets taken down.\n\nWhy are we discussing NFT theft? Just like we did with cryptocurrency adoption, Africans have quickly cashed in on the opportunity to earn money from their art. Even without NFTs, copyright laws in Africa are notoriously lax or non-existent.\n\nWestern tech companies have typically taken their precious time to respond to complaints from Africans. So, how will they react when Africans start reporting NFT theft? There\u2019s a lot to unpack here, and we\u2019ll be sure to keep you abreast of developments in this space.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nPaystack is hiring.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2018, two Nigerian siblings, Olugbenga Abejirin and Mayowa Abejirin, who have technical capabilities in programming and software development, with the former armed with over a decade of experience in entrepreneurship, leveraged an opportunity to build and deploy smart classrooms to some Nigerian schools.\n\nThe early stage of the project was successful until the pandemic struck in 2020, and deployment was slowed down as access to spare parts abroad was impeded. However, the company had already covered eight Nigerian cities.\n\nPrimarily, the plan was to incorporate robotics into these smart classrooms riding on a previous project carried out in partnership with a Chinese university to build self-driving smart cars for educational purposes. However, this couldn\u2019t be deployed due to licensing challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKalibotics smart classroom\n\nThe seemingly discouraging outcomes of these two endeavours opened their eyes to something bigger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlugbenga recounts how they made the best of a daunting situation.\n\n\u201cThat was quite disappointing. But we had a video of the project they were doing. The partners showed us what it could do as well as the assembling process. So, we thought to ourselves, \u2018We can do this! Why don\u2019t we have a company that would create these robotic kits for the smart classrooms?\u2019\u201d\n\nEncouraged by their rich backgrounds in building tech products and entrepreneurship, they decided to go beyond smart classrooms. The result was the birth of robotics startup, Kalibotics, coined from two words: Kali, a Swahili term for \u2018energetic\u2019, and Robotics. Kalibotics launched officially in December 2019.\n\nRobots for real-life challenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKalibotics drone\n\nAlthough education is Kalibotics\u2019 strong point, the startup is motivated to build products to address tough real-life challenges, something Olugbenga refers to as \u201cgoing all out.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of the areas we\u2019re interested in and building robotic systems for are agritech, security, e-waste management, and other fields.\u201d\n\nElucidating, Mayowa lists products that the startup has been able to commercialise, including those it intends to deploy.\n\n\u201cOur first project was an obstacle avoidance car that uses ultrasonic sensors. After that, we went on to build an autonomous drone that can be easily repurposed for any artificial intelligence task like precision farming, and threat avoidance, among others.\u201d\n\nThe startup has also done other functional mini-projects like a robotic arm that can make a cup of tea and an AI Chessbot \u2014 a Chess-playing robot. In a few months, the prototype for an AI-based robot manipulator that can sort e-waste will be completed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating the Kalibotics Chessbot\n\nSolar-powered drones, autonomous rovers, and underwater drones for security and surveillance are at the ideation stage and will be developed in the coming months. This also includes other specific purpose drones for trash-picking.\n\nOlugbenga notes that most of the completed products are already commercialised while others are being trialled.\n\nBesides the hardware, the startup also has a proprietary Artificial Intelligence Robotics Coding (ARC), a curriculum it plans to get into schools soon.\n\nReacting to my scepticism about not focusing on only industry-specific products while in its early years, Olugbenga opines that the startup is maximising its capabilities with the three industries it currently specialises in and will build on this in the long-term. He believes this will take the startup to a growth phase, and once they have all been fully commercialised, the scope will increase.\n\nTo keep up with subsequent changes in the technology landscape, other projects will come up under the research and development department.\n\nLeading up to Kalibotics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore Kalibotics, the duo has come a long way in building tech products and running businesses.\n\nIn fact, one of the businesses, Deepblue Technologies, has been running for over 13 years.\n\nLooking back to his beginning, Olugbenga recalls how he founded Longhall Consulting, a consulting startup that has morphed into Learning Fortress, an e-learning platform.\n\nFollowing this, he threw his weight behind Deepblue Technologies, a company focused on application development/deployment and technical support services. Interestingly, the company has been around for 13 years.\n\nOlugbenga asserts that Kalibotics\u2019 products are targeted majorly at large businesses and the government for obvious reasons. Mass waste management, for instance, is the government\u2019s responsibility; likewise, smallholder farmers are rarely as concerned about precision farming as large farmers are.\n\nHowever, the entrepreneur clarifies that there are exemption plans for edtech and agritech products.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to have variants. We have what is called Kalibotics Project Alpha, which is B2C. This will deliver proprietary kits and an e-learning platform so that individuals can have robotic kits in their homes and then go through our e-learning and can learn to install and do lots of interesting projects. This will be launched in 2022.\u201d\n\nFor him, introducing a B2C model is inevitable, not only for inclusiveness but also to widen its approachable market and broaden revenue opportunities.\n\nGetting the right attention for funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its early days, the startup had access to a $25,000 fund in angel investment. To celebrate his birthday in 2020, Nigeria\u2019s Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, funded the March 8TH Initiative, where innovative companies were offered a \u20a61 million (~$2,400) grant. With its new and functional solutions, Kalibotics applied and ended up as one of the recipients.\n\nThanks to Kaibotics\u2019 e-waste management project, the startup was one of four finalists that won a \u20a620 million (~$48,000) grant in an innovation competition organised by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) in 2021. But this wasn\u2019t the first time Kaibotics was recognised in this manner.\n\nAlthough still at the pre-profit stage, Olugbenga claims that the startup\u2019s goal is to make a social impact while making a profit. Compared to other robotics startups, the founder believes their strength lies in infusing many high-end technologies into their products, trusted business sense, dependable team, and access to funding.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been smooth sailing all the way, and sometimes, the founders have to train people to ensure they can successfully operate their products.\n\nNigeria is not big on manufacturing, so building prototypes can be pretty tough without support from outside the country. Despite this, the startup has gotten in the face of potential buyers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello!\n\nToday does not seem to be that day of the week where many African startups take over the news with several huge funding rounds. Trust me, funding news does excite me, but not as much as the massive transformations these startups have the potential to deliver in the edtech, insurtech, healthtech, open finance, and other industries they operate.\n\nNonetheless, we do have one. Nigeria\u2019s Reliance Health raised $40 million in a Series B round.\n\nToday on Techpoint Digest, I decided to explore artistes\u2019 interests in African startups, a scenario that has become more noticeable recently. I hope we can all find answers to the \u2018why?\u2019 and \u2018what\u2019s in it for them?\u2019 questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfrican startups X Artistes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, Nigerian startup, AltSchool, raised a $1m pre-seed to provide alternative schools for Africans. Besides VCs, other investors who participated in the round include two popular Nigerian artists, Folarin Falana (Falz) and Akitoye Balogun (Ajebutter).\n\nThis is not foreign to the African startup space. The best person to fit this description would be Ajibade Oluwatosin (Mr Eazi). As a founder himself, he runs a VC company, Africa Music Fund (AMF), that invests in African music talents. In 2020, AMF raised $20m. He also set up a syndicate fund, Zagadat Capital, to invest in African startups.\n\nDid you miss this? \u201cWatch out for pastor Eazi!\u201d \u2014 Mr Eazi, on creative prospects beyond tech investments\n\nDuring my conversation with Mr Eazi last year, he believed that music is a product and that being an artist is similar to running a startup, especially since both involve high uncertainty. Victor Okpala, Spotify\u2019s West African Artist and Label Partnerships Manager, also held a similar opinion during Techpoint Build 2021 while discussing the next frontier in music with other panellists.\n\nAsides from investing, another noticeable occurrence is brand ambassadorship. This is commonplace in almost every industry, from sports to hospitality, and it\u2019s evident that startups are also getting in on it.\n\nLet\u2019s name a few: ChipperCash X Burna Boy, Kuda Bank X Fireboy DML, Flutterwave X Wizkid, Risevest X Teni, among others. Fintech much, huh?\n\nHere\u2019s what I think of this. Fans can be very loyal to their favourite artistes, which means they\u2019ll likely support what they support, no matter what. And what does this loyalty mean to the brand? I see a better monetisation potential. It\u2019s a different level of marketing, you know? That brand will get the same sentimental attachment fans with that artiste. Or am I exaggerating?\n\nWhile I see a massive opportunity here for these brands, I can\u2019t ignore how much goes into these partnerships in terms of funds. But then, these startups are highly valuable to start with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut can we say this is a win-win for both parties? How much ROI do these brands record apart from the familiar metric, which is the customer base? I\u2019m also curious, do artistes request equity instead of money?\n\nI believe you\u2019ll find this interesting? From Burna Boy to TV\u2019s Big Brother Naija, Nigerian startups are spending millions on celebrity endorsements\n\nReliance Health $40m Series B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it feel to have an emergency surgery sorted without having to break a bank? That\u2019s one of the perks of health insurance. But providing this service within a low-trust space with people cynical about insurance like Africa gets complicated. Still, tech startups are working to change this outlook.\n\nNigerian healthtech startup, Reliance Health plays in this space. The startup partners with hospitals, pharmacies, clinical physicians, specialists, and other healthcare facilities to provide health insurance and telemedicine.\n\nAnd it has just raised $40m in a Series B round led by General Atlantic, Partech, Picus Capital, Tencent Exploration, Africa Healthcare Master Fund, P1 Ventures, Laerdal Million Lives Fund, and M3 Inc.\n\nThe six-year-old startup serves businesses and individuals via a subscription model and claims to be serving over 200,000 customers. This fund will be directed towards expansion to Egypt, to start with; funding two clinics in two Nigerian cities, hiring talents and introducing new products.\n\nInterestingly, Reliance Health\u2019s raise is the largest so far in Africa\u2019s healthtech space.\n\nRead more: Nigerian healthtech startup Reliance Health raises $40M led by General Atlantic\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nPaystack is hiring.

          "title": "Dirty petrol arrived Nigeria January, slipped NNPC\u2019s tests",
          "text": "The current fuel scarcity in Nigeria\u2019s major cities on account of petrol high in methanol raises questions about the NNPC\u2019s quality control process, as investigations reveal that the dirty petrol first arrived Nigeria in the second week of January.\n\nSources with knowledge of the quality control process told BusinessDay that this particular batch with impurity takes about 12 minutes for the result to surface when tested in the laboratory, but apparently this was missed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nThe corporation went ahead to supply the dirty batch to depots that had been contracted to lift the products. As of the time of going to press, the NNPC had not responded to BusinessDay\u2019s questions but multiple sources confirmed the timeline.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority issued a release Tuesday night admitting that a limited quantity of petrol with methanol quantities above Nigeria\u2019s specification was discovered in the supply chain and that it had been isolated and withdrawn from the market.\n\nFollowing complaints by customers that bought the tainted petrol at some filling stations that it may have damaged their vehicles, extensive testing was done upon which it was discovered that a particular batch did not meet specifications.\n\nArinola Shobande, corporate communications lead at Ardova, where some stations were affected, said the company promptly shut down the affected petrol stations. Although she did not disclose the volume of products affected, as two other marketers also declined comment on the volume affected. After the NNPC was alerted, the process of recalling the off-spec product commenced.\n\nAfter the shut down of the affected petrol stations, they began draining the dirty fuel from their storage tanks and began the process of cleaning their tanks for new supply. This led to widespread dislocation in the supply chain leading to queues across the country.\n\nSince Nigeria\u2019s refineries are in a state of disrepair, the NNPC invites bids from oil traders who buy Nigeria\u2019s crude that should have been refined locally, and exchange them for imported refined products. This crude-for-product swap has been criticised for being opaque and prone to abuse.\n\nAccording to an investigation conducted by an extractive sector watchdog, the Natural Resource Governance Institute, it is difficult to independently evaluate and assess if Nigeria is getting fair value for its crude. It is unclear how much petroleum products can be exchanged for 20,000 barrels per day of crude, calculating shipping and other crude oil derivatives.\n\nLast year, the NNPC picked 16 consortia for the contracts for one year starting in August. The list included major Swiss trading firms Trafigura, Vitol and Mercuria, oil major Total as well as large Nigerian traders Sahara Energy, Oando and MRS Oil.\n\nThe corporation decided to pair local marketers with foreign oil traders in a consortium that would receive 20,000 barrels per day of crude oil in exchange for products. A total of 320,000 barrels per day of Nigeria\u2019s output was awarded last year.\n\nHowever, the consortium that includes Litasco/PV Oil/Overbrook/Northwest, sources tell BusinessDay may have imported the dirty petrol in exchange for 20,000 barrels of crude oil.\n\nThis implies that the dirty batch may have been received by filling stations owned by Overbrook Resources, Northwest, Ardova, PV Oil, among others.\n\nThe shut down of the petrol stations due to the irregular specification of the petrol they were given is the last-ditch effort to contain the spread. But many Nigerians report that their vehicles have already been affected.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have already complained that their vehicles have been damaged by the fuel already. My official vehicle is inclusive. If you can, don\u2019t buy fuel for now,\u201d warned a Twitter user.\n\nThis could open both the NNPC and the petrol stations to liabilities if it can be established, legal experts say.\n\n\u201cWhere the relevant car owner can prove that the direct cause of the damage to his car is the fuel from the relevant filling station, the filling station should be responsible,\u201d said Ayodele Oni, energy lawyer, and partner at Bloomfield Law Firm.\n\n\u201cHowever, I expect the filling stations to have insurance policies covering this,\u201d Oni said.\n\nRead also: Scarcity in Lagos over dirty petrol NNPC recalled\n\nOil marketers have since confirmed that impure products have been on sale. The Independent Marketers Association of Nigeria told journalists on Tuesday that dirty fuel was being mopped up and this had caused dislocation in the supply chain.\n\nApart from a statement on January 26, the NNPC had remained silent on the development drawing condemnation from Nigerians on social media.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC wishes to assure the public that the company has sufficient PMS stock to meet the needs of Nigerians. The public is therefore advised not to engage in panic buying of petrol; and to ignore all rumours that may suggest otherwise,\u201d the statement signed by Garba Deen Mohammad, its spokesperson stated.\n\nIndustry experts say one option opened to the NNPC to quickly contain the situation is to begin blending the dirty products with some of the good products to improve quality, and this could take about a week.",

          "title": "2023: Why Nigerians must get their PVCs",
          "text": "To avoid regret in the future, adults of voting age in Nigeria have been urged to get their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) in preparation for the 2023 general election.\n\nYIAGA Africa, in a sensitisation outreach to market men and women in Abuja Monday, urged every Nigerian of voting age to go pick their PVCs.\n\nAddressing prospective voters at the market, Samson Itodo, executive director of the group, said Nigerians must not sit on the fence but must participate actively in the nation\u2019s electoral process.\n\nIn a subtle sensitisation campaign recently, actor and comedian, Okechukwu Anthony Onyegbule, popularly known as Okey Bakassi, posted on social media a challenge to the educated members of the society who, despite their exposure, have refused to take part in the electoral process.\n\nHe was quoted as saying, \u201cThe Almajiri has a PVC; Mai Shayi has a PVC; Mai Barrow has a PVC; Mai Debino has a PVC; Mai Gworo has a PVC; Gateman has a PVC; Onion & Tomato sellers have PVCs; Shoe shiner has a PVC; Sugarcane seller has a PVC; Bus drivers/conductors have PVCs, and Motor park Agberos have PVCs, but you (a student or a graduate with BSc or MSc) with all your education and exposure still don\u2019t have PVC.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing is that you even try to justify why you don\u2019t have one \u2018my vote won\u2019t count.\u2019\n\n\u201cFor the sake of those who paid your school fees and fed you through school, please don\u2019t make all your education/exposure useless with statements like that. If votes don\u2019t count, politicians won\u2019t bribe/pay people to vote for them. Go and get your PVC!\u201d he said.\n\nEnough-is-Enough (EiE) Nigeria, a not-for-profit organisation, in a recent release contained in its Newsletter, urged all Nigerians to arm themselves with their PVCs, urging those yet to get theirs to make all necessary efforts to do so.\n\nEiE Nigeria said: \u201cWe recorded a 22.13 percent increase in Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) in 2019. 2023 is now up to us! Remember that the final lap towards carrying out your civic duty as an electorate starts from getting your PVC so you can vote on Election Day.\u201d\n\nMike Akande, a political scientist, who spoke with BusinessDay on the need for Nigerians to have their PVCs, said: \u201cI hear people say they are not interested in getting the PVC because they are not sure their votes would count; that they are not sure if hired thugs would not disrupt the election; that they are not sure the security situation in the country would allow for any election in 2023, or that the elections would be rigged.\n\n\u201cI have always told everybody I meet that gives such excuses that none of such excuses is enough to justify not having the PVC. If we continue looking backward, we would not make the desired progress.\u201d\n\nBut some prospective voters who spoke with BusinessDay said they did not know how they could get their PVCs or where to get it. They urged the INEC to publish centers for the collection of PVCs to enable those who had registered online to pick up their cards.\n\nThe Commission had last June, to improve the process and give eligible Nigerians the opportunity to have their PVCs ahead of 2023, begun an online continuous voter registration process across Nigeria.\n\nThe INEC said at that time that it could be done through its registration portal https://cvr.inecnigeria.org. The schedule of appointments for online registrants and physical CVR is at INEC state and local government offices nationwide.\n\nSpeaking recently on the exercise, INEC chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, said the commission was working to eliminate challenges and constraints experienced by many citizens in reaching the 811 designated centres nationwide to register.\n\nHe said the commission was working to activate additional 1,862 centres nationwide to make it easier for citizens to exercise their right to register as voters.\n\n\u201cI want to assure Nigerians that we are aware of the constraints experienced by many citizens in reaching the 811 designated centres nationwide to register.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we are mindful of the imperative of securing the process, especially the lives of registrants and our personnel. We will not put the lives of Nigerians and our registration officials at risk.\n\n\u201cFor this reason, we will review the security situation with a view to achieving our ultimate goal of activating the process,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nDespite the progress Nigeria has made in its democratic quest in the last two decades, there has been a general lack of interest among Nigerians in exercising their civic responsibility and voting to elect those who lead them.\n\nIn Nigeria, it is common for people to feel nonchalant and general lack of interest in the electoral process.\n\nBased on observation from recent off-season elections, there is increasing concern among stakeholders that the situation may not be different in the 2023 general election if urgent action is not taken.\n\nRead also: INEC\u2019s uncommon advice on 2023\n\nA vivid picture of the enormity of the problem could be seen in the 2019 general elections where incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari was re-elected with the backing of 15.2 million voters, his main rival Atiku Abubakar also scored 11.3 million votes.\n\nPresident Buhari had 56 percent of the total votes cast, in a country with a population of close to 200 million people, including more than 84 million registered voters.\n\nHowever, observers say that the 15.2 million votes hardly qualify as a huge mandate. The 35 percent voter turnout was down from 44 percent in the 2015 general election and down from the 54 percent turnout in 2011.\n\nA similar poor turnout of voters was noticed in last year\u2019s July 24 Lagos council election in which the total number of votes cast was 678,324 out of over 6 million registered voters in the state.\n\n\u201cIt is because Nigerians don\u2019t believe their votes would count; what is the rationale for voting and at the end of the day, the result is changed? If we are serious, I think the way forward is for the Federal Government to assure Nigerians that their vote would count and that INEC would be allowed to do its job before 2023, else, it would be disastrous.\n\n\u201cPeople have lost confidence in the process here, they see voting as a waste of time and I do you blame them. There is nothing to really motivate anybody now,\u201d Ebenezer Babatope, a former transport minister, said.",

          "text": "The final settlement between Samsung Heavy Industries Nigeria (SHIN) Limited and LADOL Integrated Logistics Free Zone Enterprise has reaffirmed their partnership, after three years of dispute.\n\nAccording to both parties, the settlement is expected to increase investment and boost employment in the free trade zone, which before now contributed 560,000 man-hours of training in total. In addition, SHIN has directly employed 2,500 Nigerians and 5,000 indirectly by its suppliers, working in highly specialised skills and roles.\n\nIn a joint statement issued in Lagos Tuesday, the two companies also reaffirmed the existing shareholding structure in their joint venture, where SHIN owns 70 percent equity while LADOL 30 percent.\n\nThey stated that they had resolved the historic and outstanding issues that were the subject of litigation in the Nigerian and international courts.\n\nThe joint venture was established when SHIN was awarded the $3.3 billion Egina FPSO project, which required the construction of the fabrication and integration yard to carry out the in-country aspect of the Egina project.\n\nHowever, the friction between the two, which began in 2018, led to a total breakdown of communications and engagements, resulting in court proceedings in Nigeria and the UK.\n\nIn the statement, they thanked the Nigerian and South Korean governments for their assistance and interventions, saying, \u201cThis landmark agreement, which demonstrates SHIN\u2019s ongoing commitment to its subsidiary, SHI-MCI, and Nigeria, and LADOL\u2019s commitment to consolidating and continuing the development of LADOL Free Zone to help ensure that Nigeria becomes an African hub for industrialisation, ensures that SHIN and LADOL can work together as shareholders in SHI-MCI.\u201d\n\nThey welcomed the settlement agreement, which has been approved by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and the Nigerian Exports Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA), and would also be registered as the judgment in the High Court in London, and the courts in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThe settlement agreement confirms that the Shareholders\u2019 Agreement between SHIN, SHI-MCI, and MCI FZE Yard Development Limited (MCI), dated July 1, 2014, remains valid, and the current shareholding of SHI-MCI is held in the following proportions: SHIN controls 70 percent and MCI, 30 percent.\n\n\u201cThe settlement agreement also provides for a new sublease agreement which has been executed between SHI-MCI and Global Resources Management Limited (GRML), with the NPA as the head-lessor to GRML. Importantly, the new sublease agreement is long term and is one day less than the term of the head lease between the NPA and GRML.\u201d\n\nLadi Jadesimi, chairman of LADOL, confirmed that the disagreement between LADOL and Samsung had been laid to rest in the interest of the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cThis settlement brings to an end the dispute between the LADOL and SHI Groups, which has been lingering for a little while and it became critical that it be sorted out. Now it has been completely resolved. The key thing is that we have been able to come back together peacefully cementing a far stronger joint venture going forward.\n\n\u201cLADOL will continue to invest in and support a range of developments and industries in LADOL Free Zone from agriculture to green energy, ensuring Nigeria becomes a sustainable industrial Hub in Africa,\u201d Jadesimi said.\n\nOn his part, Jejin Jeon, managing director of SHIN, disclosed that after many years of legal proceedings that hindered SHIN\u2019s ability to operate in Nigeria and threatened its contribution to the Nigerian economy, the settlement has become a definitive statement in favour of SHI-MCI\u2019s right to operate in the LADOL Free Zone.\n\n\u201cIn recognising that Samsung Heavy Industries (Nigeria) lawfully holds 70 percent of the shares in SHI-MCI, the settlement acknowledges our extraordinary contribution to the LADOL Free Zone and its role in the economic development of Nigeria,\u201d Jeon said.\n\nHe noted that before the Egina project, most maritime construction for African oil and gas projects took place outside of Africa, stressing that Nigeria did not have the capacity to fabricate and integrate an FPSO locally.\n\n\u201cThanks to our investment in the SHI-MCI yard, we have established Nigeria as a fabrication and integration hub on the African continent. Over six years, SHIN has trained 600 Nigerians from disadvantaged backgrounds in a comprehensive welding qualification programme, in one of the most advanced welding academies in Nigeria.\n\nRead also: LADOL, SAMSUNG resolve dispute, set to unlock $300bn FDI into Nigeria\n\n\u201cThis has contributed to 560,000 man-hours of training in total. In addition, SHIN has directly employed 2,500 Nigerians with a further 5,000 employed by our suppliers, working in highly specialised skills and roles. This has moved the dial in practical terms \u2013 with the local contribution rising from 1 percent to over 25 percent,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Jeon, SHIN\u2019s focus remains to execute the plan to make Nigeria the hub for fabrication and integration works supporting the oil and gas industry and infrastructure development and ensuring SHI-MCI\u2019s participation in future fabrication and integration projects.\n\n\u201cSHIN is deeply committed to ongoing and future projects in Nigeria and as part of SHI-MCI, we plan to invest in future projects in the coming year and remain focused on creating and delivering mega deep offshore projects for Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nThe terms of the settlement also provide that NEPZA, as part of its statutory duties and role as administrator of all NEPZA free zone areas in Nigeria, shall continue to be responsible for the issuance and renewal of SHI-MCI\u2019s Operating Licence.\n\nNEPZA had previously issued an Operating Licence to SHI-MCI in the form of a National Operating Licence dated October 4, 2021, valid for three years.",

          "text": "Some senior advocates and rights activists have called on the Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC), which is the sole importer of petrol into the country, to compensate motorists who bought adulterated fuel.\n\nThe federal government had through the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority on Tuesday said adulterated petrol, fuel with methanol quantities above Nigeria\u2019s specification, was discovered in the supply chain.\n\nIn a statement, it said the supplier had been identified and appropriate sanction would apply.\n\nIt also said oil marketers had been directed to ensure sufficient supply of quality petrol in all outlets in the country.\n\nA Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, said the government was wrong to have given the NNPC the monopoly of petrol importation, insisting that the oil firm cannot escape liability.\n\nHe added, \u201cIf it is confirmed that there\u2019s negligence on the part of the importer of the petroleum products, surely all those who bought the fuel are entitled to pursue their remedies against the agency especially where it affects vehicles among others.\n\n\u201cThey would be liable and this is because they have the monopoly of importing petroleum products to the country. So the citizens are limited in terms of their choice and so in that regard they have the responsibility of ensuring that they import what is suitable for use by the consumer.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC can\u2019t escape being held liable and not just the NNPC, I think the government itself and the reason is because there\u2019s no reason to monopolise the importation of petroleum products. Also, the reason we are experiencing this is because the government has failed to repair our refineries.\u201d\n\nAnother senior lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), reportedly said the NNPC must compensate those who bought the contaminated petrol.\n\nFalana advised victims to lodge a complaint with the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe NNPC has to compensate consumers. They (consumers) should lodge a complaint with the consumer protection council. Victims can institute an action against the NNPC. The NNPC also has the right to sue those that sold the fuel to them.\u201d\n\nAlso, Norrison Quakers, another senior advocate, said it was irresponsible for the NNPC to have imported contaminated fuel, adding that they could be dragged to court for doing so.\n\nQuakers further argued that the marketers who bought the petrol from the NNPC ought to be compensated as well.\n\nThe senior advocate added, \u201cIf I was an independent marketer and I bought the product from NNPC for the supply and suddenly it turned out to be adulterated fuel , the NNPC is duty bound to reimburse and compensate me for my loss. I could start first with an administrative process to demand for the reimbursement and when they refuse to do that I can now institute an action in that regard because I bought it from them.\n\n\u201cSecondly, a car owner who goes to a filling station to buy petrol and his car develops a fault because some cars are very sensitive, can sue the supplier as well as the NNPC. It\u2019s like a chain; you identify the primary source and the secondary. Honestly, it is highly irresponsible for the NNPC to have imported adulterated fuel. It means standards have really declined. How do you determine the fuel that is being sold, is it not at the point of purchase?\n\n\u201cHow do you end up buying adulterated fuel of that magnitude? Those are questions begging for answers. The president must intervene, heads must roll. It is quite painful in the age of the way we do things in this country.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Executive Director, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Center, Ibrahim Rafsanjani, said this was scandalous to Nigeria, calling on the anti-corruption agencies in the country to investigate the matter.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think this is an indictment on the NNPC, the sole importer of petroleum in Nigeria. They must be made to account for how it happened. Taxpayers\u2019 money is used to import this petrol. This also goes to show the poor regulatory and supervision mechanism.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the implication of the development, an energy law specialist, Prof. Dayo Ayoade, noted that aside from the huge adverse environmental impact of such contaminated fuel, the product had already knocked the engines of some motorists.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is a big issue because the contaminated fuel has to be taken out of the system. It has to be extracted from the filling stations and depots and disposed off. This is because since it is contaminated, you can\u2019t sell it to another person.\n\n\u201cIt has to be disposed in an environment that is sustainable, and in a proper manner. Now, do we have the equipment to properly take care of this contaminated fuel? That is a big issue.\n\n\u201cSecondly, there is the issue of who is liable for the cost of replacement of the engines that have knocked? Because contaminated fuels have negative impact on engines and I heard that the engines of some customers have knocked.\u201d\n\nHowever, the spokesperson for the oil firm, Garba-Deen Muhammad, was said to have declined comments when asked if the NNPC would compensate motorists who had already used the contaminated petrol.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

They urged MTN\u2019s management to immediately lift the embargo it placed on some workers from membership of the union by communicating to them that they are free to join the union since membership is in the first instance, is voluntary, NAN reported.\n\n\u201cIf any of our demands are not met on or before Feb. 23, 2022, we shall be mobilising in conjunction with other sister unions affiliated to Nigeria Labour Congress workers within and outside the company for industrial actions that will force management to grant our demands,\u201d the workers noted.",

International organisations have rated Nigeria as the world poverty capital and it\u2019s time to change the narrative, Tambuwal said.\n\n\u201cPDP has ruled Nigeria before and now APC have ruled and you all have seen the negative difference.

          "text": "Four days after killing at least 12 persons in Daraga, residents of the village Tuesday said the terrorists have stopped them from evacuating the bodies for burial.\n\nDaraga is in Maru local government area, one of the worst hit locations in the state.\n\nIn a special report carried by BBC Hausa Tuesday morning and monitored by Premium Times, residents said they could not bury their dead because the bandits were still around the village.\n\nAn anonymous source who spoke to the BBC said his house was completely burnt down, with his brother and boss in the shop killed.\n\n\u201cAs I speak to you, there is no single person in that community because we have all fled from the place. 12 people were confirmed killed while several others were injured during the attack. Eight of my friends were killed. The bandits are still around the village and have stopped us from retrieving the dead bodies for proper burial.\n\n\u201cWe tried calling security agents but to no avail. To be honest with you, the security agents in Dan Kurmi (a larger community neighbouring Daraga) could not match the bandits. There is nothing they cannot do because they have more sophisticated weapons and are many in number,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said residents had deserted the village to various communities, including Dan Kurmi, Bena, Zargado (all in Zamfara state) and as far as Wasagu and Unashi in Kebbi state.\n\nSpokesman of Zamfara state Police Command, Mohammed Shehu did not respond to SMS and calls on the situation at Daraga.\n\nKatsina\n\nIn a related development, bandits have killed 9 people, abducted village head and unspecified number of persons in Guga village of Bakori local government area of Katsina state.\n\nSources from the village told newsmen that the terrorists attacked the village Monday night during which they also burnt cars, shops and houses.\n\nA source said most of the kidnapped victims were well-to-do people in the area, including women and children.\n\nAs at the time of compiling this report, there were no reported contacts between the terrorists and the family of the abductees.\n\nPremium Times reports that three communities of Guga, Gidan Kanawa and Dukawa, are in the Bakori and Funtua local government area, all in the southern part of the state, share boundaries with Kaduna state.\n\nKatsina state has witnessed frequent bandits\u2019 attacks since the beginning of this year.\n\nRecent attacks\n\nThe recent attacks were the killing of a village head and four others in Yan Gayya and at least 12 people in Ilela villages.\n\nThe police spokesperson in the state, Gambo Isa, had attributed recent attacks to fleeing bandits from Zamfara and Sokoto states.Speaking to Premium Times, Nafiu Muhammadu, said the village head of Guga, Alhaji Umar, was abducted while 10 people were killed in the attack.\n\n\u201cWhen they came, they started shooting sporadically and putting fire on shops in the community, which caused panic. When residents started running, some of the bandits started shooting, which led to the death of the 10 people I told you.\n\n\u201cThe village head, despite the chance for him to run because his house is a little far away from where the attack started, came towards the bandits, asking his people to run. That was when he was captured. He was taken back into his house where some money and foodstuff were also taken,\u201d Muhammadu said.\n\nHe said only the village head was abducted. Those killed have not been buried yet.\n\nLocal sources said the marauding bandits stormed Dukawa in Funtua local government Monday night and ran a house to house search.\n\nAn anonymous source, who is now seeking refuge in Funtua told this reporter that the bandits were possibly there to loot food.\n\n\u201cThey did not kill anyone in the village but eight women and six children were taken by the bandits when they couldn\u2019t get any meaningful food stuff. I was there and there was no attempt by the security agents to repel the attack despite the fact that we called the policemen stationed not far from the village,\u201d he said.\n\nThe source, however, said negotiations had started for the release of the women and children.\n\nThe attack in Gidan Kanawa came hours after the one in Dukawa, all in Funtua local government area.\n\nAttahiru Bala, another resident of Funtua, said the attack on Gidan Kanawa in which three people were killed in the village was a reprisal attack.\n\n\u201cMy sister-in-law lives there with her husband. She told us that the bandits were frustrated by vigilante members last Saturday when they attempted to attack the town. But they regrouped and came back this morning around 1 a.m. and launched the attack. If not because of the resilience of the vigilante members who still confronted them and helped residents escape, the casualties would have been more than the three killed. But I was also told that several people were abducted,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Bala said the three people were buried Tuesday morning in the area.\n\nThe command spokesperson in Katsina state, Mr Isa\u2019s phone number was not reachable but a message was sent to him for comments on the attacks.\n\nIPMA boss kidnapped\n\nAlso, the Benin Depot Chairman of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) Baba Abdul-Hamid Saliu, was Monday evening abducted by gunmen suspected to be kidnappers.\n\nHis driver, whose identity still remained unknown as at the time of filing this report, was killed in the process.\n\nThe incident occurred Monday, at about 7 pm in Jattu, his country home, in Etsako West local government area of Edo state.\n\nSaliu was elected last week Thursday.\n\nIt was gathered that the gunmen said to be about six in number, came in two vehicles with hidden number plates and laid ambush at his residence.",

          "text": "Moves to launch a Third Force Mega Party to wrest power from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 general elections are underway, Blueprint reports.\n\nThe Third Force agenda is being pushed by two groups identified as the National Consultative Front (NCF) and Leaders of Conscience, with key political players including former governor of Kano state, Rabiu Kwankwanso; presidential hopeful, Kingsley Moghalu; and economic expert, Pat Utomi among others.\n\nBut the duo of the ruling APC and the opposition PDP are dismissing the coalition as no threat, saying the group would go the way of others.\n\nNotwithstanding, the mega movement in a communiqu\u00e9 issued by Ms Bilikis Bello for the NCF national secretariat, said the groups met Tuesday in Lagos to harmonise all the stakeholders and interest groups into a political front ahead of the general election.\n\nThe parties that have consented to the plan resolved that the mega party would be launched, \u201cat least within the next three weeks,\u201d after the council must have secured the consent and collaboration of other stakeholders it was eyeing.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe various consultations and negotiations among parties and stakeholders (is) aimed at forming a formidable alternative democratic Mega Party to drive the political rescue and salvation of Nigeria through the ballot in 2023.\n\n\u201cMembers of the harmonization council include Prof Pat Utomi, Dr Usman Bugaje, Prof Kingsley Moghalu, Engr Buba Galadima, Senator Saidu Dansadau, Chief Raph Okey Nwosu, Barr Dan Nwayanwu, Hajiya Najatu Mohammed, Prof Mrs Remi Sonaiya, Pastor Ituah Ighodalo; and former Economic Adviser to the President of Nigeria, Prof Osita Ogbu.\n\n\u201cOthers are Hon Mrs Janet Adeyemi, Dr Chris Ekiyor, Dr Sadiq Gombe, Comrade Promise Adewusi, Dr Tanko Yunusa, Barr Monday Ubani Esq., Chief Akin Braithwaite, Arc Ezekiel Nya Etok, Lady Khadija Okunnu-Lamidi, Hon Dr Olubunmi Usim Wilson, Ogbeni Lanre Banjo, Mr Segun Oshinowo, Comrade Tony Akeni, and Sir Olawale Okunniyi.\u201d\n\nThe groups have also reportedly received solidarity from political groups and civil society organisations, including; Rescue Nigeria Project ( RNP), Nigeria Intervention Movement (NIM), Strategic Elements of the Civil Society Movement and Youths\u2019 EndSars Movement, National Rescue Movement (NRM) and African Democratic Congress (ADC).\n\nIt was stated the national chairmen of the allied political parties had been invited on their respective \u201creadiness to accommodate all partners and stakeholders in a fusion arrangement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was however observed that the presentation of one of the key allied Parties in the adoption and fusion process, the People\u2019s Redemption Party, PRP, which has been in consultations with the NCFront and invited to the Retreat, could not be received as the Leadership of the Party was yet to give full clearance and approval to the terms, conditions and modalities contained in the MOU guiding the Fusion.\n\n\u201cThe meeting to that extent mandated the Transition/Fusion Council to receive their presentation, if the Party is ready to interface with the process within the time frame given to the council to conclude its tasks.\n\n\u201cConsequent upon the two presentations and the separate pledges of the two political parties to fully honour the terms, conditions and modalities contained in the Memorandum Of Understanding, MOU drafted to guide the adoption of the Coalition Party to serve as the vehicle and platform upon which the fusion shall be consummated, the meeting set up an all inclusive Transition/Harmonisation Council to practically consummate the political fusion of all stakeholders on the platform of one of the registered allied political parties,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 reads partly.\n\nOther popular political figures being wooed to join the proposed mega party are Prof Attahiru Jega, Dr Olisa Agbakoba, SAN, Mallam Falalu Bello, Barr Femi Falana SAN, Dr Oby Ezekwesili, Barr Dan Nwayanwu, Prince Adewole Adebayo Esq, and Dr Aisha Salihu Lemu.\n\n\u2018APC not threatened\u2019\n\nDismissing the coalition as no threat, Chairman Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) and APC chieftain, Niyi Akinsuji, said such assemblage can never be a threat to the governing party.\n\nAkinsuji, when asked to comment on the preparations of the group towards 2023 general elections, described it as good development, adding that APC had achieved so much to be re-elected in 2023 and beyond.\n\nThe BMO chairman said: \u201cIt is a good development for our democracy. In fact, it even shows that our democracy is fast developing as a nation. But this can\u2019t be a threat to the ruling APC because our administration has done much to take to the public square. It now depends on the power to tell the voting public what we have been able to achieve as a party.\n\n\u201cSo, it is not a matter of threat to the APC, it is a matter of what we have offered and what we can offer beyond 2023.\u201d\n\nPDP\n\nIn a similar position, the PDP said the Third Force would fizzle out soonest.\n\nIn a phone interview with Blueprint, PDP Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Ibrahim Abdullahi, who commended those behind the outfit, said the opposition party was ready to harvest them and treat them better than other political parties.\n\nHe said: \u201cI will start by commending and appreciating the determination of those behind the proposed third force for their plans on an alternative platform for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThey have realised that the clueless administration of the All Progressives Congress (APC) under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari has brought Nigeria to this sorry state.\n\n\u201cBut certainly, the PDP is not an association, it is a political party that is national in outlook with formidable structures across the 36 States and the Federal Capital Territory. And it is a party that is peopled by very credible tested politicians who have carved niche for themselves.\n\n\u201cSo, the vehicle like the PDP that has had the opportunity to lead the country for 16 years will not be threatened by an association of a group of people in the name of Third Force, who at most will fizzle out before the election proper.\n\n\u201cThird Force is not a threat to the PDP. PDP does not recognise them. What we do is to salute their courage, destination and focus. But certainly, in no distant time, you will not hear about the Third Force.\n\n\u201cThey can go ahead and exercise their rights; it is within their fundamental rights as Nigerians. Our constitution provides them with that opportunity, so it\u2019s up to them to do so. But I can assure you that there is nothing tangible that will come out of it.\n\n\u201cOur vehicle and platform, that is the PDP, is waiting to harvest them and treat them fairly, better than other political parties they can think of.\n\n\u201cA good number of them are already talking with the leadership of the PDP. They are people that we respect and they are Nigerians of note, but they are not a threat to the chances of the PDP in any election.\u201d\n\nOn the chances of the PDP in the 2023 general elections, he said: \u201cIn the recent remark by President Muhammadu Buhari, if the APC could not unite themselves then power is already in the hands of the PDP. So if the President could see the PDP not only as a threat but as a possible successor, then what are we talking about?\u201d",

So there is no need to panic.\n\n\u201cThe sole supplier has been identified and further commercial and appropriate actions shall be taken by the authorities and the NNPC.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC Limited and all marketing companies have been directed to sustain sufficient distribution of petrol products in all retail outlets nationwide to avoid any scarcity.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the NNPC has intensified efforts at increasing the supply of petroleum products in the market in order to bridge any unforeseen supply gap.\u201d\n\nFuel anxiety\n\nFuel queues had emerged on Tuesday morning in Lagos. This caused gridlock in major parts of the state affecting traffic movement.\n\nSome fuel stations were locked while a few open ones had long queues of motorists waiting to buy fuel.\n\nThe situation was not different in the capital city, Abuja, and surrounding states where the majority of filling stations were shut and motorists spent hours in the sun struggling to buy from the few that were open.\n\nThe queues surfaced as the conversation over fuel subsidies continues to generate reactions.\n\nThe Federal Government had earlier hinted a removal of the subsidies in June but later walked back its decision amid pressure from labour unions.\n\nNigeria is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of crude oil but struggles to refine the product locally.\n\nA key refinery built by Africa\u2019s richest man Aliko Dangote is expected to ease the the demand for fuel imports when it begins operations later this year.",

As we speak, the federal government has adamantly done nothing to ensure that the renegotiation agreement is signed and implemented.\n\n\u201cWe are perplexed that the states and federal government are not responding to our consistent appeal or listening to bring about genuine transformation by highly motivated human capital in the education sector for our university system.\n\n\u201cEmbarking on strike is not in our character nor is it in our nature, however, our union should not be pushed to the wall, we only go on strike as a last resort. We are in a position where the government is not doing the needful.\u201d\n\nHe expressed concern about the neglect of conditions of service of academics saying lecturers have made sacrifices over the years than any other segment of the society to ensure that universities in the country were globally competitive, \u201cbut despite that, they are poorly remunerated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are producing lecturers and manpower for other parts of the world so we must be paid remuneration that are globally competitive. We are calling on all Nigerians to prevail on the federal government to do the needful, \u201che said.\n\nEmphasising on the issue of IPPIS, Odukoya alleged that the Accountant General of the federation seemed to have made a business of it, saying that those found culpable in fraudulent practice, should be arrested by the EFCC.\n\nOn the funding of state and federal universities, the zonal coordinator said politicians are interested in creating new universities as constituency project rather than funding existing ones, adding that academics are underpaid.\n\n\u201cWe say this must stop. Go to several of our universities, particularly our state universities, they are TETfund universities because the state government has nothing doing there. They don\u2019t even fund them.

          "text": "The Nigerian government is locked in a court battle with Britain\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA) over control of \u20ac180 million (\u00a3150 million) that was stashed abroad by Nigeria\u2019s former Head of State, late Gen. Sani Abacha.\n\nBy Tuesday\u2019s official exchange rate of the British Pounds Sterling at N563, as seen on the website of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the money in contention is about N84.5 billion.\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s The Telegraph reported that the case was again poised to spark fresh questions about dirty money flowing through the City of London.\n\nIn the latest legal tussle over the money, generally known in Nigeria as \u201cAbacha loot\u201d, the report stated that Nigeria wanted the crime-fighting agency, NCA, to release funds that it froze at the request of US authorities.\n\nIn May 2020, the federal government confirmed the receipt of $311 million looted by a late dictator, Abacha, repatriated from the United States and Island of Jersey.\n\nAccording to Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, \u201cThe amount increased significantly from over $308 million to over $311 million because of the interest that accrued from February 3, 2020, to 28th April, 2020, when the fund was transferred to the CBN.\u201d\n\nIt came after the recovery of $322 million from Switzerland in 2018.\n\nAt the time, Malami noted that the government had committed that the asset would support and assist in expediting the construction of three major infrastructure projects across Nigeria, namely, Lagos \u2013 Ibadan Expressway, Abuja \u2013 Kano Road, and Second Niger Bridge.\n\nIt was estimated that from 2007 to 2020, about $1.5 billion had been returned to Nigeria from different parts of the world.\n\nAccording to the latest report, American prosecutors said the money could be traced back to a suspected $2.2 billion (\u00a31.6 billion) or more that was plundered by Abacha and his associates during the dictator\u2019s five-year reign.\n\nIn the complex issues surrounding the repatriation of the funds, the authorities in the US sought to return the money to \u201cthe people of Nigeria\u201d, under the so-called Kleptocracy Initiative.\n\nBut the Nigerian government was said have sought to \u201csidestep\u201d the process and obtain the funds directly through an application to the High Court, in a move opposed by UK and US authorities, documents seen by The Telegraph and SourceMaterial showed.\n\nAlthough Abacha died more than 20 years ago, the piles of treasure he looted from Nigerian coffers have kept cropping up, with at least $2 billion being thought to have stolen during his five years in power.\n\nThe former dictator\u2019s spoils have been linked to dozens of offshore bank accounts over the years, as investigators unravel the intricate web he and his associates spun across the globe.\n\nBritish and American authorities have been locked in talks over tens of millions of pounds of cash that investigators say can be traced to Abacha\u2019s plundering, the investigation found.\n\nThe case, which involves a serving Nigerian politician who was one of Abacha\u2019s top henchmen, includes cash in British bank accounts that has been frozen by the National Crime Agency.\n\nHowever, the Nigerian government has brought its own legal action against the NCA in a bid to end the tussle, it has emerged.\n\nThe report stated, \u201cIt is a complicated story with many twists and turns. But the on-going struggle for \u2018Abacha\u2019s loot\u2019 reveals the difficulty in recovering stolen funds, the frustrations of law enforcement, and the way people accused of corruption have relied on respectable law firms to argue their cases in court.\u201d\n\nOn the modus operandi used by Abachi to execute the looting, the report stated that after seizing power in a 1993 coup, Abacha set about using his position as Nigeria\u2019s head of state to place himself above the law and skim vast sums of money from the oil-rich nation.\n\nIn perhaps the most brazen example, he would tell advisers to make spurious requests to him for money to deal with national \u201cemergencies\u201d, according to US court documents.\n\nSigned letters would then be sent to the CBN, which would provide cash, travellers\u2019 cheques or arrange a wire transfer.\n\nThe report added, \u201cMoney was stuffed into boxes or bags and transported to Abacha\u2019s house, before associates arranged for it to be sent abroad.\n\n\u201cAt least $2 billion is thought to have been stolen this way, using more than 60 letters to the central bank.\n\n\u201cAbacha also arranged for the government to sell bonds to a company controlled by his allies before buying them back at vastly inflated prices, generating an illicit windfall of $282 million.\u201d\n\nSeparately, the report stated that Abacha and his associates extorted French engineering firm, Dumez Group, of $97 million and used his spoils to live a luxurious lifestyle.\n\n\u201cInside his many sprawling homes, he kept piles of glittering jewellery, including gold necklaces and rings, and at one stage as much as $100 million in cash,\u201d the report noted.\n\nHowever, the money Abacha and his associates plundered became the subject of an international search after the dictator\u2019s sudden death in 1998, aged 54.\n\nThe report stated that weeks after his death, Abacha\u2019s widow was caught trying to flee the country with 38 suitcases packed with money and his family later forfeited nearly $1 billion.\n\n\u201cYet the only clues hinting at where other stashes of money could be found were a few details of secret offshore bank accounts discovered by authorities,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cSince then, the Nigerians have sought foreign help to recover as much as possible, with more than $1 billion eventually returned from Switzerland alone,\u201d it added.\n\nThe effort has been hampered by the sheer complexity of Abacha\u2019s dealings as well as marathon legal battles that have dragged on for years, some involving former associates.\n\nOne of the remaining cases, brought by US prosecutors, aims to recover more than $480 million, the report stressed. In just one example of the web of transactions criss-crossing the globe, they outlined in court filings how money was laundered by Abacha and his associates through bank accounts in Lagos, London, New York, Paris, Zurich, and Geneva.\n\nThe assets were stashed in banks, including Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and Banque SBA, according to the lawsuit, although there was no suggestion that the banks were involved in any wrongdoing.\n\nThe Telegraph stated, \u201cThis legal action eventually resulted in a 2020 deal to repatriate about $321 million, which had been laundered through the US banking system and then held in accounts in Jersey under the name of Doraville Properties Corporation, a British Virgin Islands company, and Abacha\u2019s son, Mohammed.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the new development comes as Britain fights claims that it has been very tolerant of dirty money flowing through the City of London.\n\nUS officials said last month that they were concerned that deep links between the UK and several Russian oligarchs meant that sanctions issued against Moscow if it invades Ukraine could be rendered ineffective.\n\nLast Sunday, Briish Labour MP David Lammy accused ministers of doing too little to deal with corruption in Britain.\n\nLammy said, \u201cWe have to fix the dirty money problem we have, this huge problem of money laundering in London, of corruption and fraud.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much that (ministers) are not doing. Joe Biden knows it and he\u2019s concerned.\u201d\n\nBut simultaneously, another court tussle in the UK is happening in parallel. At stake is more than \u20ac90 million, some of which came from Abacha\u2019s security votes fraud, according to a High Court judgement issued in 2014.\n\nThe money is said to be controlled by a Singapore-based trust set up for the benefit of the family of Abubakar Bagudu, the serving governor of Kebbi State, who is accused of playing an \u201cinstrumental role\u201d in many of Abacha\u2019s corrupt schemes by US prosecutors.\n\nBagudu has always denied any wrongdoing. His office did not respond to a request for comment, the report said.\n\nHis brother, Ibrahim, is a director of two companies known as Blue Holdings that are owned by the Singapore trust.\n\nAccording to the Pandora Papers, a leaked cache of documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists last year, the Bagudu brothers enlisted Farrer & Co, an elite London law firm that has advised the Queen, to help them set up these businesses.\n\nThey moved \u20ac98 million from a British Virgin Islands trust to a new structure spanning Singapore and the Cook Islands.\n\nFarrer & Co said it carried out \u201cextensive due diligence\u201d on Bagudu and that it obtained approval from the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), the precursor to the NCA, to move the funds.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the case, the amount controlled by the Singapore trust may now have grown to as much as \u20ac180 million. It is kept in accounts at Waverton Investment Management and James Hambro & Partners, both based in London.\n\nThe NCA has been working with American authorities in a bid to confiscate the funds and return them to \u201cthe people of Nigeria,\u201d the report stated.\n\nHowever, the Nigerian government wants them to be returned directly to the country and the parties, including lawyers for Bagudu, have been holding negotiations about a possible settlement, court filings in the US show.\n\nBagudu struck a deal with the Nigerian government in 2003, in which he agreed to return a sum of money but made no admission of wrongdoing, and the agreement was reaffirmed by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in 2018. What this means, according to the report, is that almost 70 per cent of the UK money could be handed to Bagudu if returned.\n\nCourt filings showed the Nigerian government subsequently sought to unlock the funds and repatriate them in legal action against the NCA \u2013 a move that was opposed by the UK and US.\n\nThe country hired Kingsley Napley, the London law firm famed for representing a host of celebrities, including Rebekah Vardy, to represent it. The firm and the NCA both declined to comment, the report noted.\n\nThe report quoted Spotlight on Corruption, a non-profit campaign group, as saying that the case raises questions about whether, \u201claw enforcement is being paid and resourced enough to get its act together\u201d.\n\nIt accused the NCA of having effectively \u201ccleaned\u201d the money by approving the transfer to Singapore and warned against returning cash to Bagudu.\n\nHowever, Jonathan Benton, a former NCA senior detective who now runs consultancy Intelligent Sanctuary, said the case also underlined the sheer complexity of efforts to reclaim Abacha\u2019s loot.\n\nBenton stated, \u201cI care passionately about tackling corruption and it is important we hold people to account.\n\n\u201cBut it can be a challenging and drawn-out process and sometimes you have to be pragmatic. In those situations, the law allows you to negotiate. It is repugnant. But Nigeria desperately needs the money that Abacha stole.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report",

          "title": "Nigeria: Buhari Angry Over Dirty Fuel in Circulation, Orders Query of Regulatory Agency",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari was said to have on Tuesday expressed anger over the contaminated petrol in circulation across the country, a development that has disrupted the nation\u2019s fuel supply chain for several days.\n\nThe president was said to have therefore ordered that the Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), Mr. Farouk Ahmed, should be queried immediately.\n\nBuhari, who was said to be visibly worried over the situation, leading to the return of long fuel queues in parts of the country, especially in Abuja, Lagos, Ogun, Port Harcourt and others, instructed the Minister of State, Petroleum, Mr. Timipre Sylva, to ask Ahmed to explain how the product came into the country.\n\nAn impeccable presidency source told THISDAY that Buhari felt that the first point to begin to unravel how the product came into the country and invariably began circulating should be the agency, which by law acts as the \u201cpolice\u201d of the downstream and midstream sector.\n\nThe Authority was created in August 2021 in line with the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) and encompasses a merger of three defunct regulatory agencies: Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA), Petroleum Equalisation Fund (Management) Board (PEFMB), and the Midstream and Downstream Divisions of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR).\n\nIt is responsible for the regulation of the midstream and downstream petroleum operations in Nigeria which includes technical, operational, and commercial activities.\n\nAccording to the source, who asked not be named, the minister who was at the Presidential Villa to brief the president, following the growing outrage over the issue, was directed to, in a short while, send the query to the CEO of the agency.\n\n\u201cThis matter has become an embarrassment to this government. There\u2019s no question that these cargoes of petrol were bad, so he (Ahmed) is being queried over how the fuel came into the country and the president has so instructed,\u201d the presidency source explained.\n\nWhen THISDAY sought to know why the midstream/downstream should be issued a query while the likely importer, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) was seemingly being let off the hook, the source said while investigations were ongoing, the response of the agency would determine which other government agency or private individuals would be sanctioned.\n\n\u201cThe reason the midstream/downstream authority is being queried first is that for now the bulk stops at its desk. They are the first port of call. Ordinarily, they are expected to know how it came into the country.\n\n\u201cThis is because they are the police of the industry. How did it get past them into circulation? It is their job to know. They are the police which should stop bad fuel from coming into the country.\n\n\u201cSo, the NNPC has not been queried for now. The question now is who certified the product clean enough to come into the country?\n\n\u201cWhen the investigation is done, then the federal government will know where the blame lies, but for now, the NNPC is just a company and doesn\u2019t necessarily owe allegiance to government as it were, because it\u2019s now just like every other company with a profit motive.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand the authority is the regulator, they are supposed to flag any adulterated product so that it doesn\u2019t come into the country. For now , the question the government is asking is: How did it come into the country. Who gave the permission or go-ahead? That is the question for now, then other steps will follow.\n\n\u201cIt is on the basis of that the presidency can then apportion blames and sanction other culpable operators accordingly,\u201d the presidency source added.\n\nAccording to the source, the affected volume of products in circulation was more than the 100 million litres being bandied about, adding that it came in six cargoes.\n\n\u201cThe actual figure is 317 million litres that came in six cargoes. So, the argument that it is isolated does not hold water,\u201d the source alleged.\n\nThe current problematic supply of petrol has for days grounded movement in Abuja, Lagos and some other parts of the country, made worse by the shortage of inventory released from the sole importer, the NNPC.\n\nThe prevailing condition has ensured that in Abuja, especially, a majority of filling stations were shut even as motorists spent hours in the sun struggling to buy from the few that were open, causing serious traffic jams in parts of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThe particular cargoes with the issue were said to have high sulphur content, while marketers have been advised not to sell to consumers.\n\nIn addition, it was learnt that the queues returned partly because the gap which existed when depot owners started hoarding products before the announcement of retention of subsidy by the federal government had not smoothened.\n\nThis has challenged the lifting of products to, especially Abuja and other parts of the north from Lagos, THISDAY gathered.\n\nIn a statement on the matter yesterday, the Authority admitted that \u201climited quantity of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), commonly known as petrol, with methanol quantities above Nigeria\u2019s specification was discovered in the supply chain.\u201d\n\nWhile stressing that methanol is a regular additive in petrol and usually blended in an acceptable quantity, the NMDPRA stated that to ensure vehicular and equipment safety, the limited quantity of the impacted product has been isolated and withdrawn from the market, including the loaded trucks in transit.\n\n\u201cOur technical team in conjunction with NNPC Ltd and other industry stakeholders, will continue to monitor and ensure quality petroleum products are adequately supplied and distributed nationwide,\u201d it added.\n\nAccording to the agency, the \u201csource supplier\u201d has been identified and further commercial and appropriate actions shall be taken by the Authority and NNPC Ltd.\n\nIn addition, it noted that the NNPC Ltd and all oil marketing companies had been directed to sustain sufficient distribution of petrol in all retail outlets nationwide.\n\nSubsequently, the NDMPRA stated that the NNPC has intensified efforts at increasing the supply of the product into the market in order to bridge any unforeseen supply gap.\n\nMeanwhile, in separate interviews on Arise Television, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, National President of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Mr. Chinedu Okoronkwo and the Vice President of the union, Mr. Abubakar Maigandi, confirmed that the bad products were being withdrawn from circulation.\n\nWhile trying to play down the seriousness of the situation, Okoronkwo who absolved his members of any complicity in the matter, noted that \u201cin any given situation, business-wise, sometimes you might have ups and downs\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis time, we must let the world know that the Independent Marketers Association of Nigeria has never been part of any scarcity or whatever you may call it.\n\n\u201cOur own duty is to ensure that we get products and take to our station and retail to the masses. So moving forward, on the issue of this contaminated product, it is no more a hidden thing, but we have got an assurance from the NNPC that the fuel has been removed.\n\n\u201cAnd they have brought in new one now that we are now using. You know any ripples in the system for one or two days might exaggerate (extend) into one week,\u201d he posited.\n\nAccording to him, the hope was that the national oil company has now gotten its act together and had taken inventory of the contaminated product which had been withdrawn from circulation.\n\nHe argued that the complaints of vehicles breaking down had markedly subsided, meaning that good product was now in circulation, reassuring that the situation will normalise in days.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the market, you know that people are still buying now, which means the good one is coming into the system,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso in his remarks, Maigandi assured that: \u201cBy God\u2019s grace, today or tomorrow, the product will be available nationwide.\u201d\n\nOn the source of the bad fuel, he said: \u201cAll the marketers as you know, heavily depend on the NNPC. So we buy this product through the NNPC and private depots.\n\n\u201cThat is the source of our getting this product. But, you know, in every business, sometimes there must be an issue. And this issue has already been understood without much damage.\n\n\u201cAnd NNPC is working seriously to see that they get the correct product so that the marketers will continue loading. Already, we have told all our marketers to stand by and we have started receiving decontaminated products.\n\n\u201c You will see that the product will be available in most of our filling station nationwide. Normally we take precautionary measures immediately we bring the product into our filling stations,\u201d he explained.\n\nA day earlier, the South-West Zonal Chairman of IPMAN, Mr. Dele Tajudeen, had lamented that members of the association had suffered severe losses and may ask for damages from the authorities.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
