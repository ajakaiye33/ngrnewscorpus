          "title": "2023: APC govs, senators draw battle line over Ahmed Lawan",
          "text": "\u2026Intrigues heighten as influential presidential aspirant sponsors 7 co-contestants\n\n\u2026Party concludes screening of govs, senatorial candidates\n\nBy Omeiza Ajayi, ABUJA\n\nAhead of the presidential convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, indications have emerged of a battle of supremacy between state governors and senators over the party\u2019s choice of a presidential candidate.\n\nTrouble started with the senators\u2019 rejection of a request by President Muhammadu Buhari to expunge an aspect of the Electoral Act 2022 (as amended), which bars executive appointees from voting as delegates at party congresses and conventions.\n\nSection 84 (12) of the Electoral Act 2022 (As Amended) stipulates that political appointees, including ministers/commissioners and special advisers, must quit their offices to be eligible to participate either as delegates or contestants at the convention of their respective political parties.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nSpecifically, the section states that; \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the Convention or Congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election\u201d.\n\nFailed judicial bid\n\nAttempts by the executive to use the judiciary to delete that aspect of the law however fell flat, a development which Vanguard learned, forced some of the governors to vow that all Senators involved in drafting and supporting that portion Act would not get a return ticket.\n\nBefore now, state governors usually had the upper hand as most of their appointees including unelected local government administrators or caretaker chairmen formed part of the delegates they often took to the conventions.\n\nA party official who is in the know of the power play told Vanguard that the lawmakers have also vowed to queue behind the Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan, in his quest to clinch the APC presidential ticket.\n\nLawan was drafted into the race at the eleventh hour by some bigwigs in the party, who were initially backing an aspirant from the South-South. But following the discovery that the said aspirant could be impeded by the amended Electoral Act, the party chieftains switched their support to the Senate President.\n\n\u201cThe thinking is that the presidential candidate of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, is likely to emerge from the North, North-East precisely. If that happens that way, there are some chieftains who believe Lawan can fight anyone from the zone since he is also from there\u201d, said the party source.\n\n\u2018Legislators using Lawan as trump card\u2019\n\nNoting that Lawan has the support of his governor, Mai Mala Buni and Imo state Governor, Hope Uzodinma, the party official said the Senate President\u2019s camp is working on securing the support of more governors.\n\n\u201cHowever, the senators are also not backing down. If they won\u2019t get return tickets, they have also vowed to give their delegates to Lawan. Don\u2019t forget that some of them are former governors too and they are still very much on ground in their states.\n\n\u201cThe genesis of the matter is the new Electoral Act which has reduced the influence of state governors on party delegates,\u201d he said.\n\nAspirant sponsors 7 others\n\nMeanwhile, despite attempts by the party hierarchy to dissuade some wealthy politicians from sponsoring multiple candidates for the same seat, one of the influential presidential aspirants is alleged to have sponsored no fewer than seven of the 28 presidential aspirants in the APC.\n\nHowever, of the 28, both former President Goodluck Jonathan and Central Bank of Nigeria CBN Governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele, did not submit their forms while the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige withdrew from the race. Vanguard also gathered that a former national chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole did not eventually pick the presidential Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms.\n\nIn the past, with lower cost of nomination forms, the APC had often been confronted with a situation whereby an aspirant would procure forms for several others who would later announce their decision to step down for their sponsor.\n\n\u201cThe said aspirant sponsored about seven people. He bought the forms for them in spite of the cost. Some of those he bought the forms for are from the South-South and South-West. The reason is that he does not want a consensus arrangement. So, when there is a meeting of aspirants, he would have a lot of supporters among fellow aspirants.\n\n\u201cSince the law requires that aspirants who agree to a consensus arrangement would have to put it in writing, these sponsored aspirants would insist on not stepping down and where you have about eight people not agreeing to step down, of course, you have to go for the election \u2014 whether direct or indirect,\u201d said the source.\n\nParty concludes screening of govs, senatorial candidates\n\nThe APC has also concluded screening of 145 governorship aspirants and 351 senatorial aspirants. The screening of 1,197 aspirants for the House of Representatives was still ongoing as of press time Sunday evening.\n\nVanguard gathered that the 17 panels which undertook the screening had some challenges regarding the attitude of some of the aspirants who forgot to attend the exercise with vital documents.\n\n\u201cSome of them did not have tax clearance certificates. They had to be given time to go and bring them the same day. There were others who had not paid party dues in their wards for several months and as per the guidelines, we had to calculate that for them to pay and issue them receipts. Those were some of the challenges we encountered\u201d, said a member of one of the panels who said he was not authorised to address the media.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Therefore, any act of lawlessness and criminality must not be swept under the carpet.\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cThe Christian Association of Nigeria (19 Northern States and Abuja) is deeply saddened over the recent ugly development in Sokoto State, that led to the gruesome murder of Miss Deborah Samuel, a 200 Level female student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto for an alleged blasphemy.\n\n\u201cThe umbrella organisation of all Christians in Northern Nigeria condemn this gruesome and barbaric murder of Deborah in the strongest terms possible.\n\n\u201cWhile CAN does not and will not encourage casting aspersions on any Religion or religious leader of any faith, CAN frowns at hiding under the gab of any religious extremism to perpetrate any form of criminality against her members especially in Northern Nigeria. God Almighty is not and can never be a weak God for a mere mortal to fight and defend Him.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, it is He who keeps, watches and defends us. CAN believe that life is sacred and must never be taken by another unless as directed by the State.\n\n\u201cThe CAN (19 Northern States and Abuja) is calling on the Federal Government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari and the Sokoto State government under governor Aminu Tambuwal not to resort to the government usual rhetoric but must demonstrate political will and capacity to bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice; otherwise, others may take queues from this and turn our fatherland to a country of lawlessness at every slightest provocation.\n\n\u201cCAN, 19 Northern States, is calling on every christian parents across the nation, especially Northern states to discourage sending their children to any school in Sokoto State, pending when the Federal and State governments are ready and willing to secure the lives of our children both in Sokoto and other States that are hostile to Christians and Christianity.\n\n\u201cWe are urging all Christian leaders to terminate their participation in Nigerian Inter-Religious Council (NIREC), until their counterparts of Islamic faith show commitment to tame their followers on equal terms.\n\n\u201cNorthern CAN prays for the immediate family and indeed the church of late Deborah Samuel not to lose hope in God\u2019s ability to avenge the killers of their daughter.\n\n\u201cWe appeal and counsel those who feel and think that killing and oppressing Christians is a demonstration of their service to their God to learn from history. Those that tried it in Egypt and their experiences should be enough warning. There is a Red Sea awaiting them, even those who are secretly encouraging them, must partake in the Red Sea Experience.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, on Monday, tasked the Department of State Services to arrest the Chief Imam of Bayero University, Kano (BUK), Sheikh Abubakar Jibril, for allegedly inciting Muslims against the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Matthew Hassan-Kukah.\n\nHURIWA, in a statement by its National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, said Jibril was captured in a video that has gone viral allegedly telling his many Muslim followers to get the home address of Kukah and possibly attack the bishop if he is the person that sent Deborah Samuel Emmanuel Yakubu to the Shehu Shagari College of Education in Sokoto where she allegedly blasphemed against the prophet of Islam.\n\nRampaging hoodlums on Saturday vandalised at least two parishes presided over by Bishop Kukah and it took the swift response of security operatives to stop any attack on Kukah\u2019s personal residence.\n\nRioters had on Thursday stoned and burnt a 200-level Home Economics student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education in Sokoto, Deborah Yakubu, for alleged blasphemy of Prophet Muhammad (SAW).\n\nThe police arrested two suspects and protesters had demanded their release. The young demonstrators turned violent, vandalised, looted and burnt traders\u2019 shops, churches and residential apartments perceived to be owned by Christians.\n\nHURIWA accused security agencies as well as 18 of the 19 governors in the whole of northern Nigeria of supporting the brutal killing of blasphemers and for grooming Islamic extremists through the implementation of policies skewed in favour of Moslems to the neglect of many other citizens of other faiths and belief systems in those states.\n\nThe group cited Section 10 of the 1999 constitution as saying the government of the federation or of a state shall not adopt any religion as state religion.\n\nHURIWA\u2019s Onwubiko said, \u201cBy this statement, HURIWA is putting the Department of State Services on notice to hold Sheikh Abubakar Jibril accountable for the fatal mob attack on Kukah\u2019s parishes on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIn fact we think the constant bashing of spokespersons of President Muhammadu Buhari against Bishop Kukah each time the Cleric issues critiques of some anti people\u2019s and anti democracy thereby encouraging haters of truth and objectivity to target Right Reverend Bishop Mathew Hassan Kukah of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto for attacks by such Islamic fanatics as has just happened with the recorded video by the Sokoto Islamic preacher who openly incited his followers against Bishop Kukah.\n\n\u201cJibril, in a trending video, erroneously accused Bishop Kukah of motivating Deborah to commit alleged blasphemy and that he should stop or else he will be dealt with. The inflammatory cleric (Jibril) then asked if they know his (Kukah\u2019s) house and the listeners shouted, \u2018Yes we do\u2019. He is inciting them to attack Bishop Kukah.\n\n\u201cHURIWA charges the DSS to arrest Jibril immediately for questioning as the secret police had probed and persecuted the late deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Obadiah Mailafia; and other vocal Christian leaders like Kukah himself.\n\n\u201cAnything short of the arrest of Jibril is sentimental and condemnable. Nothing must happen to Kukah. Nigerians are watching and are not fools.\n\n\u201cHURIWA again enjoins all Nigerians of conscience to come out enmasse as announced by the Christian Association of Nigeria and protest the killing of Deborah to pressure the Muhammadu Buhari led government to serve justice on the matter and for her killers to be punished according to extant laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d",

This is why you see aspirants jostling for votes from delegates.\n\n\u201cWith the latest amendment to the Electoral Act 2022, which enables elected councillors to be statutory delegates, the number could increase. But PDP has substantially complied with Section 84(8) of the Electoral Act in its constitution.\n\n\u201cBut I think in the next few days, if the President assents to the amendment, PDP will decide on the way forward.\n\n\u201cSection 84 (8) as amended says: \u2018A political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidates shall clearly outline in its constitution and rules the procedure for the democratic election of delegates to vote at the convention, congress or meeting, in addition to Statutory delegates already prescribed in the constitution of the party.\u2019\n\n\u201cThose affected by this section are listed in the Explanatory Note to the amendment and they include elected councillors.\u201d\n\nAs of press time, it was gathered that the 13 PDP governors are divided over Atiku, Saraki, Wike and Tambuwal.\n\nIt was gathered that to win more votes, some presidential aspirants had been engaged in covert negotiations.\n\nAnother source added: \u201cAtiku\u2019s camp may likely have some collaboration with Governors Bala Mohammed and Aminu Tambuwal. This camp is already dangling the offer of the office of the President of the Senate President to Tambuwal if Atiku Abubakar is elected as President. Although Adamawa Governor Umaru Fintiri is from the same state as Atiku, Wike has been lobbying him for support.

Other aspirants are keen on Udom and Okowa as vice presidential candidates.\u201d\n\nFifteen aspirants have been cleared for the contest.\n\nA nine-man screening committee, led by ex-Senate President, David Mark, axed two of the 17 aspirants that submitted forms.\n\nThose disqualified are Cosmas Ndukwe, a lawmaker and a US-based medical doctor, Nwachukwu Anakwenze.\n\nThose cleared are ex-Vice President Atiku Abubakar, former Senate President Bukola Saraki, former Anambra State Governor Peter Obi, former Ekiti State Governor Ayo Fayose and the only female aspirant, Teriela Oliver.\n\nOthers are Tambuwal, Wike, Mohammed, Emmanuel and banker and economist, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen.\n\nOthers are former Senate President Pius Anyim; ex-President of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN) Sam Ohuabunwa; the Publisher Ovation Magazine, Dele Momodu; Charles Ugwu and Chikwendu Kalu.\n\nAn investigation by our correspondent revealed that most of the aspirants have received the list of delegates.\n\nIt was learnt that the aspirants and their strategists have premised their permutations on the list at their disposal.\n\nThe party was still keeping the list of delegates under wraps pending the conclusion of the election of delegates in some states like Zamfara and assent to the amended Section 84(8) of the Electoral Act by President Buhari.",

          "text": "Nigerians have taken to social media to demand justice over a sound engineer, David Imoh, 38, set ablaze at Lekki.\n\nThey asked the Police and State Government to bring the suspected culprits to book.\n\nThe Nation reports Imoh was lynched and subsequently set ablaze by a mob consisting of motorcycle operators on Thursday on his way home for reasons yet to be known.\n\nWhile an account claimed the disagreement was over N100, another alleged that Imoh and two of his friends were accused of kidnapping and attacked by the motorcyclists said to be of northern extraction.\n\nIt was alleged that Imoh boarded the motorcycle from a club to a location at Admiralty Way when a disagreement ensued between him and the rider.\n\nThe argument was said to have degenerated into a fight which attracted other motorcyclists.\n\nThey were said to have beaten the sound engineer and his friends who came to intervene with sticks, clubs and other dangerous instruments.\n\nLagos Police spokesman (PPRO), SP Benjamin Hundeyin, who confirmed the killing said all the culprits have been arrested.\n\nThe Nation observed the trending hashtag \u2013 #JusticeForDave has become a topic on social media especially on Twitter, with over 12,000 tweets.\n\nReacting, Journalist Abiodun Alade said: \u201cI am in shock, reading about what happened to David who was lynched and burned to death by a group of Okada riders at Lekki Phase 1. @jidesanwoolu has to get to the root of this. This is against everything that a mega city represents.\u201d\n\nGyal Eazzie @Gyal_eazzie tweeted: \u201c#JusticeForDave that was how this promising young man was killed for no reason. David used to be the sound engineer of my band before he moved to another one. The fact that beer band denied them is just really annoying and sad. Such a shame.\u201d\n\nFemi Balogun said: \u201cI don\u2019t think Lagos is as safe as many had thought. These guys from the north are all around us.

This Justice for Dave won\u2019t be here if he was helped in the first place.\u201d\n\n@lordesszzetta tweeted: Dave was not a yahoo boy. Dave was not a kidnapper nor a ritualist! Dave was a legit young hardworking sound engineer that was set on fire & killed by a mob for no just reason in front of the venue of his show on Admiralty road.

          "text": "A presidential aspirant, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, yesterday visited Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai and delegates in the state to the All Progressives Congress (APC) national convention, to canvass for support.\n\nAnother aspirant, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, last week visited the state and he was endorsed by the delegates.\n\nThere was confusion among the delegates yesterday, as the governor described Amaechi as President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s loyalist and confidant.\n\nAmaechi said he is young and the most experienced among the presidential aspirants, adding that the presidency required agility of a young man, hence elderly people should go home and rest.\n\nPresenting the Transport minister to the delegates, Governor El-Rufai, who described Amaechi as his own friend and confidant of President Buhari, said the minister won Buhari\u2019s heart in 2011 when as a PDP governor of Rivers State, he funded the convention of Buhari\u2019s Congress for Progressive Change (CPC)\n\nReminding the delegates of their endorsement of Tinubu, El-Rufai said: \u201cMany people contesting election always say delegates will hardly make heaven, because they don\u2019t keep to promise. But I always say Kaduna delegates are different.\u201d\n\nThe governor, as he did during Tinubu\u2019s visit, however, asked the delegates what their answer to Amaechi would be. But unlike the thunderous declaration of support for Tinubu, the delegates murmured.\n\nEl-Rufai said: \u201cAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu was here two days ago and you promised him support. Today, here is my friend, my confidant, what are you going to say?\n\n\u201cMany people contesting election always say delegates will hardly make heaven, because they don\u2019t keep to promise. But I always say Kaduna delegates are different. You were in a hurry and didn\u2019t listen to what others aspirants will tell you. Amaechi is here and I told you that the Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, is also coming after him. Governor Kayode Fayemi is also coming. Also, my big brother who took CPC, Pastor Tunde Bakare, is also coming. As a result of that, you should be prepared and know what to tell them.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you people something. In 2011 when we were in CPC, we were to go to convention and we didn\u2019t have money. Amaechi then was governor of Rivers State under the PDP. I don\u2019t know how he got to know, then he asked how much was needed to hold the convention, and he gave the money. It was the money we used for the 2011 convention.\n\n\u201cSince then, President Buhari asked me to continue talking to him. When they were meeting, thinking of defecting to APC, we used to meet with the seven governors before two chickened out. Amaechi turned his back against his own neighbour, Goodluck Jonathan and said he was going to follow Buhari. He held on to that trust. That was why Daura Emirate gave him that title of Dan Amanan Daura.\n\n\u201cWe are followers of Buhari. It is what he tells us that we do. So, here is my friend and Buhari\u2019s loyalist, what are you going to do? You should know, after today\u2019s discussion, there are going to be discussions.\n\n\u201cOthers will come too, but who is your friend? Who is your loyalist?\n\n\u201cThere was a time when I was in the opposition, the DSS were looking for me, they wanted to arrest me. Amaechi told me where to go and wait for him. I waited and he drove me to the DSS himself and he insisted that I should be questioned and released to him the same day and that was what happened. So, who is my friend? Who is my confidant?\n\n\u201cNow, I am going to ask you people two questions, one you can answer, the other you can choose not to answer. Have we agreed that it is justice that the presidency should go back to the South?\u201d\n\nThe delegates replied: \u2018Yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second one is, Asiwaju came last Thursday, now Amaechi is here, what are you going to say, or are you going to tell me later?\u201d Then, the delegates went into murmuring.\n\nAmaechi said he was one of the youngest of all the presidential aspirants in his party, the APC, adding that \u201cour elders should go home and rest.\u201d\n\nHe said, he governed a state that was ravaged at the time with insecurity, but was able to successfully tame the situation and expressed confidence that if elected as president, he would do same in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI will continue with President Buhari\u2019s agricultural transformation to address hunger,\u2019 Amaechi said, adding that the administration of President Buhari inherited poverty, but had been able to change the situation positively.\n\n\u201cYou need to vote for a candidate that will protect and provide for all, regardless of region, religion and tribe. This is what I am promising you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs Speaker of Rivers State House of Assembly, I was elected Chairman of Nigerian Speakers twice and as Governor, I was also elected Chairman, Nigeria Governors Forum twice. It shows I have what it takes to govern. I am asking you not to waste Kaduna votes. Please give me your votes and I will come back to Kaduna to thank you,\u201d Amaechi said.",

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Okwe Obi, Abuja, Abuja, Noah Ebije, Kaduna, Gyang Bere, Jos\n\nTension and fears of possible breakdown of law and order have gripped Maiduguri, Borno State, following reported attempt on the life of a lady alleged to have blasphemed Islam.\n\nThe lady identified as Naomi Gomi is alleged to have committed blasphemy with her comment on a trending post on Facebook in reaction to the lynching of Deborah Samuel, a 200-level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto (SSCOE), who was burnt to death by alleged Islamic extremists last week\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nHer comment triggered sharp reactions as someone volunteered the lady\u2019s location and house with a warning to get her. The threat by some people to give her Deborah treatment made security agents to evacuate her and her family late Saturday. Security agencies were subsequently placed on red alert as the police and other sister agencies were seen patrolling the streets of Maiduguri to nip any uprising in the bud.\n\nMeanwhile, outrage and condemnation have continued to trail the lynching of Deborah. While the Northern Governors Forum condemned the act of self-help as exhibited by the mob saying it could threaten law, order, general peace and security of the society, popular Kaduna-based Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, told those that participated in the act that they would not make paradise.\n\nAlso, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) from 19 Northern states and Abuja, conglomerates of Fellowship of Churches of Christ in Nigeria, known as Tarayyar Ekklesiyoyin Kristi a Nijeria (TEKAN), Catholic Laity Council of Nigeria, and Are Onakankafo of Yorubaland, Otunba Gani Adams, yesterday, joined in condemning Deborah\u2019s killing, describing it as an evil act.This is as the Sokoto State Government announced the suspension of the resumption of basic and secondary schools in the state by one week. The schools were initially scheduled to resume yesterday and today for boarding and day students. Also, corps members serving, especially those in the Sokoto metropolis, have been advised to remain at home due to the 24-hour curfew. This was contained in another statement from the spokesperson of the scheme in Sokoto State, Malam Sani Idris.\n\nChairman, Northern Governors Forum and Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong in a statement said the governors were concerned about the development which is clearly an extra-judicial measure of addressing perceived infraction.\n\nLalong said any attempt to adopt self-help in addressing grievances whether religious or otherwise, would only lead to further chaos that could threaten law, order, general peace and security of the society.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nWhile commiserating with the family of the victim, Lalong said Northern governors want security agencies to be allowed to thoroughly investigate the matter and ensure that the law took its full course on anyone found wanting.\n\nThe governors also appealed for calm following reports of the hijack of a peaceful protest which later turned violent and led to the imposition of a curfew in Sokoto metropolis.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nSheikh Gumi, in one of his preachings at Sultan Bello Mosque in Kaduna, said any Muslim who kills a Christian in Nigeria because the prophet was allegedly insulted would not smell paradise.\n\nHe said Nigeria was not an Islamic State and that Muslims in the country have agreement with people of other faiths to live together peacefully and that anyone who kills them on religious guise has committed a grievous sin.\n\nThe Islamic scholar said it was unfortunate that some Muslim clerics were quoting verses they do not understand and telling people to kill whoever insults their religion.\n\nQuoting some Quranic verses and jurisprudence, the cleric said Killing a non-Muslim under the guise that the person uttered a blasphemous statement against Prophet Muhammad is not an excuse, \u201cbecause Allah has told us in the Qur\u2019an that the non-Muslims will insult Allah and His Prophet. In fact, it is now that the blasphemy will start after the killing of that lady in Sokoto, the insult will increase, not reduce.\u201d\n\nGumi said some Muslims of Nigeria that want to defend Prophet Muhammad should be ashamed of themselves because they are corrupt, adding that the best way to go if we want to defend the Prophet is to follow his teachings.\n\nRegardless, CAN from 19 Northern states and Abuja have demanded that all christian leaders terminate their participation in Nigerian Inter-Religious Council (NIREC), until their counterparts in Islamic faith show commitment to tame their followers on equal terms.\n\nIts spokesperson, Jechonia Gilbert, in a statement condemned what it termed gruesome and barbaric murder of Deborah Samuel by some religious extremists. The organisation said Nigeria is a country governed by the rule of law and order, hence any act of lawlessness and criminality must not be swept under the carpet. It also discouraged Christian parents across the nation especially, Northern states from sending their children to any school in Sokoto State, pending when the federal and state governments would be willing to secure the lives of students both in Sokoto and other states that are hostile to Christians and Christianity.\n\nCAN also called on the Federal and Sokoto State government not to resort to usual rhetorics but demonstrate political will and capacity to bring the perpetrators of the criminality to justice, otherwise, others may take queue from it and turn Nigeria to a country of lawlessness at every slightest provocation.\n\n\u201cWhile CAN does not and will not encourage casting aspersions on any religion or religious leader of any faith, it frowns at hiding under the gab of any religious extremism to perpetrate any form of criminality against its members especially in Northern Nigeria. God Almighty is not and can never be a weak God for mere mortal to fight and defend Him. On the contrary, it is He who keeps, watches and defends us. CAN believe that life is sacred and must never be taken by another unless as directed by the State. We appeal and counsel those who feel and think that killing and oppressing Christians is a demonstration of their service to their God to learn from history. Those that tried it in Egypt and their experiences should be enough warning. There is a Red Sea awaiting them, even those who are secretly encouraging them, must partake in the Red Sea experience,\u201d CAN warned.",

CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nHe was received by a crowd of supporters at the airport and on the streets, APC chieftains and senior state government officials, led by Secretary to the State Government, Abdulkadir Adamu, who represented Governor Badaru Abubakar who was out of the state.\n\nAt a town hall meeting with delegates, the vice president restated his view that decisions about the 2023 elections should be based on what should be the best for the country.\n\n\u201cWe should make a decision based on the future of our children; we can make progress; we can move on. All I ask you to do is what is in the best interest of Nigeria; vote in the interest of our children.\u201d\n\nHe also restated how his training and experience in governance serving as deputy under President Muhammadu Buhari would help him to lead the country effectively as president.\n\nMohammed, who was in Anambra, Ebonyi and Enugu, at the weekend, said the South East and North East have the most legitimate claim to the presidency as both zones were yet to produce a president. Nevertheless, he pledged to support who ever emerges as candidate so as to ensure the opposition party wrests power from the APC.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nAddressing delegates in Anambra, he noted that if elected, he would offer visionary leadership and tackle the myriad of problems confronting the country. He told Ebonyi and Enugu delegates that he would run an all-inclusive government and implored them to support him to clinch the PDP presidential ticket.\n\nIn a related development, Saraki said if elected, he would deploy technology to combat security challenges facing the country and put an end to it.\n\nResponding to questions from newsmen after a meeting with delegates in Kogi State, he said he has the solutions to all the problems confronting the nation.\n\nAccording to him, since the beginning of the current democratic settings in 1999, the North Central zone has not been given any opportunity to clinch the presidency, adding that the time is now ripe.He also said if elected, he would give equal opportunities to all irrespective of tribe and religion to attain the peak in their chosen careers.\n\nA\u2019Ibom gov denies blocking Atiku from seeing delegates\n\nGovernor Emmanuel Udom of Akwa Ibom State and PDP presidential candidate, has denied plans to shield Akwa Ibom delegates from Abubakar Atiku, describing the rumour as the handiwork of mischief-makers trying to divert attention.\n\nA statement by Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Ini Ememobong, described the alleged plot as spurious allegations, laced with foul and profane language.\n\n\u201cNothing can be farther from the truth as this. The said news is totally incompatible with the known accommodating disposition of Governor Emmanuel.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the governor, who has been in communication and contact with all other presidential aspirants (Atiku inclusive) was informed the former vice president will be visiting today to meet with delegates and thereafter see him (Governor Emmanuel) by 4pm, a proposal that was unhesitatingly accepted. It is, therefore, pure mischief for anyone to insinuate that the governor is preventing Atiku from seeing delegates. Other presidential aspirants have visited the party in Akwa Ibom without a hitch, so why would Atiku\u2019s be different?\n\n\u201cIn the light of current circumstances surrounding Atiku\u2019s media posture, especially online, we will like to discard the news item as not coming from him or his media handlers.We also want to believe this spurious statement does not have the authorisation of the presidential aspirant himself, especially since the allegation is not personally signed off and is not posted on any of his verified social media accounts. We urge the public to discountenance the fake news and treat it as an act of mischief of the highest order.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cOur delegates and team are waiting to receive the aspirant on the agreed date and time,\u201d he said.\n\nSpokesperson for the Udom Emmanuel Presidential Campaign Council, Bola Bolawole, said Governor Emmanuel is noted as an apostle of politics without bitterness.\n\nSenate: APC clears Nwaoboshi, Dafinone, Onowakpor\n\nAPC senatorial screening committee, yesterday, screened three senatorial aspirants from Delta State.\n\nThey include Peter Nwaoboshi, incumbent senator representing Delta North, former chairman of the state board of internal revenue, Joel-Onowakpo (Delta South); and Ede Dafinone (Delta Central.)\n\nSpeaking after his screening, Onowakpo said the screening has cleared way for him to face other contenders if any, adding that with God on his side, his supporters and the implicit confidence the party leadership has in him, he was confident the journey to the red chambers has been shortened.\n\nHe insisted that the APC was prepared more than ever before to take over Delta State in 2023. He said the ongoing exodus from the PDP to APC is enough evidence to the fact that the people of the state have embraced the APC because of the calibre of men presently piloting the affairs of the party in the state.\n\n\u2026 Onolemenme solicits delegates\u2019 votes, promises to transform Esanland\n\nA contender for the Edo Central senatorial seat, Mike Onolemenme, has solicited PDP delegates votes with a promise to transform Esanland from a largely rural place to an urban setting if voted to win the party ticket.\n\nThe former minister of works made the plea to individual delegates via a voice note he sent to all delegates of the senatorial district.\n\n\u201cI am personally soliciting your votes in the upcoming primary that will take place on Saturday, May 21, 2022\u201d, he said, adding that so much is at stake for the senatorial district.\n\nHe, therefore, said the delegates must get it right for Esan people.\n\n\u201cI am banking on you to win the primary. There is so much at stake. And we must get it right for Esan people. Engage and talk to other delegates you know to vote for me,\u201d he said.\n\nHe believed he can win the primary with votes from the delegates and go on to win the general election.\n\n\u201cIt is an important election that has the potential to transform Esan land from rural enclave to urban area with enhanced standards of living.\n\n\u201cSince an election can be won by a single vote, your votes matter, I assure you, you will not regret supporting me and your votes will be a step forward to making Esan land a better place,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "\n\n*Anyone who kills Christian will not see paradise, Islamic scholar says\n\n*Kaigama says efforts at inter-religious harmony must not stop *Northern states chapter of CAN urge boycott of inter-religious council\n\n*Tinubu, Obi, Saraki, Amaechi, Bello, Bakare, Wike, others keep mum over killing\n\n*Azman Air disclaims Capt. Abubakar\n\n\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja, Chinedu Eze in Lagos, Seriki Adinoyi in Jos, John Shiklam in Kaduna, Segun Awofadeji in Gombe\n\nNorthern States Governors Forum (NSGF) and Kaduna-based Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, yesterday, joined the growing number of groups and individuals that have condemned last Thursday\u2019s mob killing of Deborah Samuel, a student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, for alleged blasphemy against Prophet Mohammed.\n\n\n\nChairman of the forum and governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, in a statement signed by his media aid, Macham Makut, said the governors were concerned about the development, which they described as clearly an extra-judicial measure of addressing perceived infraction.\n\nThe statement came as Catholic Archbishop of Abuja Archdiocese, Most Rev. Ignatius Kaigama, said Nigerians should not succumb to the machinations of the evil ones by halting the pursuit of brotherhood and peaceful coexistence.\n\n\n\nIn its own reaction, the umbrella organisation of all Christians in Northern Nigeria at the weekend condemned what it described as gruesome and barbaric murder of Deborah. In a statement signed by the Public Relations Officer, Chaplain Jechonia Gilbert, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the 19 northern states urged \u201call Christian leaders to terminate their participation in Nigerian Inter-Religious Council (NIREC)\u201d until Islamic leaders demonstrate genuine commitment to controlling and disciplining their unruly followers.\n\n\n\nHowever, over 72 hours after the cold-blooded murder in Sokoto, frontline aspirants in the 2023 presidential race were yet to comment on the incident. All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader and former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu; immediate past Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi; former Anambra State governor, Peter Obi; former Senate President, Bukola Saraki; Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello; Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike; and Pastor Tunde Bakare had yet to comment at the time of filing this report.\n\n\n\nThe Sokoto incident, which has created religious tension, has effectively dashed any hope of a Muslim-Muslim ticket in the current political climate, as some would have wanted. analysts have pointed\n\nBut Nigeria\u2019s domestic carrier, Azman Air, disowned a pilot, Capt Jamil Abubakar, who expressed support for the killing of the late Deborah. Abubakar came under fire for a statement he made via his Twitter handle, defending the killing of Deborah.\n\n\n\nIn a tweet from its verified Twitter handle, #LetsFlyAzmanAir, Azman Air stated, \u201cCapt Jamil Abubakar is no longer a pilot @AzmanAir: his last flight with us was 22nd Dec 2019. We refuse to take responsibility for a comment or view of a former staff. The general public should kindly take note.\u201d\n\nIn a move to avert a major religious crisis over the killing of the 200-level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, the state governor, Aminu Tambuwal, had at the weekend declared a 24-hour curfew in Sokoto metropolis.\n\n\n\nThe curfew came as the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Matthew Hassan-Kukah, suspended all masses in Sokoto metropolis, but clarified that his residence was not attacked.\n\nThe remains of Deborah were at the weekend laid to rest in her home town, Tunga Magajiya, in Rijau Local Government Area of Niger State.\n\n\n\nFollowing the protests in Sokoto, Governor Nasir-el-Rufai of Kaduna State had also banned any form of religious protest across the state.\n\nCAN had at the weekend called on all its members to embark on peaceful protests nationwide on May 22, 2022.\n\nThe declaration of the curfew in Sokoto followed protests by some Islamic faithful that greeted the condemnation of the killing by the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III.\n\n\n\nThe northern governors, in the statement, stressed that any attempt to adopt self-help in addressing grievances, whether religious or otherwise, would only lead to further chaos that could threaten law and order as well as the general peace and security of the society. While commiserating with the family of the victim, Lalong said in the statement that the northern governors wanted the security agencies to be allowed to thoroughly investigate the matter and ensure that the law took its full course on anyone found wanting.\n\n\n\nThe northern governors also appealed for calm following reports about the hijack of a peaceful protest, which later turned violent and led to the imposition of a curfew in Sokoto metropolis.\n\nLalong also extended the support and commiserations of the forum to Tambuwal over the incident and commended his proactive efforts to restore normalcy. The forum assured the Sokoto State governor of its solidarity and prayers in dealing with the matter as well as ensuring that all necessary measures were taken to forestall future occurrence in any part of the region and country at large.\n\n\n\nNSGF also reminded citizens of the region and Nigerians of the need to continue to show love, tolerance and respect for one another, irrespective of faith, ethnicity or other affiliations.\n\n\n\nOn his part, Gumi, speaking during his daily preaching at the Sultan Bello Mosque, Kaduna, in a video clip shared on his Facebook page, declared that any Muslim who killed a Christian in Nigeria because the prophet was insulted would not smell paradise. He maintained that Nigeria was not an Islamic state, adding that Muslims in the country have agreement with people of other faiths to live together peacefully. He stressed that anyone who killed on religious guise had committed a grievous sin.\n\n\n\nGumi said it was unfortunate that some Muslim clerics were quoting verses they did not understand and telling people to kill whoever insulted their religion.\n\nQuoting several verses from the Qur\u2019an and Islamic jurisprudence, Gumi said killing a non-Muslim under the guise that the person uttered a blasphemous statement against Prophet Muhammad was not an excuse, \u201cbecause Allah has told us in the Qur\u2019an the non-Muslims will insult Allah and His Prophet.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn fact, it is now the blasphemy will start after the killing of that lady in Sokoto, the insult will increase, not reduce.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSome Muslims in Nigeria that want to defend Prophet Mohammed should be ashamed of themselves because they are corrupt\u2026\n\n\u201cThe best way to go, if we want to defend the Prophet, is to follow his teachings. We, the clerics, need to wake up and teach Muslims their religion. We must leave this state of ignorance; we have turned like animals. We, the Muslims, are not the only ones in this country.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is not only that we are not the only ones in this country, we must know that there was nothing the unbelievers did not do to Prophet Mohammed, but he was patient, because he was conscious that if he killed them, the unbelievers he was trying to bring to the fold of Islam will tag him a killer.\n\n\u201cThere are people who are neither Muslims nor Christians in Nigeria, and everyone is trying to win their souls. Also, there people who are not Muslims, whom we are preaching Islam to, so that they can enter the fold of Islam and be salvage in the hereafter.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we now begin to kill people, they will say it is even from the leader of our faith, Prophet Mohammed, that we have learnt it.\n\n\u201cThey will say their religion is a religion of bloodletting. At a time we are trying to draw attention of people to see the beauty of Islam, we are now scaring them away.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that we even see some clerics who are telling people that whoever insults your religion, just kill then. They are quoting verses they don\u2019t understand.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no one who has the will to kill anyone except through the Islamic justice system. And in doing this, the conditions of such justice must be completed before anyone can be killed.\u201d\n\nGumi further stated, \u201cOur religion is a civilised religion. The white people learnt rule of law from Islam. But today, we are the ones in this level of lack of civilisation, to the extent that an Islamic cleric is quoting Qur\u2019an and Hadith spreading and encouraging barbarism.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople that have not been able to perfect their own act of worship the way they are supposed to. People who don\u2019t know how to pray properly are now the ones that say they want to dispense justice to people who commit blasphemy.\n\n\u201cWhat people don\u2019t know is that, in the Islamic perspective, the world is divided into two \u2013 the Islamic world and the non-Islamic world. That is countries that are governed by the Islamic law and those that are governed by other laws.\n\n\n\n\u201cThose who are not Muslims are divided into two \u2013 there are non-Muslims that you engage in war, and there non-Muslims that you have agreement with. Those you have agreement with are also divided into two \u2013 those who are living under the Islamic laws and those that are not bound by the Islamic laws.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s non-Muslims are not living under the Islamic laws, we all have an agreement under the Nigerian constitution to live together. So, Prophet Muhammad said whoever kills a soul of non-Muslim that is under such agreement of living together will not smell the fragrance of paradise, such person\u2019s distance to paradise will be like a journey of 40 years.\n\n\n\n\u201cKilling a non-Muslim under the guise that the person uttered a blasphemous statement against Prophet Mohammed is not an excuse, because Allah has told us in the Qur\u2019an the non-Muslims will insult Allah and His Prophet. In fact, it is now the blasphemy will start after the killing of that lady in Sokoto, the insult will increase, not reduce.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat Allah asked us to do in the face of blasphemy in a society, like ours, is to be patient and preach to the people and make them understand our religion. In our kind of society, we don\u2019t have the right to kill for blasphemy, otherwise, even many people who call themselves Islamic clerics who have equally been killed because they have fallen into blasphemy by calling Allah human being or saying they know tomorrow or those who have indirectly turned to Babalawo.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Prophet told us that a time will come towards the end time, when people will feel like taking other people\u2019s life. So, he said, instead of doing that, it is better for you to look for a rock and be boxing it, so that you don\u2019t (have) the urge of killing anytime.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, who do we leave just justice for in the face of blasphemy? It is the authority. We don\u2019t have the right to take up arms and kill anyone, except in self-defence, like when some comes for your life or an armed robber invades your house. You are not the one to defend Islam, in fact, you are making the work of those calling people into Islam difficult.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe right thing the students who killed the lady in Sokoto ought to do is to report her to the school management, then the management reports to the governor or Sultan for them to know how to stop her. Just by hearing her commit blasphemy, you just went and carried out jungle justice on her, who taught you that? What do you want our country to turn into? We must leave these acts of barbarism.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs it even we, the Muslims of Nigeria, that want to defend Prophet Muhammad? We that are corrupt? We that cannot even be differentiated from unbelievers in corrupts acts. The best way to go if we want to defend the Prophet, is to follow his examples by being upright in all fronts.\u201d\n\nKaigama Says Efforts at Inter-religious Harmony Must Not Stop\n\nSpeaking during his homily at St. Louis Church, Efab Global Estate, Abuja, against the backdrop of last week\u2019s murder of Deborah Samuel, Kaigama said Nigerians should not give up on the pursuit of brotherhood and peaceful coexistence, but \u201cmust continue to speak up in a common voice and act in solidarity with one another against the evils of our time.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a related development, the Christian Association of Nigeria, YOWICAN (Youth Wing), asked security agencies to stop the molestation of Christians to avoid a religious war.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday by Chairman of YOWICAN, Belusochukwu Enwere, the association said, \u201cToday is the 4th day Miss Deborah Samuel was killed by Muslim extremist students who chose to take laws in their hands and yet most of our Nigerian political class who are gunning to lead us as a country failed to condemn or to commiserate with the bereaved family.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven after killing Deborah the miscreants continued to destroy people\u2019s properties, burning of church facilities, and going from house to house intimidating peaceful Christians. The security agencies should do the needful before this becomes a religious war.\n\n\u201cWe call on all Christian youths to continue to be peaceful and do not take laws in their hands. God must surely fight to avenge the killing of Deborah. Her death will unearth evil agenda of the wicked ones in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNorthern States Chapter of CAN Urges Boycott of Inter-religious Council\n\nThe umbrella organisation of all Christians in Northern Nigeria at the weekend condemned the barbaric murder of Deborah. A statement by the public relations officer, Chaplain Jechonia Gilbert, CAN insisted that the assailants must be brought to justice.\n\nCAN in the 19 northern states called on every Christian parent across the country, especially the northern states, to discourage sending their children to schools in Sokoto State until the federal and Sokoto State governments were ready and willing to secure the lives of their children both in Sokoto and other states \u201cthat are hostile to Christians and Christianity.\u201d\n\n\n\nCAN said in the statement, \u201cWe are urging all Christian leaders to terminate their participation in Nigerian Inter-Religious Council (NIREC), until their counterparts of Islamic faith show commitment to tame their followers on equal terms. Northern CAN prays for the immediate family and, indeed, the church of late Deborah Samuel not to lose hope in God\u2019s ability to avenge the killers of their daughter.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe appeal and counsel those who feel and think that killing and oppressing Christians is a demonstration of their service to their God to learn from history. Those that tried it in Egypt and their experiences should be enough warning. There is a Red Sea awaiting them, even those who are secretly encouraging them, must partake in the Red Sea experience.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe association added, \u201cWhile the CAN does not and will not encourage casting aspersions on any religion or religious leader of any faith, CAN frowns at hiding under the gab of any religious extremism to perpetrate any form of criminality against her members, especially in Northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cGod Almighty is not and can never be a weak God for mere mortal to fight and defend Him. On the contrary, it is He who keeps, watches and defends us. CAN believes that life is sacred and must never be taken by another unless as directed by the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe CAN (19 Northern States and Abuja) is calling on the federal government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari and the Sokoto State government under Governor Aminu Tambuwal not to resort to the government\u2019s usual rhetoric but must demonstrate political will and capacity to bring the perpetrators of this criminality to justice; otherwise, others may take queue from this and turn our father land to a country of lawlessness at every slightest provocation.\u201d\n\nTEKAN/ECWA Youths Condemn Killing of Deborah\n\nThe national body of Tarayar Ekklisiyoyin Kristi A Nigeria (Hausa, Fulani and Kanuri Christians) and the Evangelical Church Winning All (TEKAN/ECWA) youth block, at the weekend, condemned the killing of Deborah Samuel.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Gombe, National Youth Leader of the block, Jim James Amos, described the killing as an unwarranted jungle justice meted out to Deborah by Islamic extremists.\n\n\n\nTEKAN/ECWA also called for calm, saying, \u201cAs law abiding citizens, we call on all Christian youths to remain calm, law abiding and desist from taking laws into their hands, let us leave everything in the hands of God Almighty who is the final judge.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe youth group commended all organisations and individuals (both Christians and Muslims) that came out to condemn the gruesome murder. It also called on the federal and Sokoto State governments to rise up to the occasion by doing the needful, saying the world is watching.\n\n\n\nIt said, \u201cWe are aware that many organisations have called for the arrest and prosecution of the culprits, we make bold to say that the national and state assemblies must, as a matter of urgency, enact a law that handles such issues.\n\n\u201cAt this moment of grief, when our sister is being buried as we speak, we wish to commensurate with the church in Nigeria, TEKAN/ECWA block, CAN in Sokoto and Kebbi states, the Zuru people, and the immediate family and extended family of Late Deborah Samuel Yakubu.\u201d\n\nNHRC Condemns Deborah\u2019s Killing, Calls for Immediate Prosecution of Culprits\n\nThe National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) condemned the killing of Deborah Samuel, a second-year student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, for alleged blasphemy.\n\nThe Governing Council of the commission, while reacting to the killing on Sunday, in a statement, said that there was no law, either secular or religious in a democratic society, anywhere in the world that justified the killing of any person without due process of the law.\n\n\n\nIt urged all persons to exercise tolerance over religious matters, while tasking the relevant authorities, particularly the police, to thoroughly investigate and prosecute the culprits, who had been, reportedly, arrested as well as put necessary mechanisms in place to effect the arrest of every other person involved in the gruesome murder, with a view to bringing all perpetrators to book and preventing future occurrence.\n\nIt stated that the consequence of inaction now by the law enforcement agencies could be a recurrence In the near future.\n\n\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThe commission used the opportunity to condemn all acts of religious extremism in the country and appeals to all parties in this matter as well as the concerned public to remain calm even in the face of this provocative and dastardly act, while awaiting the report of the police investigation into the incident, adding that two wrongs cannot make a right.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe council also expressed its heartfelt condolences to the family of the late victim, Deborah, and other families who had lost their loved ones under similar conditions, assuring them that the commission will work with relevant bodies to ensure that justice is served in such cases.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Friends say he will take unpaid leave after convention if successful\n\n*Activists keep mum\n\nThe President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, who is among the 25 presidential aspirants that submitted forms for screening under the All Progressives Congress (APC) has intensify lobby for the party\u2019s ticket as THISDAY learnt that last week, he met Mallam Mamman Daura, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s nephew and one of those very few persons that have the president\u2019s ears.\n\n\n\nA source told THISDAY that the meeting held behind closed doors as Adesina continues to lobby of Buhari\u2019s circle.\n\n\u201cHe met him sometimes last week. His car was sighted entering Mamman Daura\u2019s house during the week. Beyond Mamman Daura, he is also reaching out to Buhari\u2019s relatives in Niger Republic, to see if they can convince Buhari to back him,\u201d the source who pleaded to remain anonymous added.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY had reported last week that some African leaders have mounted pressure on Buhari to anoint Adesina, as the presidential candidate of the APC in the 2023 general election. To this end, former President Olusegun Obasanjo, is said to have given Adesina his full backing.\n\n\n\nA reliable source had told THISDAY that leaders in West Africa, including the presidents of Niger and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, had spoken to Buhari on behalf of the AfDB president.\n\nThe West African leaders were reported to have met Buhari in Abidjan last week, where the president attended a two-day conference organised by the United Nations, to try and persuade him to consider Adesina.\n\n\n\nAdesina is expected to contest the ruling party\u2019s ticket with the likes of the Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo; Bola Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos; outgoing Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, now former Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, among others. Delegates of the ruling party are expected to pick a presidential candidate between May 30th and June 1st.\n\n\n\nLast week, a coalition made up of 28 groups bought the form for Adesina worth N100 million. One of the leaders of the coalition, Ademola Babatunde, had said they put their resources together to purchase the form because APC\u2019s fee was outrageous.\n\n\n\nA friend of the AfDB President said Adesina has concluded plan to take an unpaid leave from the bank if he gets the party\u2019s ticket, to enable him campaign around the country.\n\n\n\nHowever, analysts have expressed concern that activists in the country have kept mum despite the fact that Adesina, the head of a continental multilateral institution was still holding onto him job despite having submitted his forms to contest for the presidential ticket of the APC.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy are those who were raising their voices when a group purchased forms for the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria not saying anything about Adesina? Adesina has submitted his forms and has been shortlisted for screening, even when the AfDB doesn\u2019t allow politics, why are they not calling for his resignation as well? He signed his form for submission, so no one can claim he is not aware of it or claim that a group bought the form in his name without his knowledge,\u201d the analyst who pleaded to remain anonymous wondered.\n\n\n\nThe confidential source further disclosed that, for Adesina to submit his form, he had to submit a sworn affidavit and evidence of his APC membership card which he is said to have done in full compliance with the requirements.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "* Lampoons Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil for not investing enough in country\u2019s oil, gas sector\n\n*Nigeria remains at the heart of our strategy, says multinational oil company\n\n*Declares interest to expand into electricity sector\n\nPeter Uzoho\n\nThe federal government has disclosed that French oil major, TotalEnergies EP Nigeria Limited, has invested almost $30 billion in Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector within the space of eight years. It said the company had made a lot of investments in developing the country\u2019s oil resources since it began operation in the last 60 years.\n\n\n\nThe government criticised Shell, ExxonMobil and Chevron \u2013 three of the five oil majors in the country \u2013 over their apparent withdrawal from investing further in Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector, urging them to emulate TotalEnergies\u2019 sustained investments in the country and resume their investments.\n\n\n\nExecutive Secretary of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Mr. Simbi Wabote, made the assertions at the weekend in Lagos, at the TotalEnergies\u2019 EP Nigeria\u2019s 60th anniversary dinner.\n\nThe French oil giant said Nigeria remained at the heart of its strategy, and indicated plans to expand its business into the country\u2019s electricity sector. It stressed that the sector offered exciting opportunities that it would like to explore.\n\n\n\nWabote said TotalEnergies had invested immensely in Nigeria and deserved commendation for remaining consistent in investing in the country\u2019s oil sector. He said with the amount of investments TotalEnergies had put into the country\u2019s oil and gas sector since its entrance into the space, there was no basis for comparing it with that of Shell, Chevron and ExxonMobil.\n\n\n\nWabote stated, \u201cTotal has invested so much in Nigeria since the last 60 years. At the last count, we are looking at almost $30 billion worth of investment in Nigeria within a space of eight years.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe amount of money Total has invested in this country, when you compare that with other IOCs, like Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, there is no basis for comparison.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpecifically criticising Shell for refusing to invest to develop the protracted Bonga Southwest project, which had been on the drawing board for many decades, Wabote said on the other hand, TotalEnergies had started and completed many projects that were producing oil and gas in the country.\n\n\n\nBonga Southwest is among the oil assets that the government has been banking on to achieve its plan of increasing Nigeria\u2019s oil reserves and production.\n\n\n\nAccording to Wabote, \u201cWe started discussing Bonga Southwest before I was born, Total took FID \u2013 (Final Investment Decision) on Usan. We were still discussing Bonga Southwest when I got married, Total took FID on Egina. We were still discussing Bonga Southwest, when I had my first child, Total took FID on Ikike. I will go on and on and on.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe executive secretary argued that his job as local content chief executive would not have existed if there was no project, adding that he needs no apology for praising companies keeping him on the service through undertaking projects that create value for the country.\n\n\n\nWabote added, \u201cLet me use Total to challenge Shell. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve not seen Chevron here and I\u2019ve not seen ExxonMobil. I will use Total to continue to challenge them. Total is also one of the investors of NLNG Train 7, which is about the most important investment in the whole of the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, we should understand what Total is doing. This is a celebration that we should all partake, for keeping faith in this country, remaining in this country for 60 years is no mean feat. I encourage you to, please, remain with us.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn his address, President, Exploration and Production, TotalEnergies Group, Mr. Nicolas Terraz, assured that Nigeria remained at the heart of the company\u2019s strategy, pledging to continue investing in the country. Terraz said with the company\u2019s first oil discovery in 1964, and the subsequent commencement of production from the Obagi field, TotalEnergies E&P took its first steps into a future that was yet to unfold.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, with new fields and increased productivity, the company has continued to expand and evolve, leading to its current position as the second largest operator in Nigeria, accounting for 20 per cent of the country\u2019s oil and gas production.\n\n\n\nHe maintained that TotalEnergies was a major player and a proud partner with Nigeria in developing its oil and gas sector, noting that they have developed a number of projects over the years.\n\nTerraz said the company was in the final stages of the Ikike project, a project he described as key for its Nigerian affiliate to demonstrate the viability of tie-backs to existing fields.\n\n\n\nHe stated, \u201cA lot of progress has been made, but I know there are a lot of challenges as we near the end. I am counting on the project team, and, indeed, all the affiliates, to apply yourselves to overcome these challenges and deliver the production safely.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a company, we have shown a unique commitment to Nigeria. Indeed, the country remains at the heart of our strategy. Nigeria has a lot of potential, but as for Ikike, it is not always \u2018plain sailing\u2019, so we all have to perform at our best to continue the adventure.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said the group had strived to become the industry benchmark for Nigerian content as demonstrated by the flagship Egina project, where they set new standards, sharing their technological expertise with the oil and gas industry.\n\n\n\nThe TotalEnergies president hailed the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), saying while bringing some much-needed clarity for the industry, it has also brought changes to the regulatory, fiscal and operating environment in the country.\n\n\n\nAs a responsive organisation, Terraz said the energy group must re-engineer its processes and structure to be able to adapt and face the new challenges while taking advantage of the opportunities.\n\nTerraz expressed excitement at the opportunities that abounded in Nigeria, and indicated the intention of TotalEnergies to expand into the Nigerian electricity sector.\n\n\n\nHe noted that considering the increasing energy demand of a rapidly growing population and the need to address climate change, their objective was to meet energy needs through an energy mix that was less carbon intensive.\n\nHe stated, \u201cOf course, we continue to believe in hydrocarbons. Gas development for NLNG and domestic usage will remain a bedrock of our activities while we concentrate our investments in low cost, low emission oil.\n\n\n\n\u201cElectricity offers an exciting opportunity in Nigeria, and it is an area which we would like to explore while also expanding the scope of our company to renewables. I know you are working on this.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking also, Managing Director of TotalEnergies EP Nigeria and Chairman of TotalEnergies Companies in Nigeria, Mr. Mike Sangster, said the company would continue to collaborate with the government, its partners, and other stakeholders to help to further develop the country\u2019s huge hydrocarbon potential.\n\n\n\nSangster said TotalEnergies was proud to be the second largest oil and gas producer in Nigeria, contributing 20 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s oil production. He said behind the numbers were over 1,166 Nigerian workforce, several billion dollars\u2019 investments into the Nigerian economy in recent years, and five production sites.\n\n\n\nSangster added that the partnership between TotalEnergies and Nigeria had been a very successful one, pointing out, however, that the journey has not always been smooth.\n\n\n\nHe singled out security as a very serious issue currently facing the company that needed to be addressed by the authorities, noting that the situation \u201cis greatly reducing our onshore production.\n\n\u201cSo, we have had our fair share of challenges to overcome, but what I\u2019ve seen personally over the past three years is that when our teams, all our teams, put their heads together, there is no problem that cannot be resolved.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn her part, Managing Director, Deepwater Operation, Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCO), Mrs. Elohor Aiboni, while reacting to the challenge Wabote posed to Shell and other IOCs, stated that it was not only for Shell but for all IOCs existing in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nNoting that Nigeria was a good place to do business, Aiboni stated that they looked forward to more investments from all IOCs.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*CAN calls for nationwide protests May 22\n\n*Kukah suspends Catholic masses, says residence not attacked\n\n*El-Rufai bans religious protest in Kaduna\n\n*Tears as Deborah is laid to rest in Niger\n\n\n\nEjiofor Alike in Lagos, Chuks Okocha in Abuja, Seriki Adinoyi in Jos, John Shiklam in Kaduna and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto\n\nIn a move to avert major religious riots over the killing of a 200-level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, Miss Deborah Samuel, Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, yesterday, declared a 24-hour curfew in Sokoto metropolis.\n\n\n\nDeborah was killed last Thursday by some fanatical students of the school over an allegation of blasphemy against Prophet Muhammad (SAW) in a WhatsApp post.\n\nThe curfew came as the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Matthew Hassan-Kukah, has also suspended all masses in the Sokoto metropolis, but clarified that his residence was not attacked.\n\nMeanwhile, the remains of Deborah were also yesterday laid to rest in her home town, Tunga Magajiya, in the Rijau Local Government Area of Niger State.\n\n\n\nFollowing the protests in Sokoto, Governor Nasir-el-Rufai of Kaduna State has banned any form of religious protest across the state.\n\nBut the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has called on all its members to embark on a peaceful protest nationwide on May 22, 2022.\n\n\n\nThe declaration of the curfew in Sokoto followed the protests that greeted the condemnation of the killing by the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III.\n\nDespite the tension that followed the condemnation by the Sultan, more condemnations have, however, greeted the despicable act.\n\n\n\nThe Sultan had on Friday condemned the killing of Deborah and charged the security agents to bring the perpetrators of the dastardly act to book.\n\nThis was said to have angered the extremists, who mobilised in the early hours of yesterday to the Sultan\u2019s palace in Sokoto.\n\n\n\nThe irate youths, who described Sultan\u2019s comment as anti-Islam, demanded that those arrested over the killing should be released with immediate effect.\n\nPalpable fear enveloped the Sokoto metropolis as the protesters, in their hundreds, trooped to the streets to express their displeasure over the detention of the two suspects arrested by the police over the killing of Deborah.\n\nMajor streets such as Ahmadu Bello Way, Kano Road, where banks are located, and Emir Yahaya Road, were deserted with business places and shops closed.\n\n\n\nHowever, an attempt by the protesters to attack the Palace of the Sultan was resisted by security agents.\n\nBut despite the heavy presence of security personnel in some strategic areas within the state capital, the protesters stormed Ahmadu Bello Way church line, where Catholic, Anglican, Baptist, ECWA, and Cherubim &Seraphim churches are located.\n\n\n\nThe protesters set a car ablaze around St. Mary Catholic Church and destroyed properties in the church.\n\nTo avert major religious riots, Tambuwal therefore declared a 24-hour curfew within the metropolis.\n\nIn a state-wide broadcast, the governor stated that as the Chief Security Officer of the state, he relied on the power conferred on him by sections 176 (2) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Sections 1 and 4 of the Public Order Act, as well as Section 15 of Sokoto State Peace Preservation Law, to impose a curfew within the Sokoto metropolis for the next 24 hours.\n\n\n\nHe appealed to the people of the state to continue to obey law and order.\n\n\u201cEveryone should, please, in the interest of peace go back home and observe these measures, for the re-establishment of peace, law, and order in the state,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the remains of Deborah were yesterday been laid to rest in her hometown, Tunga Magajiya, in the Rijau Local Government Area of Niger State.\n\n\n\nTears flowed freely as she was being buried around 6:30 pm at the Christian cemetery in Tunga Magaiya.\n\nTunga Magaiya youths had insisted that Sokoto State Government should have been responsible for her burial.\n\nHer uncle, who is the Pastor of ECWA in Tunga Magajiya, Emmanuel Maaji, led the prayers at the cemetery.\n\nKukah Suspends Catholic Masses\n\nAlso, as part of measures to save the Catholic Church from further attacks, the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Hassan-Kukah, has suspended all masses in the Sokoto metropolis.\n\nThis was contained in a statement issued yesterday by the Director of Social Communications of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Rev. Fr. Christopher Omotosho.\n\n\n\nOmotosho noted that Kukah\u2019s residence was not attacked though rampaging hoodlums vandalised and torched two of the parishes presided over by the fiery preacher during the protests embarked upon by the Muslim youths.\n\n\u201cDuring the protest, groups of youths led by some adults in the background attacked the Holy Family Catholic Cathedral at Bello Way, destroying church glass windows, those of the Bishop Lawton Secretariat were also attacked and a community bus parked within the premises vandalised.\n\n\n\n\u201cSt. Kevin\u2019s Catholic Church Gidan Dere, Eastern By-pass, was also attacked and partly burnt; windows of the new hospital complex under construction, on the same premises, were shattered.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey were promptly dispersed by a team of Mobile policemen before they could do further damage.\n\n\u201cThe hoodlums also attacked the Bakhita Centre located along Aliyu Jodi Road and burnt down a bus within the premises.\u201d\n\nKukah commended Tambuwal \u201cfor acting promptly by declaring the 24-hour curfew to stem the protests\u201d.\n\nHe also commended the security forces for promptly rising to the occasion to prevent further damage to the church\u2019s facilities.\n\n\n\nThe Bishop said no life was lost in the attacks and noted, \u201cContrary to information in circulation, we wish to disclaim that there was an attack of any sort on the residence of Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah.\n\nKukah appealed to Christians to remain law-abiding and pray for the return of normalcy.\n\n\u201cAll Masses in Sokoto metropolis have been suspended until the curfew is lifted,\u201d the statement added.\n\nCAN Calls for Nationwide Protests May 22\n\nMeanwhile, CAN has called on all its members to embark on a peaceful protest nationwide.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday by the General Secretary of CAN, Joseph Daramola, the President of the religious body, Rev. Samson Ayokunle, directed all secretariats to stage the protest on Saturday, May 22, 2022.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have been directed by the CAN President, His Eminence, Rev. Dr. Samson Olasupo A. Ayokunle, to request all Church leaders, through your various Churches to organise a peaceful protest in honour of one of our daughters, Deborah Yakubu, who was gruesomely murdered on Thursday, May 12, 2022, at the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto in Sokoto State by some Islamic extremists.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe protest will take place on May 22, 2022, in the afternoon by 3p.m. in every Secretariat of the Christian Association of Nigeria nationwide and not on the streets to avoid further loss of lives,\u201d Daramola explained.\n\nIn a related development, Governor El-Rufai of Kaduna State has also banned any form of religious protest across the state.\n\n\n\nThe state\u2019s Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, announced the ban in a statement issued yesterday in Kaduna.\n\n\n\nHe said the ban became imperative \u201cgiven moves by some unpatriotic elements to organise series of for-and-against protests related to a security development in one of the northern Nigerian states.\u201d\n\nHe urged citizens of the state to remain calm as they go about their lawful pursuits and to immediately report any such activity or security concern to the security agencies.\n\nMore Condemnations Trail Killing of Deborah\n\nMeanwhile, more condemnations have continued to trail the killing of Deborah.\n\nIn its reaction to the gruesome murder, the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) expressed outrage over the killing and called on Tambuwal and President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure justice.\n\n\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday by ECWA President, Dr Stephen Baba Panya, the church stated that \u201cthe brutal killing and burning of Deborah by some misguided Muslim students is nothing short of overt criminality which we at the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) roundly condemn.\u201d\n\n\n\nPanya queried the legitimacy of a government that cannot guarantee the security of its citizens, saying: \u201cWhile our faith in this country is still very strong because we know that there are laws that ought to govern the conduct of all citizens like it is in every civilised clime, we are at a loss which provision under our nation\u2019s jurisprudence permits the brutal, senseless and shameful killing and setting ablaze of a fellow Nigerian by any misguided group, under whatever pretext with no one held accountable.\u201d\n\n\n\nECWA called on Buhari to prevail on the Inspector General of Police and all relevant law enforcement agencies \u201cto ensure that all the perpetrators of this dastardly and despicable act are not only fished out, but that they are brought to justice according to law.\u201d\n\n\n\nA former President of the Senate, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, has also condemned in the strongest terms, the gruesome and unlawful killing of Deborah.\n\nIn a statement he signed, Anyim who is a presidential aspirant on the platform of the PDP, described the killing as cruel, illegal, callous, and inhuman.\n\nNYSC Urges Corps Members Not to Panic\n\nMeanwhile, the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Sokoto State has enjoined the corps members serving in the state not to panic as their safety is guaranteed.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday, the state Coordinator of NYSC, Alhaji Muhammad Nakamba, urged the corps members to be law-abiding and remain indoors as announced by the government, especially those within the Sokoto metropolis.\n\n\n\nHe explained that the management of the scheme in the state had contacted all the security agencies to ensure the safety of its corps members throughout the curfew period and beyond.\n\nNBA Rejects Calls to Cancel Sokoto Conference\n\nIn another development, the Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Section on Public Interest and Development Law (NBA-SPIDEL), Dr. Monday Ubani, has rejected the call by some lawyers to cancel the conference of the NBA-SPIDEL scheduled in Sokoto to protest the killing.\n\n\n\nUbani advised lawyers to be circumspect over the incident.\n\nHe maintained that it was preposterous for lawyers to call for the cancellation of the 2022 NBA-SPIDEL Conference in protest against the killing of Deborah, which was carried out by lawbreakers in the state.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe barbaric act was not authorised or approved by the state government to our knowledge. The state government has issued a statement condemning the act and requested that the crime perpetrators be brought to book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving said that, it will be preposterous for someone who is a lawyer to be suggesting that we should cancel our conference that is billed to take place in Sokoto because of the acts of lawbreakers in the state,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said he had sent a message to Tambuwal and the Attorney General of Sokoto, requesting a statement that the safety of the lawyers would be guaranteed.\n\n\n\nUbani argued that calling for the cancellation of the Sokoto conference was like asking for conferences billed for Owerri to be cancelled because of the killings of two army personnel \u2013 husband and wife \u2013 by unknown gunmen or asking for the cancellation of conferences in Abuja because of some of the killings that had taken place there recently.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Tunde Bakare, serving overseer of The Citadel Global Community Church, formerly known as the Latter Rain Assembly, has condemned the killing of Deborah Samuel.\n\nDeborah, a female student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, was killed by a mob last Thursday over alleged blasphemy.\n\nHer killing has continued to generate outrage and condemnation across the country, with Nigerians calling on the government to arrest the suspects and make them face justice.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Bakare said as a former Muslim he had read Quran from \u201ccover to cover\u201d and nowhere in the holy book justifies killings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was with deep distress that I received the news of the gruesome killing of Deborah Samuel in Shehu Shagari College of Education, in Sokoto State. No Nigerian, and indeed, no human being, should be subjected to such inhumanity by fellow humans,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cAs a nation of diverse peoples and cultures, there are available institutional mechanisms for resolving sensitive conflicts and, no matter the provocation, no person under our laws has the right to take laws into their own hands.\n\n\u201cAs one who was a devout Muslim and who read the Qur\u2019an from cover to cover, what was done to Deborah Samuel is nowhere justified in the religion of peace that was handed down to me by my grandfather who was the first Chief Imam of Iporo Sodeke Mosque in Abeokuta. My deep condolences go to the family of Deborah Samuel and I pray that we all find in God the comfort and fortitude to bear this great loss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I heard of the unrest that broke out in Sokoto after the arrest of some persons involved in the act, I immediately placed a call to Bishop Matthew Kukah to guarantee that he was safe and he assured me that, contrary to the news making the rounds in some quarters, his residence and the cathedral were not set ablaze.

No Nigerian, and indeed, no human being, should be subjected to such inhumanity by fellow humans,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cAs a nation of diverse peoples and cultures, there are available institutional mechanisms for resolving sensitive conflicts and, no matter the provocation, no person under our laws has the right to take laws into their own hands.\n\n\u201cAs one who was a devout Muslim and who read the Qur\u2019an from cover to cover, what was done to Deborah Samuel is nowhere justified in the religion of peace that was handed down to me by my grandfather who was the first Chief Imam of Iporo Sodeke Mosque in Abeokuta. My deep condolences go to the family of Deborah Samuel and I pray that we all find in God the comfort and fortitude to bear this great loss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I heard of the unrest that broke out in Sokoto after the arrest of some persons involved in the act, I immediately placed a call to Bishop Matthew Kukah to guarantee that he was safe and he assured me that, contrary to the news making the rounds in some quarters, his residence and the cathedral were not set ablaze. He further told me that the Governor of Sokoto State, Governor Aminu Tambuwal, swiftly intervened and dispatched security men to his residence and cathedral to prevent any mob attack.\n\n\u201cThis is commendable and I trust that the institutions of state will be fully deployed to restore law and order, ensure that justice is done and to address the underlying issues that this sad incident has once again brought to the fore.\n\n\u201cI also appeal to the good people of Sokoto State to remember the tolerance and hospitality that they have always been known for.

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Google unveils first smartwatch, new phones, virtual cards and more",
          "text": "Google on Wednesday and Thursday held its annual developer conference where it revealed an expanded line of new products and services.\n\nAt its first in-person developer conference in 3 years, the tech giant announced 3 new smartphones and its first in-house smartwatch as well as plans to release a new tablet next year. Google also announced updates to several of its most popular tools including Maps, Google Translate and its core search product.\n\nHere are some major announcements made:\n\nNew Pixel Watch and Pixel phones\n\nIn 2019, Fitbit was acquired by Google for $2.1 billion, a move many saw as a hint that Google was planning to go head-on with the likes of Apple and Samsung, which are already market leaders in smartwatches.\n\nTwo years later, Google has finally launched its first in-house built watch. The Pixel watch can be paired with Android devices only and is 4G-compatible, which means it can function on its own without being near a phone\u2014but to do this it requires its own data plan.\n\nThe tech giant did not reveal a price for the wearable, but it said it would be a \u201cpremium product\u201d when it launches in the 4th quarter of the year.\n\nThere are already many third-party Android watches which run on Google\u2019s Wear operating system but so far Google has not had its own device until now.\n\nAs part of its annual tradition, Google announced its new mid-tier phone, the Pixel 6A. It also unveiled its next flagship phones: the Pixel 7 Pro with a triple rear camera system and the Pixel 7 with two rear cameras.\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, Google announced that it\u2019s getting back to releasing tablets after announcing that it will be focusing solely on building in 2019. The new Android tablet is set to be released in 2023.\n\nUpdated Search and Maps\n\nSource: Google\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that Google processes approximately 63,000 search queries every second, 5.6 billion searches per day and approximately 2 trillion global searches per year. Google search which started from only text queries has over the years added the option to use voice and picture queries options.\n\nNow Google\u2019s new multi-search feature\u2014Multi-search Near Me\u2014allows users to search using text and images at the same time. The tech giant pointed out that the use cases for this feature include searching for a meal or outfit, and finding local results from restaurants, retailers and more.\n\nSource: Google\n\nFor a long time, Google Map has been the most popular Map app in the world, helping people around the world including Africans navigate through cities and rural areas. Now it\u2019s getting a new feature that allows users to view their cities in a more immersive way.\n\nThe new feature, immersive view, fuses together Street View and aerial imagery in order to offer a digital model of the world and a new way to explore cities, key landmarks, restaurants, venues, and other places of interest.\n\nGoogle maps\u2019 new immersive view for cities comes off as a challenger to Apple\u2019s 3D mode map view. In addition to this, Maps also now offers to find the most fuel-efficient route to get there with eco-friendly routing and offer users the ability to access Google Maps Live View in other third-party apps with the ARCore Geospatial API.\n\nVirtual cards\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nGoogle is rolling out virtual credit cards to help protect users\u2019 financial information while they\u2019re shopping online. The feature generates a virtual card number that users can autofill instead of their actual card information on Android mobile devices or in Google\u2019s Chrome browser, masking their real credit card number from the companies they\u2019re shopping from. These virtual cards are typically used for one-time purchases, but users will also be able to use these cards for subscriptions.\n\nVirtual cards will roll out this summer initially only for US users with Visa, Mastercard American Express and Capital One credit cards.\n\nTranslation and AR glasses\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nGoogle Translate has added support for 24 additional languages, bringing the total number of languages the product supports to 133.\n\nOver 300 million people across Africa, Asia and South America speak these newly-added languages. 10 of the 24 new languages added to Google Translate are spoken in Ghana, Togo, Sierra Leone, Mali, South Africa, Eritrea, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Namibia, Uganda and Zimbabwe.\n\nClosely related to this announcement was Google unveiling Augmented Reality (AR) glasses that hint it plans to join companies like Snap and Meta who have AR glasses ambitions. Google showed off a pair of AR glasses that were capable of real-time translation during a conversation. The tech giant revealed no details on whether this will be a product people can buy.\n\nGoogle\u2019s first attempt at creating smart glasses was roughly a decade ago, but it didn\u2019t take off as expected due to its limited launch, high initial pricing and privacy concerns.\n\nAds and user privacy\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nGoogle made a set of security and privacy announcements which will roll out later in the year.\n\nA notable one is the My Ad Centre hub, a new control centre that will give users more control and visibility over how their ads are personalised across Google\u2019s apps and sites, including Google Search, YouTube, and the Discover feed in Google app.\n\nIt\u2019ll let users customise the types of ads they see by selecting from a range of topics they are interested in or opt to see fewer ads on a given topic. For example, if you want to see fewer ads about fashion, you can indicate.\n\nThe hub will also make it easier for users to request that their personal information such as phone numbers, email and home addresses be scrubbed from search results.\n\nThese announcements come after Google reported its 2022 Q1 revenue which was up 23% from the same period last year, reaching $68 billion, while its net profit dropped to $16.4 billion compared to last year\u2019s $17.9 billion.\n\nShare this article",

You just had to be there.\n\nOne thing that made my Friday was meeting Kolade, a Techpoint Digest reader, after Pitch Friday. At this point, I\u2019d make a good marketer. After all, he came because he saw my newsletter. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nSaturday was very short. I slept for nearly 12 hours after watching a Netflix series about Cerebral Palsy titled Special. \ud83d\ude02 Yeah, 12 hours! I hope I\u2019m well, though.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yesterday, I couldn\u2019t go anywhere or do anything. I was practically on my bed all day long.\n\nSo, how did your weekend go? Please tell me how you spent it. Interestingly, I\u2019m looking forward to the weekend again, especially Saturday.\n\nI\u2019m sure you can guess why. That is when the highly anticipated Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit will take place. I can\u2019t wait to see you there.\n\nYou don\u2019t have money to get the ticket? Don\u2019t worry. We have two sponsors who are willing to cover your ticket fee. Continue reading to learn how you can be one of the lucky recipients of a free ticket to the event.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nPaying bills with eNaira\n\nSEC\u2019s new guidelines on cryptocurrency\n\nCentral African Bank\u2019s warnings to the CAR\n\nTopUp Mama\u2019s $1.7m seed\n\nPaying bills with eNaira\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, do you trust your government? If you\u2019re a Nigerian, do you believe what the government, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), or whoever represents it says? I don\u2019t because they frequently fail to keep their promises.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s the most recent: The CBN announced that the eNaira would be updated to allow it to perform additional functions like bill payment and USSD access.\n\nAn upgrade to the eNaira Speed Wallet app will be available starting this week, allowing you to perform transactions like paying for DStv or electric bills and purchasing flight tickets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven the hype surrounding the eNaira in 2021, it appeared to be something the government would get right. The question is, have they got it right?\n\nRecall that the CBN delayed the launch of the eNaira, which was initially scheduled for October 1, 2021, last year.\n\nWhy? Per the CBN, the launch was postponed to avoid conflict with the Independence Day celebration\u2019s lineup of events.\n\nHowever, the CBN was facing a lawsuit at the time from a company called ENAIRA PAYMENT SOLUTIONS LIMITED, which claimed to have registered the name eNaira in April 2004.\n\nDo you think that after last year\u2019s postponement, whatever the CBN says about the eNaira will hold this time? I doubt it, but I think you\u2019re hoping it will hold this time.\n\nIs there anything else to this upgrade? There is, of course. And Bolu has done this justice as he explains what this upgrade is all about.\n\nYou can read about it here: Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank edges close to eNaira use case with much-needed upgrade\n\nSEC issues new cryptocurrency guidelines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by CardMapr.nl on Unsplash\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Nigeria\u2019s capital market regulator, has issued new guidelines on the issuance and custody of digital assets, a move that could boost crypto adoption in the country.\n\nThe new regulations essentially classify digital assets as securities. For context, per the SEC, a \u201cDigital Asset\u201d is \u201ca digital token that represents assets such as a debt or equity claim on the issuer.\u201d\n\nThis signifies that Nigeria is attempting to balance outright prohibition and unregulated use of crypto-assets.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s latest guidelines were released, following the commission\u2019s announcement on September 14, 2020, that it would take a three-pronged approach to regulating innovation in the crypto sector, including safety, market deepening, and problem-solving.\n\nThis publication comes as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) called for the creation of a new public infrastructure to connect various payment systems, including digital currencies.\n\nThe 54-page document establishes registration requirements for digital asset offerings and custodians, and classifies the assets as securities regulated by the SEC.\n\nBesides, the rules apply to all platforms that facilitate the trading, exchange, and transfer of virtual assets, all issuers and sponsors of virtual/digital assets, including international and non-resident issuers and sponsors, and any operator that aggressively targets Nigerian investors.\n\nFor more information, watch out for the Techpoint Africa Podcast on Tuesday. I believe Bolu has some insights that you\u2019d definitely enjoy.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in less than five days!

Now, the Banking Commission of Central Africa (COBAC) is cracking down on Bitcoin transactions, issuing a reminder of its crypto ban on Friday, May 13, 2022.\n\nWhat does this mean? This means that COBAC \u2014 the six-nation Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa\u2019s (CEMAC) banking regulator \u2014 has prohibited all banks from cooperating with digital currency payment platforms or acknowledging them as assets.\n\nThis is happening because CAR did not consult with its regional monetary authority before adopting Bitcoin.\n\nCOBAC stated that the prohibition is intended to ensure financial stability. Perhaps understandable as cryptocurrencies are currently reaching significant lows.\n\nMoreover, the Bank of Central African States (BEAC), based in Cameroon, urged the Central African Republic to repeal the law that would allow Bitcoin to be used as a reference currency.\n\nThe bank warned in a letter made public last week that the move violated its rules and could jeopardise regional monetary stability. It also warned that its decision could be at odds with the region\u2019s France-backed currency, the Central African Franc (CFA).\n\nThe CFA Franc is the currency of CEMAC members, which are the Central African Republic, Cameroon, Chad, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and the Republic of Congo.\n\nHow could it affect CFA? The CAR\u2019s decision violates fundamental provisions of the CFA arrangements, including the requirement that the CFA franc be the only legal tender in the region and that the BEAC control the issuing of money and currency conversion for the entire zone.\n\nThe bank also urged the Central African Republic to follow CEMAC\u2019s lead in promoting economic and financial cooperation and avoiding policies that could lead to monetary fluctuations.\n\nTopUp Mama\u2019s $1.7m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the story? TopUp Mama, a Kenyan startup that plans to digitise the supply chain for Africa\u2019s micro, small, and medium-sized restaurants, has raised $1.7 million in seed funding.\n\nWho were the investors? Ventures Platform and JAM Fund led the round, while Next Billion Ventures, Future Africa, Jedar Capital, HoaQ Fund, FirstCheck Africa, and DFS Lab participated.\n\nFormerly known as Kibanda TopUp, the company was founded in 2021 by Njavwa Mutambo (CEO), Emilie Blauwhoff, and Andrew Kibe.\n\nWhat does it do? TopUp Mama is a one-stop-shop for restaurants in Kenya and Nigeria, offering them all the supplies, short-term credit, and tools they need to run their businesses.\n\nWhat has it done since its launch? The company claims it has grown tenfold in the last year, with over 3,000 merchants (1,000 active) using its platform to place orders each month.\n\nFuture plans? Over the next few years, it hopes to become the go-to supplier for 50,000 businesses in Kenya and Nigeria as it strives to become Africa\u2019s largest grocery distributor targeting restaurants.\n\nPer Mutambo, TopUp Mama will use the funds to accelerate growth, develop technology, and scale its restaurant sales management tools.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nOpportunities\n\nWin up to \u20a61m when you participate in Credo\u2019s Social Payments Hackathon starting May 16, 2022.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank digital currency (CBDC), eNaira, will get an update that will allow it to perform more functions such as bill payment and USSD access.\n\nThis was revealed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Lagos Branch Controller, Bariboloka Koyor, during a sensitisation campaign on the eNaira in Oshodi, Lagos.\n\nAccording to Vanguard, Koyor said, \u201cstarting from next week, there will be an upgrade on the eNaira Speed Wallet app that will allow you to do transactions such as paying for DStv or electric bills or even paying for flight tickets.\u201d\n\nWhat was wrong with the eNaira?\n\nChimezie Chuta, Founder, Blockchain Nigeria User Group (BNUG), told Techpoint Africa on a phone call that the upgrade had been in the works for a while.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Chuta, the CBDC, which launched in October 2021, had to go through a complete rework as some inconsistencies were revealed.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, there were faults that would not have allowed the eNaira to achieve its full potential.\u201d\n\nThere were issues with setting up the eNaira Speed Wallet application at launch. In a test I conducted after the launch, the app had trouble verifying my BVN, which made using the application impossible.\n\nHowever, news by This Day, in December 2021, said the eNaira was getting rapid acceptance among Nigerians. It said the eNaira Speed Wallet app had reached over 600 thousand downloads eight weeks after launch, and \u20a643 million worth of transactions had been carried out just weeks after launch.\n\nPwC\u2019s 2022 CBDC Global Index also reported that the CBN leads global CBDC retail projects. Retail CBDC projects refer to digital currencies designed for public use instead of wholesale projects such as China\u2019s CBDC \u2014 the e-CNY \u2014 created for institutional usage.\n\nAccording to the Index, over 35,000 transactions have been completed on the eNaira, which was downloaded in 160 countries.\n\nWhile the Index lauds the eNaira, a Twitter poll conducted by Intelligence by Techpoint \u2014 Techpoint Africa\u2019s data and Intelligence arm \u2014 in April 2022 said otherwise. The poll had votes from 157 Twitter users, 36.9% (58) of which voted \u201cI don\u2019t own a Wallet.\u201d\n\nNigeria's eNaira adoption\n\nWhat have you done with the eNaira Speed Wallet since its launch?\n\n\n\nKindly vote and retweet. Advertisement April 7, 2022\n\nInterestingly, 27.4% (38) of those who own a wallet had never used it. Only 1.3% had completed a transaction with the eNaira Wallet, while 34.4% were indifferent about the CBDC project.\n\nChuta, however, justified the issues eNaira faced after it launched by saying the \u201cindustry and the technology are still young, so it is normal to go back to the drawing board.\u201d While he cannot point at specific errors, Chuta reiterates that there was a need to rework the project.\n\nWhat will the eNaira upgrade do?\n\nIn addition to bill payments, the eNaira will be accessible via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD). Per Vanguard, Koyor told business owners and market leaders that the USSD code for the eNaira (*997#) would make onboarding more Nigerians easier.\n\nThe Guardian also reported on Friday, May 6, 2022, that fintech could explore investment opportunities with the eNaira. Yusuf Jelil, Principal Manager and Business Lead for the eNaira project, said that the CBN, along with fintech startups, is looking to explore investment opportunities with the eNaira.\n\nHow eNaira USSD could work\n\nWhile there\u2019s little detail on how the eNaira will work with USSD, we can make educated guesses on how the service will work based on our understanding of the eNaira and USSD protocols in Nigeria.\n\nUSSD integration with the eNaira could mean that feature phone users can now use the digital currency without Internet connectivity. This includes setting up a wallet and sending and receiving eNaira.\n\nAccording to the CBN, the first tier of Speed Wallet users can set up a wallet without a Bank Verification Number (BVN). However, they will have a daily transaction limit of \u20a650,000 ($121.50).\n\nA National Identification Number (NIN) will be required in place of the BVN. Given that 71 million Nigerians have their NINs \u2014 17 million more than the 54 million registered BVNs \u2014 more people get access to financial services without going to a physical bank branch.\n\nIt is, however, important to note that the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has been unable to verify NINs, leaving 7.5 million MTN subscribers disconnected.\n\nFacilitating eNaira transactions via USSD also raises the question of who bears the consent charge, a question that stands in the way of free transactions, the eNaira\u2019s biggest value proposition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

If you can remind me \u2014 because I\u2019ve been mentioning it for a week now \u2014 you\u2019ll have all my money this weekend.\n\n$5,000. Yeah, you read that right. So, I had a dream last night and won a singing competition. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Don\u2019t mind me; I\u2019m only joking. My voice is terrible. You don\u2019t want to hear me sing.

Don\u2019t pass it up for anything. Kindly register here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAre there many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\nInterswitch\u2019s $110m\n\nSafaricom\u2019s plan to launch M-PESA Junior Accounts\n\nAre there many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat comes to mind when you hear the term \u201cfintech,\u201d especially since every Tom, Dick, and Harry wants to start a fintech startup that \u201cbanks the unbanked\u201d? Digital payments? Lending? Just those two?\n\nPerhaps now\u2019s a good time to ask how many fintech startups you know do not provide lending and payment options in Nigeria. None? Just a few?\n\nIf you believe that fintechs are limited to just those two, I just might hold a fintech Masterclass. For the right amount, of course.\n\nSimply put, fintech \u2014 the combination of the words \u201cfinancial\u201d and \u201ctechnology\u201d \u2014 is the incorporation of technology into the offerings of financial services companies to improve their usability and delivery to customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does it function? It primarily works by disaggregating offerings like digital lending, payments, blockchain, and digital wealth management, while creating new markets for them.\n\nFurther, it refers to a wide range of financial activities that can be performed without the assistance of a person, like money transfers, check depositing with your smartphone, bypassing a bank branch to apply for credit, raising funds for a business startup, or managing your investments.\n\nBut seriously, do you think Nigerian startups primarily offer payment and lending services?\n\nChimgozirim probably has answers to your many questions concerning this. Please read his story here: Does Nigeria have too many fintech startups? What the numbers say\n\nY Combinator in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Y Combinator\u2019s (YCs) website, 3,657 startups had gone through the California-based technology startup\u2019s accelerator programme as of W22 \u2014 its Winter cohort.\n\nIntelligence by Techpoint, the data and research arm of Techpoint Africa, has partnered with YC to give an account of its activities in Africa since 2009. Above is a snippet of the report titled Y Combinator in Africa: A report about African startups that have gone through Y Combinator\u2019s Accelerator Programme.\n\nInterswitch\u2019s 110m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterswitch, an African payments company, has announced an investment from LeapFrog Investments and Tana Africa Capital.\n\nAlthough Interswitch has not confirmed the amount it received from the firms, TechCrunch, reports it at $110 million, but says \u201cthe precise terms of the transaction have not been disclosed.\u201d When asked about the investment and Interswitch\u2019s new valuation, a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch, \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on that for the time being.\u201d\n\nSo, what does the company do? Founded in 2002 by Mitchell Elegbe (CEO), Interswitch is an Africa-focused integrated digital payments and commerce company which facilitates the electronic exchange of money.\n\nThe fintech company is well known for its Point-of-Sale terminals and online consumer payment platforms like Quickteller and Verve. The company claims Verve is Africa\u2019s largest domestic debit card scheme, issuing over 35 million active cards since launch.\n\nThe funding will aid in its expansion across the continent and the provision of digital payment services.\n\nAlso, the funds will be used to support Interswitch\u2019s pan-African strategy, which includes acquiring new customers and developing new products to support a financial inclusion strategy.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in less than nine days!

Children are vulnerable to various risks due to the rapid industrial revolution and digitisation in Kenya and globally. Also, with access to the Internet via various devices, other hazards include child trafficking, prostitution, child pornography, trafficking, early age exposure to alcohol advertising, cyberbullying, and crimes like identity theft.\n\nConsequently, CA wants mobile network operators, broadcasters, internet service providers (ISPs), and content providers to implement policy and technical safeguards to protect minors.\n\nHowever, it appears that Safaricom is at odds with Kenya\u2019s CA with this plan. Well, the company has not revealed additional details on how the M-PESA Junior Accounts will work.\n\nAlso, the telco will launch a virtual debit card for international online payments.\n\nWhy? While some products, like Spotify, can be paid for directly with M-PESA, others, like Netflix, are unavailable, forcing customers to use bank-affiliated cards.\n\nAnd this causes some concern, particularly among those unwilling to do so for security or other reasons best known to them.\n\nFurther, per the World Bank Financial Inclusion Data, 72.9% of Kenyans have a mobile money account, and 26.1% buy and pay bills online. This means that over 14 million people buy and pay bills online.\n\nHowever, the products will be available before the end of June 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nWin up to \u20a61m when you participate in Credo\u2019s Social Payments Hackathon starting May 16, 2022.

The respondents affirmed that they would invest in the company\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) if it ever approached the market.\n\nAigbogun noted that in making the decision, the Awards Review Committee was guided by the achievements of Ossiomo Power and Infrastructure Limited, which include its \u201ctrack record as an independent power company dedicated to providing power to the Benin Industrial and Enterprise Park as well as several local communities in Edo State. Other considerations are the company\u2019s contributions towards attracting new businesses and investors through the development of critical infrastructure; demonstrated commitment to national and economic development and the local jobs it has created.\u201d",

Our analysis shows that there is a high rate of consumption of illicit drugs in the last few months which is not unconnected with the lingering ASUU strike which has kept many students at home and idle.\n\n\u201cThe strike is one of the factors that is driving the use of illicit drugs in our state. I therefore use the opportunity of this council meeting to appeal to ASUU and the federal government to do all they can to please end this strike as soon as possible for the interest of the children of this country so that we don\u2019t keep them at home, destroying their lives.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe idle mind is the devil\u2019s workshop. One way we hope that we can reduce the use of drugs is if we take these children back to school.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the other is the rate of accidents. We have observed slight reduction because of the rain and we also want to use this medium to further appeal to the federal government that the major arterial roads, the major truck roads leading into Edo be repaired, particularly the Benin-Auchi and Okpekpe-Okene Roads.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese roads account for quite a number of the deaths we have recorded as a result of vehicular accidents. The state has enjoyed relative decline in other incidents, which shows that Edo is becoming safer,\u201d the governor said.\n\nIn his response, Edo State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Abutu Yaro, said that the facts speak for itself, noting that Edo is safer now than before.\n\nThe Police Commissioner said the security agencies will continue to do their best in improving the security situation.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

A president or government that is business-friendly is what we need now, one who understands the private sector.\n\n\u201cI was happy today when I got in to the Asaba Airport and I looked and compared it to about a year ago; you can see the difference and the innovation of the governor in bringing that change.\n\n\u201cWe need a president that is bold and courageous to take decisions. It is not going to be easy because the challenges ahead are enormous.\n\n\u201cDevolution of powers is so important; we must be able to restructure this country and give more powers to states.\n\n\u201cYou need somebody who has the capacity to do that and you all know that to restructure, you need constitutional amendments; so you need somebody with legislative experience that can unite this country.\n\n\u201cSomebody, whether in the North or South, that will be fair to all and you know that I am that person that can unite this country.\n\n\u201cWhen the party needed somebody to reconcile our party members, I was brought on board to chair the National Reconciliation Committee of our great party and today many states have come together because of the work we did.\n\n\u201cWe need somebody that can bridge the gap between the young and the old. We need somebody that can create jobs and shore up employment and that can only be done through agriculture, through non-reliance on oil.\n\n\u201cI have stated this in my manifesto that within 24 months, we will earn the same amount we are earning from 30 billion dollars from non-oil \u2013 whether it is gas or petrochemical, and unless we do that, if we continue to rely on oil we can\u2019t get away from the current challenges.\n\n\u201cI am a great team player and we were able to hold the National Assembly together because we were able to carry everyone along,\u201d Saraki said.\n\nOn his part, Gov. Okowa said that the country truly needed a leader who had what it takes to provide solutions to the myriads of problems bedeviling the country.\n\nHe congratulated Saraki for his role in the 8th Senate, describing him as a very bold and courageous leader who stood to defend the independence of the legislature.\n\n\u201cThe people of Delta are very knowledgeable people; they have heard you and I believe that during the time of discussion it is our prayer that you find favour in the sight of the delegates.\n\nEarlier, Chairman of PDP in Delta, Chief Kingsley Esiso, said that the party\u2019s hierarchy would meet and take the right decision.\n\nHe commended Saraki for the visit.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "The serving overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, Pastor Tunde Bakare, has condemned the killing of Deborah Samuel, a 200-level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, murdered over alleged blasphemy.\n\nBakare who is an APC presidential aspirant, in a statement on Monday, said he read the Qur\u2019an and that nowhere does it justify killings.\n\nIn the statement was titled, \u2018Tunde Bakare condemns the Killing of Deborah Samuel, appeals to our common humanity, calls for unity,\u2019 the pastor urged Nigerians to learn live with one another in peace.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt was with deep distress that I received the news of the gruesome killing of Deborah Samuel in Shehu Shagari College of Education, in Sokoto State. No Nigerian, and indeed, no human being, should be subjected to such inhumanity by fellow humans.\n\n\u201cAs a nation of diverse peoples and cultures, there are available institutional mechanisms for resolving sensitive conflicts and, no matter the provocation, no person under our laws has the right to take laws into their own hands.\n\n\u201cAs one who was a devout Muslim and who read the Qur\u2019an from cover to cover, what was done to Deborah Samuel is nowhere justified in the religion of peace that was handed down to me by my grandfather who was the first Chief Imam of Iporo Sodeke Mosque in Abeokuta. My deep condolences go to the family of Deborah Samuel and I pray that we all find in God the comfort and fortitude to bear this great loss.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard of the unrest that broke out in Sokoto after the arrest of some persons involved in the act, I immediately placed a call to Bishop Matthew Kukah to guarantee that he was safe and he assured me that, contrary to the news making the rounds in some quarters, his residence and the cathedral were not set ablaze. He further told me that the Governor of Sokoto State, Governor Aminu Tambuwal, swiftly intervened and dispatched security men to his residence and cathedral to prevent any mob attack.\n\n\u201cThis is commendable and I trust that the institutions of state will be fully deployed to restore law and order, to ensure that justice is done and to address the underlying issues that this sad incident has once again brought to the fore.\n\n\u201cI also appeal to the good people of Sokoto State to remember the tolerance and hospitality that they have always been known for. As a child, I lived in Sokoto State. When my father travelled up north in the 1950\u2019s from Abeokuta in search of a market for his kola-nut produce, he was warmly received by the people of Sokoto State.\n\n\u201cSo hospitable were the people that my father settled in Sokoto for a period and invested in cotton farms in Shagari Village. Though he was Yoruba, my father was given the nickname \u201cSanni Arewa\u201d by the very friendly people of Sokoto. Such unity and tolerance should remain our true identity as a people.\n\n\u201cThe horrifyingly wicked killing of Deborah Samuel is a wake-up call for us as a nation to once again reflect on our common humanity and reject every form of savagery. We must all, at this time, set aside our differences, be they religious, ethnic or political differences, and come together to say \u2018Never again should this happen to any Nigerian\u2019.\u201d",

          "title": "The Age of Social Media: Friend or Foe?",
          "text": "Back in the day, finding out what happened to someone in another town or street took days, months, and sometimes even years. Tough, right? but now thanks to the explosion of technology, especially social media, information even about strangers in another continent is now available at the click of a button.\n\nToday\u2019s society fortunately and unfortunately is largely dependent on social media, not just for information gathering but for socialising, exploring, learning, bullying, intimidation, exposure and more. The advent and growth of social media originally started as a need to expand the human intellect, but slowly over time, it has grown into a sort of mini-god, ruling over everyday thoughts and judgements. While social media is generally about creating wholesome personal influences to immense extents, we are here to see if it\u2019s truly a friend or foe.\n\nFashion\n\nIt harnesses the power of aesthetics beyond borders. Fashion in any country has always been a fast-rising sector, where brands get to show off tailoring skills and contoured outfits. In fact, back in the day, many thought that owning a fashion line, especially in Africa, meant your family had a lot of money and often this was true, simply because fashion was termed a hobby and not an actual job. Parents fought tooth and nail with their children, encouraging them to become doctors, lawyers, pilots, etc. As technology advanced and style became more extroverted, social media has so far led a lot of new and old consumers to accept fashion trends quicker than before; from engaging cultural knowledge to body positivity and showcasing them, it has definitely soothed a lot of people\u2019s sense of style. And in some cases, the term \u201cmodesty\u201d is no longer in vogue. The older generation see social media as a friendly foe of sorts: friendly, because it allows a wider reach; foe, because clothing these days is suddenly barely even recognised as strips of clothing. It is now all about exposure, and quite a lot of it.\n\nTourism\n\nTourism has definitely seen an increase via consumption/patronage. Social media continues to play a weighty role in many areas such as the promotion of native tourism supervision, increasing local profits, regional development, aiding in local employment, advancing local governance, revamping social policies, cultural displays, etc.\n\nThanks to beautiful edits, consistent promotions and showcases, this has steadily, yet significantly, impacted the tourism system, by constantly engaging the roles and uses of social media by countries, by engaging travellers\u2019 decision making about where to visit, when to visit and how to take effective measures in protecting themselves\n\nAs great as social media has positively impacted tourism, it has also unavoidably shown the darker underbellies of countries which tend to promote themselves the most, such as human trafficking, enslavement, racism and so many more horrible aspects that nations/countries would rather keep away from the public eye, especially if that \u201cpublic\u201d is meant to aid in its growth and development.\n\nSocial media helps in tourism promotion and in focusing on best practices for interacting with consumers. Leveraging social media to market tourism products has proven to be an excellent strategy.\n\nInfluencing Influencers\n\nInfluencers, the new IT people of social media. From gathering like minded followers to promoting brands, lifestyle and everything in between, social media influencing has definitely become a big factor in long distance or close-range money-making efforts without necessarily working a nine-to-five shift with a corporation. As much as this sounds like such a positively friendly view, it also has its downsides, such as unrealistic showcasing, intimidation, unmerited lies and scandals in order to get to the top of the internet food chain, and adverse effects on psyches such as depression, suicidal thoughts etc. The list is endless, but the major one is living a fake life in order to impress strangers. Thanks to social media, gone are the days when people were simply accepted for who they were \u2013 for instance, their skin tone, etc.; now it is unrealistically glamorised so much so that there is a danger towards young minds treading dangerous paths in order to be recognised. This really doesn\u2019t sit well, especially with the older generation.\n\nInfluencing is a game changer but due to loopholes in rules, roles and accountability, so many negative attributes are starting to overshadow the positive nature of social media influencing, especially with regards to \u201cclout chasing.\u201d\n\nI must admit that the existence of social media has been a welcomed platform for sharing, learning, adapting and purchasing new movements, by bridging the gap between nations, brands and consumers, opinions and more simply by the click of a button, with about 80 percent of daily usage by citizens of the world, be it in a backwater country or highly civilised one; social media is now borderless and in control when it comes to decision making.\n\nSometimes, it\u2019s hard to conclude whether it is a friend or foe simply because experience, usage, understanding etc., differ from person to person, yet one thing I can say is that guided usage is advised, because too much of anything can be bad. So, till there is a definite conclusion on how to feel or accept the terms of what social media should be, I would personally stick to a friendly foe: it drives you crazy but has its uses.",

          "text": "Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai has shown that he cannot be trusted with his words. He is like a political prostitute playing games with APC Presidential aspirants. He is certainly enjoying the game with the party\u2019s delegates from Kaduna State. No one knows where his loyalty lies right now.\n\nEl-Rufai had thrown his weight behind the presidential aspiration of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo but switch over his loyalty to the National Leader of the party and presidential aspirant, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu few days ago.\n\nIn that visit four days ago, El-Rufai openly endorsed the aspiration of Tinubu to become president. The Kaduna delegates gave their support after El-Rufai, said he would only rally round any candidate supported by the delegates.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cyou are the first presidential aspirant to come to Kaduna, you are not taking us for granted, we will not forget that.\n\n\u201cYou have spoken to our people, they appear convinced, and when the people of Kaduna give their words sir, you can be rest assured of our support.\n\n\u201cWe keep to our words and ensure that as we intend to keep our promise. We will also want you to promise to deal with insecurity, infrastructure and support agriculture and empowerment.\u201d\n\nFew days after that visit, another presidential aspirant, Rotimi Amaechi came calling and El-Rufai, like a prostitute switched allegiance from Tinubu to Amaechi.\n\nEl-Rufai and Kaduna delegates dumped Tinubu and pledged to give their votes to Amaechi at the primaries of the party scheduled for end of the month.\n\nThe delegates, in the presence of El-Rufai said their earlier pledge to Tinubu was a spur of the moment decision which no longer stands.\n\nEl-Rufai said, \u201cI told you when you made that pledge to Asiwaju that others may not come, because of what you have done. You made that choice without listening to anyone else. Today you have seen the difference. You\u2019ve heard Amaechi, you\u2019ve seen what he has done. And he has brought a very strong security team. So you know what will happen with our security if he is in charge.\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do? Who are you supporting now? You have a huge burden on you, and you must choose what is best for Kaduna and for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nEl-Rufai then asked the delegates who is their choice for President, to which the delegates unanimously chorused \u201cAmaechi\u201d and \u201cDan Amanar\u201d, the traditional Daura title of Amaechi.\n\nCertainly, El-Rufai\u2019s game will not end here. Wait until Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and others will pay a visit. He and his delegates will keep the dumping game flying until the day of the primary election.\n\nCritic, Reno Omokri said: \u201cAnybody that trusts @elrufai is not wise. In less than 72 hours he publicly switched camp from Osinbajo to Tinubu. Then from Tinubu to Amaechi. He is the definition of political prostitute. Obasanjo said it in his book. He\u2019s unable to be loyal to anyone but himself.\u201d\n\nIf Amaechi thinks he has won the heart of El-Rufai and Kaduna APC delegates, he better not rejoice yet because his heart will soon be broken and that will not be long.",

Somebody that is dead and is a corpse, how would such a person be singing in the night?\n\n\u201cThere is no medical backup to that; it\u2019s an imagination that may be due to the church she attended while alive, and the songs may just be giving people ideas, but there is no proof in any way.

          "text": "Muslims in Borno State have been asked by the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) to let the police handle a case of alleged blasphemy rather than taking the law into their own hands.\n\nNaomi Goni, a woman accused of insulting Prophet Muhammad, is at the center of the case (SAW).\n\nThis follows the assassination of a Christian student at Sokoto\u2019s Shehu Shagari College of Education by other students on Thursday for alleged blasphemy.\n\nProfessor Ishaq Akintola, the Director of MURIC, issued a statement on Sunday urging the Borno State government to intervene in the problem.\n\nHe said, \u201cAnother lady has reportedly blasphemed against the person of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him). The latest incident happened in Borno State. The lady in the eye of the storm is Naomi Goni, a student of Ramat Polytechnic, Maiduguri.\n\n\u201cOne Abdulmajid Tanko Izge who is leading the allegation against her said in his post, \u2018There is a girl named Naomi Goni who insulted the Messenger of Allah (saw) and in Islam, it is a death sentence even if it is a Muslim. We, therefore, call on the Borno State Government to take immediate action or else we Muslims will not sleep and we will take action\u2019.\n\n\u201cBut neither Tanko\u2019s message nor others that have been posted have revealed the actual blasphemous statement. Her accusers should therefore tell Nigerians the actual statement made by her which they consider blasphemous.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the lady herself has refuted the allegation. She said her phone was hacked by someone last year. That casts a shadow of doubt on the allegation. It also makes her case different as she might not have been the author of the post.\n\n\u201cTanko\u2019s blanket statement that \u2018in Islam, it is a death sentence even if it is a Muslim\u2019 also calls for concern among Shari\u2019ah experts as he did not differentiate between an offence committed by a Muslim and another committed by a Christian.\n\n\u201cIt is well known in Shariah circles in Nigeria that a Christian cannot be taken to a Shariah court unless he or she expressly opts for it. Christians can only be charged to the conventional court (common law court). That is why Muslims of Borno State must allow the police to handle the case of Naomi Goni. She is a Christian and the security agencies are there to handle her if it is true that she has committed blasphemy.\n\n\u201cMuslims must stop issuing death threats concerning this case because that creates the impression that we are living in a lawless society and that we have no respect for the rule of law.\n\n\u201cMURIC calls on Islamic scholars in Borno to follow due process. There should be proper guidance and tutelage for our youths. We should allow the police to investigate the matter.\n\n\u201cThe youths should also repose confidence in the state government. They should not entertain the fear that the police will connive with Naomi Goni. We have a governor here who has taqwah (fear of Allah). Professor Zulum will ensure that justice is done no matter whose ox is gored.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, appeal to Borno Muslims to stop issuing death threats. We also urge the police to conduct a transparent investigation of the case. An early conclusion of the findings will inject a dose of confidence in the public. We also suggest that the state government should set up a separate panel to investigate the matter.\u201d",

Victor Adewumi stated this yesterday when he visited the site of the incident at Oku Iboku Community in Uyo, to assess the level of repair works on the instance of the Minister of Power, Engr.

We are however doing everything possible to reconnect the line to the national grid\u201d.\n\nHe noted that the collapsed tower was not the only one vandalized and that restringing the transmission line involves bringing down the 330kV DC line on some suspension towers, that were minimally vandalized, up to the nearest tension towers on both sides of the collapsed tower and fortifying the suspension towers before restringing the lines to ensure quality work is done,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe noted that work has reached 70% completion and that TCN is working hard to ensure that the 330kV DC transmission line is completed and reconnected to the national grid in one week, to ensure the evacuation of over 400MW stranded power at the Odukpani Power Plant near Calabar as well as the restoration of power supply to Cross River State.\n\nEngr. Adewumi appealed to the public to help TCN in the fight against the vandalism of power infrastructure, saying that such acts are detrimental to Nigerians and the expansion of power infrastructure in Nigeria.

ABCON under my leadership will continue to encourage our members to play the vital role of closing the exchange rate gaps in the market and reducing widening premium between the parallel market and the official window,\u201d he said.\n\nGwadabe listed several factors that continue to undermine the naira stability and the local currency\u2019s value against other currencies.\n\nThe ABCON boss called for the creation of BDCs\u2019 Autonomous Foreign Exchange Trading Window (BAFEX) with determined maximum daily limit for legible BDCs to access dollars from banks, autonomous market and diaspora forex widow at the prevailing market prices.\n\nHe requested for enhancement of existing BDCs\u2019 automation portals to file transaction returns on CBN/ABCON/NFIU/NIBSS portals for effective regulatory monitoring and supervisions.\n\nGwadabe also sought for the creation of an automation portal to encourage registration of undocumented and unlicensed operators for effective monitoring, identification and tracking of their transactions.\n\nHe said the reluctance of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to open new windows through which foreign exchange can be attracted to the economy remains a key factor in the naira continued fall.\n\nHe said the non-inclusion of BDCs in the list of channels through which diaspora remittances flow to Nigeria, under the CBN\u2019s guidance and regulation, has reduced the volume of dollar inflows to the economy.\n\nAccording to him, the World Bank\u2019s latest Migration and Development Brief showed that Sub-Saharan Africa attracting $49 billion in 2021. The bank said officially recorded remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries are expected to increase by 4.2 per cent this year to reach $630 billion.\n\nGwadabe said Nigeria\u2019s contribution to the remittances fund is expected to rise when BDCs are allowed to receive funds from Nigerians in Diaspora into the economy.\n\nHe said the BDCs are to perform this role through contactless and digitised channels that make collections easy and seamless.\n\nHe said there is urgent need to review the guidelines on BDC\u2019s Scope of Operations to include participation in payment space, such as agency banking, Point of Sale (PoS) services, inbound and outbound forex transfers, ATM Forex services, to reflect global business model practice.\n\nHe suggested that the BDCs should be allowed to access dollars or diaspora remittances through the autonomous forex windows that enable operators to receive IMTOs proceeds, carry out online dollar operations and Point of Sale (PoS) Agency, among others.\n\nGwadabe insisted that now is the time to break the current industry monopoly that puts the remittances market in the hands of few players depriving others from tapping into the plan.\n\nThe ABCON boss also called for the establishment of training institutes to enhance capacity and infrastructure in the industry and broaden players\u2019 business scope with cash-back incentives for those that patronize BDCs while also implementing a less cumbersome and complex documentation requirements for end users.\n\n\u201cThe BDCs should be able to operate a network of digital solutions for PTA/BTA. This would reduce overheads, and improve profitability. Some BDCs might still consider working closer with commercial banks. The ABCON can also be recognized as self-regulatory organization to enable it operate effectively and sanction erring members,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cWe wish to reiterate our resolve to align with the policy thrust of the apex bank and ensure that ABCON members play their roles professionally and strategically in the interest of the market and economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that de-marketing of BDCs by regulators and security agencies is not good for the stability of the market.

During the guided tour, I am sure you all saw that this is indeed a purpose-built, state-of-the-art, 100-bed hospital, which is aimed at delivering the highest standard of healthcare, using the most advanced technology and treatments to provide Nigerians with the best medical expertise available anywhere in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that according to available records, Nigerians spend between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion on medical tourism annually, a development he described as a huge drain on the country\u2019s foreign reserves.\n\nHe expressed delight that many of the doctors at Duchess International Hospital, a subsidiary of Reddington Hospital, are Nigerians who had\n\ntrained and worked abroad, but who have now decided to return home because of the availability of healthcare facilities with standard equipment and a good work environment.\n\nThe Minister said the Federal Government, through the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Bank of Industry, provided financial support for Duchess International Hospital, as part of its intervention in the health sector.\n\n\u201cThis is not new. Recall that in the wake of Covid-19, the CBN set up the N100 billion Healthcare Sector Intervention Fund, now expanded to N200 billion, to provide credit support for the healthcare sector through long-term, low-cost financing,\u201d he said, listing other interventions by the Federal Government, through the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority, NSIA, as including a total of $22.5 million which was spent in establishing two diagnostic centres in Kano and Umuahia ($5.5 million each) and the NSIA-LUTH Cancer Centre in Lagos ($11.5 million)\n\n\u201cThe essence of these financial interventions and projects in the critical healthcare sector is to fast-track the evolvement of world class healthcare facilities like the Duchess International Hospital.\n\n\u201cWith that, we can conserve our foreign reserves, earn foreign exchange for the country, create jobs, reverse brain drain, become a destination for medical tourists and also ensure affordable and standard healthcare for Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed commended the management of the hospital for making their world class services affordable and accessible to ordinary Nigerians, particularly with the launching of the \u2018World Class Affordable Healthcare Programme that coincided with the visit of the Minister and the over 30 journalists who accompanied him on the tour.\n\n\u201cWith what we have seen here today and the programme that has just been launched, Nigerians can now get access to affordable and world class treatment in whatever is ailing them in many areas, including emergency medicine, women\u2019s health, paediatric care, cardiovascular medicine, kidney dialysis, dental treatment, eye care, etc,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minister said the visit to the hospital was in continuation of the media tour of the development projects of the Buhari Administration, disclosing that in the past 40 days, he had taken the media on a tour of the Dangote Refinery and Petrochemical Project as well as the Dangote Fertilizer Company in Lagos; the Lekki Deep Seaport and the Duchess Hospital, in addition to the tour of road, rail, bridge and other projects across the country.\n\nThe essence of these tours he further explained was to showcase what the present administration has achieved in the various sectors adding that even where the project was private-sector driven, the Federal Government has either provided the enabling environment or, in some cases, supported such projects with funding,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chief Executive Officer of the hospital, Dr. Tokunbo Shitta-Bey, who conducted the Minister round the hospital, said the multi-specialist hospital, which was already attracting foreigners coming for treatment, is poised to make its advanced elite service affordable and accessible to Nigerians, who would pay only N5,000 for registration and 5,000 for consultation.",

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nHALO Financial Services Ltd, a fintech start-up has launched with an innovative approach to help Nigerians manage and grow their money.\n\nSpeaking at a media round table to introduce the company, the Chief Executive Officer and co-founder, Chidimma Onyeokoro disclosed that Halo enables communities to provide financial services to their members. Halo defines a community as any group of people with defined membership and identifiable leadership. This includes professional or trade associations, cooperatives, social clubs, unions, even old boys and girls associations and more. Community members are able to leverage the strength of their union for better financial returns. By focusing on communities, Halo will be able to scale faster.\n\nShe said, \u201cNigerians, have always understood that we progress faster when we do things together. From traditional groups savings schemes like \u2018ajo\u2019, to communities putting money together for community development projects, even friends pooling resources to help one of their squad. There\u2019s strength in numbers. We are using technology to harness that strength to drive wealth creation for individuals through their communities.\u2019\n\nAccording to her, trust is the bedrock of all financial services. By leveraging existing trust networks, Halo will be able to reach more people with the products, tools and knowledge to meet their wealth creation goals.\n\n\u2018One key differentiator for us is that we hold two licenses. We have a micro finance bank license and an asset management license. This allows us to offer a full spectrum of financial services from basic banking to sophisticated investments. It also means we are regulated by both SEC and CBN, so our risk management and corporate governance is very rigorous.\u2019\n\nNoting that the company is keen on serving as many people as possible, she explained that Halo offers multi-channel access. For those comfortable with technology, there is an app, mass market customers can transact with Halo via a nationwide network of agents, and high net worth communities can access a managed service.\n\nShe stated that the fintech space in Nigeria is extremely competitive, so to meet Halo\u2019s very ambitious goals they have built a team of dynamic, knowledgeable, and committed professionals with a deep understanding of market realities, and more importantly, possess the right skills and experience to help communities and their members navigate the financial landscape and reach their goals.",

Tallen, OFR, KSG have not submitted any resignation letter and therefore, it is my decision not to go ahead with this request but carry on as the Minister of Women Affairs.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday last week, President Buhari directed all appointed members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) running for elective offices to resign on or before May 16 \u2013 a directive which affected Tallen.\n\nTwo days later, the President held a valedictory session for the affected persons to appreciate them for their service. Since, the President\u2019s directive, some of the ministers have reconsidered their decision to vie for elective offices.\n\nApart from Tallen, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, as well as the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, have also pulled out of the Kebbi State governorship election and presidential race respectively.\n\nRead the full statement by Tallen below:\n\nPRESS STATEMENT ON THE STATUS OF HONOURABLE MINISTER OF WOMEN AFFAIRS RESIGNATION\n\nI stand here today thankful to God for His abiding faith in my life and for the multiple opportunities for me to serve this country in various capacities, humbled by the love, support and commitment shown me by well-meaning Nigerians, with the intent for the good of the great people of the Southern Senatorial District of Plateau State.\n\nMindful of the task before us, I am deeply grateful for the trust vested in me as we all strive to make meaningful contributions for the greater good of our country as a whole. Women groups and other stakeholders had thought it wise to purchase an expression of interest form under the APC for me to participate in the forthcoming elections.\n\nI would like to thank and assure all my supporters that while their intention was well conceived, my current work in superintending the numerous projects for Mr President as Women Affairs Minister require my undivided attention.\n\nAdditionally, whilst their quest is a good move in support of the clamour for more women in elective and appointive positions, and considered to be critical in addressing the gender question, I am compelled to focus on the foundations we have laid towards the advancement and realisation of gender equality in leadership positions in the country.\n\nI wish to thank Mr. President for his commitment to the advancement of Nigerian women and his acclaimed promise to support and spotlight the importance of women in our society. Our nation has a long-standing commitment in overcoming the challenges that inhibit women from bringing about positive changes and the requisite impacts when given a place at the table of decision making.\n\nMy appointment as the Minister of Women Affairs is indicative of this progress and I cannot lose sight of this opportunity. Our quest for gender equality and broadening access to enable women to participate meaningfully in nation building, is at the heart of my desire to unlock the potentials of women to bring about positive change in the history of Nigeria.\n\nThe instruments with which we aim to bring about these changes may be new but the values upon which our success rests are most critical, if appreciable, progress is to be made in fulfilling our well-conceived gender agenda. I remain resolute as I continue to relish the opportunity to serve Nigerian women in my capacity as Minister of Women Affairs under the able leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR.\n\nConsequently, I wish to inform you all that following broad based consultations and interventions from critical stakeholders, I have decided to withdraw from running for the senatorial seat mindful of our accomplishments and the notable progress we have recorded under my stewardship at the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs. Above all, as we celebrate our modest achievements, we are also conscious of the opportunities and achievements yet to be harnessed for Nigerian Women under this administration.\n\nAs a humble servant of Nigerian women, I am overwhelmed by the hard work, courage, patriotism and loyalty displayed by women and I remain resolute to ride on these foundations to enable us build solid structures to yield strategic progress to add through our history. I wish to thank the First Lady of Federal Republic of Nigeria, Dr. Aisha Buhari, the team from my constituency and all well-wishers who have consistently stood by me through the years, you are deeply appreciated!\n\nAt this crucial point in our Nation\u2019s history with women\u2019s participation at the lowest ebb with just 6.7% at the parliament, it is my desire to see a better picture with Nigeria taking its rightful place as the true giant of Africa, and with that I have taken an informed perspective to support more Women across all political spheres at this time.\n\nWith profound gratitude and great humility, I have decided to voluntarily step down from the senatorial race sequel to the yearnings of women and other well-meaning Nigerians who see the need for a strong voice for women at the Senate having consulted widely with my family, well-wishers and supporters\u2019 conscious of the role I play for Women in Nigeria today!\n\nSo, to all Nigerian women and young girls who have raised concerns as to what next, rest assured that I, Dame Pauline K. Tallen, OFR, KSG have not submitted any resignation letter and therefore, it is my decision not to go ahead with this request but carry on as the Minister of Women Affairs.\n\nFurthermore, mindful that the Constitution of APC stipulates in Article 31 (1) (iii) (October 2014 As Amended), that: \u201cAny Party Office holder interested in contesting for an elective office (whether party office or office in a general election) shall resign and leave office 30 days prior to the date of nomination or party primary for the office he or she is seeking to contest aspiring to any office must have resigned his/her appointment days\u201d.\n\nIt will, therefore, be a breach to resign office at this time since this was not done ahead of the stipulated timeline. I wish to mention that what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility, a renewed vigour for us to collectively raise the tempo of partnership and reinvent the strategies to shape the uncertain destinies of Nigerian women and girls in Nigeria.\n\nRiding on the promise of an enhanced citizenship for the women folk, I am confident of our commitment to carrying on our advocacy and determination to get more women to participate in politics, in order to close up gender gaps in our dear country and ensure that the voice of the less privileged in the country, is heard.\n\nOnce again, I thank the good people of Plateau State Southern Senatorial District and appeal to them to continue to support the incumbent Senator, Prof. Nora Daduut to sustain the women\u2019s political force.\n\nThank you!\n\nSigned:\n\nDame Pauline. K. Tallen OFR, KSG\n\nHonourable Minister\n\nFederal Ministry of Women Affairs",

          "text": "Ukrainian troops counter-attacking against Russian forces in the country\u2019s northeast have pushed them back from the city of Kharkiv and advanced as far as the border with Russia, Ukrainian officials said on Monday.\n\nThe developments, if confirmed, would signal a further shift in momentum in favour of Ukrainian forces nearly three months into a conflict that began when Russia sent tens of thousands of troops over the border into Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nMoscow meanwhile warned of \u201cfar-reaching consequences\u201d should Finland and Sweden go ahead with plans to join the NATO military alliance \u2013 a change in the Nordic countries\u2019 long-standing policy of neutrality brought on by concern about Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s wider ambitions.\n\nFighting was reported near Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, on Monday in what interior ministry adviser Vadym Denisenko said was \u201cour counter-offensive\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt can no longer be stopped\u2026Thanks to this, we can go to the rear of the Russian group of forces,\u201d he said.\n\nKharkiv, lying about 30 miles (50 km) from the border with Russia, had endured weeks of heavy bombardments from Russian artillery. The Russians\u2019 routing from there follows their failure to capture the capital Kyiv in the early stages of the war.\n\nHowever, thousands of people, including many civilians, have been killed across the country, towns and cities have been blasted into ruins, and more than six million people have fled their homes to seek refuge in neighbouring states in scenes not seen in Europe since the Balkan wars of the 1990s. Russia denies targeting civilians.\n\nUkraine\u2019s defence ministry said on Monday the 227th Battalion of the 127th Brigade of Ukraine\u2019s Territorial Defence Forces had reached the border with Russia.\n\n\u201cTogether to victory!\u201d it said.\n\nKharkiv region governor Oleh Sinegubov said the troops had restored a sign on the border.\n\n\u201cWe thank everyone who, risking their lives, liberates Ukraine from Russian invaders,\u201d Sinegubov said.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify Ukraine\u2019s battlefield account and it was not clear how many troops had reached the Russian border or where.\n\nIf confirmed, it would suggest a Ukrainian counter-offensive is having increasing success in pushing back Russian forces in the northeast after Western military agencies said Moscow\u2019s offensive in two eastern provinces known as the Donbas had stalled.\n\nNonetheless, the governor of the Luhansk region in Donbas, Serhiy Gaidai, said the situation \u201cremains difficult\u201d, with Russian forces trying to capture the town of Sieverodonetsk.\n\nHe said leaders of the Lugansk People\u2019s Republic, the territory in Luhansk controlled by Russian-backed separatists, declared a general mobilisation, adding it was \u201ceither fight or get shot, there is no other choice\u201d.\n\nIn the south, fighting was raging around the city of Kherson and Russian missiles struck residential areas of Mykolayiv, the presidential office in Kyiv said. Reuters was unable to verify the reports.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Sunday Ukraine could win the war, an outcome few military analysts predicted when Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nEXPANDING NATO\n\nIn a blow for Russia, which has long opposed NATO expansion, Finland on Sunday confirmed it would apply to join the alliance.\n\nSweden\u2019s ruling Social Democrats also backed NATO membership, paving the way for an application and abandoning decades of military nonalignment.\n\nBut Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said on Monday that Finland and Sweden were making a mistake that would have far-reaching consequences.\n\n\u201cThey should have no illusions that we will simply put up with it,\u201d Ryabkov said, quoted by the Interfax news agency.\n\n\u201cThe general level of military tension will rise, predictability in this sphere will decrease,\u201d Ryabkov said.\n\nNATO and the United States said they were confident both countries would be accepted into the alliance and that reservations from Turkey, which wants the Nordic countries to halt support for Kurdish militant groups present on their territory, could be overcome.\n\nMoscow calls its invasion of Ukraine a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to rid the country of fascists, an assertion Kyiv and its Western allies say is a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war.\n\nSince mid-April, Russian forces have focused much of their firepower on trying to capture the Donbas. Moscow recognised the independence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People\u2019s Republic and the Lugansk People\u2019s Republic in the Donbas days before it launched its invasion.\n\nBritish military intelligence said Russia had lost about a third of the ground combat force deployed in February, and its Donbas offensive had fallen \u201csignificantly behind schedule\u201d.\n\nFIGHTING AROUND IZIUM\n\nThe most intense fighting appeared to be around the eastern Russian-held city of Izium, where Russia said it had struck Ukrainian positions with missiles. read more\n\nRussia continued to target civilian areas along the entire frontline in Luhansk and Donetsk, firing at 23 villages and towns, Ukraine\u2019s military task force said.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military also acknowledged setbacks, saying Russian forces \u201ccontinue to advance\u201d in several areas in the Donbas region.\n\nThere was also no letup on Sunday in Russia\u2019s bombardment of the steelworks in the southern port of Mariupol, where a few hundred Ukrainian fighters are holding out weeks after the city fell into Russian hands, the Ukrainian military said.\n\nAlexander Khodakovsky, a commander of separatist forces in Donetsk, said on his Telegram channel on Monday that 10 Ukrainian fighters emerged from a tunnel at the Azovstal steel plant holding white flags.

          "title": "TotalEnergies Invests Almost $30bn in Nigeria Within Eight Years, Government Says",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has disclosed that French oil major, TotalEnergies EP Nigeria Limited, has invested almost $30 billion in Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector within the space of eight years. It said the company had made a lot of investments in developing the country\u2019s oil resources since it began operation in the last 60 years.\n\nThe government criticised Shell, ExxonMobil and Chevron \u2013 three of the five oil majors in the country \u2013 over their apparent withdrawal from investing further in Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector, urging them to emulate TotalEnergies\u2019 sustained investments in the country and resume their investments.\n\nExecutive Secretary of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Mr. Simbi Wabote, made the assertions at the weekend in Lagos, at the TotalEnergies\u2019 EP Nigeria\u2019s 60th anniversary dinner.\n\nThe French oil giant said Nigeria remained at the heart of its strategy, and indicated plans to expand its business into the country\u2019s electricity sector. It stressed that the sector offered exciting opportunities that it would like to explore.\n\nWabote said TotalEnergies had invested immensely in Nigeria and deserved commendation for remaining consistent in investing in the country\u2019s oil sector. He said with the amount of investments TotalEnergies had put into the country\u2019s oil and gas sector since its entrance into the space, there was no basis for comparing it with that of Shell, Chevron and ExxonMobil.\n\nWabote stated, \u201cTotal has invested so much in Nigeria since the last 60 years. At the last count, we are looking at almost $30 billion worth of investment in Nigeria within a space of eight years.\n\n\u201cThe amount of money Total has invested in this country, when you compare that with other IOCs, like Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, there is no basis for comparison.\u201d\n\nSpecifically criticising Shell for refusing to invest to develop the protracted Bonga Southwest project, which had been on the drawing board for many decades, Wabote said on the other hand, TotalEnergies had started and completed many projects that were producing oil and gas in the country.\n\nBonga Southwest is among the oil assets that the government has been banking on to achieve its plan of increasing Nigeria\u2019s oil reserves and production.\n\nAccording to Wabote, \u201cWe started discussing Bonga Southwest before I was born, Total took FID \u2013 (Final Investment Decision) on Usan. We were still discussing Bonga Southwest when I got married, Total took FID on Egina. We were still discussing Bonga Southwest, when I had my first child, Total took FID on Ikike. I will go on and on and on.\u201d\n\nThe executive secretary argued that his job as local content chief executive would not have existed if there was no project, adding that he needs no apology for praising companies keeping him on the service through undertaking projects that create value for the country.\n\nWabote added, \u201cLet me use Total to challenge Shell. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve not seen Chevron here and I\u2019ve not seen ExxonMobil. I will use Total to continue to challenge them. Total is also one of the investors of NLNG Train 7, which is about the most important investment in the whole of the country.\n\n\u201cSo, we should understand what Total is doing. This is a celebration that we should all partake, for keeping faith in this country, remaining in this country for 60 years is no mean feat. I encourage you to, please, remain with us.\u201d\n\nIn his address, President, Exploration and Production, TotalEnergies Group, Mr. Nicolas Terraz, assured that Nigeria remained at the heart of the company\u2019s strategy, pledging to continue investing in the country. Terraz said with the company\u2019s first oil discovery in 1964, and the subsequent commencement of production from the Obagi field, TotalEnergies E&P took its first steps into a future that was yet to unfold.\n\nAccording to him, with new fields and increased productivity, the company has continued to expand and evolve, leading to its current position as the second largest operator in Nigeria, accounting for 20 per cent of the country\u2019s oil and gas production.\n\nHe maintained that TotalEnergies was a major player and a proud partner with Nigeria in developing its oil and gas sector, noting that they have developed a number of projects over the years.\n\nTerraz said the company was in the final stages of the Ikike project, a project he described as key for its Nigerian affiliate to demonstrate the viability of tie-backs to existing fields.\n\nHe stated, \u201cA lot of progress has been made, but I know there are a lot of challenges as we near the end. I am counting on the project team, and, indeed, all the affiliates, to apply yourselves to overcome these challenges and deliver the production safely.\n\n\u201cAs a company, we have shown a unique commitment to Nigeria. Indeed, the country remains at the heart of our strategy. Nigeria has a lot of potential, but as for Ikike, it is not always \u2018plain sailing\u2019, so we all have to perform at our best to continue the adventure.\u201d\n\nHe said the group had strived to become the industry benchmark for Nigerian content as demonstrated by the flagship Egina project, where they set new standards, sharing their technological expertise with the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe TotalEnergies president hailed the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), saying while bringing some much-needed clarity for the industry, it has also brought changes to the regulatory, fiscal and operating environment in the country.\n\nAs a responsive organisation, Terraz said the energy group must re-engineer its processes and structure to be able to adapt and face the new challenges while taking advantage of the opportunities.\n\nTerraz expressed excitement at the opportunities that abounded in Nigeria, and indicated the intention of TotalEnergies to expand into the Nigerian electricity sector.\n\nHe noted that considering the increasing energy demand of a rapidly growing population and the need to address climate change, their objective was to meet energy needs through an energy mix that was less carbon intensive.\n\nHe stated, \u201cOf course, we continue to believe in hydrocarbons. Gas development for NLNG and domestic usage will remain a bedrock of our activities while we concentrate our investments in low cost, low emission oil.\n\n\u201cElectricity offers an exciting opportunity in Nigeria, and it is an area which we would like to explore while also expanding the scope of our company to renewables. I know you are working on this.\u201d\n\nSpeaking also, Managing Director of TotalEnergies EP Nigeria and Chairman of TotalEnergies Companies in Nigeria, Mr. Mike Sangster, said the company would continue to collaborate with the government, its partners, and other stakeholders to help to further develop the country\u2019s huge hydrocarbon potential.\n\nSangster said TotalEnergies was proud to be the second largest oil and gas producer in Nigeria, contributing 20 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s oil production. He said behind the numbers were over 1,166 Nigerian workforce, several billion dollars\u2019 investments into the Nigerian economy in recent years, and five production sites.\n\nSangster added that the partnership between TotalEnergies and Nigeria had been a very successful one, pointing out, however, that the journey has not always been smooth.\n\nHe singled out security as a very serious issue currently facing the company that needed to be addressed by the authorities, noting that the situation \u201cis greatly reducing our onshore production.\n\n\u201cSo, we have had our fair share of challenges to overcome, but what I\u2019ve seen personally over the past three years is that when our teams, all our teams, put their heads together, there is no problem that cannot be resolved.\u201d\n\nOn her part, Managing Director, Deepwater Operation, Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCO), Mrs. Elohor Aiboni, while reacting to the challenge Wabote posed to Shell and other IOCs, stated that it was not only for Shell but for all IOCs existing in Nigeria.\n\nNoting that Nigeria was a good place to do business, Aiboni stated that they looked forward to more investments from all IOCs.",

          "text": "The President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, who is among the 25 presidential aspirants that submitted forms for screening under the All Progressives Congress (APC) has intensify lobby for the party\u2019s ticket as THISDAY learnt that last week, he met Mallam Mamman Daura, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s nephew and one of those very few persons that have the president\u2019s ears.\n\nA source told THISDAY that the meeting held behind closed doors as Adesina continues to lobby of Buhari\u2019s circle.\n\n\u201cHe met him sometimes last week. His car was sighted entering Mamman Daura\u2019s house during the week. Beyond Mamman Daura, he is also reaching out to Buhari\u2019s relatives in Niger Republic, to see if they can convince Buhari to back him,\u201d the source who pleaded to remain anonymous added.\n\nTHISDAY had reported last week that some African leaders have mounted pressure on Buhari to anoint Adesina, as the presidential candidate of the APC in the 2023 general election. To this end, former President Olusegun Obasanjo, is said to have given Adesina his full backing.\n\nA reliable source had told THISDAY that leaders in West Africa, including the presidents of Niger and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, had spoken to Buhari on behalf of the AfDB president.\n\nThe West African leaders were reported to have met Buhari in Abidjan last week, where the president attended a two-day conference organised by the United Nations, to try and persuade him to consider Adesina.\n\nAdesina is expected to contest the ruling party\u2019s ticket with the likes of the Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo; Bola Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos; outgoing Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, now former Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, among others. Delegates of the ruling party are expected to pick a presidential candidate between May 30th and June 1st.\n\nLast week, a coalition made up of 28 groups bought the form for Adesina worth N100 million. One of the leaders of the coalition, Ademola Babatunde, had said they put their resources together to purchase the form because APC\u2019s fee was outrageous.\n\nA friend of the AfDB President said Adesina has concluded plan to take an unpaid leave from the bank if he gets the party\u2019s ticket, to enable him campaign around the country.\n\nHowever, analysts have expressed concern that activists in the country have kept mum despite the fact that Adesina, the head of a continental multilateral institution was still holding onto him job despite having submitted his forms to contest for the presidential ticket of the APC.\n\n\u201cWhy are those who were raising their voices when a group purchased forms for the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria not saying anything about Adesina? Adesina has submitted his forms and has been shortlisted for screening, even when the AfDB doesn\u2019t allow politics, why are they not calling for his resignation as well? He signed his form for submission, so no one can claim he is not aware of it or claim that a group bought the form in his name without his knowledge,\u201d the analyst who pleaded to remain anonymous wondered.\n\nThe confidential source further disclosed that, for Adesina to submit his form, he had to submit a sworn affidavit and evidence of his APC membership card which he is said to have done in full compliance with the requirements.\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja, Chinedu Eze in Lagos, Seriki Adinoyi in Jos, John Shiklam in Kaduna, Segun Awofadeji in Gombe",

          "title": "Nigeria: Northern Governors, Sheikh Gumi Condemn Murder of Deborah, Appeal for Calm",
          "text": "Northern States Governors Forum (NSGF) and Kaduna-based Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumion Sunday, joined the growing number of groups and individuals that have condemned last Thursday\u2019s mob killing of Deborah Samuel, a student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, for alleged blasphemy against Prophet Mohammed.\n\nChairman of the forum and governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, in a statement signed by his media aid, Macham Makut, said the governors were concerned about the development, which they described as clearly an extra-judicial measure of addressing perceived infraction.\n\nThe statement came as Catholic Archbishop of Abuja Archdiocese, Most Rev. Ignatius Kaigama, said Nigerians should not succumb to the machinations of the evil ones by halting the pursuit of brotherhood and peaceful coexistence.\n\nIn its own reaction, the umbrella organisation of all Christians in Northern Nigeria at the weekend condemned what it described as gruesome and barbaric murder of Deborah. In a statement signed by the Public Relations Officer, Chaplain Jechonia Gilbert, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the 19 northern states urged \u201call Christian leaders to terminate their participation in Nigerian Inter-Religious Council (NIREC)\u201d until Islamic leaders demonstrate genuine commitment to controlling and disciplining their unruly followers.\n\nHowever, over 72 hours after the cold-blooded murder in Sokoto, frontline aspirants in the 2023 presidential race were yet to comment on the incident. All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader and former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu; immediate past Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi; former Anambra State governor, Peter Obi; former Senate President, Bukola Saraki; Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello; Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike; and Pastor Tunde Bakare had yet to comment at the time of filing this report.\n\nThe Sokoto incident, which has created religious tension, has effectively dashed any hope of a Muslim-Muslim ticket in the current political climate, as some would have wanted. analysts have pointed\n\nBut Nigeria\u2019s domestic carrier, Azman Air, disowned a pilot, Capt Jamil Abubakar, who expressed support for the killing of the late Deborah. Abubakar came under fire for a statement he made via his Twitter handle, defending the killing of Deborah.\n\nIn a tweet from its verified Twitter handle, #LetsFlyAzmanAir, Azman Air stated, \u201cCapt Jamil Abubakar is no longer a pilot @AzmanAir: his last flight with us was 22nd Dec 2019. We refuse to take responsibility for a comment or view of a former staff. The general public should kindly take note.\u201d\n\nIn a move to avert a major religious crisis over the killing of the 200-level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, the state governor, Aminu Tambuwal, had at the weekend declared a 24-hour curfew in Sokoto metropolis.\n\nThe curfew came as the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Matthew Hassan-Kukah, suspended all masses in Sokoto metropolis, but clarified that his residence was not attacked.\n\nThe remains of Deborah were at the weekend laid to rest in her home town, Tunga Magajiya, in Rijau Local Government Area of Niger State.\n\nFollowing the protests in Sokoto, Governor Nasir-el-Rufai of Kaduna State had also banned any form of religious protest across the state.\n\nCAN had at the weekend called on all its members to embark on peaceful protests nationwide on May 22, 2022.\n\nThe declaration of the curfew in Sokoto followed protests by some Islamic faithful that greeted the condemnation of the killing by the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III.\n\nThe northern governors, in the statement, stressed that any attempt to adopt self-help in addressing grievances, whether religious or otherwise, would only lead to further chaos that could threaten law and order as well as the general peace and security of the society. While commiserating with the family of the victim, Lalong said in the statement that the northern governors wanted the security agencies to be allowed to thoroughly investigate the matter and ensure that the law took its full course on anyone found wanting.\n\nThe northern governors also appealed for calm following reports about the hijack of a peaceful protest, which later turned violent and led to the imposition of a curfew in Sokoto metropolis.\n\nLalong also extended the support and commiserations of the forum to Tambuwal over the incident and commended his proactive efforts to restore normalcy. The forum assured the Sokoto State governor of its solidarity and prayers in dealing with the matter as well as ensuring that all necessary measures were taken to forestall future occurrence in any part of the region and country at large.\n\nNSGF also reminded citizens of the region and Nigerians of the need to continue to show love, tolerance and respect for one another, irrespective of faith, ethnicity or other affiliations.\n\nOn his part, Gumi, speaking during his daily preaching at the Sultan Bello Mosque, Kaduna, in a video clip shared on his Facebook page, declared that any Muslim who killed a Christian in Nigeria because the prophet was insulted would not smell paradise. He maintained that Nigeria was not an Islamic state, adding that Muslims in the country have agreement with people of other faiths to live together peacefully. He stressed that anyone who killed on religious guise had committed a grievous sin.\n\nGumi said it was unfortunate that some Muslim clerics were quoting verses they did not understand and telling people to kill whoever insulted their religion.\n\nQuoting several verses from the Qur\u2019an and Islamic jurisprudence, Gumi said killing a non-Muslim under the guise that the person uttered a blasphemous statement against Prophet Muhammad was not an excuse, \u201cbecause Allah has told us in the Qur\u2019an the non-Muslims will insult Allah and His Prophet.\n\n\u201cIn fact, it is now the blasphemy will start after the killing of that lady in Sokoto, the insult will increase, not reduce.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSome Muslims in Nigeria that want to defend Prophet Mohammed should be ashamed of themselves because they are corrupt\u2026\n\n\u201cThe best way to go, if we want to defend the Prophet, is to follow his teachings. We, the clerics, need to wake up and teach Muslims their religion. We must leave this state of ignorance; we have turned like animals. We, the Muslims, are not the only ones in this country.\n\n\u201cIt is not only that we are not the only ones in this country, we must know that there was nothing the unbelievers did not do to Prophet Mohammed, but he was patient, because he was conscious that if he killed them, the unbelievers he was trying to bring to the fold of Islam will tag him a killer.\n\n\u201cThere are people who are neither Muslims nor Christians in Nigeria, and everyone is trying to win their souls. Also, there people who are not Muslims, whom we are preaching Islam to, so that they can enter the fold of Islam and be salvage in the hereafter.\n\n\u201cIf we now begin to kill people, they will say it is even from the leader of our faith, Prophet Mohammed, that we have learnt it.\n\n\u201cThey will say their religion is a religion of bloodletting. At a time we are trying to draw attention of people to see the beauty of Islam, we are now scaring them away.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that we even see some clerics who are telling people that whoever insults your religion, just kill then. They are quoting verses they don\u2019t understand.\n\n\u201cThere is no one who has the will to kill anyone except through the Islamic justice system. And in doing this, the conditions of such justice must be completed before anyone can be killed.\u201d\n\nGumi further stated, \u201cOur religion is a civilised religion. The white people learnt rule of law from Islam. But today, we are the ones in this level of lack of civilisation, to the extent that an Islamic cleric is quoting Qur\u2019an and Hadith spreading and encouraging barbarism.\n\n\u201cPeople that have not been able to perfect their own act of worship the way they are supposed to. People who don\u2019t know how to pray properly are now the ones that say they want to dispense justice to people who commit blasphemy.\n\n\u201cWhat people don\u2019t know is that, in the Islamic perspective, the world is divided into two \u2013 the Islamic world and the non-Islamic world. That is countries that are governed by the Islamic law and those that are governed by other laws.\n\n\u201cThose who are not Muslims are divided into two \u2013 there are non-Muslims that you engage in war, and there non-Muslims that you have agreement with. Those you have agreement with are also divided into two \u2013 those who are living under the Islamic laws and those that are not bound by the Islamic laws.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s non-Muslims are not living under the Islamic laws, we all have an agreement under the Nigerian constitution to live together. So, Prophet Muhammad said whoever kills a soul of non-Muslim that is under such agreement of living together will not smell the fragrance of paradise, such person\u2019s distance to paradise will be like a journey of 40 years.\n\n\u201cKilling a non-Muslim under the guise that the person uttered a blasphemous statement against Prophet Mohammed is not an excuse, because Allah has told us in the Qur\u2019an the non-Muslims will insult Allah and His Prophet. In fact, it is now the blasphemy will start after the killing of that lady in Sokoto, the insult will increase, not reduce.\n\n\u201cWhat Allah asked us to do in the face of blasphemy in a society, like ours, is to be patient and preach to the people and make them understand our religion. In our kind of society, we don\u2019t have the right to kill for blasphemy, otherwise, even many people who call themselves Islamic clerics who have equally been killed because they have fallen into blasphemy by calling Allah human being or saying they know tomorrow or those who have indirectly turned to Babalawo.\n\n\u201cThe Prophet told us that a time will come towards the end time, when people will feel like taking other people\u2019s life. So, he said, instead of doing that, it is better for you to look for a rock and be boxing it, so that you don\u2019t (have) the urge of killing anytime.\n\n\u201cSo, who do we leave just justice for in the face of blasphemy? It is the authority. We don\u2019t have the right to take up arms and kill anyone, except in self-defence, like when some comes for your life or an armed robber invades your house. You are not the one to defend Islam, in fact, you are making the work of those calling people into Islam difficult.\n\n\u201cThe right thing the students who killed the lady in Sokoto ought to do is to report her to the school management, then the management reports to the governor or Sultan for them to know how to stop her. Just by hearing her commit blasphemy, you just went and carried out jungle justice on her, who taught you that? What do you want our country to turn into? We must leave these acts of barbarism.\n\n\u201cIs it even we, the Muslims of Nigeria, that want to defend Prophet Muhammad? We that are corrupt? We that cannot even be differentiated from unbelievers in corrupts acts. The best way to go if we want to defend the Prophet, is to follow his examples by being upright in all fronts.\u201d\n\nKaigama Says Efforts at Inter-religious Harmony Must Not Stop\n\nSpeaking during his homily at St. Louis Church, Efab Global Estate, Abuja, against the backdrop of last week\u2019s murder of Deborah Samuel, Kaigama said Nigerians should not give up on the pursuit of brotherhood and peaceful coexistence, but \u201cmust continue to speak up in a common voice and act in solidarity with one another against the evils of our time.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the Christian Association of Nigeria, YOWICAN (Youth Wing), asked security agencies to stop the molestation of Christians to avoid a religious war.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday by Chairman of YOWICAN, Belusochukwu Enwere, the association said, \u201cToday is the 4th day Miss Deborah Samuel was killed by Muslim extremist students who chose to take laws in their hands and yet most of our Nigerian political class who are gunning to lead us as a country failed to condemn or to commiserate with the bereaved family.\n\n\u201cEven after killing Deborah the miscreants continued to destroy people\u2019s properties, burning of church facilities, and going from house to house intimidating peaceful Christians. The security agencies should do the needful before this becomes a religious war.\n\n\u201cWe call on all Christian youths to continue to be peaceful and do not take laws in their hands. God must surely fight to avenge the killing of Deborah. Her death will unearth evil agenda of the wicked ones in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNorthern States Chapter of CAN Urges Boycott of Inter-religious Council\n\nThe umbrella organisation of all Christians in Northern Nigeria at the weekend condemned the barbaric murder of Deborah. A statement by the public relations officer, Chaplain Jechonia Gilbert, CAN insisted that the assailants must be brought to justice.\n\nCAN in the 19 northern states called on every Christian parent across the country, especially the northern states, to discourage sending their children to schools in Sokoto State until the federal and Sokoto State governments were ready and willing to secure the lives of their children both in Sokoto and other states \u201cthat are hostile to Christians and Christianity.\u201d\n\nCAN said in the statement, \u201cWe are urging all Christian leaders to terminate their participation in Nigerian Inter-Religious Council (NIREC), until their counterparts of Islamic faith show commitment to tame their followers on equal terms. Northern CAN prays for the immediate family and, indeed, the church of late Deborah Samuel not to lose hope in God\u2019s ability to avenge the killers of their daughter.\n\n\u201cWe appeal and counsel those who feel and think that killing and oppressing Christians is a demonstration of their service to their God to learn from history. Those that tried it in Egypt and their experiences should be enough warning. There is a Red Sea awaiting them, even those who are secretly encouraging them, must partake in the Red Sea experience.\u201d\n\nThe association added, \u201cWhile the CAN does not and will not encourage casting aspersions on any religion or religious leader of any faith, CAN frowns at hiding under the gab of any religious extremism to perpetrate any form of criminality against her members, especially in Northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cGod Almighty is not and can never be a weak God for mere mortal to fight and defend Him. On the contrary, it is He who keeps, watches and defends us. CAN believes that life is sacred and must never be taken by another unless as directed by the state.\n\n\u201cThe CAN (19 Northern States and Abuja) is calling on the federal government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari and the Sokoto State government under Governor Aminu Tambuwal not to resort to the government\u2019s usual rhetoric but must demonstrate political will and capacity to bring the perpetrators of this criminality to justice; otherwise, others may take queue from this and turn our father land to a country of lawlessness at every slightest provocation.\u201d\n\nTEKAN/ECWA Youths Condemn Killing of Deborah\n\nThe national body of Tarayar Ekklisiyoyin Kristi A Nigeria (Hausa, Fulani and Kanuri Christians) and the Evangelical Church Winning All (TEKAN/ECWA) youth block, at the weekend, condemned the killing of Deborah Samuel.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Gombe, National Youth Leader of the block, Jim James Amos, described the killing as an unwarranted jungle justice meted out to Deborah by Islamic extremists.\n\nTEKAN/ECWA also called for calm, saying, \u201cAs law abiding citizens, we call on all Christian youths to remain calm, law abiding and desist from taking laws into their hands, let us leave everything in the hands of God Almighty who is the final judge.\u201d\n\nThe youth group commended all organisations and individuals (both Christians and Muslims) that came out to condemn the gruesome murder. It also called on the federal and Sokoto State governments to rise up to the occasion by doing the needful, saying the world is watching.\n\nIt said, \u201cWe are aware that many organisations have called for the arrest and prosecution of the culprits, we make bold to say that the national and state assemblies must, as a matter of urgency, enact a law that handles such issues.\n\n\u201cAt this moment of grief, when our sister is being buried as we speak, we wish to commensurate with the church in Nigeria, TEKAN/ECWA block, CAN in Sokoto and Kebbi states, the Zuru people, and the immediate family and extended family of Late Deborah Samuel Yakubu.\u201d\n\nNHRC Condemns Deborah\u2019s Killing, Calls for Immediate Prosecution of Culprits\n\nThe National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) condemned the killing of Deborah Samuel, a second-year student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, for alleged blasphemy.\n\nThe Governing Council of the commission, while reacting to the killing on Sunday, in a statement, said that there was no law, either secular or religious in a democratic society, anywhere in the world that justified the killing of any person without due process of the law.\n\nIt urged all persons to exercise tolerance over religious matters, while tasking the relevant authorities, particularly the police, to thoroughly investigate and prosecute the culprits, who had been, reportedly, arrested as well as put necessary mechanisms in place to effect the arrest of every other person involved in the gruesome murder, with a view to bringing all perpetrators to book and preventing future occurrence.\n\nIt stated that the consequence of inaction now by the law enforcement agencies could be a recurrence In the near future.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThe commission used the opportunity to condemn all acts of religious extremism in the country and appeals to all parties in this matter as well as the concerned public to remain calm even in the face of this provocative and dastardly act, while awaiting the report of the police investigation into the incident, adding that two wrongs cannot make a right.\u201d\n\nThe council also expressed its heartfelt condolences to the family of the late victim, Deborah, and other families who had lost their loved ones under similar conditions, assuring them that the commission will work with relevant bodies to ensure that justice is served in such cases.\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja, Chinedu Eze in Lagos, Seriki Adinoyi in Jos, John Shiklam in Kaduna, Segun Awofadeji in Gombe",
