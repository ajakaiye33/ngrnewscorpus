          "title": "Court rejects Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s request to be moved to Kuje Correctional Centre",
          "text": "Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB leader\n\nA Federal High Court, Abuja, on Monday declined the request of the Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, to be moved to Kuje Correctional Service Centre.\n\nJustice Binta Nyako, in a ruling, turned down the application by Nnamdi\u2019s Lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor.\n\nEarlier when the matter was called, the leader of the IPOB was not brought to the court by the Department of State Services (DSS).\n\nCounsel to the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), M. B. Abubakar, informed the court that though he was ready to proceed, the defendant (Kanu) was not in court.\n\nEjiofor, however. expressed worry over the absence of Kanu in court.\n\nThe lawyer alleged that his client was subjected to dehumanising conditions and that he had no access to his lawyers while he was in the custody of the DSS.\n\nEjiofor, who said he had not seen his client for over10 days, told the court that the information reaching him was that Kanu had been taken away to an unknown destination.\n\nHe said he had a motion on notice filed before the court, seeking for \u201can order of this Honourable Court directing the transfer of the Applicant from the custody of the National Headquarters of the State Security Service to the Nigerian Correctional Service Centre in Kuje, Abuja, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, where he was originally detained before he was granted bail, pending the determination of the charge.\n\n\u201cAN ORDER of this Honourable Court directing the Defendant/Applicant\u2019s custodian, to grant access to his Medical Experts/Doctors for the purpose of carrying out a comprehensive independent medical examination of the Defendant/Applicant\u2019s health condition/status, while in custody.\u201d\n\nNyako said though the earlier remand order at the DSS facility still subsisted, she made an order for the lawyers to be given access to their client (Kanu).\n\nALSO READ: Photo News: Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s supporters in shock over today\u2019s trial\n\n\u201cNo, I am not transferring him to correctional centre. I am keeping him there (DSS custody) and I am going to make an order that you should be given access,\u201d she said\n\nThe judge, however, noted that the access to Kanu would be regimented.\n\n\u201cBut it is not going to be all conners affairs; it will be regimented. You can\u2019t get up at night and say you want to visit your client,\u201d she stated.\n\nJustice Nyako, who condemned the prosecution\u2019s act for not producing Kanu in court, ordered that Kanu should be produced in court in the next adjourned date.\n\n\u201cBefore you can take a criminal case, the defendant must be in court. I have been sitting down here since waiting for you.\n\n\u201cI will not take this kind of practice in the conduct of this case. When I give you a date, I want you to continue on that date.\n\n\u201cAnd you cannot continue until the defendant is present,\u201d she held.\n\nNyako said he had not make any order for the trial to continue in Kanu\u2019s absence, hence he must be brought to the court to stand his trial.\n\n\u201cPlease do the needful and don\u2019t allow this to happen again,\u201d she told the prosecution.\n\nShe also noted that since the court vacation had started, a fiat from the Chief Judge of the court, Justice John Tsoho, would be needed to give the matter accelerated hearing.\n\nShe adjourned the matter until Oct. 21 for trial continuation.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that besides the former Governor of old Anambra, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife who was in court to monitor the proceeding, the Ohaneze Ndigbo was represented by a lawyer, Chief A. G. Nwanzuruike, while Barrister M. C. Udebuani appeared for an association of all the Igbo lawyers in Abuja (Otuotiwu).\n\nNAN on June 29, reported that the judge had ordered the IPOB leader to be remanded at the Department of State Services (DSS) facility pending the hearing and determination of the matter\n\nThe order followed an application by Counsel to the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Shuaibu Labaran, that Kanu, who jumped bail and rearrested, be remanded in the DSS custody.\n\nThe court also granted the request that the matter be given accelerated hearing to guard against delay in justice and fixed today for trial continuation.\n\nNAN reports that Kanu, who was rearrested on July 27 abroad, was said to have jumped bail around September 2017.\n\nHe was, however, produced before the trial judge, Nyako, on June 29 to stand his trial.\n\nThe judge had, on March 28, 2019, issued a bench warrant for Kanu\u2019s arrest after she revoked the bail that was earlier granted him.\n\nRelying on Section 352(4) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA), 2015, the court equally okayed Kanu\u2019s trial in absentia.\n\nREAD ALSO: Release Nnamdi Kanu now, you can\u2019t kill him, since you couldn\u2019t kill him in Kenya \u2013 Supporters\n\nKanu was arrested on October 14, 2015, on 11-count charge bordering on terrorism, treasonable felony, managing an unlawful society, publication of defamatory matter, illegal possession of firearms and improper importation of goods, among others.\n\nHe was charged alongside three other pro-Biafra agitators; Chidiebere Onwudiwe, Benjamin Madubugwu and David Nwawuisi.\n\nShortly after he was declared \u201cmissing,\u201d Justice Nyako, on February 20, 2018, okayed a separate trial for the other three defendants.\n\nThe IPOB leader who has dual citizenship was before his arrest reportedly sighted at various locations outside the country, including Jerusalem and the United Kingdom (UK).\n\nKanu who was the Director of Radio Biafra was initially arrested by security operatives on October 14, 2015 upon his arrival to Nigeria from his base in the UK.\n\nHe was subsequently arraigned in court on January 20, 2016, and remanded at Kuje prison in Abuja.\n\nAfter he had spent about a year and seven months in detention, the trial court, on April 25, 2016, released Kanu on bail on health ground.\n\nTo secure his release, Sen. Enyinnaya Abaribe (PDP\u2013Abia), an Accountant, Mr. Tochukwu Uchendu and a Jewish High Priest, Emmanu El- Salom Oka BenMadu, on April 28, 2016, signed an undertaking to ensure his attendance in court.\n\nFollowing Kanu\u2019s disappearance after he was released on bail, the court, on Nov. 14, 2018, ordered the three sureties to forfeit the N100 million bail bond they each consented to.\n\nAll the sureties had since approached the Court of Appeal in Abuja to challenge the ruling.\n\nKanu\u2019s lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor had equally protested the revocation of his client\u2019s bail, even as the court rejected his request for time to file affidavit evidence to explain why he jumped bail.\n\nEjiofor had insisted that Kanu\u2019s disappearances was occasioned by the unwarranted invasion of his home at Afaraukwu in Abia State by the Nigerian Army.\n\nThe claim Kanu restated when he was brought before the court after his rearrest.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\u2022Access Bank leads with N11.929 trillion, followed by Zenith Bank\u2019s N11.297 trillion\n\nObinna Chima\n\nThe five tier-1 banks in Nigeria gave out a total of N49.999 trillion as loans and advances to their customers between January 2016 and December 2020, data compiled by THISDAY have shown.\n\nThe banks are Access Bank Plc., Zenith Bank Plc., FBN Holdings Plc. (First Bank), United Bank for Africa Plc. (UBA), and Guaranty Trust Bank Plc. (GTBank). The data were gathered from the respective lenders\u2019 financial statements.\n\nThe data showed that in the five-year period, Access Bank lent out a total of N11.929 trillion to its customers. The amount lent by Access Bank rose sharply in the last two years due to its acquisition of former rival, Diamond Bank.\n\nAccess Bank was closely followed by Zenith Bank, whose total loans and advances in the review period stood at N11.297 trillion, despite its penchant for organic growth.\n\nFirst Bank lent out a total of N9.825 trillion in the five year-period, UBA supported its customers with a total of N9.488 trillion, while GTBank lent N7.460 trillion to its customers within same period.\n\nA further breakdown of the customers\u2019 loans and advances showed that Access Bank gave out a total of N3.218 trillion in 2020; N2.911 trillion in 2019; N1.994 trillion in 2018; N1.996 trillion in 2017; and N1.809 trillion in 2016.\n\nFor Zenith Bank, its total loans to customers in 2020 was N2.779 trillion; N2.305 trillion in 2019; N1.823 trillion in 2018; N2.100 trillion in 2017; and N2.289 trillion in 2016. In the same vein, FBN Holdings reported total customer loans and advances of N2.217 trillion in 2020; N1.852 trillion in 2019; N1.670 trillion in 2018; N2.001 trillion in 2017; and N2.084 trillion in 2016.\n\nA breakdown of the five-year period for UBA showed that in 2020 it gave out a total of N2.555 trillion as loans to its customers spread across the continent, and did N2.061 trillion in 2019, N1.715 trillion in 2018, N1.651 trillion in 2017, and N1.505 trillion in 2016.\n\nFor GTBank, in 2020 it gave out a total of N1.663 trillion as loans to its customers; N1.500 trillion in 2019; N1.259 trillion in 2018; N1.448 trillion in 2017; and N1.589 trillion in 2016.\n\nDespite the relatively high aggregate loan, experts say there is need for financial institutions to do more considering the country\u2019s wide infrastructure gap, which reports indicate would require about $3 trillion over the next 30 years to close.\n\nGlobal management consulting firm, Mckinsey & Company, noted in a recent report that the unprecedented scale of the COVID-19 slowed down bank lending in Nigeria and forced the financial institutions to re-examine and reimagine the way they did things.\n\nThe report said, \u201cFor financially strong tier-1 banks with scale (resilient and market leaders), now is the time to consider investing in technology infrastructure and talent to expand beyond current customers and products.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic and other on-going pressures present the sector with a new vantage point from which to address structural vulnerabilities and position itself for sustainable long-term growth.\u201d\n\nTo thrive beyond the crisis, Nigerian banks would need to bolster their capital levels and grow capital faster than the rates of inflation and devaluation, the report noted.\n\nThe report said, \u201cThis will be no small feat in the current environment. Given the need to meet Basel III requirements, the possible deterioration of asset quality, and some foreign-exchange-based commitments to service, it is likely that another round of consolidation and capital raising is approaching.\u201d\n\nOn their part, Senior Analyst at Coronation Asset Management, Ope Ani, and the company\u2019s Head of Research, Guy Czartoryski, told THISDAY in a recent interview that loan growth in the present climate remained challenging, as it increased risk pressure and asset quality concerns for banks.\n\nThey pointed out that an improvement in structural issues and the overall macro environment would help assuage the concerns and spur loan growth.\n\nThe analysts stated, \u201cRecent developments around credit infrastructure (collateral registries, credit bureaus) have certainly been positive with respect to driving risk asset creation. So, there is a foundation for banks to increase their loan books going forward. However, loan growth also needs to be looked at in the context of capital.\n\n\u201cThe distribution of capital across the banks featured in the report is unequal in terms of the percentage of total capital to assets (or, more technically, interest-earning assets). We have seen some banks hold back by not wanting to increase capital and actually changing their strategy to maximise the returns from the loan portfolios that they already have.\n\n\u201cSo, for loan growth to take place, and because it requires capital, it is necessary to achieve and maintain a certain level of profitability. Of course, the regulator\u2019s response, in the middle of 2019, was to impose the loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) regime that requires banks to make customer loans equivalent to 65 per cent of their deposits.\n\n\u201cThis worked very well in 2019, with overall gross loans rising sharply. However, once most banks were compliant with it, the effects of the policy were not as strong during 2020.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Goddy Egene\n\nA Federal High Court sitting in Abeokuta has granted an interim order restraining the federal government from taking over the unclaimed dividends of shareholders in the capital market estimated to be over N200 billion. The order followed a suit instituted by shareholders under the aegis of Palm Wealth Shareholders Association (PWSA).\n\nThe Finance Act 2020 signed into law last February by President Muhammadu Buhari provides that any unclaimed dividends of a public limited liability company quoted on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) and any unutilised amounts in a dormant bank account maintained in or by a deposit money bank, which has remained unclaimed or unutilised for a period of not less than six years from the date of declaring the dividend or domiciling the funds in a bank account, shall be transferred immediately to Unclaimed Funds Trust Fund.\n\nBut shareholders and other stakeholders in the financial sector had faulted the proposal. As part of efforts to stop the federal government from taking over the funds, PWSA instituted a case against the government at the Federal High Court in Abeokuta.\n\nThe shareholders (Applicants) sued the Attorney General of the Federation; Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning; and Accountant General of the Federation as Respondents and Representatives of the Federal Government of Nigeria in the Suit NO. FHC/AB/FHR/14/2021. The applicants sought an order restraining the respondents from calling for or transferring the unclaimed dividends of the applicants from their respective companies to the Unclaimed Funds Trust Fund in accordance with Part xv of the Finance Act, 2020.\n\nHon. Justice J. O. Abdulmalik last Friday, July 23, granted interim orders restraining the respondents from bringing into force the \u201cproposed new rules on unclaimed dividends (E-dividend mandate) or any new rules on unclaimed dividend not in force before 31st December, 2020.\u201d\n\nThe court also restrained the federal government from harassing, intimidating, inviting and/or ordering public limited liability companies or their Registrars for questioning for purpose of taking or giving accounts of the unclaimed dividends, pending the determination of the Motion on Notice.\n\nA copy of the judgment obtained by THISDAY showed that the case was adjourned to October 25 for hearing of the applications as well as the substantive matter.\n\nThe chairman of PWSA, Mr. Simon Emokeraro, said the shareholders were seeking \u201can Order of the Honourable Court for the enforcement of the applicants\u2019 fundamental rights to acquire and own immoveable and moveable personal property; an order restraining the federal government, that is, the Respondents, from calling for or transferring the unclaimed dividends of the Applicants in public quoted companies to the Unclaimed Funds Trust Fund; an order restraining the Respondents from harassing, intimidating, inviting the companies or their Registrars for the purpose of transferring the unclaimed dividends belonging to the applicants to the Unclaimed Funds Trust Fund contrary to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights Act, Laws of the Federation.\n\n\u201cOthers are: an order of the Honourable Court restraining the Respondents from borrowing the unclaimed dividends belonging to the applicants; a declaration by the Honourable Court that the applicants have rights guaranteed and protected under sections 43 & 44 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Articles 14 and 24 of the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights and Article 17 of the United Nation\u2019s Charter on Human Rights 1945 and sections 42 (1) and (2) of the Companies and Allied Matters Act; a declaration of the Honourable Court that Part XV of the Finance Act 2020 calling for or transferring the unclaimed dividends of the applicants in public quoted companies to Unclaimed Funds Trust Fund by the respondents without any constitutional grounds is unconstitutional, null and void and of no moment as it violates the applicants fundamental rights; and a declaration of the Honourable Court that the applicants are entitled to claim their dividends without coercion, stampede, and intimidation from the respondents.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The pivotal moment, when Kroc meets the finance guy, is worth savoring again:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to realize what business you\u2019re in. You\u2019re not in the burger business, you\u2019re in the real-estate business. You don\u2019t build an empire off a 1.4% cut of a 15-cent hamburger. You build it by owning the land upon which that burger is cooked.\u201d\n\nSix decades later, McDonald\u2019s is still primarily a multibillion dollar real-estate business. Tech companies today use McDonald\u2019s as a lesson in scaling. Stripe is not a payment processing company but one building \u201ceconomic infrastructure for the internet.\u201d Just as Google became the internet\u2019s knowledge infrastructure two decades ago. What does scale look like in Africa? Fintech is the continent\u2019s hot cake so let\u2019s start there. PARTNER MESSAGE\n\nHave you tried Flutterwave Mobile today?

The Flutterwave Mobile App makes it super convenient for anyone to take their business with them anywhere, anytime. Learn how you can take your business anywhere, anytime here. Now, today\u2019s story.\n\nThe top 4% No standard definitions exist for what scale is for fintech in Africa. But one effort by the Wheeler Institute at the London School of Business can be a guide. Here are five key numbers from the report: Out of 716 fintech companies pooled across Africa, only 37 have achieved scale. 20 out of those 37 companies are headquartered in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. On average, it takes 12 years for a African fintech company to scale; only 5 startups have managed to scale within 5 years of operations.\n\nOlanrewaju Odunowo/TC Insights Also, those 37 include \u2018fintech\u2019 units launched by Airtel and MTN. So we really only have 4% scale prevalence in African fintech.\n\nThese numbers are not pretty. Is Africa not a huge market populated by young people with internet-enabled smartphones? Why are the fintech companies serving them not scaling? The report gives two explanations: Fragmentation: Many tech companies have not overcome the complex aspects of implementing their ideas in practice. A major complexity is the existence of different (and sometimes harsh) regulations from one country to another. Low-income: How many people can pay for the services being offered? An \u201caddressable market\u201d is demand \u2013 the number of people \u201cwilling and able to pay\u201d \u2013 not population. Goodwill may attract but it is self-interest that converts. Putting it bluntly, the report states that \u201cscaling a business that serves lower income tiers is notoriously hard.\u201d It\u2019s a reality check for those who dream of capturing the next billion from Africans at the bottom of the pyramid. Beware of \u201cfinancial inclusion\u201d apps. However, it\u2019s not all bad news. One interesting takeaway is that \u201cinfrastructure\u201d fintech companies are likely to scale in Africa. Olanrewaju Odunowo/TC Insights Infrastructure fintechs, according to the report, are those providing payment gateways, building banking-as-a-service applications or aggregating services into APIs. Of the 96 fintech companies defined as being in the sub-sector, 10% have scaled. Interswitch, MFS Africa and Fawry probably typify the infrastructure fintechs but I am surprised that certain names are not listed among the scaled in this sub-sector. Is a multimillion-dollar acquisition not a signal of scale? How about a presence in 30 countries with over $50m in annual revenue? The researchers explain their methodology in the report. Whatever those answers, the important thing to note is that companies building the rails for other services (financial and non-financial) in Africa are likely to expand quickly. But scale is not just for B2B fintechs. Carbon and Branch, two digital lending companies, make the case that it is possible to scale by serving consumers efficiently. Both have recently evolved to digital banks. Carbon staking out a claim to lead Buy Now Pay Later in Africa \u2013 in other words, to become infrastructure for lending. Perhaps another report with a different yardstick will reveal other scaled fintechs in Africa. For now, we can look deeper into the top 4% to see how they arrived where they currently are. Like McDonald\u2019s, did they all scale by owning land instead of burgers and fries?

          "title": "CBN regulations holding back mobile money revolution in Nigeria",
          "text": "In Ghana, it would be an \u201canomaly\u201d for a supermarket, small store, or business merchant to not use a mobile money service for transactions. Daniel, a colleague at TechCabal, who visited Ghana two weeks ago said the same during a recent meeting.\n\nMobile money was first introduced in Ghana in 2009. However, it took some time for it to gain traction due to a restrictive Branchless Banking policy of the Bank of Ghana.\n\nNew agent and electronic money guidelines were released in 2014, allowing network operators to run mobile money services, with supervision from the banking regulator.\n\nEver since, players such as MTN have invested heavily in mobile money operations with great success. The telco giant launched its MoMo service in January 2017. By January 2019, over 100,000 merchants were using the service.\n\nUptake in mobile money services and financial inclusion have equally increased across the country. A March 2020 Summary of Economic and Financial Data published by the Bank of Ghana showed that the country had 14.7 million active mobile money accounts and 235,000 active agents.\n\nOn the other end of the cardinal point is M-Pesa\u2019s success in East African countries, particularly Kenya. The mobile money service, owned and operated by telco Safaricom, has significantly contributed to improving the financial inclusion rate in Nairobi.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the government is banking on a mobile money service run by the state-owned network operator, Ethio Telecom, to increase financial inclusion among low-income groups. The service soared to more than 1 million registered users in one week, 4 million in a month, and 6 million in two months.\n\nDespite being home to Africa\u2019s largest unbanked population, Nigeria has not witnessed the same exponential growth in mobile money adoption and lags behind its regional peers when it comes to penetration.\n\nChasing financial inclusion\n\nFinancial inclusion for 200 million Nigerians has been a much-touted priority of Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration and the central bank under governor Godwin Emefiele\u2019s leadership. Still, it\u2019s a goal that has been elusive.\n\nNigeria has a significantly large population without access to financial services. In 2017, it was home to 3.4% of the world\u2019s unbanked people despite contributing 2.6% to the global population.\n\nSome progress has been made over the past decade to bring more Nigerians under the formal financial system, according to a report by EFinA, but the figures remain disturbing.\n\nAt the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked as the central bank missed out on its 80% national financial inclusion target. In addition, just over 40 million out of an estimated 105.5 million Nigerian adults have bank verification numbers (BVN), an important metric for gauging how many people have access to financial services.\n\nThe CBN has adopted several measures \u2013 such as the creation of special Payment Services Banks (PSBs) in 2018 \u2013 to drive financial inclusion.\n\nHowever, the apex bank has shown reluctance towards adopting a framework that has proved to be very effective in improving financial inclusion in many African countries: telecoms-driven mobile money services.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nPayment service banks, not mobile money operators\n\nIn 2018, CBN announced a new regime that would allow non-financial companies to apply for mobile banking licences \u2013 either as PSBs or Mobile Money Operators (MMOs).\n\nUnder the guidelines, mobile network operators are allowed to provide financial services to millions of unbanked Nigerians. However, they can do so only as payment service banks and through a subsidiary separate from their core operations.\n\nPayment service banks are like small-scale banks. While they\u2019re similar to typical banks, the scope of their license is strictly to deepen financial inclusion and the regulator forbids them from engaging in credit risk and foreign exchange operations.\n\nMore than two years after the CBN\u2019s announcement, just three companies (including mobile operators 9mobile and Globacom) have been granted PSB licences. The two other network companies in the country, MTN and Airtel, are yet to get a regulatory nod to launch their Payment Service Banks. Although the former launched an agent network for money transfers in 2019.\n\nThe lack of progress on licences \u2013 particularly for two telcos that have significant mobile money experience in other markets in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 calls into question how dedicated the central bank is to really broaden access to financial services in the country.\n\nSome industry stakeholders blame the issue on lobbying by traditional financial institutions said to be wary of telco-led mobile money services. Banks perceive that network operators would claim their territory if allowed to offer standalone financial services.\n\nAccording to one telecom industry expert who asked not to be named, the \u201cbig banks are fighting back behind the scenes to ensure telcos don\u2019t come to have their lunch.\u201d\n\nWill telcos ever lead?\n\nIn Nigeria, the mobile money landscape is dominated by banks, technology, and financial services companies. Contrary to what is seen in Kenya and Ghana, telecoms operators are not allowed to apply directly for mobile money licences and are instead restricted to the provision of network infrastructure for the use of mobile money operators.\n\nThe regulatory framework is one of the core reasons why mobile money uptake has been relatively slow in Nigeria. As of 2019, there were just over 15 million mobile money accounts in the country, compared to nearly 60 million in Kenya, which is home to fewer than 55 million people.\n\nFintech companies have recorded significant strides towards advancing financial inclusion in Nigeria. Companies such as Paga and Teamapt democratise access to financial services through their agent networks and mobile payments infrastructure.\n\nBut telecoms companies are more positioned to deepen mobile money services due to their subscriber numbers, available infrastructure, and broader agent networks, which outnumber those of banks and fintechs. MTN and Airtel agents can be seen selling recharge cards in nearly every corner of the country.\n\n\u201cThe telecoms industry has ready infrastructure and resources to push financial inclusion all over the country. If you truly want to deepen the use of mobile technology for financial service, the last mile to reach the people is through network operators,\u201d the expert said.\n\nThere have been calls for a more liberalised regulatory framework where telcos lead. However, if the CBN\u2019s latest mobile money regulatory framework published July 9 is anything to go by, network operators will continue to play the second fiddle in Nigeria\u2019s mobile money space under the current administration.\n\nIn the new framework, the banking regulator reiterates its long-held stance that Nigeria will not adopt the model in which telecommunications companies are the drivers of mobile money services.\n\n\u201cThe CBN recognises the importance of Mobile Network Operators in the operations of mobile money services and appreciates the criticality of the infrastructure they provide. However, the telco-led model (where the lead initiator is an MNO) shall not be operational in Nigeria,\u201d the 40-page document reads.\n\nThe framework stated only two acceptable models for the implementation of mobile money services: bank-led (bank and/or its consortium as lead initiator) and non-bank-led (a corporate organisation duly licensed by the CBN as lead initiator).\n\nAlthough the CBN says it recognises the importance of telecoms companies in providing the infrastructure to drive the exchange of messages for mobile payments, it feels compelled to prohibit the Telco-led option. This, according to the bank, is to \u201cretain full control of monetary policy operations, minimise risks and ensure that the offering of financial services is driven by organisations that have been licensed to do so.\u201d\n\nAfter failing to meet its 2020 target, the CBN has revised its financial inclusion goal to 95% by 2024. But with its continued regulatory conservatism towards telecoms-led mobile money, the regulator is likely to find it only more difficult to bring millions of unbanked Nigerians into the financial system.\n\n\u201cCBN\u2019s models will only slow down financial inclusion penetration,\u201d the expert said. \u201cInstead, telecoms companies should be allowed to take the lead in the mobile money space as seen in other African countries. This is the only way speedy coverage and easy access can be achieved and financial inclusion improved.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "This app wants to simplify Twitter giveaways, without bank accounts",
          "text": "Let\u2019s say I wanted to send a surprise \u2018happy birthday\u2019 cash gift to a friend; my first thought would be to ask for their bank account number. I would do this for people I know very well but also for someone I only know on social media.\n\nBut what if my virtual friend, feeling we are not buddies as such or having been scarred by online money doubling scams, hesitates to share such personal information? Can I thrill them on their special day by using public information I have about them?\n\nSometime in June, I tried Vendly, a web app that is trialling a solution for this need (or desire, if you\u2019re not yet persuaded). \u2018Payments made Social\u2019 the landing page declares on a light green background. Bob Nzelu, the brain behind it, described it to me as a way to share and receive items of digital value \u2013 money, crypto, airtime, e-tickets \u2013 over social media.\n\n\u201cLike sending money through email addresses using PayPal, Vendly hopes to replicate that using social media handles,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that is just the basic use case he anticipates, cutting in to assuage my skepticism that money transfer on social media is a compelling enough value to build a (potentially venture-backed) company on. Long-term, Vendly will help social media users monetize their social media presence, the CEO said.\n\nBack to social money vending. Nzelu believes Vendly is similar to Cash App and Venmo because it seeks to simplify transfers between people who don\u2019t know each other. \u201cVendly is not built for chummy friends who have each other\u2019s account details.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor this type of relationship, creating a \u2018vend\u2019 with a social media handle and sharing the link with a beneficiary walks a fine line of not being too personal or invasive while caring.\n\nIt\u2019s the online equivalent of a co-worker dropping a birthday cake with a card at your desk but not inside your drawer.\n\nSomeone who receives a vend can decide to either make a claim for or ignore it by clicking the link in their DM. The message states the amount sent; recipient inputs the bank account where they want the cash to go. And like cakes, the link expires after some time (Nzelu sent me a vend of about $1 as a demo).\n\nVendly stores the recipient\u2019s bank details to make future transfers seamless but the sender never sees the account information. Because a sender can create one vend to go to multiple social media handles, Nzelu thinks it should appeal to brands or influencers who target giveaways at 3 million Nigerian social media users who have a bank account and phone number.\n\nVendly is part of a crop of social gifting apps seeking to delight people online.\n\nA few months ago, after my managing editor promised to get me a book, I got a Tweet from Showlove, a Lagos-based company, with a voucher to claim my books at a particular bookstore (thanks again, KK). Getcards, a product of the cryptocurrency startup Buycoins, was floated last December for people who want to gift services like a Netflix subscription, an Amazon or Delta airlines ticket to friends and family.\n\nLike these two services, Vendly hopes that its first platform for traction will be Twitter, because the platform is the most friendly for services that require people to click links to claim rewards.\n\nBut Nzelu knows that can\u2019t be the long-term plan. After all, Twitter is officially banned in Nigeria at the moment, an event that currently hampers Vendly\u2019s ability to be fully functional. An alternative is to send vends using phone numbers, although that option might raise privacy concerns. Integrating other platforms \u2013 Instagram, Facebook \u2013 is on their roadmap.\n\nRight now, Vendly is a prototype undergoing iteration. It may yet face hard questions about monetization, like Abeg\u2019s mobile app which launched last year to enable peer-to-peer money transfers using social handles. But Nzelu says Vendly will answer most user concerns at launch in a few weeks.\n\nHe\u2019s been working at it for two years now and feels the time is right to tap into the social and creator economy bump that started last year. Being Nigerian, his home country is the market of choice. But if it proves tough for a start, Vendly will seek initial users in Ghana, Kenya and Uganda.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Telecommunications infrastructure owned by several mobile network operators was severely damaged in the rampant looting and destruction of property that rocked South Africa last week.\n\nThe Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) revealed on Tuesday, July 13, that the vandalism included more than 100 mobile network towers in some parts of the country.\n\nAfter the statement, rioters destroyed many more mobile sites, according to multiple reports. Virtually all network providers operating in South Africa reported disruption to service delivery.\n\nMTN alone reported damage to over 100 of its base stations which the company\u2019s technicians could not safely reach the sites to repair.\n\n\u201cOver 1,000 MTN employees can\u2019t get to work, and millions of calls and queries from our customers cannot be attended to, as our primary call centre remains inaccessible,\u201d MTN South Africa chief executive, Godfrey Motsa, said Friday.\n\nAccording to Vodacom spokesperson, Byron Kennedy, there was a connectivity issue that affected customers in many parts of the country. Like MTN, the crisis prevented its staff from fixing a fault in its infrastructure.\n\n\u201cUnrest in these areas meant that it wasn\u2019t safe for technicians to immediately visit affected sites physically to remedy faults,\u201d Kennedy was quoted as saying by MyBroadband. An estimated five to ten of Vodacom\u2019s base stations at malls were also damaged by fires.\n\nData-only operator Rain, which has a lease agreement for using Vodacom\u2019s network towers, also said it has sites in the affected areas that had been vandalised and were down.

Hundreds of businesses have been destroyed and more than 200 people have died.\n\nSouth African authorities believe the unrest was deliberately provoked by political opponents to force president Cyril Ramaphosa to pardon Zuma or even step down.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "The war against drug abuse \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe rate of drug abuse in Nigeria, particularly among the youths is assuming an alarming dimension.\n\nA recent data released by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), showed that over 20 million Nigerians are involved in drug abuse out of which 60 per cent are youths.\n\nMostly involved are youths in higher institutions and in the entertainment sector.\n\nDr Obi Adagwu, an expert on drug control, explained that the resurgence of drug use among the youths is due to poor enforcement and inadequate policy to curtail it.\n\n\u201cHow many drug rehabilitation centres exist in the country? The few we have, how effective are they?\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said the war against drug abuse should start from homes, as most parents who are supposed to be mentors do not monitor their children.\n\n\u201cSome parents do not even know at what point their children got involved with drugs.\n\n\u201cThe fight against drug abuse should also be taken to government offices, there are so many government officials abusing drugs,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nAdagwu who is a psychologist, also blamed the government for not giving sufficient support to agencies with the mandate to check drug abuse.\n\nNDLEA spokesman, Femi Babafemi, who spoke on the efforts of the agency to tackle drug abuse, said that over 400 suspects and large quantities of drugs were intercepted in the past few months by officials of the agency from various routes, including airports.\n\nAccording to him, over 200 cases are at various stages of prosecution.\n\n\u201c We solicit media support and other Nigerians to give information to the agency, no effort shall be spared to rid the country of illicit drugs, \u2018\u2019he added.\n\nMr James Ojomo, an expert in drug abuse, says many of the major towns including Kano, Kaduna, Abuja and Lagos are veritable grounds for drug abusers.\n\n\u201c For some time, the country was not serious in waging war against drug abuse, as we were treating it with kid grooves.\n\n\u201cIllicit drug users and its barons were having a field day, turning the country into a destination route rather than a transit.\n\n\u201cWith the ongoing restructuring of NDLEA, and a new henchman in the person of Buba Marwa, the agency has been rejuvenated and the war has just begun,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOjomo says that what is expected from the rest of us is to give information and expose barons amongst us that are threatening to destroy our youths and the future of the country.\n\nSome concerned Nigerians say that over the years, successive regimes in Nigeria had taken steps to improve the country\u2019s reputation as an international drug trafficking centre.\n\nAccording to them, most of the emphasis had fallen on law enforcement and repression, resulting in a sharp increase in the number of arrests and prison population.\n\nIn spite of such severe measures, experts say a correlative fall in drug consumption has not been witnessed.\n\nThey added that with the renewed effort by the NDLEA and support from the Federal Government, the war against drug abuse will be tackled and won in no distant time.\n\nThey also stressed the need to strengthen the law against drug use.\n\nProf. Isiodore Obot, the Director, Centre for Research and Information on Substance Abuse, said that Nigeria had failed in its drug war, considering the large number of youths involved in drug usage and abuse.\n\nObot, who spoke at the Youthrise Nigeria Drug Policy Training for media practitioners recently in Abuja, said in spite criminalising drug use for many years, this had not achieved its goal of eliminating drug production and use.\n\nAccording to him, the nation\u2019s perspective about drugs from a criminal justice system perspective needs to be changed to healthcare system perspective.\n\nObot, who is also a psychologist, declared that drug use was much more than a criminal issue, but one with many health and social implications, including fighting, violence, among others.\n\nHe said drug use cuts across all social classes and gender, adding that what may be different is what type of drug they are using.\n\nHe listed illegal drugs commonly used as cannabis sativa, cocaine, heroin, amphetamine-type stimulants and inhalants and solvents such as glue.\n\nProf. Mojisola Adeyeye, the Director-General, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), attributed the high rate of drug abuse to lack of control of prescribed drugs, among others.\n\nAdeyeye who spoke at an event to mark the 2020 International Drug Awareness Day in Abuja, said other factors responsible for drug abuse are the love for money by peddlers, unemployment, disobedience to the laws of the land.\n\nOther reasons she identified as responsible for drug abuse are smuggling substances through our porous seaports and land borders, corruption and light penalties for the sellers and traffickers.\n\nAccording to her, the only way to check abuse is for the government to develop and enforce a National Prescription Policy.\n\nAdeyeye appealed to the three arms of government not to relent on its efforts in the fight against drug abuse, stressing that they have a major role to play by putting in place, stiffer penalties, that are commensurate with the offences of drug abuse.\n\nShe called on ministries, departments and agencies, religious bodies, educational institutions and parents to join hands with government in the fight against drug abuse.\n\nWhile identifying drugs like tramadol and codeine as the most commonly abused drugs in the country, the NAFDAC D-G had this to say: \u201cTramadol is a synthetic analgesic used to treat moderate to severe pains and is the most abused medicine among addicts.\n\n\u201cTramadol and codeine are regulated as 50mg and 100mg dosage strengths, but very high dosage forms of 200mg and 225 mg have infiltrated the market,\u201d she added.\n\nShe advised youths in the country to desist from drug abuse as it portends very high risks such as arrhythmias, cramps, coma, and death.\n\n\u201cWe need to rescue our youths from the use of illicit drugs, to achieve this, all hands must be on deck, relevant agencies must work together,\u2019\u2019 she emphasised.\n\n_________________________\n\nJulius Enehikhuere, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)\n\n...",

B Abubakar, informed the judge that Mr Kanu\u2019s absence might be due to \u201clogistical\u201d issues encountered by the SSS, the agency holding him in custody.\n\nHowever, Mr Kanu\u2019s lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, countered the claim of the prosecution, saying the IPOB leader had been moved out of Abuja.\n\nThe separatist, who was granted bail in April 2017, fled the country after the invasion of his home in Afara-Ukwu, near Umuahia, Abia State, by the military in September of that year.\n\nMr Kanu was rearrested and brought back to Nigeria in June, about four years after his trial on charges of treasonable felony was stalled due to his disappearance from the country.\n\nThe judge had on June 29 ordered Mr Kanu to remain in SSS custody.\n\nIt remains unclear why the SSS failed to produce him in court on Monday, as the operatives of the spy agency had taken over the premises and the adjoining roads much earlier before the proceedings started at about 11.10a.m.\n\nMore details soon\u2026",

Liaison with Sect 2 MIB revealed that a SAR operation is being conducted while the driver of the bus in which the soldiers were traveling is suspected to be a prime suspect in the incident due to some indicators.

B. Abubakar, blamed Kanu\u2019s absence in court on what he termed as \u201clogistical problems\u201d.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the matter was slated for hearing, Abubakar told the court that he was ready to proceed in Kanu\u2019s absence, adding that he has three witnesses ready to testify.\n\nThe Prosecution however sought the court\u2019s direction on whether the matter could go on, considering that the High Court has commenced its annual vacation.\n\nHe argued that it would be impossible to proceed with the case in the absence of a Fiat from the Chief Judge of the High Court.\n\nOn his part, Kanu\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Ifeanyi Ejiofor told the court that the life of his client was in danger.\n\nEjiofor told the court that he had been unable to have access to his client for the past 10 days.\n\n\u201cMy lord, speaking from the Bar, I got it on good authority that my client has been taken away, outside the jurisdiction of this court,\u201d he said.\n\nEjiofor equally argued that it would be in the interest of justice for CJ of the court to issue Fiat for the trial to go on during the courts vacation.\n\nMeanwhile, trial Justice Binta Nyako noted that the case could not go on in the absence of the Defendant.\n\n\u201cI am also worried why the Defendant is not here. The first step in a criminals matter is to provide the Defendant in court. He is not here.\n\nThough Justice Nyako acknowledged that she could not proceed with the case without Fiat allowing her to sit as a vacation judge, she made an order, directing the DSS to grant Kanu access to his lawyers, Vanguard reported.\n\nThe judge also ordered that Kanu must be produced before the court on October 21 which is the next adjourned date for the matter",

You might have done it to others; you are about to learn a lesson if you touch me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you know what I have done in secret, bring it to the open. I dare you to come after me if you can. I worked with you; I worked for you; I supported you to get there (where you are). When I talk now, I now have a smelly mouth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in meeting you any longer; no more visits. Now, it is war, because Nigeria must be set free.\u201d\n\nIn the sermon, Bakare also slammed the Buhari government for clamping down on leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu and Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho.\n\nHe urged government to enthrone justice, instead of using intimidation and brutality.\n\nBakare also told the congregation how he backed the unnamed top official to his current position.\n\n\u201cHave you forgotten that you vowed never to contest again. I said \u2018not so\u2019. I showed you how you can win the next election and you agreed to run and you won. I was not considering myself but concerned about how Nigeria can become great.\n\n\u201cWinning an election is a different thing; doing the right thing is another. No one must behave as if Nigeria is a personal property. Nigeria must be set free and any obstruction along the way must be removed; it must get out of the way.\u201d\n\nHe told Nigerians to be prepared for baton of change, recalling how he pronounced the late Gen Sani Abacha\u2019s days numbered during his fist rule.",

          "text": "\u2026says the school has zero tolerance for sexual harassment\n\nThe Secondary school at the center of controversy over the death of Keren Akpagher, Premiere Academy Lugbe, Abuja , has pushed back on allegations of sexual harassment leading to the death of the 14-year-old SS1 student.\n\nActing Principal of the school, Mr. Chris Akinsowon, in a statement on Thursday, said the school has zero-tolerance for sexual harassment of any kind, whether verbal or physical, as well as in-campus misconduct.\n\nAkinsowon vowed that \u201cin the unlikely event that any form of sexual assault happened to Miss Keren Akpagher in the school, leading to her death, the School Board and Management will join hands with all relevant security agencies to prosecute such a person in line with the laws of the land.\u201d\n\nThe acting principal, who provided further clarifications on the alleged assault of the deceased student, however, maintained that Keren\u2019s autopsy result was not yet out, stressing that it is part of the investigation the school insists must be allowed to take its course and earnestly awaits the result.\n\n\u201cThe autopsy result is not out yet. It is a part of the investigation process the school insists must be allowed to take its course. We earnestly await the result and plead that nothing should be said to pre-empt whatever the outcome might be,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the alleged staff of the school that was sent on indefinite suspension and dismissal, he noted that the dismissal of the staff was \u201c based on a careless talk with a student; that\u2019s part of our commitment in making the school safe for our students and earn the confidence of our parents.\u201d\n\nHe described reports that their students have sworn to an \u2018oath of secrecy\u2019 as very disturbing, stating that \u201chow can secondary students take an \u2018oath of secrecy; this is nothing but blackmail and an attempt to divert the minds of the public from the truth.\u201d\n\nHe assured the general public that \u201cas a school established to train future leaders, we will never give in to spineless, chinless and directionless individuals who are all out to cause people to have a negative opinion of the school.\n\nSpeaking further on Keren\u2019s demise, he said upon her \u201cadmission to the Queen\u2019s Hospital, Wuse Zone 11, Abuja on early Monday, 21st June 2021, the school\u2019s representatives went there to visit her and her mother.\n\n\u201cWe reached out to the family on the very Tuesday, 22nd of June, when we were informed of her demise at the hospital, all activities for that day in the school were shut down. The Management staff and some members of staff went to commiserate with her.\n\n\u201cThe following day, 23rd June, the visit was repeated with a Board member and some staff to deliver a condolence letter, even though she was not in, we delivered it. On the 24th June, 4 members of staff went again, but they were denied entry right from the gate of the Estate. The PTA Executives of the school went on the same day and were equally prevented from entering from the gate of the Estate.\n\n\u201cKeren\u2019s mother denied granting any interviews, yet media houses, publications, social media, and bloggers have been quoting her. A valedictory Service was conducted in memory of Keren Akpagher in the Academy on Monday, 12th July, 2021.\n\nAkinsowon was responding to an earlier press conference held on Wednesday, in which the leader of the Coalition of Gender-Based Violence Responders, Lemmy Ughegbe, alleged that Premiere Academy was one of the schools engaging in the ignoble act of sexual harassment.\n\nUghegbe accused the FCT police of acting like image-makers of Premiere Academy by defending the action and role of the school and failed to release, Katen\u2019s medical report to the mother.\n\nHe said \u201cThe FCT Deputy Commissioner of Police, Fom Pam Joseph, has held on to the medical report of the deceased and refused to give it to the biological mother of the girl. The idea is if she gets it, she will share it with the press. Is the Police PRO of Premiere Academy? What is the business of the police with what the mother does with the information on the medical report?\n\n\u201cOf course as an investigative journalist working with a coalition, we have gotten the medical report that corroborates the fact that this girl was raped with a condom left inside of her. That condom eventually caused sepsis which led to her untimely death.\u201d\n\nHe alleged that a preliminary report of an autopsy conducted on Keren by the official doctor appointed by the police, Dr. Desmond Ike Okonkwo of Maitama General Hospital, revealed that she was raped.\n\nUghegbe challenged the school management to a \u2013 media dialogue to discuss the rape and death of Keren-Happuch and other cases of sexual molestation, which it has the record of covering instead of handing pedophiles to the police.\n\nDuring the press conference, Keren\u2019s mother, Mrs. Vivian Akpagher, who has passed through psychological trauma following the death of her daughter, for the first time, narrated how condom and sperm discharge were found in the deceased\u2019s private part before her death.\n\nThe grieving mother who could not hold back her tears made the revelation while addressing journalists on Wednesday in Abuja said she rushed her daughter to the hospital shortly after picking her from the school following the complaints of pains and weakness.\n\nShe said the doctor while trying to administer drips on her decision to insert a urinary catheter because of her weakness, but surprisingly found sperm discharge and condom left in her private part after a medical test.",

          "text": "What worries one of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists the most?\n\nHeatwaves \u2014 and particularly the tendency of current models to underestimate the intensity of these bursts of deadly, searing temperature.\n\nThis is one of the \u201cmajor mysteries\u201d science still has to unravel, climatologist Robert Vautard told AFP, even as researchers are able to pinpoint with increasing accuracy exactly how human fossil fuel pollution is warming the planet and altering the climate.\n\n\u201cToday we have better climate projection models, and longer observations with a much clearer signal of climate change,\u201d said Vautard, one of the authors of an upcoming assessment by the United Nations\u2019 panel of climate experts.\n\n\u201cIt was already clear, but it is even clearer and more indisputable today.\u201d\n\nThe assessment, the first part of a trio of reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), will be released on August 9 at the end of meetings starting Monday.\n\nIt focuses on the science underpinning our understanding of things like temperature increases, rising ocean levels and extreme weather events.\n\nThis has progressed considerably since the last assessment in 2014, but so has climate change itself, with effects being felt ever more forcefully across the planet.\n\n\u2018Phenomenal\u2019 heat\n\nScientists now have a greater understanding of the mechanisms behind \u201cextreme phenomena, which now occur almost every week around the world\u201d, said Vautard, adding that this helps better quantify how these events will play out in the future.\n\nIn almost real time, researchers can pinpoint the role of climate change in a given disaster, something they were unable to do at all until very recently.\n\nNow, so-called \u201cattribution\u201d science means we can say how probable an extreme weather event would have been had the climate not been changing at all.\n\nFor example, within days of the extraordinary \u201cheat dome\u201d that scorched the western United States and Canada at the end of June, scientists from the World Weather Attribution calculated that the heatwave would have been \u201calmost impossible\u201d without warming.\n\nDespite these advances, Vautard said \u201cmajor mysteries remain\u201d.\n\nScientists are still unsure what part clouds play \u201cin the energy balance of the planet\u201d and their influence on the climate\u2019s sensitivity to greenhouse gases, he said.\n\nBut it is \u201cphenomenal temperatures\u201d, like those recorded in June in Canada or in Europe in 2019, that preoccupy the climatologist.\n\n\u201cWhat worries me the most are the heat waves\u201d and the \u201cthousands of deaths\u201d they cause, said Vautard, who is director of France\u2019s Pierre-Simon Laplace Institute, a climate research and teaching centre.\n\nWith rainfall, scientists have a physical law that says water vapour increases by seven percent for every degree of warming, he said, with intense precipitation increasing by about the same amount.\n\nBut extreme heat is harder to predict.\n\n\u201cWe know that heatwaves are more frequent, but we also know that our models underestimate the increasing intensity of these heatwaves, particularly in Europe, by a factor of two,\u201d he said.\n\nClimate models have come a long way, even since 2014, but there is still room for improvement to reduce these uncertainties.\n\n\u201cBefore we had models that represented the major phenomena in the atmosphere, in the oceans,\u201d said Vautard.\n\nToday the models divide the planet\u2019s surface into grids, with each square around 10 kilometres (six miles).\n\nBut even now he said the \u201cresolution of the models is not sufficient\u201d for very localised phenomena.\n\nThe next generation of models should be able to add even more detail, going down to an area of about a kilometre.\n\nThat would give researchers a much better understanding of \u201csmall scale\u201d events, like tornadoes, hail or storm systems that bring intense rain like those seen in parts of the Mediterranean in 2020.\n\nTipping points\n\nEven on a global scale, some fundamental questions remain.\n\nPerhaps one of the most ominous climate concepts to have become better understood in recent years is that of \u201ctipping points\u201d.\n\nThese could be triggered for example by the melting of the ice caps or the decline of the Amazon rainforest, potentially swinging the climate system into dramatic and irreversible changes.\n\nThere are still \u201ca lot of uncertainties and mysteries\u201d about tipping points, Vautard said, including what level of temperature rise might set them off.\n\nCurrently, they are seen as low probability events, but he said that it is still crucial to know more about them given the \u201cirreversible consequences on the scale of millennia\u201d that they could cause.\n\nAnother crucial uncertainty is the state of the world\u2019s forests and oceans, which absorb about half of the CO2 emitted by humans.\n\n\u201cWill this carbon sink function continue to be effective or not?\u201d Vautard said.\n\nIf they stop absorbing carbon \u2014 as has been found in areas of the Amazon, for example \u2014 then more C02 will accumulate in the atmosphere, raising temperatures even further.\n\n\u201cIt is a concern,\u201d said Vautard.\n\n-AFP",

          "text": "Tunisia\u2019s president has suspended parliament and dismissed Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi in a move condemned as an attack on democracy by his rivals but which others greeted with celebrations on the streets.\n\nPresident Kais Saied said on Sunday he would assume executive authority with the assistance of a new prime minister after violent protests broke out in several Tunisian cities over the government\u2019s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economy.\n\nIt is the biggest challenge yet to a 2014 constitution that split powers between the president, prime minister and parliament.\n\n\u201cMany people were deceived by hypocrisy, treachery and robbery of the rights of the people,\u201d he said in a statement carried on state media.\n\n\u201cI warn any who think of resorting to weapons \u2026 and whoever shoots a bullet, the armed forces will respond with bullets,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also suspended the immunity of members of parliament, insisting his actions were in line with the constitution.\n\nThe statement followed an emergency meeting at his palace after thousands of Tunisians marched in several cities, with much of the anger focused on the Ennahdha party, the biggest in parliament.\n\nTunisian Parliament Speaker Rached Ghannouchi accused President Saied of launching \u201ca coup against the revolution and constitution\u201d after the move.\n\n\u201cWe consider the institutions to be still standing and supporters of Ennahdha and the Tunisian people will defend the revolution,\u201d Ghannouchi, who heads Ennahdha, told the Reuters news agency by phone.\n\nThe party also condemned the president\u2019s move as a \u201cstate coup against the revolution\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat Kais Saied is doing is a state coup against the revolution and against the constitution, and the members of Ennahdha and the Tunisian people will defend the revolution,\u201d Ennahdha wrote in a statement on its Facebook page.\n\nSaied has been enmeshed in political disputes with Prime Minister Mechichi for more than a year, as the country grapples with an economic crisis, and a flailing response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSaied and the parliament were elected in separate popular votes in 2019, while Mechichi took office last year, replacing another short-lived government.\n\nTunis-based journalist Rabeb Aloui told Al Jazeera that Saied\u2019s move did not come as a surprise, as he had threatened to dissolve parliament and sack the prime minister.\n\n\u201cSince last September we (have) lived under a political crisis,\u201d Aloui said.\n\nShe said many young Tunisians, particularly those who were protesting on Sunday, have expressed joy at the announcement.\n\nThe demonstrators had also called for social and economic reforms, however, and those issues still need to be addressed, Aloui added.\n\n\u201cWe are really living under an economic crisis, with the health crisis too [from] the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d she said.\n\nTunisia has been overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases, with more than 18,000 people dying from the disease in the country of about 12 million.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a failure of governments and the president himself is offering no leadership,\u201d William Lawrence, a professor at the American University in Washington DC and an expert on Tunisia, told Al Jazeera. \u201cHis solution is to fire people, a bit like the former president of the United States. Despite the jubilation in certain corners of Tunisia, there is not widespread jubilation I don\u2019t think. So far, we don\u2019t see a president who has the authority or the ability to solve the problems (Tunisia faces).\u201d\n\nThousands of people had defied virus restrictions and the scorching heat to demonstrate earlier on Sunday in Tunis, the capital, and other cities. The crowds of mostly young people shouted \u201cGet out!\u201d and slogans calling for the dissolution of parliament and early elections.\n\nThe protests were called on the 64th anniversary of Tunisia\u2019s independence by a new group called the July 25 Movement.\n\nThere was heavy security presence, especially in Tunis where police blockades blocked all streets leading to the capital\u2019s main road, Avenue Bourguiba. The avenue was a key site for the Tunisian revolution 10 years ago that brought down a dictatorial government and unleashed the Arab Spring uprisings.\n\nA Tunisian protester lifts a national flag at an anti-government rally as security forces block off the road in front of the parliament in the capital Tunis [Fethi Belaid/AFP]\n\nPolice were also deployed around the parliament, preventing demonstrators from accessing it.\n\nIn Tunis on Sunday, police used pepper spray against protesters who threw stones and shouted slogans demanding that Prime Minister Mechichi quit and parliament be dissolved.\n\nWitnesses said protesters stormed or tried to storm the offices of Ennahdha in Monastir, Sfax, El Kef and Sousse, while in Tozeur they set fire to the party\u2019s local headquarters.\n\nEnnahdha, banned before the revolution, has been the most consistently successful party since 2011 and a member of successive coalition governments.\n\nThe sacking of Tunisia\u2019s parliament is the latest step along a bumpy road since the country\u2019s 2011 revolution.",

She was having separate meetings with Xie, who is in charge of U.S.-China relations, and Foreign Minister Wang Yi at a closed-off resort hotel in the city of Tianjin.\n\nRelations between the countries deteriorated sharply under Biden\u2019s predecessor, Donald Trump, and the two sides remain at odds over a host of issues including technology, cybersecurity, human rights and other issues.\n\nXie said China wants to seek common ground while shelving differences. The Biden administration has said it will cooperate in some areas but confront China in others, such as human rights, describing the relationship as collaborative, competitive and adversarial.\n\nIn an interview Saturday, Wang accused the U.S. of adopting a superior attitude and using its strength to pressure other countries.\n\n\u201cChina would never accept any country that claims to be superior to others,\u201d he told China\u2019s Phoenix Television. \u201cIf the U.S. has not learned to treat other countries equally, China and the international community have the responsibility to help the U.S. learn how to do this.\u201d\n\nBiden administration officials have said the goal of the talks is not to negotiate specific issues but to keep high-level communications channels open. The U.S. wants to ensure that guardrails are in place to prevent competition between the countries from becoming conflict, they said.\n\nA possible meeting between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to be on the agenda, possibly on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Rome at the end of October.\n\nSherman, who arrived Sunday evening from Mongolia, tweeted \u201cheartfelt condolences (from the United States) to those who have lost loved ones\u201d in severe storms and flooding last week that killed at least 63 people in Henan province.\n\nHer meetings follow an initial and highly contentious meeting in March in Anchorage, Alaska, where Wang and veteran Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi flew to meet Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan.\n\nJohn Kerry, the Biden administration\u2019s special climate envoy, traveled to Shanghai for meetings with his Chinese counterpart in April.",

Both leaders have been critical of Dr Fauci\u2019s advice in the past.\n\nDr Fauci has been a key adviser to President Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump, through the pandemic.\n\nHe said he was involved in discussions to change mask guidance issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nAs it stands, the CDC says people who are fully vaccinated can \u201cresume activities that you did before the pandemic without wearing a mask\u201d.\n\nDr Fauci said local governments could issue their own rules under the current CDC guidance.\n\nBut he noted that some local governments had reinstated indoor and public mask requirements to curb rising infections.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, masks are now required indoors for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people.",
