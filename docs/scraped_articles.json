          "text": "A Federal High Court, Abuja, on Monday, nullified the participation of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate, Andy Uba, in the Nov. 6 Anambra governorship election.\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo, in a judgment, held that the June 26 primary of the party which produced Uba as its standard-bearer was not validly conducted.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Chief George Moghalu, an aspirant in the APC primary election had challenged the process and the outcome of the primary election that produced Uba as the party\u2019s candidate.\n\nMoghalu, who was the plaintiff, had sued the party, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and Uba as 1st to 3rd defendants respectively.\n\nDelivering the judgment, Justice Ekwo aligned with the plaintiff\u2019s arguments that the June 26 primary election breached the provisions of the Electoral Act and the APC guidelines for the conduct of the exercise.\n\nHe held that the plaintiff had successfully demonstrated that the primary election was not conducted in accordance with the law and the party\u2019s guidelines.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the case of the plaintiff succeeds on its merit,\u201d he said.\n\nEkwo held that since the election was conducted illegally, the APC (1st defendant) cannot be a beneficiary of the Nov. 6 election which produced the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) candidate, Prof. Charles Soludo, as the winner of the poll outcome.\n\nThe judge, therefore, declared that the APC had no candidate in the Anambra governorship election by non-inclusion of the name of Moghalu in the primary election, and the conduct of the poll in contravention of the Electoral Act and the party\u2019s guidelines.\n\n\u201cThe 2nd defendant (INEC) is compelled to delist the name of the 1st defendant and 3rd defendant from the Nov. 6, Anambra governorship election,\u201d he ordered.\n\nAccording to the judge, any election conducted contrary to the 1st defendant guideline is in nullity.\n\n\u201cThe real issue was not whether accredited members of 1st defendant voted on that day but whether the election was conducted in accordance with the election guidelines of 1st defendant,\u201d he held.\n\nHe also said that the evidence of the police report confirmed that the election was conducted outside the time frame.\n\nEkwo, who described the conduct of the primary by APC as \u201ccrude and primitive,\u201d ordered that the N22.5 million paid by Moghalu as expression of interest and nomination forms be refunded since the party failed to complied with the provisions of the law and its guidelines.\n\nNAN reports that Moghalu had, in July, filed the suit at the court, seeking an order removing Uba and the APC from the list of gubernatorial candidates and political parties partaking in the Anambra governorship election on the grounds that the party failed to conduct a valid primary election.\n\nHe also demanded N122.5 million as damages, which include a refund for the fee paid for expression of interest and nomination forms and N100 million \u201cfor the breach of contract to commence and conclude primary election\u201d.\n\nINEC had picked Uba, winner of the APC primary election, as the party\u2019s candidate.\n\nIn the affidavit in support of the suit, the plaintiff said the APC failed to conclude the selection and nomination process for its candidate for the Nov. 6 governorship poll.\n\nHe said the APC had chosen to adopt direct primary, which is why the party published the list of designated venues for the exercise.\n\nMoghalu said the party received N22.5 million for the expression of interest form and nomination form, including from him, \u201cto allow him to participate in the primary election exercise\u201d.\n\nHe further said he was informed a day before the primaries that the APC electoral committee would address all aspirants and stakeholders in Akwa.\n\n\u201cShockingly, on June 26, 2021, the said election committee was not seen anywhere in Anambra; no accreditation of voters took place; no voting and collation of votes occurred in all the 326 wards of Anambra state,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the committee \u201cannounced election results it did not conduct, and which fakery was credited to the 3rd defendant as the winner of the primary election scheduled for emergence as APC\u2019s candidate in the November 6 governorship election in Anambra\u201d.\n\nMoghalu also argued that the party did not invite the INEC in line with the law requiring the commission to monitor the exercise.(NAN)\n\nVANGUARD NEWS NIGERIA",

          "text": "Mr Ademola Abidemi, presidential candidate of the Nigeria Community Movement Party at the 2019 general elections says it is uncultured for any Nigerian to wish President Muhammadu Buhari evil on his birthday.\n\nAbidemi stated in Abuja on Monday that it was unfortunate that people wrote negative things against the president in spite of the sacrifices he had been making to make the country a better place for all.\n\n\u201cIf President Buhari had died many years ago as a soldier defending his country, those wishing him evil today would have called him a fallen hero.\n\n\u201cIt is funny to see write-ups that implied that all the woes that had befallen Nigeria were what they wished him.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate to note such hatred and wicked mind-set from Nigerians to a fellow Nigerian.\n\n\u201cIt is also very funny that one of the writers of such negative write up against Buhari ended his curses with the name of Christ,\u2019\u2019 he lamented.\n\nHe wondered where such was written or taught in the Bible.\n\nAccording to Abidemi, the idea of making those evil wishes as prayer points is not different from the concept of kidnappers, bandits and Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nHe stressed that those wishing Buhari death were not different from enemies of the country.\n\nAbidemi also noted that many of such persons had not laboured or sacrificed half of what Buhari had sacrificed in his lifetime for Nigeria.\n\nHe added that attacking the president without justification, could hinder the attackers\u2019 personal prayers for their own well-being.\n\n\u201cSuch prayers are not honoured by God because those making same are not left out of the causes of the challenges and problems you are trying to place on the president.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t pay your tax; urinate on the road; throw refuse on the road; take or give bribe; hurt others in your little capacity and influence, you are not qualified to pray evil on the president.\n\n\u201cIf you go against traffic rules or disobey the laws of Nigeria in any way, you cannot pray evil for the president.\n\n\u201cGod sees through sinners,\u2019\u2019 he stressed.\n\nAbidemi added that trying to condemn the president for his purported errors or mistakes in leadership to the point of raising curses on him in any guise was indirectly cursing Nigeria the more.\n\nHe noted that when some individuals took on former President Goodluck Jonathan between 2014 and 2018, rather than fall under their curses, he has been prospering even the more.\n\n\u201cHe is enjoying his life and moving from glory to glory; the problems befalling an average Nigerian does not in any way affect him.\n\n\u201cEven after office, President Buhari can never live like an ordinary Nigerian except he so chooses,\u2019\u2019 Abidemi stated.\n\nHe added that when God placed people in position of leadership, their failure could only be adjudged by only Him, especially when it is the very first leader of a sovereign nation.\n\nThe former presidential flag bearer congratulated President Buhari on his birthday and wished him long life in prosperity and good health.\n\nAbidemi also wished Buhari more achievements, ability, capacity, wisdom, knowledge and understanding to conquer the challenges befalling his administration and the country and to leave Nigeria better than he met it.

          "title": "BOOK OF THE YEAR: A FRONT ROW PARTICIPANT\u2019S ACCOUNT",
          "text": "It is a series of words as pinprick. It began as a book presentation, and the bigwigs of the Nigerian political firmament gathered, especially of the APC hue. The president, Muhammadu Buhari, in his full light-blue babaringa and loosed-limbed with humour, was accompanied by a raft of governors. That day drew praise for the book, from all sides. Asiwaju Bola Tinubu called him a hero. The president draped him as a rare specimen of integrity. Ogbonnaya Onu, Minister for Science, Technology and Innovation, regarded him as a political icon. The book reviewer and this newspaper\u2019s Editor-at-Large, Segun Ayobolu, pronounced what was to come. He called it a bomb.\n\nSo it has been, a work of barely over 500 pages has been a detonation from denotations. Titled My Participations, former governor of Osun State and former chairman of unprecedented four political parties, Chief Bisi Akande, weaves a skein of his life, but in a larger context it is the political yarn of his generation.\n\nBut he trades tackles with his bare but direct style. There have been quite a few persons uncomfortable with his narratives. Some have so far been quiet, especially former President Olusegun Obasanjo. The retired general and a perennial figure in Nigeria\u2019s contemporary history, comes out of Akande\u2019s telling as a crafty subvert. He is always on the malevolent side of the narrative and Nigeria\u2019s history.\n\nAnother person he overwhelmed with his ire was his deputy as governor of Osun State. He tracked how he fell for the deceptions of a wily man. He became a major stud and matador of retrogression. He eventually became the one who lost his job rather than Akande who was first marked for eviction from the State House. The Ife titan has remained mum.\n\nBut others have squalled in protest. One of them is a chieftain of Yoruba politics, Ayo Adebanjo, who emerges as an undercutting work horse for the obstructions of the Yoruba march forward. He is a follower of Awo who even in Awo\u2019s lifetime was painted in unflattering light with his friend and fellow traveller Olaniwun Ajayi during the fraught era of military overthrow when Akande, Bola Ige and others spent years in Buhari\u2019s gaol. What he has been loud about though is Akande\u2019s reporting that he obtained a certificate of occupancy for a plot at Lekki Phase one from former Lagos State Governor Tinubu who also helped build the house in which he currently lives.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAlso, in an outburst is the former army officer and Akande\u2019s successor as governor, Olagunsoye Oyinlola, who railed about his reporting of graft and lack of faith concerning the construction and siting of a government house.\n\nBoth Oyinlola and Adebanjo belong to countervailing signposts in Southwest politics. Many do not expect them to look at the world from the same lens.\n\nIt has drawn flak from the Presidency about how the vice president was nominated. The vice president who has said his bit long ago has been quiet but others have taken the bait. A newspaper supposedly quoting sources close to the president claimed there was no agreement between the then candidate Buhari and Tinubu to pair the former governor as his running mate. They claimed it was a partnership, and they implied that both agreed on vague terms of engagement.\n\nThe book is not just about these men. Chief Akande reflected a political atmosphere that was marked by shysters as heroes. He took Awolowo for his hero and ensign, and the track light for the west.\n\nNo book has generated thus far this sort of flap since one of his targets, Obasanjo, penned a war memoir that he alone seems to be participant and witness to.\n\nAkande\u2019s My Participations will shake and echo in the political world for a long time. It is courage in penmanship. For telling a story that has spun a spool stories, My Participations is our book of the year.",

          "title": "TRAGEDY OF THE YEAR: IKOYI FOURSCORE TOWER COLLAPSE",
          "text": "Tragically, this was a many-sided tragedy. It was a tragedy not only because a spectacular high-rise under construction in a highbrow neighbourhood was reduced to a lowly status. The 21-storey giant on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, Lagos, had a great fall on November 1.\n\nIt was a tragedy not only because many people who were at the site, for one reason or another, died. The number of fatalities was 46. Each death was a tragedy in its own right. Luckily, 15 others were pulled out alive from the rubble.\n\nIt was a tragedy not only because the dead included the ambitious builder of the ambitious residential tower and CEO of Fourscore Homes, Femi Osibona. He was aged 55.\n\nHe had a grand architectural dream. The fallen tower was one of three towers, collectively known as 360 Degrees Towers. He painted a picture of the project in an interview three months before the tragedy. \u201cWe are actually building a seven-star hotel,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cThey are flats, but we make it feel like you are living in a seven-star hotel. Everything that is in a seven-star hotel, you will have there. But the only difference is that you own the property. We have not advertised and we have sold more than 50 per cent\u2026Here in 360, we have security, exceptional view, offices, clubhouse, and open recreation area. Practically everything you have in a seven-star hotel.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt was a tragedy not only because the building collapse raised questions about structural integrity and the builder\u2019s integrity. The project and the builder attracted attention in 2020 when it was reported that Osibona had tried to prevent officials of the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA) from sealing off the building in question. The agency was said to have observed some \u201canomalies.\u201d\n\nThe agency\u2019s general manager, Gbolahan Oki, was quoted as saying Osibona \u201cgot an approval for a 15-storey building and he exceeded his limit\u2026and the materials he used are so inferior and terrible. The materials he used, the reinforcement, are so terrible. He got approval for 15 floors but built 21.\u201d\n\nThere was a controversy over the number of floors he got approval to build. It was confusing that some high-level state officials claimed the builder got approval for 21 floors.\n\nThe tragedy was heightened following the release of the outcome of a \u201cpreliminary investigation\u201d by the Nigerian Institution of Structural Engineers (NIStructE). Significantly, the body said what it found out would \u201cgive a general indication of what likely led to the unfortunate incident.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe building that collapsed was initially designed for just six floors, and later to 12 floors, before this was further changed to 15 floors,\u201d according to NIStructE president Kehinde Osifala.\n\nHe said in a statement: \u201cIt could not yet be established the adequacy of any properly designed and documented further revision to the eventual (and tragically, final) 21 floors that was being implemented and which collapsed.\u201d\n\nThe professional body said the preliminary investigation \u201calso revealed some evidence of structural inadequacy in the construction and that signs of some structural distress had already started to show within certain elements of the building.\u201d\n\nWhatever measures the builders took to address the observed defects were futile, the body noted, because \u201cthe method of implementation of this was not in accordance with sound structural engineering practices.\u201d\n\nThis picture suggested that disregard for building standards, poor workmanship and materials, and a lack of official oversight were to blame.\n\nIt is incomprehensible how a building allegedly designed to have six floors became a 21-storey tower. Nobody needs building engineering expertise to know that such a building, without appropriate intervention, was a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nIt was a tragedy not only because the disaster was avoidable. It was a tragedy not only because the crumbled tower was said to lack insurance cover. After the tragedy, the Nigerian Insurers Association (NIA) highlighted the importance of respecting building rules, and having insurance to minimise losses.\n\nPerhaps predictably, the Lagos State government set up a panel to investigate the tragedy. The public awaits the result of the probe. It remains to be seen whether the outcome of the probe will help prevent avoidable building collapse, which has become tragically familiar.",

          "text": "Self-determination is a fundamental right\u2026that cannot be subjugated \u2013 Justice Akintola\n\nAgitations for self-determination are not new. They started long ago as people who speak the same language and perhaps share the same faith and boundary resolve to come together as one. Their common affinity is the sole determinant of their struggle for a common entity. The struggle is usually long and tortuous wherever this set of people seeks to quit a nation state. In some cases, the state labels them as rebels and go all out to kill their struggle. At times, the agitators too pay with their lives. Is there anything wrong in agitations for self-determination? No, says Justice Ladiran Akintola of the Ibadan High Court, in his verdict on the case of Yoruba Nation agitator Chief Sunday Adeyemo popularly known as Sunday Igboho against the Federal Government.\n\nNigeria was virtually drowned in the wave of such agitations in the outgoing year. Groups and people rose in some parts of the country, demanding that they be allowed to go. The agitations were pronounced in the Southwest and Southeast. That of the Southeast, however, took a different bent. The arrowhead of the campaign, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, wanted secession. Having travelled that road between 1967 and 1970, the elders, who witnessed the three-year civil war during which a million people were killed, did not want the region to go that way again. Yet, Kanu, who is in custody facing treasonable felony trial, found support in the youths, who have been holding the region down, with a weekly sit-at-home order enforced every Monday.\n\nAre self-determination and secession the same thing? A thin line runs through them. Self-determination is a peaceful agitation to leave a country, while secession is forceful separation from an entity. People resort to secession where they are oppressed or the government is illegitimate. This is where Kanu and Igboho are different. Igboho hit the limelight with his exploits in Igangan, a community in Oyo State, in the heat of the herders and farmers skirmishes. He took sides with the farmers to chase out herders said to be wreaking havoc on the community. Igboho, who is battling for his release from custody in Cotonou, Benin Republic, ran into trouble with the government, which saw him as an existential threat.\n\nHis home in Soka, Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, was invaded by security operatives in the wee hours of July 1. Some of his properties, including vehicles, were destroyed. One of his cats was also taken away by the security agents who believed that it was Igboho who turned into a cat! Igboho fled the country, but he was arrested in Cotonou on his way to Germany. His arrest and detention over there did not stop him from challenging the legality of the invasion of his home. He also sought the determination of the propriety of the Yoruba\u2019s struggle for self-determination. He won on both counts. Justice Akintola declared the agitation for self-determination as legitimate.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to him, \u2018\u2019Chief Sunday Adeyemo and his group have a right to self-determination and are free to hold their rallies as long as they are peaceful. Self-determination is one of the fundamental human rights of the citizens that cannot be subjugated\u2019\u2019. His finding was premised on Igboho\u2019s request for:\n\nA declaration that he and his Yoruba indigenous people have unquestionable and/or inalienable fundamental right to peacefully campaign and seek self-determination of Yoruba tribe in Nigeria and lobby the legislature to amend the 1999 Constitution as guaranteed by Article 20 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Right (Ratification and Enforcement) Act, Laws of the Federation 2010, and Articles 3, 4, 7 & 18 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Indigenous People, thereby insulating campaign for self-determination from criminal culpability.\n\nA declaration that the respondents\u2019 resolve to prevent the applicant from propagating his belief in association with other like-minds in creating a Yoruba Nation and/or Oduduwa Republic for his Indigenous Yoruba People and hunting him with gun with a view to arresting him dead or alive when he has not called for war in achieving same is against his fundamental rights to freedom of thought, conscience and association since campaign for self-determination is recognised by law and international treaties of organisations to which Nigeria belongs.\n\nIt is a landmark decision on a vexed issue which has been threatening the fabric of society.",

          "title": "CONTROVERSY OF THE YEAR: THE WAR OVER VAT",
          "text": "One controversy that Nigerians will not forget in a hurry when reviewing 2021 is the Value Added Tax over which the Federal Government and State Governments literally fought over who should collect and how it should be shared among the tiers of government. The heated debate was not a straight one between the federal and sub-national governments, the Organised Private Sector, lawyers, Civil Society Organisations, the academia and many others joined in the spar. Yet, it is one controversy that has refused to go away as it is yet before the judiciary for adjudication.\n\nThe governor of Rivers State, Mr. Nyesom Wike, took the bull by the horn by approaching a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt to resolve who, under the law, has the right to collect and expend the Tax that is basically a consumption tax. He contended that consumption tax is a residual responsibility over which the federal government has no control and that the Federal Inland Revenue Service that has been performing the function is merely an interloper acting ultra vires.The Rivers State governor equally argued powerfully that the constitution that is the grundnorm in the country does not list the tax among those that the federal government whether exclusively or concurrently with states could collect and share.\n\nThe state was later joined by Lagos that generates the largest amount given its population, relative prosperity and strategic location. The states won at the High Court, but the battle still rages. The Federal Government has since decided to take the matter to the Court of Appeal, with Oyo State joining the fray.\n\nWhere would this lead? Is the federal government being greedy in seeking to have the FIRS take charge? This may not be exactly so. Under the existing formula by which proceeds of the Tax is shared, the federal government only retains 15 per cent, while the states share 50 per cent, and the local governments are allowed to use 35 per cent. But, the issue is deeper than the amount actually retained by the central government. At stake is control and proprietary right. Also, the states think the federal government is already controlling so much of the national wealth through its share of the Federation Account, mining of solid minerals aviation, railways and waterways, among so many others. The states believe that the national government has its knees on their necks and they are unable to breathe. It took a similar grim fight for the Lagos State government to win control over sales tax from the hotels. Until 2019 when the court awarded control to the state government, the federal government had controlled proceeds from the sector.\n\nThe major difference in the current dispute is that the states are not unanimous. States that generate very little in terms of Value Added Tax are in support of the Federal Government. Many of them have argued that the relatively richer states should be their \u201cbrothers\u2019 keepers\u201d. The inequity and injustice in distributing the proceeds is at the heart of the judicial contest. While, in the first eight months of this year, Lagos State raked in N429 billion, it received N139 billion. Rivers generated N90 billion, but was allocatedN47 billion, behind Kano that generated N24 billion and got allocated N47 billion. Oyo State was allocated N18 billion, despite bringing 64 billion into the coffers.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMore stupefying, perhaps, is the case of Zamfara that got an allocation of N59 billion despite generating less than one billion Naira. This has been described as grossly unfair and the basis for demanding that states should take full charge of the process. Contrary to the contention of some, it is not a geo-political contest. The South East States collectively generated about N22 billion, while Kano, as earlier indicated generates N24 billion.\n\nOver the years, the VAT that was first introduced under the Babangida administration has grown to become a major funding source for state governments. In the past four years, about N10 trillion was generated as VAT and shared. It has therefore been argued that withdrawing the feeding bottle could lead to asphyxiation of some states. The contest has become intractable, essentially because at the heart of it is inequity, injustice, opaqueness and suspicion of the federal government. There are tributaries of the central contention such as who controls import duties. In 2020, this accounted for 22.7 per cent of the VAT, while foreign non-import VAT amounted to 27.4 per cent. That is another battle ahead.\n\nAs the country looks forward to 2022, it is in the interest of the stakeholders to resolve the matter amicably to protect all. But, in all, unless equity and justice prevails, there will be no resolution.",

          "text": "Nigerians will not forget in a hurry, the scandals involving music diva, Tiwa Savage, and widely acclaimed \u2018super cop\u2019 DCP Abba Kyari. Both of them are celebrities in their own right but they were in the news for the wrong reasons. First was music diva, Tiwa Savage, whose sex tape set cyberspace agog. Social media pulsed with outrage as fans of the music artiste and her critics went to war soon before and after the release of a sex video featuring Savage.\n\nThe artiste hinted in an interview with American radio host, Angie Martinez, of Power 105.1 that she was being blackmailed with the sex tape and would rather release it than succumb to the designs of her blackmailer. The prior warning by the Afrobeats singer, predictably, set tongues wagging.\n\nAt the heel of her disclosure during the interview, the divorced mother of one revealed that the video features her and her current partner and that her blackmailer commenced his threats immediately after it was mistakenly uploaded online by her partner.\n\nSavage claimed that although the latter promptly deleted the video soon after he accidentally posted it on Snapchat, in error, it was too late.\n\nShe said, \u201cYesterday, I was leaving a radio station and I was in my car when my road manager sent me a message. She said I should check my phone. I checked it and there was a video, and I was just like \u2018Wow!\u2019,\u201d she told Martinez.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI asked him where he got it from and he said he received it about 20 minutes earlier. The video was sent to him and it is a tape of me and the person I am dating right now. The first thing I did after I got off the phone was that I sent it to my manager and asked what we should do.\n\n\u201cThe person is asking for money now. The person I am dating is going crazy too. My manager asked how much the person is asking for.\u201d\n\nBut the singer said she had decided not to pay the blackmailer because blackmailers usually come for more.\n\n\u201cI decided I was not going to pay the person because if I do, two months from now, three months down the line, or even two years later, you are going to come back again. Who knows, if I send the money, the person will probably release it. I am not going to let anyone blackmail me for doing something natural.\u201d\n\nThe singer further stressed that she will not give a dime to her blackmailers. Savage stated that she could release the video herself because she is \u2018that crazy\u2019.\n\nThe news caught the attention of her fans in Nigeria and across the world. When the video was later leaked online it sparked conversation both online and offline.\n\nJust before Savage\u2019s sex debacle, Nigerians stirred to the shocking news of popular supercop and head of the Nigerian Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), Abba Kyari\u2019s alleged complicity in fraudulent transactions involving suspected internet fraudster, Abbas Ramon, aka Hushpuppi.\n\nThe United States (US) crime fighter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in investigations made the declaration indicting Kyari in a $1.1m fraud case alongside five others, including United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based Abbas.\n\nThe FBI had reportedly filed a criminal complaint at the United States District Court in California listing Abbas Ramon, aka Hushpuppi; and Kyari among others indicted in the $1.1m international fraud conspiracy.\n\nOther suspects include AbdulRahman Juma (Abdul); Vincent Kelly Chibuzo (Kelly); Rukayat Motunrayo Fashola\n\n(Morayo); and Bolatito Tawakalitu Agbabiaka (Bolamide).\u201d\n\nUntil his indictment, Kyari was seen as a fearless crime fighter and outstanding officer presumably honest and committed to his work.\n\nHe was particularly notable for arresting the dreaded billionaire kidnap kingpin, Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike aka Evans, and ending the reign of terror of armed robbers and kidnappers in the southeast, among other numerous heroic exploits.\n\nAt his indictment, Kyari\u2019s critics emerged from the woodwork claiming that he had always been a suspicious cop whose association with questionable characters were red flags that ought to have been taken cognizance of.\n\nKyari, according to an FBI affidavit is \u201calleged to have arranged for Vincent, Abbas\u2019 rival in crime to be arrested and jailed at Abbas\u2019 behest, and then sent Abbas photographs of Vincent after his arrest.\n\n\u201cKyari also allegedly sent Abbas bank account details for an account into which Abbas could deposit payment for Vincent\u2019s arrest and imprisonment.\u201d\n\nBut in a swift rebuttal on Facebook, Abba Kyari denied the allegations claiming the only monetary transaction between him and Abbas was the N300,000 sent by the latter to him for onward payment to his cloth vendor. Kyari said he introduced the tailor to Abbas after the latter expressed the desire to buy some native attires he (Kyari) shared on his Facebook page.\n\nFurther allegations held that Kyari abandoned his official duty post in September 2019, and flew to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to frolic with the most wanted internet conman,s according to the FBI.",

          "title": "Electoral Bill: Lawmakers talk tough as Buhari withholds assent within deadline",
          "text": "From Fred Itua and Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nPlans by senators and the House of Representatives to override President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s veto on the Electoral Amendment Bill may have hit a dead end.\n\nThe development, Daily Sun gathered, is the seeming inability of lawmakers from the two chambers to reach a compromise on how to mobilise members should the president decides to withhold assent the Bill.\n\nHowever, Daily Sun gathered that some lawmakers across party divide would not let the rejection go without a fight. Consequently, they are said to be frantically mobilising and restrategising in spite of the difficulties.\n\nThe signing of the Electoral Amendment Bill by President Buhari, elapsed yesterday, having clocked the mandatory 30 days, within which the president must communicate to the National Assembly on his decision regarding any Bill passed by the parliament.\n\nSection 58 (4) of 1999 (as amended) stipulates that \u201cWhere a bill is presented to the President for assent, he shall within thirty days thereof signify that he assents or that he withholds assent.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, section 58 (5) provides thus \u201cWhere the President withholds his assent and the bill is again passed by each House by a two-thirds majority, the bill shall become law and the assent of the President shall not be required.\u201d\n\nThe bone of contention in the proposed amendment is the expulsion of indirect primaries from the existing Act by members of the two chambers of the National Assembly.\n\nIts removal was spearheaded by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila. The Senate, had in its earlier amendment retained indirect primaries.\n\nObservers believe that lawmakers made the sudden U-turn after they lost out in the recently-conducted primaries of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) across the 36 states of the Federation and the FCT.\n\nPolitical pundits, who spoke with Daily Sun, said the move by the National Assembly to make political parties powerless in the selection of candidates for any election is unconstitutional and will therefore not stand.\n\nWith the purported rejection of the Bill, members elected on the platform of APC and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), are strategising ahead of an unveiling of a letter of rejection sent to the two chambers by President Buhari.\n\nFormer chairman, House Committee on FCT, Sergius Ogun, who represents Esan North East/Esan South East federal constituency of Edo State, told Daily Sun, in a telephone interview, said lawmakers would wait for an official communication from President Buhari before deciding on the next course of action.\n\n\u201cWe will wait until we get a communication from him. The other thing would have been to override his veto but I don\u2019t think the National Assembly as it is constituted has the courage to do that. The leadership of the National Assembly as it is constituted might not have courage to veto the president.\u201d\n\nEfforts to reach the House spokesman, Benjamin Kalu, the House Leader, Alhassan Ado Doguwa and the Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu, were unsuccessful. While Kalu did not answer reported calls to his mobile phone, Doguwa and Elumelu\u2019s mobile line were unreachable.\n\nMeanwhile, a top government source has told Daily Sun that a notice of rejection of the Bill was sent to the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and Speaker Gbajabiamila in early December. He said the National Assembly, which is expected to embark on its annual Christmas break this week, may be unable to take any action until mid January, 2022 when it would reconvene. He further revealed that the National Assembly is already divided along regional lines on the issue of direct primaries and electronic transmission of results from polling units.\n\nThe source said many northern leaders were opposed to electronic transmission of results but indifferent to direct or indirect primaries.\n\nThe top government official said many northern lawmakers would side with Buhari if the National Assembly makes any move to override him.\n\nThe process of overriding the president is tedious. Since the beginning of the fourth republic in 1999, the National Assembly has only overruled the president\u2019s veto once, when it passed the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), following President Olusegun Obasanjo veto.\n\nFor each chamber to override the president, it needs two-third of members. For the Senate, it needs 74, out of 109 members seated and voting. For the House of Representatives, a similar requirement is needed. It needs at least 240 members present, out of 360 constitutionally recognised by law.\n\nAs soon as the process is kicked off, the rejected Bill would be recommited on the floor of the two chambers. After its first and second reading, it may likely go for a public hearing. During the third hearing on the floor, if 74 senators and 240 members of the House vote, it would become a law without the approval of the president.\n\nHowever, despite the growing pressure from the public and the political class, it is unclear if Lawan and Gbajabiamila would muscle the courage to call the bluff of the president and override him.",

In the meantime, security agencies have sustained patrols in the general area.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s attack in Giwa local government area of Kaduna State appears to be the bloodiest in recent times in the State.\n\nMeanwhile, a few hours after disclosing that about 20 people were killed, the State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Aruwan, confirmed, in a statement, that the casualty figure had risen to 38 at the time of filing this report last night.\n\nHe said: \u201cFollowing the report of attacks by bandits across villages in Idasu, Giwa LGA, contained in an earlier update, security agencies have confirmed to the Kaduna State Government that 38 people were killed across the locations attacked.\n\n\u201cTwenty-nine of the victims have been identified, with nine remaining unidentified as of the time of this update.",

Credible reports indicate that Turji was badly wounded by today\u2019s strike and if not dead. There were civilians that were also set free, after our military raids at the bandits\u2019 forest camps, There may likely be collateral damages in communities where bandits are harboured and protected because some community leaders are reluctant to provide useful information on the bandits in their areas.\u201d",

That Buhari is in charge of Nigeria at this time is not mere happenstance. His years in the military that saw him reaching the peak of his career; his various positions within and outside the military, his global exposure, his unmatched demeanour and, above all, his wisdom have all helped to stabilise Nigeria at the most difficult of times.\u201d\n\nReeling out the administration\u2019s achievements, Mohammed said the Buhari\u2019s administration had \u201cleapfrogged Nigeria to the modern rail era; set the nation on the path of unprecedented infrastructure development; built the Second Niger Bridge that his predecessors only built on paper; gave Nigeria its first modern airport terminals in decades; provided social safety net for the poor and introduced school feeding system that has helped push up school enrolment.\n\nOthers, according to the minister, include institutionalisation of measures to fight corruption through strict implementation of TSA and the introduction of the whistle blower policy, among others.\n\nHe said the administration had \u201crestored our country\u2019s respect and dignity in the comity of nations, as you can see in the recent quick reversals of flight bans by the UK and Canada and the quick decision by the UAE to reverse itself on the number of slots given to a Nigerian airline; upgraded military hardwares for our armed services and restored the respect of our gallant military. I believe God has a reason for keeping him alive when many had written him off as dead.\u201d",

Indeed, the law does not compel him to give reason for declining assent if he chooses to.\n\nSection 58(1) of the 1999 Constitution as amended provides that the power of the National Assembly to make laws shall be exercised by bills passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives and, except as otherwise provided, be assented to by the President. This is in furtherance of the principle of separation of powers, which ensures that every organ of government in democratic dispensation, is checkmated by the other arms.\n\nTherefore, where a bill has been passed by the House in which it originated, it shall be sent to the other House, and it shall be presented to the President for assent, when it has been passed by that other House and agreement has been reached between the two Houses on any amendment made on it.\n\nWhere, however, a bill is presented to the President for assent, the President shall within thirty (30) days thereof signify that he assents or that he withholds his assent. It is, however, the prerogative of the president to give reasons for his refusal to assent to a particular bill.\n\nHowever, the refusal of assent to a bill by the President might not be the end of the process for the passage of such bill. Where the President withholds his assent to a bill, which has been duly passed by the National Assembly, and the National Assembly considers it expedient that such bill should be passed into law, the Constitution empowers the National Assembly to veto the refusal of assent by the President.\n\nSection 58 (5) of the CFRN provides that where the President withholds his assent and the bill is again passed by each House by two/thirds majority, the bill shall become law and assent of the president shall not be required.[1]\n\nWhat this signifies is that upon the refusal of assent to a bill by the President, if the National Assembly considers that the bill is of such nature as to become law notwithstanding the refusal of assent by the President, each House of the National Assembly may pass the bill again by two/thirds majority and when that happens, the bill automatically becomes a law even without the assent or signature of the President.\n\nThe National Assembly once exercised this overriding power in the case of the Niger Delta Development Commission Bill. Both Chambers of the National Assembly had passed the bill into law upon the failure of the President to sign or give his assent within the time prescribed by the Constitution.\n\nPoignantly, the overriding power is vested with the National Assembly to consider the expedience of each of the bills to which the President has refused assent and to determine if it would take the passage of the bills a step further.\n\nFlowing from this, the interpretation is that President Buhari might have actually resolved to sign the bill, but still contending with the pressure from other equally weighty forces that were opposed to the bill hence his silence.\n\nThis is also because the president had hardly wasted time with any bill he was not going to sign into law, if recent past experience was anything to factor into account.\n\nFor example, some of the bill the president had declined assent included the Nigerian Film Commission Bill 2018, the Chartered Institute of Pension Practitioners of Nigeria Bill 2018, the Immigration Amendment Bill 2018, the Climate Change Bill 2018, the Digital Rights and Freedom Bill 2018, the Chartered Institute of Training and Development of Nigeria (Establishment) Bill 2018.\n\nOthers were the Nigerian Aeronautic Research Rescue Bill 2018, the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria Bill 2018, the National Housing Fund Bill 2018, the National Institute of Credit Administration Bill 2018, the National Bio-Technology Development Agency Bill 2018 as well as the Ajaokuta Iron and Steel Completion Fund Bill.\n\nIn withholding his assent, President Buhari gave such reasons infractions on extant laws, duplication of responsibilities of existing agencies, and financial constraints owing to prevailing economic circumstances.\n\nTherefore, on this particular bill, apart from the expiration of the one month deadline, which was known to all, there have not been reports or indications that the presidency had triggered any process of communication with the National Assembly to decline assent to the bill.\n\nSources within the presidency insisted that Buhari was still disposed to signing the bill and would sign it eventually, which is just a matter of choosing a date for the ceremony and also why he was not bothered about the deadline.\n\nBut he was still neck deep in managing the other tendencies that have maintained an unyielding opposition to a section of the bill, which approved direct primaries for political parties to determine their candidates for election.\n\n\u201cIt is a very simple process, the law only requires that he communicates to the National Assembly if he was not going to sign it and explain why. But if he has decided to sign it, there is no need for any communication or watch over any deadline; it is just a question of picking a date to sign and that is it. It is purely at his beck and call.\n\n\u201cHowever, I am convinced he is signing it, because if you know the president very well, he does not like to disappoint the international community and having given his words on leaving a legacy of credible electoral system, I believe he would sign it. Besides, there are no indications of any communication to the legislature and the 30 days have expired, so, let\u2019s take it that he would sign it,\u201d the source explained.\n\nInterestingly, had the president declined assent to the bill and communicated same to the legislature, it would have marked the second time in two years, that he has botched an attempt to reform the country\u2019s electoral system.\n\nBuhari had previously declined assent to an earlier version of the same bill passed by the Eighth National Assembly led by then Senate President Bukola Saraki of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), citing closeness to elections.\n\nBut the president did not adduce any reason for his latest refusal to approve reform of the country\u2019s electoral system, despite passage by the bicameral legislature under the leadership of his fellow All Progressives Congress (APC) member, Senate President Ahmed Lawan.\n\nAgain, by repeatedly voicing an intention to leave behind a legacy of credible electoral system, Buhari would have handed victory against the electoral reform to governors, particularly, those elected on the platform of APC; the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, and some prominent members of the ruling party, who never hid their disdain for a progressive electoral culture, if he had declined assent.\n\nThe National Assembly had, while forwarding the amended Electoral Act Bill to the president, urged him to sign it in the collective interest of the country, especially, in view of his promise to leave a legacy of free, fair and credible electoral system for the country.\n\nAmong the major amendments to the electoral act bill was the approval by the legislature of direct primaries by political parties in the election of candidates for elections. But this proposition did not sit well with some elements within the political class, especially, from the ruling party. They had since launched an offensive against direct primaries, urging the president not to sign the amended electoral act bill.\n\nIn the forefront here was Malami, who advised the president in writing to shelve the intention, if there was any, of signing the bill, because he found some contentious clauses. Two days to the expiration of the 30 days within which the president must communicate rejection of the bill, Malami, reportedly, wrote another letter, reaffirming why the president should not sign the bill. He claimed mandatory direct primaries would cause chaos.\n\nBut since Malami\u2019s first official advice to the president, many of the governors of the ruling party had equally mounted pressure on Buhari not to sign the bill, citing cost and the fact that the choice of the mode of primary should be a decision for the political parties and their leaderships to take.\n\nWhile the anti-direct primaries elements were mounting pressure on the president, those inclined to the idea, including President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, and Speaker, House of representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, had also met with the president repeatedly and came out with the assurances that Buhari would do the needful.\n\nCivil society groups, members of the diplomatic community, and ordinary Nigerians had also appealed to the president to sign the bill because it would strengthen participatory democracy and also hand power back to the people in the choice of their representatives at all levels of the electoral process.\n\nBuhari has yet to assent to the bill or give reasons why he has not, even though he recently said at a virtual summit on democracy put together by United States President Joe Biden that he would leave behind a credible electoral culture by 2023, when he is billed to leave office after two terms of eight years.\n\nIt appears the president intentionally chose to keep Nigerians in suspense. But some sources said he was concerned about the governors, who were against the amendment, and has been trying to strike a balance since the governors fund the party.\n\nAn inside source, who did not trust the president, told THISDAY that, \u201cCan\u2019t you see that the governors stopped talking about it for a while? They had reached an understanding with the president and they won. They boasted they would prevail and they just did. Whoever says the governors are not powerful is a joker. They are not only powerful, they always deploy their power to effective uses, especially, when a lot is at stake for them.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, what seemed to corroborate this happened two weeks ago, following reports that the president might have resolved to decline assent to the bill. But both Gbajabiamila and a presidential spokesperson, Garba Shehu, denied it and said they were not privy to such information.\n\nSo far, there has not been any official communication on the bill generally considered crucial to the success or otherwise of the next general election.\n\nMeanwhile, the Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), yesterday, expressed shock and disappointment at the failure of the president to assent to the electoral act amendment, describing him as the biggest threat to Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nThe CSOs called on the National Assembly to override the president\u2019s veto. They spoke in a joint statement signed by Executive Director, Adopt A Goal Initiative, Ariyo-Dare Atoye, and endorsed by Convener, Raising New Voices Initiative, Jude Feranmi; Programme Officer, Centre for Liberty, Maryam Ahmed; Convener, Speak Out Africa Initiative, Kenneth Eze; Executive Director, The Nigerian Alliance, Simi Olusola; and Executive Director, Youth and Students Advocates for Development Initiative (YSAD), Obinna Eze Nwagbara.\n\nThe CSOs accused Buhari of trying to destroy the country\u2019s democracy.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cIt has come to the point where we must tell President Buhari in unmistaken terms that his failure to sign the bill within the 30 days window has exposed him as the biggest threat to the Fourth democratic republic, having failed to perform a similar responsibility four times in his first term.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari benefitted significantly from some of the electoral reforms initiated by Yar\u2019Adua and signed by Jonathan; if he fails to sign the amended electoral act, history will record him as a major impediment to electoral credibility and governance. This is a low hanging lifetime opportunity for the president to salvage his terrible electoral credential.\u201d\n\nThe civil society groups vowed to storm the National Assembly today in protest, to press for the overriding of the president in the interest of Nigerians.\n\nThe statement also said, \u201cThere is a constitutional window opened to the National Assembly to recall the bill and give it the effect of law with a two-thirds number. From Monday morning, we will turn to the National Assembly to act in the national interest and pass the bill expeditiously before they embark on the Christmas recess.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the next step is for us as CSOs to take our advocacy to the National Assembly to step in, exhibit courage, recall the bill, and ensure they override the president with an accelerated passage before Christmas.\n\n\u201cThe Ninth National Assembly has deferred too much to President Buhari almost to the point of ridicule, so, if the president does not respect and reciprocate this gesture, history will be kind to them if they override the president and salvage their own political future.\n\n\u201cThis will not be the first time in the last 20 years that the National Assembly will override the president; the Fourth legislative session did so and got the NDDC Act passed and operational. The Ninth National Assembly has the opportunity of not sharing with the executive, the glory that will accompany the new act.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Deji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, said the last vestiges of terrorists were the ones soft-targeting innocent citizens, looting their assets and burning houses, because they were already frustrated as a result of the heat turned on them by the nation\u2019s troop.\n\nThe president, who just got back from a three-day visit to Turkey, returned to the news of some 38 persons, reportedly killed in some communities in Kaduna State by bandits and stressed that killing of innocent citizens were no more acceptable.\n\nAlso, the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs in Kaduna State, Samuel Aruwan, who disclosed the latest killings in a statement, confirmed that no fewer than 38 people were killed in Giwa Local Government Area of the state.\n\nHowever, in a counter effort, operatives of the Nigeria Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), working with the Taraba State Police Command, said they arrested eleven notorious kidnap suspects in Taraba over alleged complicity and various criminal roles in the recent spate of kidnap incidents, including the killing of a police sergeant in Jalingo, the state capital.\n\nA statement by Force Headquarters, which also claimed that the suspects were responsible for the kidnapping of a serving personnel of the Nigeria Customs Service and a relative of the Emir of Jalingo, stated that the police recovered seven AK47 rifles, two baretta pistols, 121 rounds of live ammunition of different calibre, four magazines, masks, illicit drugs and other incriminating items during raids of various hideouts of the suspects in the state.\n\nBuhari, while condemning the renewed killings in Kaduna State, said the gruesome nature of recent incidents in Kauran Fawa, Marke and Ruhiya of Idasu Ward of Giwa Local Government Area, has made him particularly sad and the killings unacceptable.\n\nIn a release by the president\u2019s spokesman, Garba Shehu, Buhari expressed the nation\u2019s condolences to the Government of Kaduna State, the people of Zonkwa Chiefdom and the family of His Highness Nuhu Bature, the Agwam Kajju on his demise.\n\nIn praying for the repose of the souls of the deceased, the president reiterated that the nation\u2019s security forces had \u201cturned the heat on the terrorists, who are getting frustrated and are soft-targeting innocent citizens, looting their assets, burning their homes and killing them indiscriminately.\u201d\n\nBuhari further reiterated his directive to the security and intelligence chiefs to do everything they could to destroy the remaining vestiges of the terrorists.\n\nAruwan, while speaking on the Kaduna killing, said the incident was reported to the state government by the military and police authorities, adding that, \u201csecurity agencies have confirmed to the Kaduna State Government that 38 people were killed across the locations attacked.\u201d\n\nHis statement identified some of the affected villages to include Kauran Fawa, Marke and Riheya villages in Idasu district, adding that houses, trucks, and cars were also burnt, along with food and farm produce.\n\nAruwan said Governor Nasir El-Rufai of the state received the news with sadness and had sent condolences to the families of the victims of the brutal attacks while praying for the repose of their souls.\n\n\u201cThe governor also commiserated with the affected communities and directed the Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency to conduct an urgent assessment of the area towards providing relief,\u201d he said.\n\nBut, \u201cin the meantime\u201d he said, security agencies had sustained patrols in the general area.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner said 29 of the victims had been identified, with nine yet to be identified atthe time of the security update.\n\nAccording to him, the 29 identified victims included Rabi`u Wada, Salisu Boka, Nura Nuhu, Bashari Sabiu, Lawal Dahiru, Abbas Saidu, Inusa Kano, Lawal Nagargari, Malam Aminu, Lawal Maigyad and Mustapha Lawal Aliyu.\n\nOthers victims, according to Aruwan, include, Sale Makeri, Sani Lawal, Auwal Umar,Jamilu Hassan, Badamasi Mukhtar, Malam Jibril, Lawal Tsawa, Sule Hamisu, Sadi Bala, Kabiru Gesha, Abubakar Sanusi, Saiph Abdu, Haruna Musa, Lawal Hudu, Shuaibu Habibu, Yahaya Habibu and Abubakar Yusuf.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Taraba situation, a statement by Force Public Relations Officer, Mr Frank Mba, a Commissioner of Police, said the arrest of the suspects followed the deployment of operatives of the Intelligence Response Team by the Inspector General of Police, Mr Usman Alkali Baba, to the state to complement efforts of the sState command in promptly containing the disturbing trend of kidnapping, armed robbery, and other violent crimes in the state.\n\nThe suspects, Luka Adam, Shuaibu Nuhu, Moses Amos, Peters Mashi, Ahmadu Mallam, Adamu Mohammed, Dahiru Mallam Dalha, Gambo Isah, Sanusi Ahmadu, Mallam Mohammed Mauludu, Ibrahim Idi, all indigenes of Taraba State, were arrested by the police team from their various criminal hideouts.\n\nPolice investigations revealed that the suspects, who were on the wanted list of the command, were members of a notorious kidnap syndicate and had been evidentially linked to the recent upsurge in incidents of kidnapping in the state, including deliberate and calculated attacks on security personnel.\n\nInvestigations also revealed how two of the suspects, Gambo Isah and Sanusi Ahmadu, masterminded the killing of the police sergeant and left a police inspector with gunshot injuries in their recent operation to enable them escape arrest, having abducted some victims in Jalingo recently.\n\nFurther investigations revealed that the modus operandi of the suspects included trailing individuals notably, business owners, government functionaries, motorists with flashy and exotic cars, among others, to their houses and thereafter planned and executed the kidnap of such persons.\n\n\u201cThey also collect huge sums of money as ransom from relatives and friends of their victims before their release,\u201d it said.\n\nThe police, in the course of investigations, identified and raided various criminal hideouts,where kidnap victims were usually kept. The police stated that while a cache of weapons and other incriminating items were recovered from their hideouts, all the kidnap victims held hostage at the various hideouts were carefully and successfully rescued unhurt and reunited with their families.\n\nTo that extent, investigators had intensified efforts at arresting other suspects currently at large.\n\nThe IG, while commending the people of Taraba for supporting the police especially, in providing useful information that aided the prompt apprehension of the suspects, assured that the police would continue to work with all stakeholders in deepening the collective safety of the Taraba people.\n\nThe IG condoled the family of the late Sergeant Ogidi Habu and maintained that the force would sustain efforts at improving public safety in all Nigerian communities, adding all the suspects would be charged to court on completion of investigations.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Imperial College London: Omicron Largely Evades Immunity from Past Infection or Two Vaccine Doses",
          "text": "*Fauci harps on booster jabs\n\nPeter Uzoho with agency report\n\nThe Omicron variant largely evades immunity from past infection or two vaccine doses, according to the latest Imperial modelling.\n\nThe new report (Report 49), from the Imperial College London COVID-19 response team estimated that the risk of reinfection with the Omicron variant was 5.4 times greater than that of the Delta variant.\n\nBut amid concerns about the rapidly spreading omicron variant, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States and White House Chief Medical Adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci has described the booster jabs as the tool to fight the spread of omicron.\n\n\u201cOur booster vaccine regiments work against omicron,\u201d US-based ABC News quoted him to have said.\n\n\u201cAt this point, there is no need for a variant-specific booster,\u201d he added. While a specific booster was not needed, booster shots, in general, have been shown to greatly restore antibody levels in the fight against omicron, he added.\n\nThe Imperial College report implied that the protection against reinfection by Omicron afforded by past infection may be as low as 19 per cent.\n\nResearchers estimated the growth and immune escape of the Omicron variant in England. They used data from the UKHSA and NHS for all PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in England who had taken a COVID test between November 29th and December 11th 2021.\n\nThis level of immune evasion meant that Omicron poses a major, imminent threat to public health.\n\nAccording to the report obtained from the Imperial College website, the study included people identified as having Omicron infection due to an S gene target failure (SGTF), as well as people with genotype data that confirmed Omicron infection.\n\nIt revealed that overall, 196,463 people without S gene target failure (likely to be infected with another variant) and 11,329 cases with it (likely to be infected with Omicron) were included in the SGTF analysis, as well as 122,063 Delta and 1,846 Omicron cases in the genotype analysis.\n\nFirstly, it stated that the report looked at factors associated with testing positive for Omicron compared to non-Omicron (mostly Delta) cases.\n\n\u201cThe results suggest that the proportion of Omicron among all COVID cases was doubling every 2 days up to December 11th, estimated from both S-gene Target Failure and genotype data. Based on these results they estimate that the reproduction number (R) of Omicron was above 3 over the period studied.\n\n\u201cThe distribution of Omicron by age, region and ethnicity currently differs markedly from Delta, with 18\u201329-year-olds, residents in the London region, and those of African ethnicity having significantly higher rates of infection with Omicron relative to Delta. London is substantially ahead of other English regions in Omicron frequency.\n\n\u201cOmicron transmission is not yet uniformly distributed across the population. However, the researchers note that given its immune evasion, the age distribution of Omicron infection in the coming weeks may continue to differ from that of Delta,\u201d it added.\n\nBut, the study found no evidence of Omicron having lower severity than Delta, judged by either the proportion of people testing positive who reported symptoms, or by the proportion of cases seeking hospital care after infection. However, hospitalisation data remained very limited at the time, it added.\n\n\u201cTo assess the impact of Omicron on reinfection rates the researchers used genotype data, since even prior to Omicron, reinfection was correlated with negative S gene Target Failure data, likely due to random PCR target failure caused by the lower viral loads associated with reinfections.\n\n\u201cControlling for vaccine status, age, sex, ethnicity, asymptomatic status, region and specimen date, Omicron was associated with a 5.40 (95% CI: 4.38-6.63) fold higher risk of reinfection compared with Delta. To put this into context, in the pre-Omicron era, the UK \u201cSIREN\u201d study of COVID infection in healthcare workers estimated that prior infection afforded 85 per cent protection against a second COVID infection over 6 months. The reinfection risk estimated in the current study suggests this protection has fallen to 19% (95%CI: 0-27%) against an Omicron infection,\u201d it added.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers found a significantly increased risk of developing a symptomatic Omicron case compared to Delta for those who were two or more weeks past their second vaccine dose, and two or more weeks past their booster dose (for AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines).\n\nDepending on the estimates used for vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection from the Delta variant, this translated into vaccine effectiveness estimates against symptomatic Omicron infection of between zero per cent and 20 per cent after two doses, and between 55 per cent and 80 per cent after a booster dose. Similar estimates were obtained using genotype data, albeit with greater uncertainty.\n\nCommenting on the study, Prof. Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London said: \u201cThis study provides further evidence of the very substantial extent to which Omicron can evade prior immunity given by both infection or vaccination. This level of immune evasion means that Omicron poses a major, imminent threat to public health.\u201d\n\nAlso, Prof Azra Ghani from Imperial College London said: \u201cQuantifying reinfection risk and vaccine effectiveness against Omicron is essential for modelling the likely future trajectory of the Omicron wave and the potential impact of vaccination and other public health interventions.\u201d\n\nThe work, which was not yet peer-reviewed, was presented in the latest report from the World Health Organisation (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Modelling within the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Jameel Institute, Imperial College London.\n\nSince the emergence of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) in December 2019, the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team adopted a policy of immediately sharing research findings on the developing pandemic.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The aircraft touched down at the Ataturk International Airport in Istanbul at exactly 5:14 pm (Turkish time).\n\nThe presidential jet had developed a fault while the President and his entourage were returning to Abuja from the UN General Assembly in the US on Saturday, September 25.\n\nThe aircraft was subsequently moved to Euro Airport in Germany on September 29 and arrived at 4.15 pm after leaving the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport at 9.48 am, with the Nigerian government paying \u20ac5,000 (Euros) per night as parking fee. See Also News Nigerian Government Confirms SaharaReporters' Stories, Says Presidential Jet Under Repairs In Germany Flown Back To Nigeria\n\nTo avoid any backlash, SaharaReporters gathered that the registration of the 5N-FGT aircraft was done using AMACGND.\n\nOn Sunday, President Buhari returned to Nigeria from Turkey using the aircraft.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari is back in Abuja after attending the three-day Turkey-Africa Partnership Summit in Istanbul.\n\n\u201cThe official BBJ aircraft which he hadn\u2019t used for several months as it underwent repairs and improvements landed at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport at exactly 2:35,\u201d Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, on Sunday posted on Facebook.\n\nWhile the Gulfstream Aerospace GV-SP (G550) marked 5N-FGW returned to Nigeria on December 17, the Falcon 7X jet with registration number 5N-FGV got back to the country on Sunday, December 19 after a stopover in London.\n\nDespite promising to cut waste, the Buhari-led government has spent at least N41 billion on the presidential fleet.\n\nAfter taking office on May 29, 2015, the 2016 Appropriation Act signed by the President allocated N3.652 billion for the upkeep of the presidential fleet.\n\nIn 2017, the cost of maintenance of the presidential aircraft rose to N4.37 billion (19.6 per cent). The figure then skyrocketed to N7.260 billion (98.7 per cent) in 2018.\n\nIn 2019, the cost of maintaining the PAF again rose to N7.297 billion (99.6 per cent). The allocation, however, fell to N6.793 billion (86 per cent) in 2020. But in 2021, the budget for the presidential fleet saw its sharpest Buhari-era jump to N12.550 billion (243.6 per cent).\n\nBy comparison, the 2015 budget, which was in effect upon Buhari\u2019s inauguration, earmarked N5.190 billion for the presidential fleet. The appropriation for the Presidential Air Fleet in 2021 indicates a 243.6 per cent increase from the allocation six years prior.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian government is broke and has been relying on borrowing to run its affairs.\n\nFor instance, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Mr Chris Ngige, had in September 2021 confirmed that the Nigerian government under President Muhammadu Buhari borrowed funds from international sources to pay salaries of workers because of a shortfall in the country\u2019s revenue.\n\nNgige had said the government took borrowed funds from foreign institutions like the World Bank to offset some recurrent expenditures.\n\nAlso, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, had in April 2021 admitted that Nigeria\u2019s economy was facing a difficult time, saying borrowing was inevitable.\n\nShe had said, \u201cWe have very low revenues, we have very high expenditures. What we have done so far is just to provide some stability to make sure salaries are paid, pensions are received every month; that we send funds to the judiciary and the legislature; that we meet our debt service obligations.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we are doing. It also means we have had to borrow more than we had planned before the COVID-19 started because we need to still continue to invest in infrastructure using our national budget. We borrowed to invest in key projects such as roads, rail, airports, seaports and several other investments that are required in health and in education and upgrading the social standards and quality of life of our people and Nigeria is not unique as several countries of the world went into recession.\n\n\u201cAlmost every other country has had to borrow more than it planned. It means we expanded our deficit very fast in 2020. 2021 is a year that we see as the year of recovery.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, FAAC reduces and whenever FAAC reduces, it is a very difficult situation and in the past one year, we have tried to fall back on some specific accounts that are meant to be saved; savings that when you have such a situation, you fall back on the resources and augment.\n\n\u201cSo, we take funds based on Mr President\u2019s approval either from Excess Crude or Stabilisation Account or in some cases, President approved for us to take funds from LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) dividends. In the month of March, we had a shortfall of FAAC that was about N50 billion; we didn\u2019t have enough accrued in any of those accounts other than some N8.5 billion that we took from the exchange rate differential account so we added that and we ended up with the FAAC of N605 billion.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s dwindling finances had also come under intense pressure as the Muhammadu Buhari-led government as it had been amassing foreign loans.\n\nThe country\u2019s debt profile according to the Debt Management Office was N33.10trillion as of the end of the first quarter of 2021.\n\nThis represents an increase of N191bn compared to the N32.91 trillion recorded in December 2020.\n\nThe DMO in a statement had said the debt figures include the debt stock of the federal and state governments, as well as the Federal Capital Territory.",

          "text": "Nigerian sports have it all: awe-striking talents, intriguing performances and nauseating controversies. The year 2021 had it all \u2014 and more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigeria sports can be likened to a pendulum that swings between two extremes too often that it\u2019s almost shocking there are achievements at all from the athletes.\n\nWhile athletes are stretching their muscles to abnormal lengths to bring the country glory on the world stage, administrators engage in leadership tussles for ego and power, consequently derailing the achievement of these young patriots.\n\nThis year has not been any different, and here are nine major controversies of 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEdo\u2019s threat to shut down the National Sports Festival\n\nBarely two days into the 20th National Sports Festival (NSF) in Edo, the state government dropped a shocking memo.\n\nThe local organising committee (LOC) threatened a shutdown of the festival due to the federal government\u2019s refusal to provide the state with funds.\n\nPhillip Shuaibu, Edo deputy governor, ordered the closure of offices belonging to the LOC and main organising committee (MOC) to signal that the threat was not empty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe threat was not lifted until the federal government intervened. TheCable reported that before the event was allowed to continue, President Muhammadu Buhari pledged to make available the sum of N500 million to the Edo state government.\n\nThe sporting showpiece held till the end, and Delta emerged the winner for the sixth consecutive time.\n\nD\u2019Tigers jersey seizure by Nigerian customs\n\nThe drama began with the Olympics a few weeks away. TheCable reported that D\u2019Tigers kits for the Games were being held by the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS).\n\nThe seized merchandise was shipped into the country by Peak, the teams\u2019 kits sponsor with whom the Nigerian Basketball Federation (NBBF) has a four-year contract, but NCS withheld it at the Apapa seaport in Lagos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA board member of the NBBF revealed to TheCable that the failure to get the kits out of the port was due to \u201ca lack of documentation and miscommunication between the ministry of finance and the ministry of sports.\u201d\n\nHe added that the sports ministry had failed to communicate the federation\u2019s need for a \u201cwaiver\u201d to its sister ministry, hence the logistical logjam.\n\nThe kits were not released until July 16 \u2014 a few days till D\u2019Tigers were billed to play their first game in Tokyo.\n\nAFN leadership tussle\n\nOn June 14, the protracted leadership tussle within the Athletic Federation of Nigeria (AFN) reached a tipping point as two presidents were elected to oversee the federation\u2019s activities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTony Okowa was elected AFN president at the 2021 elective congress held at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja.\n\nIn a parallel election held in Kebbi state, Ibrahim Shehu-Gusau was also elected as the federation\u2019s president.\n\nThe tussle and its ripple effects contributed to the abysmal outing that the country suffered at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nWorld Athletics has since confirmed that it only recognises the Okowa-led board and has established communication with the administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisqualification of Nigerian athletes at the Olympics\n\nOn July 28, barely a few days into the Olympics, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) disqualified 10 Nigerian track and field athletes for failing to comply with the out-of-competition testing (OCT) requirement.\n\nAIU said Nigeria is among countries deemed to have the highest doping risk, and the athletes were expected to undergo \u201cat least three no-notice out-of-competition tests (urine and blood) conducted no less than three weeks apart in the 10 months leading up to a major event\u201d.\n\nThe 10 disqualified athletes fell short of the required number of tests and were thereby disqualified.\n\nThe affected athletes \u2014 Knowledge Omovoh, Ruth Usoro, Favor Ofili, Rosemary Chukwuma, Glory Patrick, Yinka Ajayi, Tima Godbless, Chidi Okezie, Chioma Onyekwere and Annette Echikunwoke \u2014 later took to the streets of Tokyo to protest the disqualification caused by the incompetence of Nigerian authorities.\n\nSamsung saga\n\nThere was further drama at the Tokyo Olympics when officials of the Nigeria Olympics Committee (NOC) refused to give the disqualified athletes the Samsung phones due to them. The Samsung S20+ 5G was a souvenir for all athletes that took part in the Olympics.\n\nOfficials of the NOC were said to have collected the phones for Team Nigeria but refused to distribute them to some of the athletes.\n\nThe phones were later given to the affected athletes after the alarm was raised and an outcry ensued.\n\nExplaining the situation, Femi Adetula, NOC spokesman, said the body was only following the terms and conditions for the phones as stipulated by International Olympics Committee (IOC).\n\nHe said the athletes were later given the phones because IOC permitted them waivers.\n\n\u201cThe International Olympic Committee has finally granted the request of Team Nigeria for her 10 athletes who were declared ineligible to partake in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics to receive Samsung Galaxy S21 5G given to all athletes who qualified and are resident at the Olympic Village,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018PumaGate\u2019\n\nOn the eve of the final shot put event at the Tokyo Olympics, Chukwuebuka Enekwechi posted a video on Instagram.\n\nIn the short footage that would later go viral, he was seen washing his jersey ahead of the shot put final that was just a few hours away. \u201cWhen you qualify for Olympic Finals, but you have only one jersey,\u201d he captioned the post.\n\nThe development exposed the detrimental effect of the prolonged power tussle between a factional board of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) and the sports ministry.\n\nIn 2019, the AFN board under Ibrahim Gusau signed a four-year kits sponsorship contract with Puma.\n\nA section of the deal stated that Puma would supply Nigeria\u2019s athletics team kits for four years.\n\nThe contract also included monetary rewards for Nigerian athletes who wear the sportswear during medal presentations at the Olympic games \u2014 with gold medalists earning $15,000, silver medalists getting 5,000, while a bronze medal will attract $3,000.\n\nHowever, the contract resulted in a legal battle between the sports ministry and the factional board of AFN.\n\nIn addition, Gusau, alongside Sunday Adeleye, technical director of the body, was dragged to court by the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) for the alleged diversion of over $75,000.\n\nConsequently, the ministry failed to allow Nigerian athletes to wear the Puma-branded apparel at Tokyo Olympics, arguing that it\u2019s \u201ca subject of a criminal investigation\u201d.\n\nThe developments culminated in Puma prematurely terminating the deal with the federation for alleged breach of contract.\n\nBash Ali versus Sunday Dare\n\nIn October, Bash Ali, former world cruiserweight champion, released a video wherein he accused Sunday Dare, minister of youths and sports development, of extorting \u201cmillions of naira\u201d from him as part of the process to organise a world boxing title fight for him.\n\nThe 63-year-old boxer said he had proposed a Guinness World Record boxing fight to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAccording to him, the president inaugurated a committee on October 15, 2019, adding that the minister was saddled with the responsibility of hosting the fight.\n\nThe accusations didn\u2019t stop until a high court in Abuja slammed an order restraining Bash Ali from making defamatory publications against the minister.\n\nD\u2019Tigress protest unpaid allowances\n\nJust days after D\u2019Tigress won their third consecutive Afrobasket championship, some members of the team released a video expressing their discontent over unpaid allowances and bonuses.\n\nIn the viral video, they threatened to boycott call-ups to represent Nigeria for the 2022 World Cup qualification series if their demands were not met.\n\nThere were also claims that the players\u2019 money had been diverted to the personal accounts of some top members of the ministry of sports. The ministry immediately denied the allegation and said the money was intact in NBBF\u2019s account domiciled with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThe ministry said the delay in disbursing the funds was because some members of the team were yet to provide their account numbers \u201cso that the processing of payments can be one-off as requested by the CBN\u201d.\n\nThe D\u2019Tigress have since been paid their outstanding allowances and are expected to represent Nigeria at the 2022 World Cup qualification.\n\nSuper Eagles unpaid allowances\n\nIn the buildup to the double-headed friendly encounter against Cameroon in June, several players from Gernot Rohr\u2019s 24-man list asked to be excused from the game, citing injuries.\n\nThe spate of withdrawals resulted in allegations that some players deliberately declined the call ups due to a backlog of unpaid allowances from previous games \u2014 and not because they are injured.\n\nAmaju Pinnick, president of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), subsequently confirmed that the Super Eagles were being owed allowances.\n\nHe added that COVID-19 was the biggest reason the federation was short of funding as its sponsors were still reeling from the economic impact of the pandemic.",

          "title": "Inside TeamApt: How an upstart overturned competition to dominate agency banking",
          "text": "Six years after TeamApt, a little-known banking software development company, had launched, it stirred excitement after Bloomberg reported the startup\u2019s move to raise $150 million at a billion-dollar valuation\u2014which would elevate it to the coveted unicorn status. TeamApt\u2019s co-founders had bootstrapped the company from a four-man team in their flat in 1004 Estate to building products, MoneyTor and AptPay, which serviced virtually all the commercial banks in Nigeria. TeamApt followed the growth with a $5.5 million Series A round by 2019.\n\nHowever, it was Moniepoint, the product it launched next, that skyrocketed the company to near-unicorn status.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Nigeria had 4.3 bank branches per 100,000 people in 2018, thereby leaving many of its 200 million population either unserved or underserved. Moniepoint provides payment, withdrawal, and deposit services to these underbanked users through an army of agents mostly in mom-and-pop stores across the country. In 2019, when OPay announced a total of $170 million in fundraising from two rounds and marched thousands of point-of-sale (POS) terminal-wielding footmen across the country to convert agents and successfully grow agency banking in the country, Moniepoint launched that September after a beta-testing phase, with about 1,000 agents.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have money then, so we were taking terminals from banks and manually sending them to agents, individually, in other parts of the country. That was so base and hectic,\u201d says Tolu Adetuyi, Moniepoint Head of Growth.\n\nAfter the $5.5 million raise, TeamApt had cash in the bank to place orders for terminals in China and invaded the Nigerian market. Now it processes over $4 billion monthly, servicing 18 million unique customers, and has over 120,000 active merchants in almost all of Nigeria\u2019s 774 local government areas (LGAs)\u2014only the terror-prone LGAs in the country\u2019s northern regions are left out. A regulator report seen by TechCabal back in June capturing transaction volumes by super agents showed TeamApt recorded an agent transaction volume of roughly 50 million, which accounted for 75% of total agent volumes collated for the month reported. Although, an industry analyst under anonymity told TechCabal that he doubts OPay\u2019s numbers were captured in the report.\n\nSo how did TeamApt become this super agent?\n\n\u201cBack then, our fee was only 1% of each transaction, which was high, but that was what we could afford, but we obsessed about our agents and offered them unmatched user experience,\u201d Adetuyi explained.\n\nTolu Adetuyi, as growth lead, along with 40 other support staff, oversee a massive network of agents engaged through Whatsapp groups dedicated to each LGA in Nigeria and a few other separate high-level Whatsapp groups of LGA agent leaders also called cluster managers, state managers, and regional managers. These performing agents-turned-managers are responsible for increasing and engaging the agents in their communities in order to increase their commission.\n\n\u201cMy phone is always buzzing, and I\u2019m attending town hall meetings. That\u2019s like, the whole of my work. I know what\u2019s happening on the streets right from my room,\u201d Adetuyi tells me excitedly via a Google Meet call.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s strong feedback loop facilitates rich market intelligence which enabled the company successively introduce groundbreaking features to the market which some competitors adopted and eventually became industry standards.\n\nMrs Ogunleye, an agent in the Alimosho local government area of Lagos, runs a grocery store and owns three POS terminals. \u201cI started using Moniepoint because of their daily commission settlement while others were paying monthly,\u201d she tells TechCabal.\n\nSources at TeamApt credit Moniepoint\u2019s early success and breakthrough growth to this payment feature. \u201cMany of these agents are like petty traders who need their daily earnings for restocking and running their households. I study my agents. I literally have documents on agent motivation,\u201d Adetuyi shares.\n\nMoniePoint also provides agents with live analytics dashboards to see a detailed breakdown of their performance and earnings. This transparency enables agent trust in the commission given and drives them to improve their performance as opposed to opaque estimated monthly earnings.\n\nTeamApt deploys an interesting active POS terminal performance management system for its merchants. For example, for every 10 terminals given, a certain number must be doing transaction values exceeding a fixed amount. The figure is determined by the area and market trend. This drives cluster managers to identify and recruit the best agents and engage them daily to improve their performance.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really want merchants who use our terminals only when they need to make quick money. We want active agents who use them daily. We try to prevent what they call bozo explosion, where we bring in lots of agents but are not able to service the 20% that\u2019s going to give you most of your revenue, then you end up losing them,\u201d Solomon Amadi, Vice President at TeamApt, tells TechCabal.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s agent network is a vibrant talent ecosystem that allows enterprising agents to grow through the rank. Merchant agents can become cluster managers at LG level, grow into state managers, and finally regional heads, while increasing their earnings along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a talent war. Competitors are calling and trying to poach our star agents, so much so that we know the name of some of the employees calling them because our agents tell us. That\u2019s why we sign exclusive contracts with some of these agents,\u201d Amadi disclosed.\n\nThe talent grab, though, goes both ways. TeamApt also tries to convert performing agents on other platforms.\n\nTo improve the reliability of its product, TeamApt introduced to the market a 24-hour resolution service for false debit card withdrawals. Usually, it takes 8 days after physically visiting a bank branch to resolve an unsuccessful card withdrawal where the customer\u2019s account got debited. But TeamApt funds customers from its account once it can verify the transaction and later sorts out the reconciliation at the back end with the bank.\n\n\u201cThe solutions we introduced to the market seem commonplace but many of them weren\u2019t being done till we did. In Nigeria, we just like to copy and paste models without thinking to adapt them to our peculiarities. But, first principles thinking has really helped us in how we approach problems and come up with the solutions we have introduced,\u201d Adetuyi concludes.\n\n\u201cFirst principles thinking\u201d is a phrase I heard often while interviewing management executives at TeamApt. It\u2019s a problem-solving thought process of attacking problems by first identifying the fundamental issues. It was first taught by Aristotle and currently made popular by South African-born physics engineering genius, Elon Musk. Tosin Eniolorunda, founder and CEO of TeamApt, champions the thought process and is instilling it into the company culture.\n\n\u201cWhen we hit a roadblock while thinking up a solution, Felix (TeamApt CTO) would often say, okay, let\u2019s go back, let\u2019s go back,\u201d Eniolorunda tells me as he rolls his wrist backwards. He shares that his exposure to first principles philosophy came in stages. The first time was in his 100 level at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) as a mechanical engineering student.\n\n\u201cI got into OAU on merit, first try. So, I was feeling fly with myself. But I now failed in my first year. My CGPA was 3.3,\u201d he shares in-between laughs. \u201cThat was a major learning experience for me. I learnt the power of focus. Secondly, it sparked a new way of thinking because adversity changes us. I questioned myself on why I want excellence and I began to think of how to get there.\u201d\n\nTosin, the first born of a building contractor father and primary teacher mother, worked and paid his way through tertiary school and graduated with a second class upper in mechanical engineering. He had always wanted to be an entrepreneur and build \u201csomething massive\u201d. With TeamApt seemingly to be crowned with unicorn status, the company now has its eyes on digital banking but with a slant. \u201cThere\u2019s a me too movement in tech. Everyone is launching digital banking with different offerings. But the fundamental question is, what do customers really need? Zero cost transaction accounts? That\u2019s good, but I think credit is one of the key needs. So, we will be launching a hybrid credit-led banking solution that also caters to the offline market,\u201d Eniolorunda concludes.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Want luxury fashion? Play Africa\u2019s first metaverse crypto game",
          "text": "The digital age has seen people try to imitate reality online. A result of this trend is that people are buying the online versions of what they would normally buy in real life: luxury houses, dresses, and even land. For example, this year saw the purchase of the world\u2019s first digital home, sold for over $500,000 on the NFT market. Instead of physical artworks, people now buy Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), digital assets whose ownerships are recorded on the blockchain.\n\nDigital fashion allows designers to model their designs in pixels instead of silk, cotton, lace, or polyester. Digital fashion can be in the form of digital fashion conceived to produce physical garments or fashion that a person can wear only with augmented or virtual reality. Or it can be fashion that is sold directly to an avatar.\n\nPowered by blockchain and NFTs, the digital fashion world is steadily growing. This growth is marked by the emergence of fashion houses like The Fabricant, which creates digital-only fashion; and RTFKT, a company that specialises in making digital sneakers that can be used and traded in virtual spaces as NFTs. In what represents a landmark moment in digital fashion, The Fabricant sold the world\u2019s first digital-only dress, \u201dIridescence\u201d, for $9,500 to a Canadian, Rachel Ma.\n\nThe Fabricant\u2019s \u2018Iridescence\u2019 | @the_fab_ric_ant\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic forced designers to rethink and seek a digital option to showcase their collections, leading to the creation of hyper-real digital showrooms around the world.\n\nA product of digital fashion, hyper-real fashion, is used to explain the use of tech to virtually showcase fashion products. By removing the need for humans to physically examine fashion products, hyper-real fashion tech continues to blur the lines of a prominent human physical experience: shopping.\n\nThis has also led to the development of Obsess, an experiential e-commerce platform, that uses 3D to create 360-degree virtual stores. Their portfolio includes brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Dior, and Charlotte Tilbury. \u201cVirtual stores can be created completely digitally and don\u2019t have to exist in real life. Brands use this option to create super engaging experiences for their customers,\u201d says Neha Singh, Obsess\u2019s founder and CEO, in an interview with Vogue India earlier this year.\n\nPositioning for \u201cmeta fashion\u201d\n\nThe metaverse is the use of the combination of technology like virtual reality, augmented reality, and video to create a digital world. The metaverse, unlike the way we currently access the internet, is immersive.\n\nSome of the earliest collaborations between the metaverse and fashion industry can be seen in games. There is Burberry\u2019s first-of-its-kind NFT collection with Mythical Games\u2019 Blankos Block Party, Gucci\u2019s Garden Metaverse with Roblox and their Aria Collection Film at Christie\u2019s, and Louis Vuitton\u2019s \u201cLouis The Game\u201d NFT in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French house\u2019s founding.\n\nWhile it is evident that the metaverse will enjoy massive investments from the fashion industry, the gaming industry is not left behind. Collaboration between the fashion and gaming industry in the metaverse presents a huge economic opportunity. Some notable collaborations in recent times include Balenciaga and Fortnite working together to design accessories and skins, Burberry partnering with Tencent to create exclusively designed skins for Honor of Kings characters.\n\nThe fashion industry is investing in the metaverse to create the branding of the future. While the metaverse is still new and building around it is still ongoing, its building blocks\u2014fashion avatars, digitally designed spaces, exotic pets in games\u2014are not entirely foreign.\n\nIn an attempt to tap into the trend of combining fashion and the digital world, Delz Erinle, a product and UX designer and Niyi Okeowo, an art director, started Thrill Digital, a company that started as a virtual fashion showcase and now pioneers a fashion metaverse. Thrill Digital uses a combination of Web3 technologies like XR (AR/VR), video, audio, crypto, and gaming to create its own fashion metaverse and other unreleased digital products.\n\nDuring the pandemic last year, Erinle saw how difficult it was to shop. So, he decided to bring in Lead Developer and Chief Technical Officer (CTO), Luke Jeffers, to use 3D to create a VR shopping product, to make shopping more accessible and effortless for an audience that was stuck at home.\n\nPivoting from creating the initial idea of a fashion show, Thrill started working on a VR shopping product. Thrill Digital pitched a lot of investors and won Epic Game\u2019s MegaGrant worth $40,000 in January this year to create the VR shopping product. They eventually delivered the product during Lone Design Club fashion week in February.\n\nAfter that, Erinle carried out research in a mall in London where he asked people if they would play a game to win luxury prizes. The feedback they got from people was affirmative. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to create a metaverse project initially. It was like a virtual shopping experience, first, \u201d Erinle said.\n\nThis was how Thrill Digital started Astra, a fashion crypto game where players can win real-life fashion luxury items. The game would have its own crypto token, which must be connected to a crypto wallet like the popular crypto game, Axie Infinity. The game will be open on December 20 and users can play to win a Balenciaga Small Hourglass Tote Bag. When players win a luxury item on Astra, it would be delivered to them wherever they are in the world.\n\nErinle, who doesn\u2019t believe a fully fleshed metaverse has been created yet, explained the metaverse as \u201ca collection of interoperable virtual worlds which people can experience using an avatar. The metaverse is a virtual 3D environment where people can interact but this time with phones; it is an immersive experience.\u201d\n\nLead 3D designer, Charles Egbejule, believes daring to dream they can build a mini metaverse out of Africa was one of the biggest challenges they had to face. While lead VR architect, Adekunbi Ajai, believes building remotely from different parts of the world also poses a challenge for the team. But they were able to adapt and can now easily communicate, she added.\n\nFor the team\u2019s brand designer and co-founder, Niyi Okeowo, one difficulty they faced was raising awareness on a new concept like digital fashion. \u201cWe were trying to sell the product while teaching people about it.\u201d\n\nThe audience that Astra is targeting is people who love fashion, people who use crypto, and people who love games\u2014or people who love all three.\n\nSo here is how the game works: players amass as many crypto tokens as they can within an allotted time, after which a leaderboard is created where winners will be declared and win luxury fashion.\n\nJeffers explained that NFTs would play a huge role in claiming ownership of clothing accessories and land in Astra.\n\nErinle explained that it chose to build its metaverse on the Solana blockchain because of its low gas fees and low energy consumption. Citing a report that says transactions on the Solana blockchain consume less energy than two Google searches, Astra believes it is contributing to the reduction of environmental sustainability issues.\n\nThe game will be available first on PC before VR headsets and, hopefully, mobile devices.\n\nTapping into the play-to-earn trend\n\nLike the play-to-earn crypto game, Axie Infinity, Astra will make money through protocol profits too. Revenue is generated via fees for interacting with a protocol\u2014a game\u2019s unique crypto token.\n\nAxie Infinity made huge profits using a similar approach this year. The leading crypto game has raked in $84.9 million in funds, making its protocol profit one of the biggest in the market. In the case of Axie Infinity, whenever a player sells one of the Axie creatures, he pays a 4.25% marketplace fee. He does this when he sells land or special items. Another way Axie makes money is through the fee of 4 AXS, the game\u2019s native token for \u201cbreeding\u201d more digital creatures called Axies.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ventures Platform launches a $40m fund, invites Seni Sulyman as venture partner",
          "text": "As far back as 2005, Kola Aina knew he wanted to invest in companies. He even registered a company name after his MBA program\u2014one which he\u2019s too embarrassed to share and ended up not using. After a number of rejections, unreplied messages, and bootstrapping his first business, Kola Aina launched Ventures Platform, an early-stage pan-African VC firm, in 2016.\n\nToday, Ventures Platform, announced a $40m fund for African tech startups. The new fund which has reached the first close is being led by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).\n\nThe fund features participation from experienced investors and some new leading names in Africa\u2019s technology and corporate ecosystem,, including UAC Nigeria, VFD Group, Gbenga Oyebode, Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, as well as global investors like Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, and Adam Draper. A sizable portion of the fund comes from local partners, Ventures Platform told TechCabal.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Ventures Platform has backed almost 70 startups including Seamless HR, PiggyVest, Mono, and Paystack\u2014which Stripe acquired in October 2020 for over $200m.\n\nThis new fund will allow Ventures Platform to significantly deepen its long-standing presence in Nigeria and West Africa while also investing in select companies in East, North and Francophone Africa that are able to expand across the continent.\n\n\u201cPrior to this fund, we could only write one cheque, then introduce the entrepreneur to our network of investors for a follow-on round. Now we\u2019re not only able to write their first cheque but also write follow-on rounds for our companies,\u201d Kola Aina, founder and General Partner at Ventures Platform, told TechCabal.\n\nThis new capital injection will enable Ventures Platform to double down on existing investments in its category-leading portfolio via subsequent rounds. Aina believes that being able to double down on existing investments means they can assure startups that they have a long-term capital partner. It also helps Ventures Platform defend their ownership stake in the companies, as they can participate in the upside they helped build, which is important from a returns perspective.\n\nAs part of a move to further deepen its expertise, Ventures Platform has also onboarded leading figures across African tech as Venture Partners, including Seni Sulyman (ex-VP at Andela, founder at Black Ops.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very bullish about the market; it\u2019s about the entrepreneur first. Across our portfolio, we now have two companies whose entrepreneurs we\u2019ve funded twice. We funded their first project, it didn\u2019t work; we\u2019ve funded them again,\u201d Aina said.\n\nAina has a heart for entrepreneurs as he\u2019d been one before becoming an investor.\n\nFascinated by the power of capital\n\n\u201cI was just always fascinated by the power of capital. I always wanted to end up being an investor, even when it wasn\u2019t popular.\u201d\n\nWhat attracted Aina to investing? It was the notion of giving people money and seeing them build something meaningful with it.\n\nIn 2009, Aina moved back from the US to Nigeria and co-founded Emerging Platforms, a software company. Initially, they had some customers willing to pay, but the business needed funding. They tried to raise funds but faced rejection at every corner.\n\n\u201cWe wrote a letter to every bank in Nigeria, got introductions but everyone said no. So, we went back to the drawing board and bootstrapped the business.\u201d\n\nThe harrowing experience of fundraising stayed with Aina and ignited the desire to change how people got access to capital in Africa.\n\nMaking new mistakes\n\nFortunately, the bootstrapped business thrived and Aina started angel investing in 2014. Two years later, he had an epiphany that waiting for the government and donors to solve society\u2019s problems was pointless. A better alternative was to find and fund young people using technology to solve these problems.\n\nInspired by Silicon Valley-esque accelerators, Ventures Platform was born in 2016. The initial approach was to get the best entrepreneurs from across Africa to fly into a campus in Abuja for a 16-week acceleration program. They were paired with investors, team members, capital, and mentors.\n\n\u201cObviously everyone told us acceleration is too difficult to do in Africa, but we told them we\u2019ll make new mistakes.\u201d\n\nWhile making new mistakes, they also got a few things right. One of the things Ventures Platform did then that was pioneering and different was that it was fully transparent with its terms of investing in startups. It offered $20,000 for 10% equity.\n\n\u201cAt that time it was one of the fairer deals out there,\u201d Aina said.\n\nThis transparency helped ventures attract talents like Kayode Oyewole, partner at Ventures Platform and Fola Olatunji-David, who later left the firm to become Head of Startup Success and Service at Google. Aina also believes that sharing the firm\u2019s manifesto helped move the market forward in setting the terms of evaluation for pre-seed companies in Africa.\n\nAlongside the accelerator, Aina continued investing and got to invest in startups like Paystack, Kudi, Kangbe (now Reliance HMO), Printivo and Tizeti.\n\nAfter the first year, Aina and his team saw that the accelerator wasn\u2019t ideal for the continent, so they pivoted to an early-stage fund model.\n\n\u201cWith people living together on campus, you\u2019re not just investing and helping people scale their businesses, you\u2019re also dealing with personalities. It was almost like the Big Brother House but for investing.\u201d\n\nNotably, the initial capital used to run the accelerator and invest in startups was Aina\u2019s personal funds. He had to have a conversation with his wife telling her that he needed to raid their savings to support startups.\n\n\u201cWe did over a million dollars in investments in the early days. But, in retrospect, that was a smart decision because it helped us show a track record.\u201c\n\nBy late 2017, Ventures Platform started raising external capital: syndicate funds. This happened because people who were impressed with the performance of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies wanted to invest in Ventures Platform.\n\nThe syndicate style investments continued until mid last year when Aina felt it was time for Ventures Platform to start working on raising its first institutional fund.\n\nWhy did he wait this long to raise an institutional fund?\n\n\u201cI wanted to see evidence that there\u2019s liquidity in this market before I raised an institutional fund. Startups are not just about inspiration or motivational talk. It\u2019s real business. Startup founders sometimes forget that I have to return money to my investors.\u201d\n\nWhy $40m matters\n\n2021 has been a record year for African startups as they\u2019ve raised over $4 billion so far. It\u2019s easy to see $40m, in an era where $100m raises are the new normal and wonder \u201cWhat difference does $40m make?\u201d\n\nAina believes that while the increase in capital inflow is important, the venture capital space needs to be seen as a continuum. For him, Venture Platforms\u2019 role is to find companies early and support them along the way as they gain product-market fit and look to scale.\n\n\u201cThere was a period when a company raising $500,000 was huge. Five years ago, you could count the number of local funds in the market. I think it\u2019s day one for this fund. We must not get ahead of ourselves. We want to stay disciplined. We\u2019re very clear about our thesis and are staying grounded to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, technology has had a strong role in how we create, distribute, and consume works of art. Music, for example, has gone from stringed cassette tapes that\u2019ll go on to become a child\u2019s plaything (if you\u2019re me) to being globally available with a simple tap.\n\nOne of the most profound effects technology has had on music is blurring the geographical boundaries that set sounds from different cultures apart, making music truly universal.\n\nIt\u2019s no doubt technology has aided major paradigm shifts in every industry, rendering applauded methods of doing things obsolete and establishing another method as the status quo. But at the point where music is now, it\u2019s hard to think of innovations that will disrupt the current model of music creation, distribution, and consumption.\n\nBut after a closer look and talking to some of the industry\u2019s brightest, the signs are there \u2014 the next frontier for music tech may be closer than we imagine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t predict the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nMusic is in a very exciting place right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Marcela Laskoski on Unsplash\n\nWhile Victor Okpala, who recently became Spotify\u2019s Artist & Label Partnerships Manager, West Africa, sees amazing things coming to African music tech, he\u2019s still pretty excited about where things are right now. Okpala is also the Founder of Nabsolute Media, a communication and marketing agency.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he started with the subject of monetisation and said artistes can now truly live off their music.\n\n\u201cFor example, we know how bootlegging used to work. A huge percentage of the people that consume music in Nigeria downloaded them from free websites. It was something illegal that somehow got normalised. But we are moving to a place where people see the value in music enough to pay for it.\n\n\u201cApart from the traditional streams of income which were live shows and endorsements, the music itself is able to bring in revenue as a product.\u201d\n\nBootlegging or piracy is the illegal manufacture, distribution or sale of goods. It has been a thorn in the flesh of Nigerian artistes for years. The amount lost to piracy runs into millions of dollars every year.\n\nAdeyemi Adetunji, a lawyer who is also Audiomack\u2019s Manager of Operations and Commercial Partnerships, is just as excited about African music.\n\nAccording to him, he knew afrobeats would become a thing when he was a DJ, playing the songs to an international audience back in the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would play them Wande Coal, P-Square, and D\u2019banj songs all the way back in 2011, and I just felt like the music was resonating with people, so I knew there was something there.\u201d\n\nAdetunji is particularly pleased that Nigerian musicians were maximising the opportunities technology presented. From building a strong following to connecting with fans on a deeper level.\n\nInternational collaborations and more international award nominations are also exciting phenomena in music right now. Adetunji beams with excitement as he recounts how the international collaborations that only started trickling in in 2010, are becoming the norm today.\n\n\u201cAll the new school kids are doing that a lot now, the Fireboys, the Remas and Omahlays. They\u2019re really big on that.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Okpala, the next frontier for music is that it will be viewed more as a product. He said it\u2019s currently seen solely as a form of art that doesn\u2019t drive enough investment in the industry. Ultimately, he believes the music industry is worthy of the same attention investors pay to fintech or healthtech, for example.\n\nA study by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) published on November 17, 2020, revealed that music supports two million jobs and contributes \u20ac81.9 billion ($91.69 billion) to the European economy annually.\n\nIn the US, music contributes even more to the economy. According to a 2021 study by the Recording Industry Association of America, music contributes $170 billion to the US GDP annually and supports 2.5 million jobs.\n\nThis is possible due to robust investments in the industry. In the US, record companies invested more than $4.5 billion in the industry in 2015.\n\nWhile Nigeria cannot boast such levels of investment, the state of the music industry signals that more investments could have a positive impact on the economy. Per Statista, motion picture and music recording made up $1.8 billion out of Nigeria\u2019s GDP.\n\nIn terms of revenue, the music industry raked in $40 million in 2021. This number is projected to reach $44 million in 2022. Interestingly, there are now data points that can be used to predict investment in music. As Okpala points out, this will aid more investments as there is enough data for investors to bet on.\n\n\u201cAs an investor, if you\u2019re about to invest in an artiste that has, say, 10,000 monthly listeners and 1 million monthly streams on Spotify, you can calculate his monthly revenue to be $5,000. So, if you decide to invest $5,000 towards branding, marketing, and extending reach with the goal of multiplying your audience, you can predict what the revenue could look like.\u201d\n\nHe adds that gone are the days when investors had to bet on just talent as it is never enough.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that come into play when it comes to the success of an artiste, which could be the name, the branding, the story, and the content, of course.\u201d\n\nMusic, blockchain, and the metaverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@zarakvg?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Zarak Khan</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/music-streaming?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a></span>\n\nWhile Adetunji believes no one knows tomorrow and doesn\u2019t like to make bold statements about the future, he indicates that the advent of Web3 and blockchain might have a strong role to play in the future of music.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing blockchain innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) disrupting the music space.\n\nWhile Okpala agrees that these technologies will play a big part in music, he believes that the future is still very far away. Streaming, on the other hand, isn\u2019t going anywhere soon but will only get better.\n\nNot only is it the current frontier, it\u2019ll most likely still be the next frontier. The convenience streaming brings to music is probably why it\u2019s playing a big role in music growth now.\n\nGlobal streaming revenues have grown by 42% since 2015, surpassing the entire recording industry, which has only grown by 9% in the same amount of time.\n\nAdetunji and Okpala are optimistic about the future of African and Nigerian music, one where tech will definitely determine what the next frontier will be.\n\nWith such interesting predictions, I can\u2019t wait to see more experts from the music scene share their thoughts at Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nYou can also be a part of Techpoint Build 2021, the biggest tech event in West Africa, by registering here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nOgheneruemu, Bolu, and Chimgozirim here.\n\nYou are probably wondering why all three of us are writing this newsletter. Yes, we are all hale and hearty. Hearts working fine, livers functioning perfectly, and all of that. This is the last time this year we get to write the Techpoint Digest, and we decided to give you a triple whammy.\n\nOluwanifemi and Emmanuel would do a final wrap up tomorrow, but for the last time this year, from the three of us:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, we\u2019re discussing:\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s shiny new Data Protection Act\n\nProblems in the metaverse\n\nA Bitcoin trust fund\n\nAfDB\u2019s $170m loan\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s Data Protection Act\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Succo on Pixabay\n\n\u201cAfrica is a dumping ground for technologies produced elsewhere.\u201d These first nine words of this article by Privacy International probably accurately sum up one of Africa\u2019s biggest problems.\n\nA perfect example is social media. As of December 2020, 255 million Africans used Facebook. Although these numbers appear small compared to the continent\u2019s population of over a billion people, you also have to consider other challenges such as smartphone penetration and Internet coverage.\n\nTo put all of this in perspective, that\u2019s 255 million datasets in the hands of a foreign entity. I want to re-emphasise that number, but I also want to avoid my sub-editor\u2019s wrath.\n\nSo here\u2019s the thing, Africa needs to protect its citizens\u2019 data from breaches, theft, and several other issues. Thankfully 27 out of 55 countries on the continent have enacted data protection laws and regulations. Although some are yet to enforce these laws, we are off to a good start.\n\nRecently, on December 3, 2021, Zimbabwe joined the ranks of African countries with a data protection law.\n\nFor this month\u2019s Privacy Roundtable, I talked to Nellie Tiyago, a Zimbabwean lawyer, on some of the Act\u2019s provisions and also tried to understand the intriguing decision to include cybersecurity sections.\n\nTake a look: A Zimbabwean Data Protection Act to rule them all. Or not\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProblems in the metaverse\n\nWhat is the metaverse? According to Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadal, the metaverse allows us to \u201cembed computing into the real world and to embed the real world into computing.\u201d\n\nIt is a platform, technology, or even a concept that takes the Internet beyond looking through a screen and actually being inside it. Interacting with people as if it were real.\n\nSame problems, different technologies: While the metaverse makes interactions more intimate, it also amplifies issues such as privacy, cyberbullying, or harassment that already exists online.\n\nDoes it? Oh, yes. According to The Verge, a beta tester for Horizon Worlds, Meta\u2019s (formerly Facebook) virtual reality (VR) powered metaverse claimed a stranger inside the virtual world groped her avatar.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cSexual harassment is no joke on the regular Internet, but being in VR adds another layer that makes the event more intense.\u201d\n\nAlthough Meta says the beta tester didn\u2019t make use of the safety features provided by Horizon, the incident proves that such problems should be a concern for creators of virtual worlds.\n\nWhy does this matter? Meta\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that the metaverse \u201cwill be the successor to the mobile Internet.\u201d if his predictions are anything to go by, then care needs to be taken before the metaverse becomes mainstream.\n\nJack announces \u20bftrust board\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter ex-CEO, Jack Dorsey\n\nTwitter\u2019s ex-CEO, Jack Dorsey, has announced the board of a Bitcoin trust fund, \u20bftrust, he set up with American rapper and business mogul, Shawn Carter aka, Jay-Z.\n\nWho are they? The board, which has four members, includes three Nigerians \u2014 Abubakar Nur Khalil, Obi Nwosu, and Ojoma Ochai \u2014 and a South African, Carla Kirk-Cohen.\n\nKhalil is a 22-year-old Bitcoin Core contributor, an open-source project where contributors propose upgrades to the Bitcoin client or software. Nwosu is the CEO of Coinfloor, a Bitcoin exchange in the UK.\n\nLike Khalil and Nwosu, Kirk-Cohen also has a ton of experience with Bitcoin. She\u2019s currently a software engineer at Lightning Labs, a company building software that enables fast Bitcoin transactions.\n\nOchai, unlike the other three, doesn\u2019t have any known experience with crypto. She was a former member of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Expert panel and previously British Council\u2019s Regional Director, Arts and Creative Economy Programmes, sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAccording to Dorsey, the four were selected among 7,000 applicants \u201call reviewed with purpose and rigor.\u201d The 500 BTC trust fund was created to fund Bitcoin development in Africa and India. Per Dorsey, the board members will operate independently without any control.\n\nHow will it work? It\u2019s not entirely clear how the board will implement the fund; however, a Twitter account where progress will be documented has been set up.\n\nAfDB approves $170m loan for Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood news: Nigerian tech-enabled and creative sector businesses are set to receive a boost after the board of directors of the African Development Bank approved a loan of $170 million for investment in Digital and Creative Enterprises Program (i-DICE).\n\nAt a lecture in October 2021, the President of the African Development Bank, Dr Akinwumi Adesina, disclosed that the Bank was in the process of preparing a $500 million investment to be co-financed with other partners.\n\n\u201cThis programme will boost innovation, especially in the tech-enabled business and e-commerce space, where new and successful ventures are being inaugurated in Nigeria,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\ni-DICE, an initiative of the Federal Government of Nigeria, targets youths between 15 and 35. In addition to the AfDB, the programme is co-financed by the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB).\n\nNigeria is currently the top startup investment destination in Africa. With a population of about 200 million, most of whom are young, and a vibrant tech community, the country has seen huge growth in the last decade.\n\nTechpoint Africa stories last week\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading/watching\n\nIP valuation in IP-based financing.

          "title": "Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s latest \u2018city of refuge\u2019 gets overstretched",
          "text": "Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s seat of power is fast becoming the newest home of some sort for \u2018executive refugees\u2019. The population growth in Abuja \u2013 the Federal Capital Territory \u2013 is not just simply a trend in urbanisation, which is a global phenomenon.\n\nBut the city, known for its serenity is literally becoming a safe haven for many citizens who are fleeing heightening insecurity situations in other parts of the country, particularly the North, where for years, insurgents, bandits and kidnappers held sway.\n\nThe thinking of migrants into the city \u2013 now witnessing an obvious population explosion \u2013 is the relative tranquillity and security, with the number one citizen, President Muhammadu Buhari playing chief host.\n\nThe daily influx is particularly visible at the motor parks, occupancy levels at the hotels \u2013 including short-let apartments, flights, shopping and recreational centres.\n\n\u201cWe can say for sure the number of people coming into Abuja is huge, but we can\u2019t tell the reason and right now we have no data to back this up,\u201d Stanley Olisa, Airpeace Spokesperson told BusinessDay.\n\nThe heightened migration into Abuja is also reflecting on everything, from traffic to housing and even its hotel industry. Insecurity is also rising. Hotel business is experiencing a boom. Most hotels in the city centre and outskirts are consistently being overbooked by visitors, residents and tourists into the city, most especially, Nigerians seeking long term stay in the federal capital territory. Some of the hotels visited \u2013 including The Grand Pela Hotel and Suites and White House Suites both near the popular Games Village arouse some curiosity.\n\nDespite the increasing cost of rooms and suites, the hotels were fully booked \u2013 not necessarily due to the quality of the rooms or ambience \u2013 but because lodgers were looking to book down rooms for long periods of time. A number of these individuals were leaving their insecure states and moving into Abuja, which they believe, is more secure, BusinessDay was told.\n\nThe occupants of the White House Suites were long-term lodgers who came there to partake in the housing rave of Abuja.\n\nThe influx into the city has also affected the level of traffic. Beggars \u2013 both corporate and petty \u2013 are everywhere. The cost of living in the city capital is also rising as more people migrate into the nation\u2019s capital. Houses that ordinarily go for N50 million now cost up to N120 million and above, an increase of over 150 percent in the last quarter of this year.\n\nWhen you ask them (why they are rushing in), they tell you it is because of insecurity. When you tell them that Abuja is very costly, they tell you their life is more important\n\nShanties and slums are also building up especially in places like Jabi, Utako, Airport Road, Asokoro, and all area councils, where the master plan is increasingly violated.\n\nAccording to the United Nations population prospects, Abuja is projected to have grown 6% on the average, at least in the last four years from 2,919,000, in 2018 to 3,464,000 in 2021.\n\nMohammed Bello, the FCT minister, had admitted that the problem will increase crime rate in the city. Another source of concern he stressed, is the burden of waste management, with attendant health problems for citizens and a possible outbreak of epidemics.\n\nBello said he cannot control what he described as \u201cexploding population\u201d in the city \u2013 tagged \u201cCentre of Unity\u201d, but assured that his ministry was working to manage the situation by strengthening institutions and increasing infrastructure to meet the needs of the city.\n\nThe popular Jabi Motor Park, a major transit point for travellers to almost all the states of the country has seen heightened activity. Sam, the manager of one of the Transport companies, confirmed the daily influx, relying on the data from daily ticket sales.\n\nAccording to him, people are even moving in with their entire families into the city.\n\n\u201cIt is true that people are coming in from the states in the North central, including Benue, Plateau, Kogi and Kwara. There is no day that we don\u2019t have people coming in. Most of them are men and women but we still have families relocating. When you ask them (why they are rushing in), they tell you it is because of insecurity. When you tell them that Abuja is very costly, they tell you their life is more important,\u201d Sam said.\n\nLess than one year of relocating from Jos, Plateau State to Abuja, Nnamdi Nwankwo, a resident recalls the trauma of waking up to incessant bandits, kidnappers and herdsmen attacks drove him out of his initial base. He further worries about insufficient security operatives needed to tackle criminality in the country.\n\nRead also: Increased private sector participation, government policies crucial to develop manufacturing\n\nEstate managers also confirmed the increasing demand for accommodation, with new estates rapidly springing up across the city.\n\nObiora Uchenna, an Abuja based realtor, confirmed the influx of people from other states into the Federal Capital, affirming that the situation has affected rent in the city.\n\n\u201cAbuja is now considered as a safe haven due to insecurity in other states of the federation. As a realtor, I can tell that many people are trooping into the city and this has increased the cost of properties in Abuja. Properties in Abuja are now scarce too,\u201d Uchenna said.\n\nAccording to Olawale Sholademi, marketing director of Urban shelter \u201cAbuja\u2019s population has grown steadily over the past 10 years on an average of about 5.3%. The FCT population is set at about 3.4 million at the moment. Economic value is the major factor for the influx of people into the FCT.\n\n\u201cThere are more businesses springing up, entrepreneurship is growing with the advent of co-locations/shared serviced office spaces, real estate happens to be one of the major influences in the FCT business arena as it has leveraged other businesses such as outdoor advertising among others. Nightlife is on the rise and this particularly comes with the social vices.\u201d\n\nSholademi notes that population growth comes with its pros and cons, but worries, particularly about how the authorities are bracing for an imminent population surge and its consequence.\n\n\u201cThe issue here is what the FCDA is doing about the growth,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need the brain of an astronaut to know that the population surge is putting pressure on public infrastructures \u2013 we need more roads and traffic controls for instance. Driving around the FCT during business hours is almost a night mare.\u201d\n\nFor him, the concentration of places of interest in a single location is not a smart development plan.\n\n\u201cIf you go off the present city centres, you will see several empty lands that a proactive government should quickly leverage on to grow the city\u2019s infrastructures, road networks, alternate means of transportation, amenities, recreational, and even dare to build smart cities that will lead to urban development as seen all over the world.\u201d\n\nSholademi strongly believes there is an urgent need for public education, policies, and rule of law to enforce law and order in the FCT. He said for instance, \u201cAbuja motorists don\u2019t use designated bus stops. They park just about anywhere that serves their own personal interest. That is so wrong in a city growing so fast. People do not obey traffic lights and driving rules.\u201d\n\nTo take full advantage of the pros of population growth, he identified the need to strategically plan the city\u2019s expansion and provision of necessary amenities and infrastructure in these new layouts. One does not need to drive to the present city centres to get medical care, shop satisfactorily, and have a social life.\n\nEdith Omoyi, a housing agent in Abuja said more people now make inquiries for accommodation compared to the previous years.\n\n\u201cApparently the population in Abuja has greatly increased. I now receive many more calls from people needing apartments compared to 3 or 4 years ago. People believe there are job opportunities in Abuja because it is the capital city.\n\n\u201cAnother reason I would say is peace and security. In order states, people believe that when insecurity arises, tackling it might be difficult for the state government, but since Abuja is the nation\u2019s capital, the federal government will do everything possible to ensure that the insecurity is well tackled.\n\n\u201cI think there is more priority in ensuring security in Abuja compared to any other states after all most of the politicians and big men are here. Some of my clients are here not for opportunities but security.\u201d\n\nInnocent Opara, an estate surveyor, who moved in from Cross River State to continue his water drilling business in Abuja, is concerned that low economic activity in most states, which largely depend on the monthly federal allocation for survival, is a major problem apart from insecurity.\n\nAnother major trouble for people in the states, Opara pointed out, is the criminal activities of herdsmen and criminal gangs who engage in kidnapping, which have grounded work on sites and farms to a halt.\n\nThe larger concern is that facilities in the city are stretched, and may worsen if some measures are not taken to contain the situation.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, an official of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCDA), disclosed that the fast rising population of the FCT is now a cause for concern to the authorities.\n\nAccording to him, the influx of people from other parts of Nigeria has begun to put pressure on the city, citing the persistent traffic build up on the roads leading in and out of neighbouring states.\n\n\u201cAbuja today is experiencing this grind because over the years, the government in power did not envisage a time when Nigerians will begin to seek refuge in the Federal Capital. There is so much insecurity in the various states across the country and yet, the government of the day is not finding a lasting solution to this problem.\n\nIfeanyi Ughamadu, head of Information, Transport Secretariat, FCTA acknowledged the rapid influx of persons into the nation\u2019s capital which, he said, may put pressure on available infrastructure. He, however, declined comment on the severity or consequences saying, it is within the Minister of FCT\u2019s purview.\n\nUghamadu, however, affirmed that insecurity is a major driver. \u201cApart from the search for greener pasture and better access to better infrastructure, citizens are running to the FCT for safety, states that border the city have continued to witness diverse conflict and insecurity ranging from the farmer/herder clash in Benue state to banditry in Niger and Kaduna states and some communal clashes in Nasarawa and Plateau States.\u201d",

          "text": "Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s seat of power is fast becoming the newest home of some sort for \u2018executive refugees\u2019. The population growth in Abuja \u2013 the Federal Capital Territory \u2013 is not just simply a trend in urbanisation, which is a global phenomenon.\n\nBut the city, known for its serenity is literally becoming a safe haven for many citizens who are fleeing heightening insecurity situations in other parts of the country, particularly the North, where for years, insurgents, bandits and kidnappers held sway.\n\nThe thinking of migrants into the city \u2013 now witnessing an obvious population explosion \u2013 is the relative tranquillity and security, with the number one citizen, President Muhammadu Buhari playing chief host.\n\nThe daily influx is particularly visible at the motor parks, occupancy levels at the hotels \u2013 including short-let apartments, flights, shopping and recreational centres.\n\n\u201cWe can say for sure the number of people coming into Abuja is huge, but we can\u2019t tell the reason and right now we have no data to back this up,\u201d Stanley Olisa, Airpeace Spokesperson told BusinessDay.\n\nThe heightened migration into Abuja is also reflecting on everything, from traffic to housing and even its hotel industry. Insecurity is also rising. Hotel business is experiencing a boom. Most hotels in the city centre and outskirts are consistently being overbooked by visitors, residents and tourists into the city, most especially, Nigerians seeking long term stay in the federal capital territory. Some of the hotels visited \u2013 including The Grand Pela Hotel and Suites and White House Suites both near the popular Games Village arouse some curiosity.\n\nDespite the increasing cost of rooms and suites, the hotels were fully booked \u2013 not necessarily due to the quality of the rooms or ambience \u2013 but because lodgers were looking to book down rooms for long periods of time. A number of these individuals were leaving their insecure states and moving into Abuja, which they believe, is more secure, BusinessDay was told.\n\nThe occupants of the White House Suites were long-term lodgers who came there to partake in the housing rave of Abuja.\n\nThe influx into the city has also affected the level of traffic. Beggars \u2013 both corporate and petty \u2013 are everywhere. The cost of living in the city capital is also rising as more people migrate into the nation\u2019s capital. Houses that ordinarily go for N50 million now cost up to N120 million and above, an increase of over 150 percent in the last quarter of this year.\n\nWhen you ask them (why they are rushing in), they tell you it is because of insecurity. When you tell them that Abuja is very costly, they tell you their life is more important\n\nShanties and slums are also building up especially in places like Jabi, Utako, Airport Road, Asokoro, and all area councils, where the master plan is increasingly violated.\n\nAccording to the United Nations population prospects, Abuja is projected to have grown 6% on the average, at least in the last four years from 2,919,000, in 2018 to 3,464,000 in 2021.\n\nMohammed Bello, the FCT minister, had admitted that the problem will increase crime rate in the city. Another source of concern he stressed, is the burden of waste management, with attendant health problems for citizens and a possible outbreak of epidemics.\n\nBello said he cannot control what he described as \u201cexploding population\u201d in the city \u2013 tagged \u201cCentre of Unity\u201d, but assured that his ministry was working to manage the situation by strengthening institutions and increasing infrastructure to meet the needs of the city.\n\nThe popular Jabi Motor Park, a major transit point for travellers to almost all the states of the country has seen heightened activity. Sam, the manager of one of the Transport companies, confirmed the daily influx, relying on the data from daily ticket sales.\n\nAccording to him, people are even moving in with their entire families into the city.\n\n\u201cIt is true that people are coming in from the states in the North central, including Benue, Plateau, Kogi and Kwara. There is no day that we don\u2019t have people coming in. Most of them are men and women but we still have families relocating. When you ask them (why they are rushing in), they tell you it is because of insecurity. When you tell them that Abuja is very costly, they tell you their life is more important,\u201d Sam said.\n\nLess than one year of relocating from Jos, Plateau State to Abuja, Nnamdi Nwankwo, a resident recalls the trauma of waking up to incessant bandits, kidnappers and herdsmen attacks drove him out of his initial base. He further worries about insufficient security operatives needed to tackle criminality in the country.\n\nRead also: Increased private sector participation, government policies crucial to develop manufacturing\n\nEstate managers also confirmed the increasing demand for accommodation, with new estates rapidly springing up across the city.\n\nObiora Uchenna, an Abuja based realtor, confirmed the influx of people from other states into the Federal Capital, affirming that the situation has affected rent in the city.\n\n\u201cAbuja is now considered as a safe haven due to insecurity in other states of the federation. As a realtor, I can tell that many people are trooping into the city and this has increased the cost of properties in Abuja. Properties in Abuja are now scarce too,\u201d Uchenna said.\n\nAccording to Olawale Sholademi, marketing director of Urban shelter \u201cAbuja\u2019s population has grown steadily over the past 10 years on an average of about 5.3%. The FCT population is set at about 3.4 million at the moment. Economic value is the major factor for the influx of people into the FCT.\n\n\u201cThere are more businesses springing up, entrepreneurship is growing with the advent of co-locations/shared serviced office spaces, real estate happens to be one of the major influences in the FCT business arena as it has leveraged other businesses such as outdoor advertising among others. Nightlife is on the rise and this particularly comes with the social vices.\u201d\n\nSholademi notes that population growth comes with its pros and cons, but worries, particularly about how the authorities are bracing for an imminent population surge and its consequence.\n\n\u201cThe issue here is what the FCDA is doing about the growth,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need the brain of an astronaut to know that the population surge is putting pressure on public infrastructures \u2013 we need more roads and traffic controls for instance.

He said for instance, \u201cAbuja motorists don\u2019t use designated bus stops. They park just about anywhere that serves their own personal interest. That is so wrong in a city growing so fast.

Examination of the Capital Account Cashbook revealed that an additional sum of N36,610,000.00 (Thirty-six million, six hundred and ten thousand naira) was paid in favour of the contractor in September 2016 under the same contract, without approval.\n\n\u201cThe Management of the Institute should justify the overpayment, which is in excess of the contract sum, otherwise the sum of N36,610,000.00 (Thirty-six million, six hundred and ten thousand naira) overpaid should be recovered from the contractor and recovery particulars forwarded for verification.\u201d\n\nAnother query reads, \u201cPayments totalling \u20a667,296,478.00 (Sixty-seven million, two hundred and ninety-six thousand, four hundred and seventy-eight naira) were revealed to be made to payees other than the payees specified in the payment vouchers.\n\n\u201d This is contrary to the provision of FR 613 which stipulated that \u201cPayments shall be made only to the persons named in the vouchers or their properly authorized representatives.

We have committed some portions of our land for the cultivation of oil palm in the state.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNigeria did well without crude oil and agriculture drove the growth and development, as both small and large plantation owners drove the growth at that time.\n\n\u201cThe large plantation owners did well and we focused more on them as they prepared a large expanse of land for farming cash crops as smaller holders don\u2019t have that capacity. They have access to knowledge and resources to help us introduce the new standard for agriculture.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cIn the new thinking and a new Nigeria that we are approaching, you are critical and a valuable partner required if this nation must be transformed into an agro-based economy.\n\n\u201cWe have to undertake a forest audit to understand the nature of our forest and discovered that part of it has been degraded and decided to convert some of them to oil palm cultivation and agreed to work with you to regenerate part of the forest that has not been badly affected.\n\n\u201cWorking with you, we developed the Edo State Oil Palm Programme where we realise that community engagement is very important for the success of the program. Community engagement is critical for success. We have put in place a mechanism to ensure we succeed in this area, as they will be the ones to protect the investment. We are involving the communities in securing our communities and state.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn securing our forest we created a forestry law, established a forest commission as it will help us secure our forest better, ensuring the forest is not used by criminal gangs,\u201d Obaseki added.\n\nOn his part, the Managing Director of PRESCO, Felix O.

          "title": "Omicron fallout: Nigeria\u2019s diplomatic bluff pays dividends",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nBy the time the dust settled on what had been days of diplomatic tit for tat between Nigeria on one hand, the United Kingdom (UK), Canada and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on the other, in the wake of the detection of Omicron variant of Covid-19 in South Africa late last month, Africa\u2019s most populous country had proved a point, that it could well stand up to bullies.\n\nBattered by intractable security challenges and worsening economy, Nigeria has variously been described as a failed and failing state with disorientated populace, but after days of diplomatic row with its colonial master, the North American country and the Gulf nation, all of which ended ultimately with Nigeria claiming bragging rights last week, Nigerians have found a reason, even if momentarily, to feel a sense of pride in their country.\n\n\u201cUnited Arab Emirates backed down from the diplomatic row over airlines slots. United Kingdom backed down from red listing of African countries. You might not link these together but I am glad Nigeria fought back,\u201d wrote an elated public affairs commentator, Dipo Awojide, @OgbeniDipo. \u201cAgain, I say, you can be small and fight when being bullied.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to concede that in comparative terms, a country of over 200 million people could be said to be \u201csmall\u201d or an underdog in a fight with UAE, with approximately 10 million people and the United Kingdom with a little more than 67 million population, a combination of which is less than half of Nigeria\u2019s total.\n\nBut in global geopolitics, economic power lies real strength. And obviously a country with GDP Per capita of $5,280 pales into insignificance when compared to UAE\u2019s $70,441 and UK $48,693.\n\nRegardless, what Nigeria lacks in economic strength, it proved it could somewhat make up for with its population, and in the last few days, it proved, when push came to shove, that it could count on its people.\n\nUK Row\n\nThe detection of Omicron late last month in South Africa led to hasty slapping of travel bans on the country and other African countries by the United Kingdom, U.S. Canada and a host of other western and Asian countries, a move that triggered continental fury. Many alleged it was informed by racism and politics, not science.\n\nBoth the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations condemned the bans as travel apartheid, but undeterred, UK would fortnight ago, add Nigeria \u2013 among other African countries, including Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe \u2013 on its red list, a decision that left many stranded at Abuja airport, as they were yanked off British Airways which cancelled its flight from the country.\n\nComing few days after Cyril Ramaphosa, president of South Africa visited Abuja \u2013 what was in a way, calling the bluff of the UK, which had earlier slammed travel ban on South Africa and other countries in the sub-region after Omicron was detected \u2013 the UK decision was interpreted in some quarters as trying to punish Nigeria for showing solidarity with a brother African nation, an interpretation that further inflamed passion.\n\nFrom Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), to former president of Nigeria, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo and the Federal Government of Nigeria, and indeed everyone that mattered, the reaction to the ban was that of indignation.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, in an address on December 6, argued that the decision by the UK to put Nigeria on the red list, just because of less than two dozen cases of Omicron which, by the way, did not originate in Nigeria, is unjust, unfair, punitive, indefensible and discriminatory.\n\n\u201cAs the Spokesman for the Federal Government, I can say, without mincing words, that the decision by British government to put Nigeria on the red list, just because of less than two dozen cases of Omicron which, by the way, did not originate in Nigeria, is unjust, unfair, punitive, indefensible and discriminatory. The decision is also not driven by science,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nAmid the outrage on December 8, an obviously rattled British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Mrs. Catriona Laing appeared on Channels Television to fight off what had developed into a raging storm, an indication that her country had gotten the message.\n\n\u201cThe decision (to add Nigeria on the red list) is not discriminatory,\u201d she argued. \u201cWhen the UK was the epicenter of the Alpha variant, we took some tough measures to essentially cut ourselves off.\u201d\n\nShe went on: \u201cIn the earlier stages of the Delta variant, we were red listed by Austria, France and Turkey.\u201d\n\nTo further make the point that contrary to widely held views in Nigeria, the decision to impose the ban was informed by certain biases, Laing emphasized that UK had added France and Pakistan when it first decided on the idea of coming up with travel red list.\u201d\n\nMrs. Laing insisted that the decision to draw up the red list was not discriminatory as alleged, but based on \u201cindividual deep dive assessment of an individual country.\u201d\n\nMrs. Vicky Ford, Minister for Africa, followed up by visiting Nigeria\u2019s High Commissioner to UK, Ambassador Sarafa Isola, who had himself called on his host country to reverse the travel ban, describing same, like the WHO and UN had done, as travel apartheid, and afterwards, tweeted that \u201cNigeria is very important to United Kingdom,\u201d and that her country is committed to \u201ca strong relationship\u201d with Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2019We discussed science behind current red listing as a significant number of Omicron cases linked to travel from Nigeria,\u201d she wrote, concluding that the \u2018Restrictions are temporary.\u201d\n\nBut the appeals and explanations failed to dissuade a Nigerian government determined to make a point.\n\nLast weekend, Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika announced its own reciprocal red list, slamming travel bans on UK, Canada, and Saudi Arabia with effect from Tuesday, December 14.\n\nSirika who announced the decision on Sunday in Lagos, explained that it was to reciprocate restricted flights from Nigeria into those countries over the new COVID-19 variant, Omicron.\n\n\u201cThere is also the case of Saudi Arabia that put Nigeria on the ban list. On Sunday, I participated in a meeting with the COVID-19 task force,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have given our input that it is not acceptable by us and we recommended that those Canada, the UK, Saudi Arabia and Argentina also be put on the red list. As they did to us, if they do not allow our citizens into their countries; who are they coming, as airlines, to pick from our country?\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government\u2019s decision had sent sufficient message. Same Tuesday the restrictions took effect, UK\u2019s Covid operations cabinet committee, which had said the ban would be reviewed on December 20, held a meeting and approved the decision to remove travel restrictions, starting from 4am on Wednesday.\n\nThe UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who had announced the travel ban, said the Omicron had spread so widely that the rules are now less effective.\n\nLaing, on her part, would issue a statement to explain that the decision to remove Nigeria and other African countries from the travel red list was based on \u201cscientific and public health data.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, \u201cOn Tuesday 14th December, UK Ministers made the decision \u2013 based on scientific and public health data \u2013 to remove Nigeria from the UK\u2019s travel red list. The emergence of the Omicron variant is a reminder that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, and like all countries around the world the UK has had to take difficult decisions to protect public health.\n\n\u201cWe took this necessary precautionary action to give us time to understand the challenge we and others faced, and to slow down the spread of Omicron while scientists urgently assessed what impact the variant has on vaccines, treatments and transmissibility. When we announced the heightened restrictions we made clear that we would remove them as soon as we could, and that is the decision Ministers have taken today.\n\n\u201cI know this will be welcome news for students, tourists, businesses and families in the UK and Nigeria, although I recognise the impact that these temporary health measures have had.\u201d\n\nBut for many Nigerians, the move was most likely necessitated by the reaction of Nigeria, especially given that Omicron is fast spreading in the country.\n\n\u201cThey knew that if the row continued, they were going to lose,\u201d said Dr. Bongo Adi, senior lecturer at Lagos Business School. \u201cHow many flights do British airways do into Nigeria on a weekly basis? How many Nigerian airlines take people to Britain on a weekly basis? None, so it is British Airways and Virgin Atlantic that were going to lose.\n\n\u201cThe impact would not have been much on Nigeria. Those it would have affected are the elite who send their children to school abroad and who obtain health care from abroad.\u201d\n\nAdi said remittances would not have been affected, as according to him, there are channels for sending money home.\n\n\u201cIt would not have affected remittances because anybody who wanted to send money home against Christmas would still have she sent money home without coming home,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the way you don\u2019t carry money when you are traveling. You can\u2019t have more than a few thousand dollars. If you do that, you would be arrested.\u201d\n\nThe UK would subsequently on Thursday, lifted the suspension on processing visitor visas in Nigeria, and all countries previously on the red list.\n\nCanada Lifts Travel Ban\n\nCanada, which in recent years, has become a popular destination for middle class Nigerians seeking greener pastures or just to escape the chaos at home, had on November 26, slammed travel ban on Nigeria, as well as a number of other African countries, including South Africa, Mozambique, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Eswatini, Namibia, Malawi and Egypt.\n\nThe decision equally generated outrage, given that only African countries were affected by the ban. This had informed the decision of Nigerian government to include Canada in its own travel restriction list, and on Friday last week, the government of Canada lifted the travel ban.\n\nA statement by the Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos on Friday said Canada is lifting the ban starting December 18 at 11:59 p.m.\n\nHe said Canada will also re-introduce pre-arrival tests for all new incoming travellers.\n\nThe ban was originally set to expire on January 31.\n\n\u2026Tit For Tat with UAE\n\nWhile the row with UK and Canada over Covid-19 restrictions raged, Nigeria was engaged in similar tit for tat with the UAE over travel slots.\n\nNigeria\u2019s diplomatic scuffle with the Arab country had started in September when it decided to stop issuing visas to Nigerians. The federal government responded by banning its airline, Emirates from entering the country.\n\nThe ban was eventually lifted in late September when the UAE wrote to state that it had agreed to issue visas to Nigerians.\n\nBut following the lifting of the ban, Emirates used Covid-19 as pretext to subject Nigerians to all manner of inhumane treatment, and the federal government slammed yet another ban on the airline.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, however, the federal government once again, lifted the ban, following which Emirates applied to the Federal Ministry of Aviation for approval of its winter flight schedule, consisting of 21 weekly passenger flight frequencies to Nigeria, a request that was granted by Nigeria in the spirit and intent of the Bilateral Air Services Agreement (BASA) between both countries.\n\nBut another problem arose. Air Peace Airlines, the only Nigerian airline that operates passenger flights to Sharjah International Airport in UAE, requested three weekly passenger flight frequencies but was granted only one.\n\nThe action of UAE authorities prompted a decision by Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to also whittle down Emirates flight into the country to one per week, a move that sparked an intense diplomatic row.\n\nFollowing the decision of NCAA, UAE Minister of Economy, Abdulla Bin Touq Al Marri, who doubles as the chairman of the General Civil Aviation Authority wrote to Sirika, justifying the decision to grant Air Peace only one slot.\n\nHe accused the Nigerian carrier of abandoning the Sharjah Airport, where it had slot, to fly into Dubai airport, before returning to the Sharjah, an airport distance away from Dubai.\n\n\u201cThe GCAA has the honour to highlight that such a decision by the NCAA is totally unjustified especially, as it has come to our attention that their action is being taken against the background of Air Peace not securing all 3 slots at Sharjah Airport which they desire. Air Peace initially operated at Sharjah Airport, shifted to Dubai Airport and then returned to Sharjah airport.\n\nIt would be unreasonable for an airline to expect any airport to maintain their slots when they ceased operating at that airport. In this regard, we wish to kindly advise you. that Sharjah Airport is currently operating at 140% slot capacity, but with goodwill and tremendous effort on their Side, this Airport was able to accommodate Air Peace with 1 of the 3 slots that this airline requested,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThe GCAA wishes to stress that the action being taken by the NCAA is obviously not in line with the spirit of the agreed air services arrangements between our two Nations. As we are both aware, the relations between our two brotherly countries are vintage in nature, one hallmark being the recent visit of the President of Nigeria to the UAE, which certainly mirrored the status of these positive relations.\u201d\n\nBut Air Peace in a swift response described the claim by Marri that it operates from another airport other than Sharjah Airport as falsehood calculated to damage on its brand.\n\n\u201cWe did several evacuation flights out of Sharjah. So, we never left Sharjah Airport nor did we at any time \u201cshifted and operated out of DXB (Dubai Airport\u201d. The letter deliberately painted us as unserious while at the same time, suggesting that we look for other airports in the country to operate from,\u201d Air Peace said in a letter to Sirika.\n\n\u201cAfter the restriction of scheduled flight operations between UAE and Nigeria was lifted towards the last week in November 2021, we approached the Sharjah Airport and GCAA with a request to allow us to operate a charter into the UAE on December 01, 2021.\n\n\u201cTo our surprise and, despite the lifting of the ban on flight operations between both countries, they refused. They said they would not allow charter but scheduled flight operations.\n\n\u201cHowever, we then, in obedience to their demand, announced resumption of scheduled operations beginning from that date and we opened our sales to the public.\u201d\n\nAccording to Air Peace, three days to departure, the GCAA was yet to approve flights and came back 48hours to deny them of slots to operate flights. They were later told that Air Peace would only be accepted if only it brought a small aircraft.\n\n\u201cOn our request to continue with the scheduled operations after this present flight, we were turned down using lack of slot as excuse. Meanwhile, Emirates had started operating three flights daily into Nigeria while Air Peace was totally turned down!\u201d\n\nAir Peace said the one slot was only given to them after the NCAA had made threats to withdraw Emirates Airlines ministerial approval.\n\n\u201cThen, at your threat of going to stop them if Air Peace was not allowed a meagre three flights weekly, THEY QUICKLY DID THE UNTHINKABLE. THEY GAVE US ONE FLIGHT ONLY PER WEEK! They also added that it must be operated only on Thursdays at a time that they chose themselves,\u201d the airline said.\n\nBut the UAE authorities were in the mood for muscle flexing, and on Monday last week, barred all airlines \u2013 including Egypt Air, Air France, KLM, Ethiopian Airlines, Rwanda Air, Etihad \u2013 from conveying Nigerian passengers to the country.\n\nSame Monday, many Nigerian passengers who board Ethiopian Airlines heading for Dubai were sent off the plane.\n\nThe move attracted outrage in the country, with many encouraging the Nigerian government to stands its ground.\n\n\u201cThe law is very clear on the BASA agreement,\u201d fumed retired Nigerian diplomat and former Permanent Secretary Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Joe Keshi on Arise TV last week.\n\n\u201cThe federal government\u2019s argument is very simple: Give us what is in the books, don\u2019t dictate to us. How can you say that you will take 21 flights but will give us one? It\u2019s an insult on this country, and we must face the reality. So let nobody cry over the fact that they not going to spend the holidays in Dubai.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s support this government to teach these people a lesson. At the end of the day, yes some Nigerian would suffer, but they would also lose financially. How many people from UAE come to Nigeria? Very few if any, but a lot of Nigerians travel to the UAE and so they make huge sums of money from Nigeria, which if they continue with the diplomatic row they would lose, especially this Christmas season.\u201d\n\nThe UAE, would, however, soon back down. In a letter dated December 13, 2021 and addressed to Chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyema, the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA), said it has given Air Peace weekly flight slots in Dubai, emphasising that in order to maintain good relations between both countries, it had offered to block some slots for the Nigerian carrier.\n\nIn the said letter signed by the DCAA Director General, Mohammed Ahli, titled, \u201cOperation of Air Service between Dubai and Nigeria,\u201d the Dubai authority said, \u201cThe Dubai Civil Aviation Authority presents its compliments to the honourable management of Air Peace, Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, relations between our two countries go a long way back and we value these relations immensely. We surely wish to facilitate easy and safe travel for the people, between our two brotherly countries.\n\n\u201cWe write in reference to Air Peace\u2019s possible/intended operations to/from Dubai Airport (DXB)-Terminal 1 and as a gesture of goodwill and in support of UAE and Nigeria relations, in case Air Peace wishes to start flights, slots have been blocked by Dubai Airports as detailed below:\n\n\u201cSlots available and blocked for Air Peace are the following: A0540LT D0800LT-All days and A0510LT D0800LT- without day 6.\n\n\u201cAs these slots cannot be blocked indefinitely, we would highly appreciate if Air Peace could kindly reach out to Dubai Airports-ACL and inform them of their intentions to operate by Thursday December 16, 2021 and accordingly confirm the blocked slots.\n\n\u201cDubai airport has also confirmed that dnata-the ground handling agents at DXB have sent the ground handling quotation to Ms. Reham Mustafa-Country Manager and also, Emirates Flight Catering is working on the quotation and should send it out latest by tomorrow morning.\n\n\u201cFor landing permissions, they could contact our Air Transport Section as detailed below: Landing Permission: [email protected]\u201d\n\nThe letter added, \u201cDubai Civil Aviation Authority avails itself of the opportunity to renew to the honourable management of Air Peace, the assurances of its highest consideration and reiterates its support at all times.\u201d\n\nNigeria had pulled it\u2019s weight, proving that it could stand it\u2019s ground when push comes to shove. And for many, it\u2019s a sign that the country can indeed be great when it gets it act right.\n\n\u201cAir Peace stood for its Citizens during Covid-19 and now Federal Government and its Citizens stood by them,\u201d noted Mohammed Jammal, @whitenigerian. \u201cIf we can do a case study on this and henceforth stand by all business men and women to succeed, Nigeria will be a better place!!\u201d\n\nHowever, the decision, last week, of UAE to stop Nigerian athletes from participating in the 15th World Swimming Championships 2021 holding in Abu Dhabi, suggests that country is still targeting Nigeria.\n\nNigerian athletes and their representatives who arrived the Arab nation from different parts of the globe to participate in the games claimed that they were denied access to participate in the competition by authorities of the UAE on Thursday.\n\nThe Nigerian government is yet to react to the latest development.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "The Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Matthew Hassan Kukah, yesterday said he would not stop speaking against bad governance in the country until Nigeria changes for the better.\n\nKukah, who stated this in his homily celebrating 45 years of priesthood and 10 years as Bishop in Sokoto, said keeping quiet in the face of injustice and bad governance was nothing but corruption.\n\nHe recalled with nostalgia how he took the vow to keep preaching the gospel with fidelity and constancy not minding whose ox is gored.\n\nIn keeping to this vow, Bishop Kukah said some might construe constant criticism of governments as causing trouble.\n\n\u201cI did not promise to serve the President, governor, any politician, businessman or individual but preach the gospel with fidelity and constancy. Nothing I have accomplished as a result of myself. Were it not for the Catholic Church, I would have been nothing. I would not have been a priest. Constantly remind yourself that everything about you is God\u2019s gift,\u201d Kukah admonished the congregation.\n\nWhile noting that his happiness was not about how far he had been as a priest but had remained committed to his vow by preaching the gospel with fidelity and constancy.\n\n\u201cKeeping silence in the face of injustice is corruption. The things I keep saying is not for any government, I was saying it before this government came and I will continue to say same even after this government.\n\n\u201cWe must passionately and deliberately fix this country. It is not by accident that we are here today; we must fix this country together. Human greed gives birth to all the problems in the world. Human beings cause all the evil in the world.\n\n\u201cIf we look at how the world is broken today, we must all ask ourselves, what is our individual contributions to the broken world? You must have contributed by not necessarily joining the fight but your refusal to live a life that is sufficiently regulated by the spirit as the spirit illuminates darkness.\n\n\u201cReligion is not going to fix Nigeria; politics will not fix our country as those in power in Nigeria are not any different from the colonial masters. They have same mentality as they continue to steal the resources which is our collectively patrimony and hide same abroad.\n\n\u201cNigerians should be faithful to the word of God and have confidence in the country. The situation we are today is not about whether Christian is the President or not. We must ask ourselves why the decay in the system? And the simple answer is because we are not doing what God asked us to do as Christians.\u201d\n\nOn the political front, he said: \u201cThe Peoples Democratic Party , PDP, is not wanting to take over power because they want to do anything better, just as the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) do not want to hand over power because they are going to do something different. It is all about selfishness.\u201d\n\nOn why Nigerians should continue to be proud of the country at all times, Kukah said, \u201cGod did not make mistake for you to have come from your small village.\n\n\u201cI talk about Nigeria with pride because before our very eyes, God will do a great thing that we will all rejoice.\u201d\n\nReflecting on his life, Bishop Kukah said: \u201cI am happy that sometimes, somebody will stop me somewhere and say thank you my Lord Bishop Kukah for making such a huge impact in my life. I schooled courtesy of your scholarship.\u201d\n\nHe said his next plan was how to take five 5000 families out of poverty through an upcoming empowerment programme by the grace of God.

Nothing I have accomplished as a result of myself. Were it not for the Catholic Church, I would have been nothing. I would not have been a priest. Constantly remind yourself that everything about you is God\u2019s gift,\u201d Kukah admonished the congregation.\n\nWhile noting that his happiness was not about how far he had been as a priest but had remained committed to his vow by preaching the gospel with fidelity and constancy.\n\n\u201cKeeping silence in the face of injustice is corruption. The things I keep saying is not for any government, I was saying it before this government came and I will continue to say same even after this government.\n\n\u201cWe must passionately and deliberately fix this country. It is not by accident that we are here today; we must fix this country together. Human greed gives birth to all the problems in the world. Human beings cause all the evil in the world.\n\n\u201cIf we look at how the world is broken today, we must all ask ourselves, what is our individual contributions to the broken world? You must have contributed by not necessarily joining the fight but your refusal to live a life that is sufficiently regulated by the spirit as the spirit illuminates darkness.\n\n\u201cReligion is not going to fix Nigeria; politics will not fix our country as those in power in Nigeria are not any different from the colonial masters. They have same mentality as they continue to steal the resources which is our collectively patrimony and hide same abroad.\n\n\u201cNigerians should be faithful to the word of God and have confidence in the country. The situation we are today is not about whether Christian is the President or not. We must ask ourselves why the decay in the system? And the simple answer is because we are not doing what God asked us to do as Christians.\u201d\n\nOn the political front, he said: \u201cThe Peoples Democratic Party , PDP, is not wanting to take over power because they want to do anything better, just as the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) do not want to hand over power because they are going to do something different. It is all about selfishness.\u201d\n\nOn why Nigerians should continue to be proud of the country at all times, Kukah said, \u201cGod did not make mistake for you to have come from your small village.\n\n\u201cI talk about Nigeria with pride because before our very eyes, God will do a great thing that we will all rejoice.\u201d\n\nReflecting on his life, Bishop Kukah said: \u201cI am happy that sometimes, somebody will stop me somewhere and say thank you my Lord Bishop Kukah for making such a huge impact in my life. I schooled courtesy of your scholarship.\u201d\n\nHe said his next plan was how to take five 5000 families out of poverty through an upcoming empowerment programme by the grace of God.

          "text": "By Taiye Agbaje\n\nAll Progressives Congress (APC) candidate in Anambra, Andy Uba, who has vowed to upturn the election of Professor Chukwuma Soludo, was handed an unexpected knock out on Monday.\n\nA Federal High Court, Abuja, on Monday, nullified his participation in the 6 November election, declaring his candidacy illegal.\n\nThe ruling effectively denied Uba a locus standi to challenge Soludo.\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo, in a judgment, held that the June 26 primary of the party which produced Uba as its standard-bearer was not validly conducted.\n\nThe ruling ended what would have been some legal distraction for Soludo, a former Central bank governor, hoping to make a difference in governance in the state.\n\nChief George Moghalu, an aspirant in the APC primary election had challenged the process and the outcome of the primary election that produced Uba as the party\u2019s candidate.\n\nMoghalu, who was the plaintiff, had sued the party, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and Uba as 1st to 3rd defendants respectively.\n\nDelivering the judgment, Justice Ekwo aligned with the plaintiff\u2019s arguments that the June 26 primary election breached the provisions of the Electoral Act and the APC guidelines for the conduct of the exercise.\n\nHe held that the plaintiff had successfully demonstrated that the primary election was not conducted in accordance with the law and the party\u2019s guidelines.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the case of the plaintiff succeeds on its merit,\u201d he said.\n\nEkwo held that since the election was conducted illegally, the APC (1st defendant) cannot be a beneficiary of the Nov. 6 election which produced the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) candidate, Prof. Charles Soludo, as the winner of the poll outcome.\n\nThe judge, therefore, declared that the APC had no candidate in the Anambra governorship election by non-inclusion of the name of Moghalu in the primary election, and the conduct of the poll in contravention of the Electoral Act and the party\u2019s guidelines.\n\n\u201cThe 2nd defendant (INEC) is compelled to delist the name of the 1st defendant and 3rd defendant from the Nov. 6, Anambra governorship election,\u201d he ordered.\n\nAccording to the judge, any election conducted contrary to the 1st defendant guideline is in nullity.\n\n\u201cThe real issue was not whether accredited members of 1st defendant voted on that day but whether the election was conducted in accordance with the election guidelines of 1st defendant,\u201d he held.\n\nHe also said that the evidence of the police report confirmed that the election was conducted outside the time frame.\n\nEkwo, who described the conduct of the primary by APC as \u201ccrude and primitive,\u201d ordered that the N22.5 million paid by Moghalu as expression of interest and nomination forms be refunded since the party failed to complied with the provisions of the law and its guidelines.\n\nMoghalu had, in July, filed the suit at the court, seeking an order removing Uba and the APC from the list of gubernatorial candidates and political parties partaking in the Anambra governorship election on the grounds that the party failed to conduct a valid primary election.\n\nHe also demanded N122.5 million as damages, which include a refund for the fee paid for expression of interest and nomination forms and N100 million \u201cfor the breach of contract to commence and conclude primary election\u201d.\n\nINEC had picked Uba, winner of the APC primary election, as the party\u2019s candidate.\n\nIn the affidavit in support of the suit, the plaintiff said the APC failed to conclude the selection and nomination process for its candidate for the Nov. 6 governorship poll.\n\nHe said the APC had chosen to adopt direct primary, which is why the party published the list of designated venues for the exercise.\n\nMoghalu said the party received N22.5 million for the expression of interest form and nomination form, including from him, \u201cto allow him to participate in the primary election exercise\u201d.\n\nHe further said he was informed a day before the primaries that the APC electoral committee would address all aspirants and stakeholders in Akwa.\n\n\u201cShockingly, on June 26, 2021, the said election committee was not seen anywhere in Anambra; no accreditation of voters took place; no voting and collation of votes occurred in all the 326 wards of Anambra state,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the committee \u201cannounced election results it did not conduct, and which fakery was credited to the 3rd defendant as the winner of the primary election scheduled for emergence as APC\u2019s candidate in the November 6 governorship election in Anambra\u201d.\n\nMoghalu also argued that the party did not invite the INEC in line with the law requiring the commission to monitor the exercise.",

So, we closed down even private schools. We know the inconveniences considering the importance of education, especially now that schools were about to write their promotion examinations. But having analysed that particular threat, we believed it was better for us to close the schools temporarily to allow security operatives to continue to conduct their operations because we don\u2019t know when they will strike because they even said they will strike in the afternoon, about 300 of them will strike precisely at 4:00pm.\n\n\u201cFor bandits to tell you that they will strike in broad daylight, that tells you the magnitude and the number at which they will enter Zungeru and overwhelm everybody. So, we are trying to avoid what happened in Tegina.\u201d\n\nNalando further revealed that Zungeru had been threatened by bandits in recent times.\n\nHe said, \u201cOne of the incidents was the abduction of the Permanent Secretary, Niger State Ministry of Transport.\u201d\n\nHe added that schools would be reopened if the security situation in the area improves.\n\nThe council boss also appealed to parents and school proprietors for understanding.",

Later, the lovers had a tender embrace.\n\nIn another scene, the corps member was seen standing immediately behind Sofiat, wearing Sofiat\u2019s military cap.\n\nHowever, an Army spokesman said the female soldier had broken the Nigerian Army\u2019s rules and regulations governing military personnel\u2019s codes of conduct while on duty.\n\nNwachukwu said the female soldier\u2019s actions amounted to exploiting her trainee, noting that if a male soldier proposed to a female corps member during the NYSC parade, the public would have been outraged and accused the Army of coercion.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe female soldier in question violated the following rules of the NA: fraternisation while on official duty at the NYSC camp. That is, indulging in an amorous relationship with a trainee.\n\n\u201cPersonnel must have served for three years before he/she can qualify for marriage.\n\n\u201cShe disobeyed the Armed Forces of Nigeria standing guidelines and directives for the use of Social Media. Indulging in romance while in uniform.\n\n\u201cHer conduct was prejudicial to good order and military discipline.\n\n\u201cAll the above, if proven are in violation of extant laws with attendant disciplinary and penal implications.\n\n\u201cAs personnel, her task was to train the Youth Corps members and not to indulge in amorous relationship with any of them. These rules were put in place for the purpose of proper administration and discipline in the Army. If I may ask, what if the soldier was a male? How would the public have perceived his action? Definitely, it would have been perceived as taking advantage of a female Corper, a trainee, put in his care for training.\u201d\n\nThe Army spokesman, however, declined comments on the likely punishment the female soldier might get but said \u201cthe Nigerian Military like all others, has its disciplinary codes, distinct from that of the general society. All personnel have voluntarily undertaken to be bound by this code.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore has called for Sofiat\u2019s immediate release.\n\nAccording to the activist in a Facebook post, there is no law that prevents anyone from accepting a marriage proposal in military uniform.\n\nHe posted, \u201c#FreeSofiat HQ Nigerian Army is illegally holding Army Private Hannah Sofiat A, her offence was accepting a marriage proposal from her National Youth Corps Service (NYSC) lover at a Mammy Market in Ilorin. There is no law that prevents anyone from accepting a marriage proposal in military uniform but as it is typical of the pre-civilization Nigerian military she was clamped into detention at Sobi Military Cantonment in Ilorin, Kwara state.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian military must release Sofiat asap and apologise to her for illegal detention. #RevolutionNow.\u201d",

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC), has been fiercely criticised by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for its unforgivable indifference to terrorist assaults in Sokoto, Niger, Katsina, Kaduna, Plateau, and other parts of the country.\n\nThe apparent numbness of the APC leaders to bloodshed, as well as the failure of the APC as a party to offer any tangible solution or forcefully call its government to task on security, validates concerns about the APC\u2019s reported complicity in our nation\u2019s worsening insecurity over the last six years, the PDP said in a statement released on Sunday and signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Debo Ologunagba.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cIs it not unforgivable that, while the APC failed to show empathy for the heinous murder of scores of travelers who were burned alive in Sokoto state, the massacre of over 15 worshippers in Niger state, and other compatriots killed in Kaduna, Katsina, and other parts of the country in recent days, its leaders and officials in government found time to attend President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s son\u2019s turbaning ceremony in the same troubled Katsina state?\n\n\u201cIs it also not provocative, vexatious and indeed the height of heartlessness that APC and its leaders party while Nigeria burns?\n\n\u201cSuch callous assault on the sensibility of Nigerians which amounts to dancing on the graves of the victims of the attacks further exposes the APC as a party that is completely unfeeling to killings, attaches no value to lives and has no commitment towards the fight against terrorism in our country.\n\n\u201cThe PDP, standing in solidarity with Nigerians, calls out the APC to come clean on its alleged connection to killings, the benefit it derives from violence and bloodletting and why it attaches no value to human lives.\n\n\u201cNigerians can recall that despite demands by the PDP, the APC and its leaders have failed to account for the \u201cpolitical mercenaries\u201d they reportedly imported from neighboring countries as thugs, gangsters and hoodlums to unleash violence on Nigerians during the 2019 elections. The APC has also not explained the continued presence of a self-confessed terrorism apologist in its government.\n\n\u201cThe least Nigerians expect of the APC is to forcefully give its government a marching order to develop wholesome strategy to proactively tackle insecurity, including targeting the source of fund to terrorists, many of which were revealed by a foreign government, yet the APC government refused to take action.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the APC as a party of selfish and blood thirsty \u201cpolitical bandits\u201d does not have the commitment, readiness or capacity to do so.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the PDP charges President Muhammadu Buhari to demonstrate leadership and empathy by personally visiting the troubled states in line with his campaign promise to lead the fight against terrorism from the front instead of always pushing his responsibilities to others.\n\nThe PDP again commiserates with victims of the horrific attacks. We also urge Nigerians not to resign to despondency but continue to support one another and remain focused as we scale up our collective efforts to rescue and rebuild our nation from misrule.\u201d",

          "title": "Imperial College London: Omicron Largely Evades Immunity from Past Infection, Two Vaccine Doses",
          "text": "The Omicron coronavirus variant largely evades immunity from past infection or two vaccine doses, according to the latest Imperial modelling.\n\nThe new report (Report 49), from the Imperial College London COVID-19 response team estimated that the risk of reinfection with the Omicron variant was 5.4 times greater than that of the Delta variant.\n\nBut amid concerns about the rapidly spreading omicron variant, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States and White House Chief Medical Adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci has described the booster jabs as the tool to fight the spread of omicron.\n\n\u201cOur booster vaccine regiments work against omicron,\u201d US-based ABC News quoted him to have said.\n\n\u201cAt this point, there is no need for a variant-specific booster,\u201d he added. While a specific booster was not needed, booster shots, in general, have been shown to greatly restore antibody levels in the fight against omicron, he added.\n\nThe Imperial College report implied that the protection against reinfection by Omicron afforded by past infection may be as low as 19 per cent.\n\nResearchers estimated the growth and immune escape of the Omicron variant in England. They used data from the UKHSA and NHS for all PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in England who had taken a COVID test between November 29th and December 11th 2021.\n\nThis level of immune evasion meant that Omicron poses a major, imminent threat to public health.\n\nAccording to the report obtained from the Imperial College website, the study included people identified as having Omicron infection due to an S gene target failure (SGTF), as well as people with genotype data that confirmed Omicron infection.\n\nIt revealed that overall, 196,463 people without S gene target failure (likely to be infected with another variant) and 11,329 cases with it (likely to be infected with Omicron) were included in the SGTF analysis, as well as 122,063 Delta and 1,846 Omicron cases in the genotype analysis.\n\nFirstly, it stated that the report looked at factors associated with testing positive for Omicron compared to non-Omicron (mostly Delta) cases.\n\n\u201cThe results suggest that the proportion of Omicron among all COVID cases was doubling every 2 days up to December 11th, estimated from both S-gene Target Failure and genotype data. Based on these results they estimate that the reproduction number (R) of Omicron was above 3 over the period studied.\n\n\u201cThe distribution of Omicron by age, region and ethnicity currently differs markedly from Delta, with 18\u201329-year-olds, residents in the London region, and those of African ethnicity having significantly higher rates of infection with Omicron relative to Delta. London is substantially ahead of other English regions in Omicron frequency.\n\n\u201cOmicron transmission is not yet uniformly distributed across the population. However, the researchers note that given its immune evasion, the age distribution of Omicron infection in the coming weeks may continue to differ from that of Delta,\u201d it added.\n\nBut, the study found no evidence of Omicron having lower severity than Delta, judged by either the proportion of people testing positive who reported symptoms, or by the proportion of cases seeking hospital care after infection. However, hospitalisation data remained very limited at the time, it added.\n\n\u201cTo assess the impact of Omicron on reinfection rates the researchers used genotype data, since even prior to Omicron, reinfection was correlated with negative S gene Target Failure data, likely due to random PCR target failure caused by the lower viral loads associated with reinfections.\n\n\u201cControlling for vaccine status, age, sex, ethnicity, asymptomatic status, region and specimen date, Omicron was associated with a 5.40 (95% CI: 4.38-6.63) fold higher risk of reinfection compared with Delta. To put this into context, in the pre-Omicron era, the UK \u201cSIREN\u201d study of COVID infection in healthcare workers estimated that prior infection afforded 85 per cent protection against a second COVID infection over 6 months. The reinfection risk estimated in the current study suggests this protection has fallen to 19% (95%CI: 0-27%) against an Omicron infection,\u201d it added.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers found a significantly increased risk of developing a symptomatic Omicron case compared to Delta for those who were two or more weeks past their second vaccine dose, and two or more weeks past their booster dose (for AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines).\n\nDepending on the estimates used for vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection from the Delta variant, this translated into vaccine effectiveness estimates against symptomatic Omicron infection of between zero per cent and 20 per cent after two doses, and between 55 per cent and 80 per cent after a booster dose. Similar estimates were obtained using genotype data, albeit with greater uncertainty.\n\nCommenting on the study, Prof. Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London said: \u201cThis study provides further evidence of the very substantial extent to which Omicron can evade prior immunity given by both infection or vaccination. This level of immune evasion means that Omicron poses a major, imminent threat to public health.\u201d\n\nAlso, Prof Azra Ghani from Imperial College London said: \u201cQuantifying reinfection risk and vaccine effectiveness against Omicron is essential for modelling the likely future trajectory of the Omicron wave and the potential impact of vaccination and other public health interventions.\u201d\n\nThe work, which was not yet peer-reviewed, was presented in the latest report from the World Health Organisation (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Modelling within the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Jameel Institute, Imperial College London.\n\nSince the emergence of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) in December 2019, the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team adopted a policy of immediately sharing research findings on the developing pandemic.\n\nPeter Uzoho with agency report",
          "summary": "The Omicron coronavirus variant largely evades immunity from past infection or two vaccine doses, according to the latest Imperial modelling.\n\u201cOur booster vaccine regiments work against omicron,\u201d US-based ABC News quoted him to have said.\nThe Imperial College report implied that the protection against reinfection by Omicron afforded by past infection may be as low as 19 per cent.\nThe reinfection risk estimated in the current study suggests this protection has fallen to 19% (95%CI: 0-27%) against an Omicron infection,\u201d it added.\nSince the emergence of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) in December 2019, the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team adopted a policy of immediately sharing research findings on the developing pandemic.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday, said the last vestiges of terrorists were the ones soft-targeting innocent citizens, looting their assets and burning houses, because they were already frustrated as a result of the heat turned on them by the nation\u2019s troop.\n\nThe president, who just got back from a three-day visit to Turkey, returned to the news of some 38 persons, reportedly killed in some communities in Kaduna State by bandits and stressed that killing of innocent citizens were no more acceptable.\n\nAlso, the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs in Kaduna State, Samuel Aruwan, who disclosed the latest killings in a statement, confirmed that no fewer than 38 people were killed in Giwa Local Government Area of the state.\n\nHowever, in a counter effort, operatives of the Nigeria Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), working with the Taraba State Police Command, said they arrested eleven notorious kidnap suspects in Taraba over alleged complicity and various criminal roles in the recent spate of kidnap incidents, including the killing of a police sergeant in Jalingo, the state capital.\n\nA statement by Force Headquarters, which also claimed that the suspects were responsible for the kidnapping of a serving personnel of the Nigeria Customs Service and a relative of the Emir of Jalingo, stated that the police recovered seven AK47 rifles, two baretta pistols, 121 rounds of live ammunition of different calibre, four magazines, masks, illicit drugs and other incriminating items during raids of various hideouts of the suspects in the state.\n\nBuhari, while condemning the renewed killings in Kaduna State, said the gruesome nature of recent incidents in Kauran Fawa, Marke and Ruhiya of Idasu Ward of Giwa Local Government Area, has made him particularly sad and the killings unacceptable.\n\nIn a release by the president\u2019s spokesman, Garba Shehu, Buhari expressed the nation\u2019s condolences to the Government of Kaduna State, the people of Zonkwa Chiefdom and the family of His Highness Nuhu Bature, the Agwam Kajju on his demise.\n\nIn praying for the repose of the souls of the deceased, the president reiterated that the nation\u2019s security forces had \u201cturned the heat on the terrorists, who are getting frustrated and are soft-targeting innocent citizens, looting their assets, burning their homes and killing them indiscriminately.\u201d\n\nBuhari further reiterated his directive to the security and intelligence chiefs to do everything they could to destroy the remaining vestiges of the terrorists.\n\nAruwan, while speaking on the Kaduna killing, said the incident was reported to the state government by the military and police authorities, adding that, \u201csecurity agencies have confirmed to the Kaduna State Government that 38 people were killed across the locations attacked.\u201d\n\nHis statement identified some of the affected villages to include Kauran Fawa, Marke and Riheya villages in Idasu district, adding that houses, trucks, and cars were also burnt, along with food and farm produce.\n\nAruwan said Governor Nasir El-Rufai of the state received the news with sadness and had sent condolences to the families of the victims of the brutal attacks while praying for the repose of their souls.\n\n\u201cThe governor also commiserated with the affected communities and directed the Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency to conduct an urgent assessment of the area towards providing relief,\u201d he said.\n\nBut, \u201cin the meantime\u201d he said, security agencies had sustained patrols in the general area.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner said 29 of the victims had been identified, with nine yet to be identified atthe time of the security update.\n\nAccording to him, the 29 identified victims included Rabi`u Wada, Salisu Boka, Nura Nuhu, Bashari Sabiu, Lawal Dahiru, Abbas Saidu, Inusa Kano, Lawal Nagargari, Malam Aminu, Lawal Maigyad and Mustapha Lawal Aliyu.\n\nOthers victims, according to Aruwan, include, Sale Makeri, Sani Lawal, Auwal Umar,Jamilu Hassan, Badamasi Mukhtar, Malam Jibril, Lawal Tsawa, Sule Hamisu, Sadi Bala, Kabiru Gesha, Abubakar Sanusi, Saiph Abdu, Haruna Musa, Lawal Hudu, Shuaibu Habibu, Yahaya Habibu and Abubakar Yusuf.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Taraba situation, a statement by Force Public Relations Officer, Mr Frank Mba, a Commissioner of Police, said the arrest of the suspects followed the deployment of operatives of the Intelligence Response Team by the Inspector General of Police, Mr Usman Alkali Baba, to the state to complement efforts of the sState command in promptly containing the disturbing trend of kidnapping, armed robbery, and other violent crimes in the state.\n\nThe suspects, Luka Adam, Shuaibu Nuhu, Moses Amos, Peters Mashi, Ahmadu Mallam, Adamu Mohammed, Dahiru Mallam Dalha, Gambo Isah, Sanusi Ahmadu, Mallam Mohammed Mauludu, Ibrahim Idi, all indigenes of Taraba State, were arrested by the police team from their various criminal hideouts.\n\nPolice investigations revealed that the suspects, who were on the wanted list of the command, were members of a notorious kidnap syndicate and had been evidentially linked to the recent upsurge in incidents of kidnapping in the state, including deliberate and calculated attacks on security personnel.\n\nInvestigations also revealed how two of the suspects, Gambo Isah and Sanusi Ahmadu, masterminded the killing of the police sergeant and left a police inspector with gunshot injuries in their recent operation to enable them escape arrest, having abducted some victims in Jalingo recently.\n\nFurther investigations revealed that the modus operandi of the suspects included trailing individuals notably, business owners, government functionaries, motorists with flashy and exotic cars, among others, to their houses and thereafter planned and executed the kidnap of such persons.\n\n\u201cThey also collect huge sums of money as ransom from relatives and friends of their victims before their release,\u201d it said.\n\nThe police, in the course of investigations, identified and raided various criminal hideouts,where kidnap victims were usually kept. The police stated that while a cache of weapons and other incriminating items were recovered from their hideouts, all the kidnap victims held hostage at the various hideouts were carefully and successfully rescued unhurt and reunited with their families.\n\nTo that extent, investigators had intensified efforts at arresting other suspects currently at large.\n\nThe IG, while commending the people of Taraba for supporting the police especially, in providing useful information that aided the prompt apprehension of the suspects, assured that the police would continue to work with all stakeholders in deepening the collective safety of the Taraba people.\n\nThe IG condoled the family of the late Sergeant Ogidi Habu and maintained that the force would sustain efforts at improving public safety in all Nigerian communities, adding all the suspects would be charged to court on completion of investigations.\n\nDeji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna",

          "text": "Chilean leftist Gabriel Boric won the country\u2019s presidential runoff election on Sunday, capping a major revival for the country\u2019s progressive left that has been on the rise since widespread protests roiled the Andean country two years ago.\n\nIn downtown Santiago, supporters cheered, embraced and waved flags with Boric\u2019s image, as well as rainbow flags of LGBT groups that have backed his socially inclusive policies as well as plans to overhaul Chile\u2019s market-orientated economic model.\n\n\u201cWe did it!\u201d 39-year-old Paola Fernandez said tearfully as she hugged her daughter, adding she was happy because of Boric\u2019s progressive policies.\n\nWith over 99% of ballots counted, Boric, 35, who leads a broad leftist coalition, had 55.86% of the vote, compared with 44.14% for far-right rival Jose Antonio Kast, who conceded defeat.\n\n\u201cI just spoke to @gabrielboric and congratulated him on his great success,\u201d Kast said on Twitter. \u201cFrom today he is the elected President of Chile and he deserves all our respect and constructive collaboration. Chile is always first.\u201d\n\nThe protests in 2019 shone a spotlight on economic inequality and triggered an official redraft of the constitution.\n\n\u201cI am going to be the president of all Chileans,\u201d Boric said in a call with center-right President Sebastian Pinera, who will step down in March.\n\n\u2018I WANT REAL CHANGE\u2019\n\nLucrecia Cornejo, 72, a seamstress, backed Boric\u2019s pledge to fix inequalities in education, pensions and healthcare.\n\n\u201cI want equality, for us not to be as they call us, the \u2018broken ones,\u2019 more fairness in education, health and salaries,\u201d she said. \u201cI want real change.\u201d\n\nThe election was the nation\u2019s most divisive in decades, with the two candidates offering starkly different visions of the future. Kast, 55, ran a law-and-order campaign and was a defender of former dictator Augusto Pinochet.\n\nOften likened to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and a hero of Chile\u2019s \u201cunapologetic right,\u201dKast has said that \u201ctwo models for the nation\u201d were going head-to-head.\n\nBoth candidates were from outside the centrist political mainstream that has ruled Chile since the return to democracy in 1990 after Pinochet\u2019s military dictatorship. Both moderated their positions in recent weeks to win over centrist voters.\n\nMiguel Angel Lopez, a professor at the University of Chile, said Boric faced a complex period ahead and would have to negotiate with the opposition due to a split Congress where neither side has a majority.\n\n\u201cHe now has to make a strong speech where he tries to end the uncertainty. Lots will depend on that and on his appointments and his decisions. International investors will be very attentive to this.\u201d\n\nBoric supporters say he will overhaul the country\u2019s economic model that dates back to Pinochet. It has been credited for driving economic growth, but attacked for creating sharp divides between rich and poor.\n\n\u201cWe can close the chapter on the dark, damaging and abusive model that benefited a small minority,\u201d said businessman Jorge Valdivia, 54, a Boric supporter.\n\nBoric, who rose to prominence leading a student protest in 2011 to demand better and more affordable education, wrote in an open letter on Saturday that his government would make the changes Chileans had demanded in the 2019 social uprisings.\n\nThose protests, which lasted months and at times turned violent, sparked a formal process to redraft Chile\u2019s decades-old constitution, a text that will face a referendum next year.\n\n\u201c(That means) having a real social security system that doesn\u2019t leave people behind, ending the hateful gap between healthcare for the rich and healthcare for the poor, advancing without hesitation in freedoms and rights for women,\u201d Boric wrote.",
