          "text": "Following threats by the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics to embark on a fresh round of industrial action following the non-implementation of its demands, the Federal Government has set up a committee and opened fresh grounds for renegotiation with the union, The PUNCH has learnt.\n\nOur correspondent gathered that the committee was expected to turn in its report in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThe National President of ASUP, Dr Anderson Ezeibe, disclosed this in an interview with our correspondent in Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nThe PUNCH reports that the members of the union had embarked on a 65-day strike that affected federal and state polytechnics in 2021 following the failure of the government to release the sum of N15bn for the revitalisation of the institutions and payment of the new salary scheme, among others.\n\nThe Federal Government had given approval for the release of the fund. However, seven months later, the money was not released and other agreements were not fulfilled.\n\nThe ASUP president told our correspondent that the union would have no choice but to go on strike because of the failure of the Federal Government to meet its demands.\n\nHowever, in what seems to be a move to avert the crisis, the Federal Government set up a committee to look into the demands.\n\nEzeibe said, \u201cA committee has been inaugurated to look into the previous agreement and what we are looking towards now is renegotiation. Some of the past agreements from way back were not honoured; so, they said they want to renegotiate and that is what will happen.\n\n\u201cA committee has also been set up to look into some of the outstanding demands, which include the issue of revitalisation fund and the issue of salary scheme for polytechnic lecturers; the committee is expected to turn in its report in the first quarter of 2022. We are hopeful, because we do not want a situation where we will be forced to embark on a strike.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

All though the future belongs to all of us a greater part of the future belongs to the youth, you must not discount your future gain, keep pressing forward with those ideals you strongly believe in to make the world a better future.\u201d\n\nThe Olu of Warri, Tsola Emiko, Atuwase III also urged the Nigerian youths and women to participate more in the process of governance as it would enhance the economic growth of the nation.\n\nHe said, \u201cWomen and youths are the remaining two-third that we must fully utilise for us to get there. I dare say if governance gets it right to reach this right equilibrium, society can only be right for it.\u201d\n\nThe President of the Carrington Fellowship Network, Mr Olusola Owonikoko, described the late Carrington as a true hero of democracy, saying it was important for every youth to be more relevant in politics.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO) Director General, Tedros Ghebreyesus, has expressed optimism that COVID-19 pandemic will end in 2022.\n\nGhebreyesus said at a press briefing on Wednesday that it was two years ago, as people gathered for New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations, that a new global threat emerged.\n\nSince then, 1.8 million deaths were recorded in 2020 and 3.5 million in 2021, but the actual number is much higher. There are also millions of people dealing with long-term consequences from the virus.\n\nRight now, Delta and Omicron are driving up cases to record numbers, leading to spikes in hospitalisation and deaths.\n\nGhebreyesus said he was \u201chighly concerned\u201d that the more transmissible Omicron, circulating at the same time as Delta, is leading to \u201ca tsunami of cases.\u201d\n\nEarlier in 2020, during meetings of the world\u2019s biggest economies \u2013 the G7 and G20 \u2013 WHO challenged leaders to vaccinate 40 per cent of their populations by the end of 2021 and 70 per cent by the middle of 2022.\n\nWith only a couple of days left in the year, 92 out of 194 Member States missed the target.\n\nHe attributed this to low-income countries receiving a limited supply for most of the year and then subsequent vaccines arriving close to expiry, without key parts, like syringes.\n\n\u201cForty per cent was doable. It\u2019s not only a moral shame, it cost lives and provided the virus with opportunities to circulate unchecked and mutate,\u201d he said.\n\nWHO chief warned that boosters in rich countries could cause low-income countries to again fall short and called on leaders of wealthy countries and manufacturers to work together to reach the 70 per cent goal by July.\n\n\u201cThis is the time to rise above short-term nationalism and protect populations and economies against future variants by ending global vaccine inequity.\n\n\u201cWe have 185 days to the finish line of achieving 70 per cent by the start of July 2022. And the clock starts now,\u201d he said\n\nEarly on, the director-general acknowledged that beating the new health threat would require science, solutions, and solidarity.\n\nWhile elaborating on some successes, such as the development of new vaccines, which he said \u201crepresent a scientific masterclass\u201d, the WHO official lamented that politics too often triumphed over solidarity.\n\n\u201cPopulism, narrow nationalism and hoarding of health tools, including masks, therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines, by a small number of countries undermined equity, and created the ideal conditions for the emergence of new variants,\u201d he said.\n\nMoreover, misinformation and disinformation, have also been \u201ca constant distraction, undermining science and trust in lifesaving health tools\u201d.\n\nHe highlighted as a case in point that huge waves of infections have swept Europe and many other countries causing the unvaccinated to die disproportionally.\n\nThe unvaccinated are many times more at risk of dying from either variant.\n\nAs the pandemic drags on, new variants could become fully resistant to current vaccines or past infection, necessitating vaccine adaptations.\n\nFor Ghebreyesus, as any new vaccine update could mean a new supply shortage, it is important to build up local manufacturing supply.\n\nOne way to increase production of life-saving tools, he said, is to pool technology, as in the new WHO Bio Hub System, a mechanism to voluntarily share novel biological materials.\n\nHe also pointed to the new WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence, based in Berlin, Gerrmany.\n\nThe WHO chief called for the development of a new accord between nations, saying it would be \u201ca key pillar\u201d of a world better prepared to deal with the next disease.\n\n\u201cI hope to see negotiations move swiftly and leaders to act with ambition,\u201d he said.",

Aminu Bello Masari, to the effect that his government is going to assist communities acquire weapons to defend themselves against rural bandits and other criminal gangs \u201c\n\n\u201cThe apparent failure of our military and other law enforcement agencies to protect citizens against bandits and other dangerous criminal has created an atmosphere where heavily armed bandits operate freely in the Northwest and parts of Niger State with impunity as they rape, plunder, maim and kill citizens with reckless abandon.\u201d\n\n\u201cNumber of opinion leaders and Associations had called on communities to take up arms and defend themselves as some people feared that such calls if hindered could degenerates into anarchy\u201d\n\n\u201cWith this initiative by the governor to assist communities armed themselves with some sort of official regulation,it will balance the use of terror by these criminals thereby, reduce the number of these frequent attracts on communities.\u201d\n\nHowever, spokesperson of Coalition of Northern Groups ( CNG) , Suleiman Abdulaziz , said \u201cthat is nothing but an afterthought from leaders who have turned down every suggestions for collective approach to the security situation in the North.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe northern Governors in particular have refused to act on the advice to design a uniform approach as against the current isolated approaches which have not worked and have no promise of yielding results.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge that whenever the gangs of criminals are attacked and dislodged from one state, they slip into other states with ease. Unless by this new resolve Masari means he will mobilise his fellow Governors of the frontline states to agree to a common, regulated action, it will amount to just another exercise in futility.:\n\n\u201cSerious challenges such as the one we are faced with ought not be treated with the level of levity and condescension shown by the governors of the affected northern states, neither should they be seen as affecting only one region or state or, for that matter, one ethnic group or the other. On the contrary, such challenges are cross-national issues that affect every one of us regardless of where we live or come from.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor this reason, the security problem must be confronted collectively with the entire will and resolve of the people behind the effort. Failure to do so will indubitably mean that every effort made in isolation such as this one being proposed by Masari, will defeat all the endeavours, and render the task of ending the crisis.the more difficult and futile.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery one of us must therefore, become a stakeholder and a committed actor in this struggle to free our society and our country of this debilitating problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn any case, even that proposal by Masari, though belated, is a better option to street protests that are bound to be manipulated by unscrupulous politicians. Masari should also go further to organise general prayers for God\u2019s intercession,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has been lampooned for his response to a letter by a Niger Delta leader, Edwin Clark.\n\nIn a rejoinder on Tuesday, Obasanjo declared that the oil within the region belongs to the entire people of Nigeria.\n\nOn Wednesday, a South-South coalition said from paragraphs 4 to 12 of his reply, Obasanjo emphasized the constitutionality of \u201cthe forceful expropriation of Niger Delta\u201d.\n\nThe Niger Delta Congress (NDC) chided the ex-Head of State for failing to see the absurdity in centring his arguments on legalities \u201cconceived by members of the larger ethnic nationalities which Obasanjo belongs\u201d.\n\nA statement by the spokesman, Ovunda Eni, noted that in paragraph 13, Obasanjo, not only admitted Niger Delta resources was eyed by both sides during the civil war, he asked the people to be appreciative because the situation would have worsened if the Biafran side won.\n\nEni, a lawyer, thanked the retired General for the \u201crevelations\u201d which he said aren\u2019t new to the region.\n\n\u201cIt important for the Niger Delta people to take note that its territory and people are seen as war booty won and/or lost. This thinking continues to influence the relationship between the Niger Delta and the larger nationalities; not neighbours, not brothers, not comrades, not friends, but war booty.\n\n\u201cIn paragraph 18, the former President made it known that he has been a champion of equity and fairness in Nigeria. And in his bid to ensure this equity, he believes that it is necessary to \u201csuppress\u201d ethnic nationalities, or \u201ctribes\u201d in his own words, so the state can emerge.\n\n\u201cWhat he failed to reveal is that suppressing \u201ctribes\u201d in a state is in reality nothing more than an attempt to create a state where smaller nationalities are silenced, or annihilated so their lands and resources are annexed and controlled by the larger ethnic nations who also make up the state.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the ruthlessness with which this suppression as a strategy has been applied, most importantly with the genocide in Odi which left over 10% of the population dead in 1999; a genocide perpetrated by Nigerian troops when President Obasanjo himself was the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.\n\n\u201cPresident Obasanjo stating that he would continue to push for the suppression of \u201ctribes\u201d in the Nigerian state until he \u201cbreathes\u201d his \u201clast\u201d, is Obasanjo pledging allegiance to a genocidal ideology. Such audacity can only come when a man has successfully carried out a massacre.\n\n\u201cThis does not only show the failure of the Nigerian state he swears by, but also shows the complicity of the international community he hobnobs with and whose interests in the Niger Delta he has served. This also shows the failure of the Niger Delta leadership to stand by and for our people.\n\n\u201cIn subsequent paragraphs, the former President went back in time to cite colonialism and its legal constructs in different ways to derive legitimacy for the injustice that has been the relationship between the Niger Delta and what is currently known as Nigeria right from as early as the colonial era.\n\n\u201cAs interesting as this attempt to gaslight the Niger Delta is, what is poignant for the NDC is the subtlety in insinuating that what we currently have operable in Nigeria is an extension of colonialism with the larger groups as the new colonial masters. We choose to not be colonised by any group.\n\n\u201cMost important to the NDC are paragraphs 20 and 21 wherein Obasanjo revealed moves he and some other collaborators from within and outside the Niger Delta are making to once again shortchange the people as has been done within the Nigerian context since 1960, and which he has played an integral part of from the civil war till date.\u201d\n\nEni said the former leader spelt out the work being done by the Committee for Goodness of Nigeria (CNG) \u2013 which he is a part \u2013 where Niger Delta representatives are proposing an 18% derivation in CNG recommendations \u201cto those who can take action\u201d ahead of a new constitution before the 2023 elections.\n\nNDC condemned the \u201cinsulting\u201d proposition, insisting that agitations have revolved around economic and political autonomy (resource control), contained in the different declarations and charters that have emanated since the 1965 Rumuomasi declaration.\n\nThe body recalled that at the South-South Hearing on 1999 Constitution review in Port Harcourt on 27th May 2021, the NDC presented recommendations to the Senate Committee led by Senator Betty Apiafi where 50% resource control or derivation was demanded.\n\nThe statement reminded the public that the NDC has been collating signatures of ethnic nationalities\u2019 representatives for the Niger Delta Peoples Charter which asserts the right of the region to control their resources and determine their socio-political future.\n\nEni vowed that the people will resist any move to foist any constitution that does not take cognizance of the demands of the people as captured in the charter adopted on 8th October 2021 at the Niger Delta Peoples Conference in Yenagoa, capital of Bayelsa.",

          "text": "By Joseph Jibueze, Deputy News Editor\n\nThe Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) on Wednesday announced Jose Peseiro as the new head coach of the Super Eagles.\n\nPeseiro is a Portuguese national, born on 4 April 1960. His last coaching stint was Venezuela.\n\nBut his record in football management has been largely poor and dogged by sackings and no major trophies.\n\nHe had a stint managing in Africa, but one day after announcing the Portuguese as Egyptian club Ahly\u2019s new head coach in 2015, hundreds of the Cairo giants\u2019 fans gathered before the club\u2019s headquarter in protest.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe protesters demanded that the team\u2019s management board rescind the decision.\n\nFollowing a trophy-less season, Ahly appointed the former Real Madrid assistant manager Peseiro, then 55, as the new boss.\n\nSome Ahly fans expressed their disapproval of appointing the new coach due to his perceived soft-handed approach as well as his lack of titles.\n\nAs a national team manager, Peseiro failed to take Saudi Arabia to the 2010 World Cup finals.\n\nHis most notable achievement came in 2005 when he led Portuguese giants Sporting to the Europa League final before losing the title to CSKA Moscow.\n\nHis management record\n\nPeseiro spent his first eight years as a manager in the third and fourth tiers of Portuguese football, starting out as a player-coach at his last team.\n\nIn summer 1999, he was appointed at C.D. Nacional, which he helped promote to the Primeira Liga in three seasons.\n\nIn 2002\u201303, he led the team to a final 11th position.\n\nIn 2003\u201304, Peseiro assisted Carlos Queiroz at Real Madrid.\n\nAt the end of the campaign, after the team lost a considerable advantage on the table to be finally surpassed by Valencia CF, FC Barcelona and Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a, the pair was sacked, and the latter returned to his assistant position in Manchester United.\n\nPeseiro signed with Sporting CP for 2004\u201305.\n\nAfter collecting three losses and two draws in his first nine games in charge, the side eventually finished in third place with 61 points, four behind champions S.L. Benfica.\n\nHe coached the team to a runner-up run in the UEFA Cup after disposing of the likes of Feyenoord, Middlesbrough and Newcastle United.\n\nThe final was played at the Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade, and after a 1\u20130 lead at half-time the hosts eventually succumbed to PFC CSKA Moscow 3\u20131.\n\nAt the start of the 2005\u201306 season, the Lions were ousted from the UEFA Champions League by Udinese Calcio, and after being relegated to the UEFA Cup they were immediately knocked out by Halmstads BK 4\u20134 on aggregate after a 2\u20133 home loss.\n\nOn October 16, 2005, following a 0\u20131 home defeat to Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra that saw Sporting sink to the seventh position, Peseiro resigned.\n\nIn the 2007 off-season, Peseiro was named manager of Panathinaikos FC.\n\nAfter failing to win the Super League Greece and also losing 0\u20134 to neighbouring Olympiacos F.C. in the domestic cup, he was forced to step down.\n\nIn June 2008, Peseiro signed a three-year contract with Romanian club FC Rapid Bucure\u0219ti.\n\nOn October 2, 2008, after being eliminated from the UEFA Cup by VfL Wolfsburg, he was sacked only to be reinstated a few days later.\n\nHe eventually resigned on January 12, 2009, after failing to agree on a new deal.\n\nPeseiro succeeded Nasser Al-Johar at the helm of the Saudi Arabian national team in 2009, during the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nHis first game occurred on 28 March, and it ended with a 2\u20131 away win over Iran which was the former\u2019s first ever victory in that country and the latter\u2019s first loss in nearly 40 home games.\n\nEventually, the nation failed to reach the finals in South Africa, and on January 10, 2011 he was relieved of his duties after losing the first game in the AFC Asian Cup against Syria.\n\nOn June 3, 2012, Peseiro was appointed at S.C. Braga.\n\nHis first major signing was Portuguese international R\u00faben Micael, and he qualified the club to the group stage of the Champions League for the second time in its history, after ousting Udinese on penalties.\n\nAt the end of the campaign, in spite of winning the Ta\u00e7a da Liga and ranking fourth in the league, Braga and Peseiro reached an agreement to terminate the manager\u2019s contract.\n\nFrom November 11, 2013 to January 11, 2015, Peseiro worked with Al Wahda FC in the UAE Pro League.\n\nOn October 9, 2015, Al Ahly SC announced his signing; upon hearing the news, fans protested against the decision based on his weak r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nOn January 18, 2016, after cutting ties with the Egyptian side, Peseiro replaced Julen Lopetegui at FC Porto.\n\nEven though the third position the team occupied at the time of the Spaniard\u2019s dismissal was still secured, he collected more losses than his predecessor, and also lost the final of the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal to former team Braga, on penalties.\n\nOn June 6, 2016, Peseiro signed a two-year deal with Braga.\n\nOn December 14, 2016, following consecutive home defeats that resulted in elimination from the Europa League and the Portuguese Cup, respectively at the hands of FC Shakhtar Donetsk (2\u20134) and S.C. Covilh\u00e3 (1\u20132), he was fired.\n\nPeseiro returned to the UAE in January 2017 with Sharjah FC, and was sacked nine months later after a poor start to the new season.\n\nThe following February, he went home to sign a contract at Vit\u00f3ria S.C. until June 2019, which he rescinded by mutual agreement a year early.\n\nIn July 2018, Peseiro returned to Sporting after 13 years away, assuming the reins at a club that had lost several key players following fan violence and whose previous manager Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107 lasted nine days in the job.\n\nOn November 1, 2018, following poor overall performances and a 1\u20132 home loss against G.D. Estoril Praia for the group stage of the Ta\u00e7a da Liga, he was relieved of his duties.\n\nPeseiro returned to national team duties on February 4, 2020, being appointed by Venezuela after the resignation of Rafael Dudamel.\n\nHe made his debut on October 9, 2020 in a 3\u20130 loss away to Colombia in 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification.\n\nAt the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Brazil, Venezuela were eliminated from the group stage with two draws and two defeats.\n\nHe resigned in August, having not been paid for over a year amidst the South American country\u2019s economic crisis.",

So far, I believe that all the indications for the conduct of the national convention of our party are positive.\n\n\u201cThe Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum and Governor of Kebbi State, Alhaji Atiku Bagudu had earlier disclosed after his meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House that the convention will hold in February 2022.\n\n\u201cThis is enough time for the states that are yet to hold their congresses at the State level to do so. The APC reconciliation committee is also working round the clock going from state to state to find solutions to all grievances either before or after the congress.\n\n\u201cSo, I am optimistic that we are on the right course, and the convention will be a success come February 2022.\u201d\n\nMusa said he is prepared to leave the Senate for the national party secretariat, if chosen as chairman.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe desire to be for everyone is one of the cardinal reasons that sees me aspiring for the head of the All Progressives Congress.\n\nBefore I was elected a senator, I have worked in the public and private sectors. I have been a leader in the APC since 2014 and served as a member of the National Executive Committee (NEC) from 2019 to date.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the antecedents, you will notice the consistency. As a serving senator and Chairman Committee on Senate Services. I have served my people well as a first term Senator, and it has been an amazing experience.\n\n\u201cSo, my interest in the chairmanship of our great party, the APC is another call to national service just like my current position as a Senator of the Federal Republic.\n\n\u201cAs Chairman of the APC, I can leverage on my experience here in the Senate to push the manifesto of the party to the National Assembly more efficiently.\n\n\u201cIt will also give me vantage position to deliver reconciliatory leadership which the party needs now to navigate out of its present challenges. And my leadership of the party will reinforce our commitment to keep the towering legacy and leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, whom has given our party an ideology and presence in the international community, his democratic ideals and work within the sub-region and Africa, fight against corruption and his efforts at providing security.\n\n\u201cHence, the need to have a leader that will continue to give full support and attention to such progressive efforts.

          "text": "World Health Organisation (WHO) Director General, Tedros Ghebreyesus, has expressed optimism that COVID-19 pandemic will end in 2022.\n\nGhebreyesus said at a press briefing on Wednesday that it was two years ago, as people gathered for New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations, that a new global threat emerged.\n\nSince then, 1.8 million deaths were recorded in 2020 and 3.5 million in 2021, but the actual number is much higher. There are also millions of people dealing with long-term consequences from the virus.\n\nRight now, Delta and Omicron variants are driving up cases to record numbers, leading to spikes in hospitalisation and deaths.\n\nGhebreyesus said he was \u201chighly concerned\u201d that the more transmissible Omicron, circulating at the same time as Delta, is leading to \u201ca tsunami of cases.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEarlier in 2020, during meetings of the world\u2019s biggest economies \u2013 the G7 and G20 \u2013 WHO challenged leaders to vaccinate 40 per cent of their populations by the end of 2021 and 70 per cent by the middle of 2022.\n\nWith only a couple of days left in the year, 92 out of 194 member states missed the target.\n\nThe WHO boss attributed this to low-income countries receiving a limited supply for most of the year and then subsequent vaccines arriving close to expiry, without key parts, like syringes.\n\n\u201cForty per cent was doable. It\u2019s not only a moral shame, it cost lives and provided the virus with opportunities to circulate unchecked and mutate,\u201d he said.\n\nGhebreyesus warned that boosters in rich countries could cause low-income countries to again fall short and called on leaders of wealthy countries and manufacturers to work together to reach the 70 per cent goal by July.\n\n\u201cThis is the time to rise above short-term nationalism and protect populations and economies against future variants by ending global vaccine inequity.\n\n\u201cWe have 185 days to the finish line of achieving 70 per cent by the start of July 2022. And the clock starts now,\u201d he said\n\nEarly on, the director-general acknowledged that beating the new health threat would require science, solutions, and solidarity.\n\nElaborating on some successes, such as the development of new vaccines, which he said \u201crepresent a scientific masterclass\u201d, the WHO official lamented that politics too often triumphed over solidarity.\n\n\u201cPopulism, narrow nationalism and hoarding of health tools, including masks, therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines, by a small number of countries undermined equity, and created the ideal conditions for the emergence of new variants,\u201d he said.\n\nMoreover, misinformation and disinformation, have also been \u201ca constant distraction, undermining science and trust in lifesaving health tools\u201d.\n\nHe highlighted as a case in point that huge waves of infections have swept Europe and many other countries causing the unvaccinated to die disproportionally.\n\nThe unvaccinated are many times more at risk of dying from either variant.\n\nAs the pandemic drags on, new variants could become fully resistant to current vaccines or past infection, necessitating vaccine adaptations.\n\nFor Ghebreyesus, as any new vaccine update could mean a new supply shortage, it is important to build up local manufacturing supply.\n\nOne way to increase production of life-saving tools, he said, is to pool technology, as in the new WHO Bio Hub System, a mechanism to voluntarily share novel biological materials.\n\nHe also pointed to the new WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence, based in Berlin, Gerrmany.\n\nGhebreyesus called for the development of a new accord between nations, saying it would be \u201ca key pillar\u201d of a world better prepared to deal with the next disease.\n\n\u201cI hope to see negotiations move swiftly and leaders to act with ambition,\u201d he said.",

And I was speaking at that time as the chairman of the governors\u2019 forum,\u201d Amaechi said.\n\nHowever, Chidoka, in a statement titled \u2018Gov. Amaechi\u2019s Statement on 2015 Foreign Reserve: Setting the Records Straight,\u2019 accused Amaechi of deliberately feeding Nigerians with lies to curry public favour for the Buhari administration even as he said the Jonathan administration handed over a $550 billion economy (largest in Africa and 26th globally) and a diversified economy to the Buhari administration.\n\n\u201cAs a member of the Federal Executive Council that handed over to the current administration, I am disturbed that this urban myth of \u2018empty treasury\u2019 is still the subject of conversation by a senior government member.\n\n\u201cAlso, I am confused about what the Honourable Minister means when he says, \u201cBy the time we came in,\u201d as he was not appointed minister until six months after the May 29 Handover. Since he was not a minister on the handover date, it may be pertinent to present him with the facts again.\n\n\u201cOn May 29, 2015, President Buhari inherited a foreign reserve of $28.6 billion, according to official data still present on the website of the Central Bank of Nigeria, as well as $5.6 billion Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas Limited dividends. Also, a 2015 budget of over N4 trillion was handed over to the incoming administration by the outgoing Jonathan government.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the Jonathan administration left a total of $2.2 billion in the Excess Crude Account on May 29, 2015. (As verified by the Ministry of Finance both by the immediate past minister and the incumbent).\n\n\u201cTo further create context, I would like the Minister of Transport to note the country\u2019s economic indices after 1849 days of President Jonathan\u2019s Presidency from May 06 2010, the date he took over from President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua to the Handover date of May 29, 2015.\n\n\u201cOn May 29, 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari inherited an economy that, by the testimony of the World Investment Report, prepared by the Geneva-based United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), was the number one destination for foreign direct investment in Africa. In the five years of President Jonathan, Direct Foreign Investment stood at about 35.25 Billion Dollars. You can compare this to the 11.55 Billion Dollars Direct Foreign Investment received from 2016 to 2020.\n\n\u201cThe Jonathan administration handed over a $550 billion economy (largest in Africa and 26th globally) and a diversified economy. On May 29, 2015, President Jonathan left behind an economy with a stable currency, where the Naira exchanged for N199 to $1, and Nigeria had a single-digit inflation rate. Today, after 2,406 days of the current administration, headline inflation rate hovers above 15 per cent.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

According to the National Bureau of Statistics, six and half years after Governor Amaechi\u2019s government came in, unemployment is 33 per cent.\n\n\u201cBefore the government came in, Nigeria\u2019s poverty rate was 32 per cent as of May 2015. We need not compare it against 71 per cent today after 78 months of President Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cOur External debt as of May 2015 stood at $7.3 billion, the Gini coefficient (degree of inequality) was not different from China\u2019s as of 2015. In 343 weeks and four days of the current administration, our external debt has ballooned to $37.9 billion as of September 2021. It is important to point out that over 48 per cent are bilateral and commercial loans.\n\nWith the facts above, I am sure that the Minister of Transport will rethink his fixation on the past and focus on the clear and present danger of an economy on the path to Argentina \u2013 sovereign debt default.\n\n\u201cIn the face of declining revenues, available public data revealed that external debt servicing gulped $1.82 billion between January and September 2021; this is 43.9 per cent higher than the $1.27 billion spent in the corresponding period of 2020.\n\n\u201cIn the same period of January to September 2021, Domestic debt servicing rose to N1.74 trillion from N1.53 trillion recorded in the same period of 2020.\n\nThese issues should worry the Honourable Minister, coupled with unlocking the asphyxiating gridlock that Apapa port has created in the economy.\n\n\u201c2,406 days after, a clear 557 days (One year five months) more than President Jonathan governed Nigeria; this administration\u2019s economic policies and heightened insecurity have left the country comatose.\n\n\u201cMinister Amaechi and the APC government should stop this perennial blame game and focus on redeeming its tattered image by signing the electoral bill passed by a legislature it controls.\u201d",

          "text": "From Laide Raheem, Abeokuta\n\nFormer president, Olusegun Obasanjo, yesterday, knocked leader of the Ijaw nation, Chief Edwin Clark, over his recent claim that oil in the Niger Delta belongs to the region.\n\nHe said Clark\u2019s ownership claim amounted to having two sovereign entities within a state, which is impossible.\n\nThe leader of the Pan Niger Delta Forum and chairman of the Board of Trustees, Ijaw National Congress (INC), had in a letter titled, \u201cMy Disappointment Over Unprovoked Outburst Against The People of Niger Delta Region\u201d accused Obasanjo of resenting the people of the region.\n\nHis comments came after Obasanjo allegedly attacked Ebipamowei Wodu, national secretary of INC over resource control at a recent peace meeting.\n\nClark said section 140 of the 1963 constitution provided that a natural resource found in a region is to be controlled by the people of the area.\n\nHowever, Obasanjo said the provision did not imply that resources found in any region belongs to the people there.\n\n\u201cMy dear chief, where in this constitutional provision is it said or implied that minerals located in any part of Nigeria belongs to that location? For emphasis and to further buttress the point, the provision is even in the Exclusive List \u2013 exclusively reserved to the Federal Government,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former president said it was wrong and unconstitutional for Clark and the people of Niger Delta to lay claim to crude oil or any mineral resources, saying, \u201cno territory in Nigeria including the minerals found therein belongs to the area of location and this remains so until the federation is dissolved.\u201d\n\nHe expressed disappointment over Clark\u2019s deployment of \u201coffensive and uncouth\u201d languages which according to him are unbecoming of a leader of Clark\u2019s status to describe him.\n\nThe former president declared that Nigeria and Niger Delta demand in Clark, a statesman and not a tribesman, just as he cautioned the Ijaw nation leader against deploying \u201coffensive and uncouth languages\u201d to describe his personality.\n\n\u201cSome of the languages you (Clark) have deployed to describe me in your letter are offensive, uncouth and totally and completely rejected them. I am not inconsistent, hypocritical, unstatesman and nor am I anybody\u2019s lackey.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cYou use your own yardstick to judge others. I fear God and I respect those who respect themselves and I hope it is about time you change from a tribesman to a statesman of character. That is what Nigeria and indeed the Region you profess to love demand of you at this stage.\n\n\u201cI believe one lesson that we all must appreciate that we have all learned in the last sixty-one years of our independence is that we all need to be civil to ourselves and occasionally put ourselves in the position of others.\n\n\u201cBad language does not show prudence, wisdom and maturity. I hope you will think and adjust. Negotiation achieves better results than dictation. I believe that we should be reformists rather than being pedantic with leave-it or take-it attitude\u201d, Obasanjo stated in the letter.\n\nThe letter read further: \u201cFor me, personally. I have never shown any anger or distraught with Nigeria Delta Region nor with any part or Region of Nigeria Rather, I have always picked points on leadership performance or policies and I will continue to do so.\n\n\u201cMy records before, during and after the civil war in Nigeria Delta Region was without blemish and it was all goodwill to all the people of Nigeria and especially the people of the Niger Delta Region which was my theatre of operation during the Nigerian civil war.\n\n\u201cI have always stood for equity and justice in our Federation and, for me tribe has to be suppressed for the state to emerge. And until the state emerges, Nigeria will not make the desired progress as tribesmen will always sacrifice state for tribe. This has always been my position and it will remain my position until breathe my last\u201d.\n\nOn allegation of double standard over resource control in the country, Obasanjo said: \u201cYou (Clark) cannot have two sovereign entities within a state which is what your position of Niger Delta ownership claim of the crude oil found in that location amounts to.\n\n\u201cThe territory of Nigeria is indivisible inclusive of the resources found therein. No territory in Nigeria including the minerals found therein belongs to the area of location and this remains so until the federation is dissolved.\n\n\u201cThis is the position of the Nigerian Constitution and international law. If there is a threat of violence to any part of Nigeria today, including the Niger Delta, it is the Nigerian military backed by any other machinery that can be procured or established at the Federal level that will respond to any such threat. In principle and practice, the position taken on the location of mineral resources in any part of Nigeria is the legal and constitutional position.\n\n\u201cMay I also recall the adjunct position I proposed that equity and justice demand that those domiciled in these locations are entitled to more of the material benefits accruing from the crude oil or other minerals. At the end of the day, it may transpire that our linguistic differences on this matter are no more than semantics. And we stand on the same logic with respect to the criminal mining of gold deposits in Zamfara State today or any other State in Nigeria or any other part of Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "Experts involved in the killing of the Santa Barbara Wellhead in Nembe, Bayelsa State, have insisted that it was impossible for a wing valve installed on a wellhead to become detached so abruptly, noting that the type of action could only have been achieved if the facility was tampered with by unauthorised persons.\n\nThe wing valve is a piece of flow-control equipment used in oil and gas operations and is part of a Christmas tree used to shut in flow from an oil well.\n\nThe professionals argued that only deliberate interference with the equipment could have enabled a disruption to its normal functions.\n\nThe spillage which has now been stopped, the engineers stated, could only have occurred because the device was tampered with.\n\nThey spoke to further amplify pronouncements made by the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) and the National Oil Spills Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), two critical federal agencies which earlier linked the leak to sabotage, offering further clarification on the possible cause of the spillage.\n\nDuring a Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) to the Santa Barbara River, Nembe, both organisations on the on-site assessment of the wellhead, had agreed that the wing valve would have been tampered with by yet unknown persons, leading to the leak that enabled the blowout to occur with such intensity.\n\nRepresentative of the NURPC, Adetoyinbo Adeyemi, said the physical examination of the failed wellhead, from an engineering point of view, indicated that the pressure from the equipment was not of a sufficient level to cause a blowout leading to the type of consequence.\n\nHe said the wind valve is designed to withstand extremely high pressure and could not have failed if it had not been tampered with, explaining that the fact that the facility was not even producing, the internal well pressure would have been quite low at the time.\n\n\u201cWe are here to establish the cause of the incident that happened at the Santa Barbara Well 1. From the findings, you can see there\u2019s no spill anymore. Where the spill came out from is from the wing valve.\n\n\u201cThe wing valve has been replaced now. That means, the wing valve, the way it was, is not designed to fail like that because there are bolts surrounding it, well designed to keep the pressure in place.\n\n\u201cSo, if it had not been taken off, there is no way it could have moved from there. When it was reported initially, there was no valve in that place, and none was found. So, to us, it is an act of sabotage,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, before the well\u2019s assembly was designed, it was done to take care of any pressure from the well, insisting that the fact that the well had not been producing for a long time, meant there was no pressure to take off the valve.\n\nNOSDRA\u2019s Ismail Baba-Ahmed traced the leak to the same cause, stressing that from his expertise in fluid mechanics, his own physical examination at the site and his interactions with the wellhead experts who plugged the leak, only vandalism could have led to the blowout.\n\nHe explained that he had ascertained that the threading on the wellhead casing where the valve was removed, was not worn out, a situation that suggested the detachment of the valve was not caused by pressure.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nAnother NOSDRA representative, Olubunmi Akindele, also corroborated his colleague\u2019s position, although the Bayelsa State Government representatives had disputed the outcome of the investigation and had refused to append their signatures to the official JIV report.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf this thing wasn\u2019t worn out and it was a sudden thing, then it\u2019s a surge. In addition, if it had not been building for some time, it cannot come off suddenly. That corroborates what my colleague has said.\u201d\n\nChief Executive Officer of Kenyon International, the company which undertook the sealing of the leak, Victor Ekpenyong, in his comments, insisted that wing valves are designed to be sturdier than the pressure they are meant to withstand.\n\n\u201cIn seismic studies, before a well is designed or drilled, there\u2019s a lot of parameters that are put into consideration. One of them is the reservoir pressure. So, when the reservoir pressure is determined, the pressure that is going into the design for the well must be able to withstand the reservoir pressure.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way you have a reservoir pressure of 5,000 PSI and you design an equipment of 2,000 PSI. In fact, you design a higher PSI. There\u2019s no way you drill a well and the pressure will remove the Chrismas tree designed based on the seismic report.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s not correct to say the pressure from the reservoir pulled out the Chrismas tree. This well was not drilled by Aiteo, it was drilled by Shell. Shell is an international company with high reputation worldwide. Aiteo inherited the well from Shell.\n\n\u201cEverything that has to do with this well was well designed and taken care of. There\u2019s no chance that the pressure can pull out the valve. In industry best practices, a well needs first line and second line maintenance. Aiteo has a procedure which I have seen,\u201d he said.\n\nEkpenyong further explained that the stud the community alleged was tampered with in the process of fixing the leak was the anti-theft device and not the knot of the valve that was vandalised.\n\nGlobal Group Director/Coordinator, Asset Protection/Security Services and Community Matters, Aiteo, Andrew Oru, also reiterated that beyond emotions and sentiments, the facility had spilled about 16,000 barrels as against a loss two million barrels that has been vaunted by certain individuals.\n\n\u201cTotal barrels recovered is 16,000. Nobody in Aiteo said two million barrels had been recovered from this place and this place is not even capable of producing two million barrels in 20 years. That\u2019s not the position, not the science. Let\u2019s forget emotions and sentiments\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Aiteo engineer, Glory Odita, disclosed the well had been in existence for about 20 years, saying wing valves do not detach on their own.\n\nThe leak which was reported on November 5 was plugged on December 8.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Presidency, yesterday, gave reasons President Muhammadu Buhari withheld assent from Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, in a statement, said the Presidency took the decision in the best interest of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s decision to withhold assent from the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 has come under scrutiny from media and political circles. This is quite correct because it is a decision that will impact all Nigerians. The President\u2019s Office has decided, therefore, to issue an official statement to make its position clear. Nigeria\u2019s strength, as a nation and its status as one of the wealthiest economies in Africa with one of its highest standards of living, owes above all to its proud democratic processes, which are enshrined in the Electoral Act of 2010.\n\n\u201cIt is this act which the new bill seeks to amend. These amendments have been presented as a means to enhance and build upon our democratic processes. After careful review, the President\u2019s Office has found that the opposite is true. Rather, the proposed amendments entail significant legal, financial, economic and security consequences for all Nigerians, principal among which would be a severe spike in the cost of holding primary elections by parties \u2013 integral to democracies the world over. And who would shoulder these costs? The Nigerian taxpayer of course. And who would benefit? Only the richest of political parties.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cAt a time when the nation is seeking to extricate itself from the economic mire of the worst global health crisis in living memory, whatever other merits the new bill may have, now is not the time for such frivolous spending of public money. Inevitably, the usual voices are making themselves heard, with cynical claims of election rigging and so on. This is nothing new. We heard their self-serving cries of fraud in 2015, when we saw the first peaceful transfer of power in independent Nigeria\u2019s history. Then again in 2019, when President Buhari was re-elected with a lead of over three million. We will hear them again in 2023.\n\n\u201cUntil then, the president will do whatever he can to protect this county\u2019s democracy, and that includes withholding assent from this bill. It is worth noting that, as one of Nigeria\u2019s largest political parties, All Progressives Congress (APC) is one of those that stand to benefit from a bill that favours wealthier parties. But it is not the job of this government to protect the APC. It is the job of this government to protect Nigeria, her people and her democracy.\n\n\u201cTo those that would rather that limited public funds be spent on politicking during this time of global crisis, we say: cease these cynical games. Tell the Nigerian people openly what you want. Put your \u2013 or rather their \u2013 money where your mouth is.\u201d",
          "summary": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, AbujaThe Presidency, yesterday, gave reasons President Muhammadu Buhari withheld assent from Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\u201cThe president\u2019s decision to withhold assent from the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 has come under scrutiny from media and political circles.\n\u201cIt is this act which the new bill seeks to amend.\nOnly the richest of political parties.\n\u201cUntil then, the president will do whatever he can to protect this county\u2019s democracy, and that includes withholding assent from this bill.",

          "text": "A Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chief Mike Ozekhome, has disagreed with former President Olusegun Obasanjo over his statement that Niger Delta cannot lay claim to the crude oil found in the region.\n\nObasanjo had in a six-page letter to Niger Delta elder, Chief Edwin Clark noted that the constitution did not confer ownership of oil and other mineral resources on any of the then regions.\n\nMike Ozekhome\n\nHe insisted that just as the Niger Delta\u2019s oil belongs to the Nigerian federation, the minerals in other parts of the country also belonged to the country.\n\nReacting in a statement sent to SaharaReporters, Ozekhome said a law that \u201cliterally steals the resources of a people, punishing them with destruction of their only available aquatic and agrarian life, even though in the statute books, is a bad, aberrant and obnoxious law.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer said the Niger Delta region has been repressed, suppressed, marginalized and neglected.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cFormer president Olusegun Obasanjo has theorized that the oil and gas found in the Niger Delta region belong to the federal government, and not to the oil-bearing communities. Legally speaking, Obasanjo can be said to be correct, because he was part and parcel of successive military juntas that cleverly and systematically inserted expropriatory and inhuman laws concerning ownership of oil and gas into our statute books. But, does that make such laws right or justifiable? No. I think not.\n\n\u201cEx-president Obasanjo should be told in very clear terms that there is such an overriding principle of law which goes with the maxim of 'quic quid plantatatur solo solo cedit'. This literally means that whoever owns the land owns everything on top of it. Any extant constitutional or statutory provisions ( such as those apparently referred to by Obasanjo) that run contrary to this commonsensical common law principle are therefore nothing but bad, immoral, exproriatory and exploitative laws.\n\n\u201cHelp me inform Obasanjo that Nigeria operates a federal system of government, and that federalism is fiscal and plural. One of the major attributes of federalism is that it ensures that regions, sub-national or federating units develop according to their pace and needs, using the God-given resources that are available to such units.They pay tax to the central government.\n\n\u201cHelp me inform President Obasanjo that a law that literally steals the resources of a people, punishing them with destruction of their only available aquatic and agrarian life, even though in the statute books, is a bad, aberrant and obnoxious law.\n\n\u201cHelp me tell Obasanjo that in the USA, since oil was discovered in 1859, (a country whose Presidentialism and federalism we ape after), oil and gas are not owned by the American Federal government, but by the surface owners; while oil and gas offshore are owned either by states or federal government. Help me remind Obasanjo that before the January 15, 1967 first military putsch led by Major Kaduna Nzeogwu Chukwuma, neither the cotton, groundnut and hides and skin obtainable in the North, the cocoa grown in the West, Palm produce produced in the East; nor the rubber and timber that existed in the then Midwest, were said to belong to the federal government. They belonged to the regions that took a lion 50% share, while paying tax to the Federal government at the centre. What has changed? Nothing, I believe.\n\n\u201cHelp me remind Obasanjo to remember history, and that the major reason his 2005 Political Reform Conference failed was because of the rancor and rockus generated by the thorny and still unsolved controversy of resource control. He should remember that this led the South South delegates to stage a walkout from the conference. I was not only a Civil Society delegate, I was actually the head of the Civil Society unit that drafted our final committee report and recommendations.\n\n\u201cObasanjo should therefore not have dismissed such a festering thorny issue as oil and gas and bleeding oil-bearing communities with a wave of the hand in a most provocative and cavalier manner. The 1960 independence Constitution and the 1963 Republican Constitution had actually activated true fiscal federalism, after the 1957-1958 Willinks Commission Report which had identified and validated the fears of minorities within the Nigerian space.\n\n\u201cHelp me inform Obasanjo that the failure of the 1922 Hugh Clifford Constitution, 1946 Arthur Richards Constitution, 1951 Macpherson Constitution and 1954 Littleton Constitution, was partly ascribed to the overbearing influence of majority tribes over the minority ones (374 ethnic groups in Nigeria, according to Prof Onigu Otite).\n\n\u201cKindly emphasize to Obasanjo that as an Elderstatesman, former military Head of State and former democratic President, his well respected public statements and opinions (which he is constitutionally entitled to, should be generously garnished with unifying, healing, therapeutic and inclusive flavor ; and not with the vinegar of devisive and provocative statements.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta region has been repressed, suppressed, marginalized and neglected. Respected Obasanjo, more than any other person,knows this very well, having had the rare privilege of governing Nigeria both in khaki and agbada.The poor people have had to pay with their sweat, sorrow, tears,blood, pains and pangs, over their God-given wealth. The wealth has become a curse rather than a blessing. I wholly disagree with Obasanjo's thesis. I rather embrace wholly embrace Pa E.K.Clark's anthesis, which wears a human face.\u201d",

          "title": "Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem pays tribute to Nnena Nkongho",
          "text": "The African tech ecosystem mourns the passing of Nnena Nkongho, an African investor who championed diversity and excellence. Nkongho died on December 26, 2021.\n\nNkongho had over 15 years of experience in identifying, building, and capturing value for corporations and funds in Africa is the founding partner of Otundi Ventures, a pan-African early-stage fund. She was also a founding investor at Digital Growth Africa (DiGAME), one of Africa\u2019s earliest (2016) institutional venture investing organisations, which has deployed about $35 million in the series A/B rounds of high-growth, tech-enabled businesses including Getsmarter (exited to 2U, Inc.), SWVL, 10X Investments, and Rhino Safaris Africa.\n\nPrior to that, she was a founding team member at Nubuke Investments, a $75 million multi-strategy pan-African fund.\n\nOutside investing, she briefly worked as an African c-suite executive via her roles as the Head of Business Development, SOLO Phone Nigeria, and Head of Strategy & Business Development, Etisalat Nigeria.\n\nEarlier in her career, she spent seven years working at global financial services companies, Morgan Stanley (New York and Hong Kong) and at Merrill Lynch (London).\n\nNkongho was a Kauffman fellow, with an MBA from Columbia Business School and a B.A. from Princeton University.\n\nAs a Nigerian-American, Nkongho spent her formative years in the US, with occasional visits to Nigeria, especially to see her grandmother in eastern Nigeria. It was these visits that opened her eyes to the transformation that was taking place in Africa, making her shift her focus to working in the African investment space.\n\nNnena Nkogho by Kunmi Owopetu\n\nAn ardent believer in the power of technology, she explained why she eagerly supports the African tech ecosystem, in this interview.\n\n\u201cMy grandmother was a farmer in eastern Nigeria, but not a very [successful] one. She would wake up at the crack of dawn to fetch water. She would then carry large containers of water on her head to the rocky soil of her small plot of land. Over the past five years, I\u2019ve seen technology change the lives of smallholder farmers like my grandmother. I\u2019ve seen businesses use the mobile platform to offer value-added services\u2014provide loans for better seeds, automatically irrigate land, and find better markets (and pricing) for harvested goods. Technology-enabled investing can transform lives. To me, that\u2019s the most impactful thing that you can do.\u201d\n\nThe African and global technology ecosystem mourns the loss of their colleague, friend, peer, and mentor. As a way of remembering Nkongho\u2019s greatness and contribution to technology communities at home and abroad, TechCabal has been granted the opportunity to publish tributes sent to us by people who knew and worked with Nkongho during her lifetime. May her soul rest in eternal peace.\n\n(L-R) Nnena Nkongho, Principal, DiGAME; Taiwo Ketiku, VP Investments, EchoVC; Omobola Johnson; Senior Partner, TLcom and Osarumen Osamuyi, Founder, The SubTxt (Moderator) at TechCabal Townhall Mobility event.\n\nEghosa Omoigui, founder, EchoVC Partners\n\nAbsolutely devastated to hear of the passing of @NnenaP, an amazing woman, friend, investor, & long-time believer in & contributor to the African tech ecosystem.\n\n\n\nAs one of the few Black female @KauffmanFellows, she was a shining light to many.\n\n\n\nMy condolences to her family.#RIP \u2014 Eghosa Omoigui (@EghosaO) December 26, 2021\n\nIdris Bello, founder, LoftyInc\n\nVery early on as we were figuring out our Fund journey at LoftyInc Capital, a mutual friend intrigued me to Nnena who was then at Digame Investment. We met up and by the time we were done, she had shortened my VC journey, while sharing great insights from her own journey. Over the last year, I have kept tabs on her as she set up Otundi and worked harder than anyone I have seen to build her new fund. Hence, her death comes as a rude shock, especially at this opportune moment for venture capital on the African continent. On behalf of LoftyInc Capital, I offer my heartfelt condolences to Nnena\u2019s family and friends and the folks at Otundi. She will be missed.\n\nTomiwa Aladekomo, Big Cabal Media\n\nNnenna was a wonderful person, generous, cheerful and helpful to a fault. She was a close friend and supporter of our work at TechCabal, ready to offer advice, connections and knowledge whenever we asked it of her. She checked in on us and offered encouragement at those times when it was most needed. She will be greatly missed by us all. May she rest her peace and God comfort her family and loved ones.\n\nEmilian Popa \u2013 Ilara Health\n\nYou started out as a colleague and became a friend over the years. Your thoughtful advice and friendship will be missed. Rest in peace.\n\nKarim Shariff, Managing Partner, Majlis Investments\n\nNnena. What beautiful energy and willingness to listen to perspective. Her memory attached her to Africa. Her imagination will bring her back. A sense of culture, geography, and technology. Always tirelessly moving. We met, over the years, in New York, London, Dubai, and Nairobi. She knew these places intimately. I know I will miss her and her lens on everything.\n\nIyin Aboyeji, founder, Future Africa\n\nNnenna was a force of nature, a real one. She always had the courage to say what everyone was thinking but dreading to say. This was where we found a common cause. No one was ever in doubt of where they stood with her. Her impact in our industry was silent but potent. The Get Smarter deal is one for the ages. Our industry will miss her. May her soul Rest In Peace and may GOD give her family and friends the fortitude to bear the loss.\n\nSteven Grin, managing partner, Lateral Capital.\n\nNnena was a friend, colleague, and an intellectual sparring partner with no BS, in a world filled with so much fakery. She was relentlessly curious and had that rare combination of being strong and vulnerable at the same time. She was a trailblazer and deeply committed to the African tech ecosystem, especially at a time when most LPs did not believe in the asset clas. I know she was particularly excited about the work she was doing with Kauffman, her new fund, Otundi, and her support to emerging female managers. Being one of a few female general partners in our space, we have lost a real lion. I can only trust, somehow, that we will all continue in her honour, doing our part, to keep up the work.\n\nMari\u00e8me Diop \u2013 Orange Ventures.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few days since I heard the devastating news of Nnena\u2019s passing. I have been processing it since then\u2026, and after the tears, questions, sorrow, remembrance, and acceptance\u2026, it still hurts to know that she\u2019s gone forever.\n\nI liked Nnena very much. I met her almost five years ago. We hit it off straight away and have stayed in touch ever since. She was always supportive, enthusiastic, empathetic, and so hard-working. These past six months after she started Otundi Ventures, we had wonderful conversations once or twice a week, and she always had great insights on how to address the root cause of gender inequality and biases in our industry.\n\nShe fought hard not only to get a seat at the table but to build her own and hence forge a path for women investors in Africa.\n\nNnena cared about people. She loved the arts and creative minds. Even when she was very busy, we sent each other encouraging messages, and she was always advising me to take care of myself. I am glad that she knew how much I valued her, which I told her for the umpteenth time in our last conversation, a few days before she left this world. Nnena, you will be really missed, and I will continue to hold you warmly in my heart. Rest in peace, my friend. My deepest condolences to her family and friends.\n\nWale Ayeni \u2013 IFC | World Bank Group\n\nThis is difficult to write. Nnena was a giant. She was ebullient, extremely dedicated, and cared deeply about Africa. Her passion for the ecosystem and for founders was palpable, and I will miss our hour-long conversations on the ecosystem. I, and we, have lost a colleague and trusted friend. Her energy is irreplaceable. We will miss you Nnena, and we won\u2019t forget.\n\nIK Kanu, founding partner, Atlantica Ventures\n\nNnena was always real to me and everyone that met her. She was always positive, smiling, and quick to lend an ear or hand. We met years ago, and strengthened our friendship during our Kauffman Fellowship. She was strong, confident, yet humble and kind. Always laughing and looking forward to better days ahead. Rest well with God my dear friend.\n\nRomain Diaz \u2013 Founder & CEO, Satgana\n\nI am deeply saddened that my mentor, Nnena P. Nkongho, has left this world. I met Nnena five years ago in Cape Town, and she has been one of the most important people in my professional development ever since. From a mentor, she became a friend, advisor, and confidant.\n\nI am profoundly grateful for all the countless hours that she selflessly spent to help me figure things out, solve problems, strategise, and grow.\n\nEvery hour I spent with her equated to months of accelerated development, thanks to the right blend that she always brought between validating me and challenging me. She is the one who pushed me to pursue a vision that later gave birth to Satgana. She believed in me when I sometimes didn\u2019t. I wish all entrepreneurs out there find their own Nnena.\n\nIf anything, as I have been told by another dear friend and business partner, I should honour her by making this company as successful as she believed it would become. Thank you for everything, Nnena. You\u2019ll leave a hole in my life and those around you.\n\nRest in peace. Much love.\n\nNnena Nkongho.\n\nArun Iyer \u2013 Alpha Direct Insurance\n\nNnena was an incredibly astute individual and investor. In the brief time in which I got to know her and the interactions we had, she became a friend and partner, giving me advice and being open, honest, and straightforward about everything she did, every interaction we had. She gave me the inspiration to aim higher and push harder because she believed in us founders as much as we believed in ourselves. She understood our business so quickly and well, and she had an incredible ability to be forthright and candid while staying supportive and encouraging. She thought like a founder, and her optimism and enthusiasm were infectious.\n\nWe lost a true gem of a human being. It\u2019s a big loss for the entire African technology ecosystem and the world at large. May her soul rest in eternal peace, and I pray for her family and loved ones to find the strength and courage to deal with her loss.\n\nCraig McLeod \u2013 Box Commerce\n\nNnena Nkongho was one of the greatest champions of the African tech ecosystem as a VC, leader, pioneer and, hands down, one of its smartest players. She was a great mentor, friend and peer. In an ecosystem of only a handful of giants, she stood tall. She will be missed.\n\nLeonard Stiegeler \u2013 Founder, Pulse Africa\n\nI was deeply saddened to hear of Nnenna\u2019s passing.\n\nShe was a kind, joyous, and thoughtful person that I was lucky to meet in different places around Africa & in the UAE, over the years. Every time we met, we had great discussions and I left smarter than I had come.\n\nNnenna\u2019s impact in the African technology and venture capital space will live on. Her support for entrepreneurs, businesses, and industries will facilitate opportunities for young people and economies for generations to come.\n\nMy thoughts are with her loved ones and friends.\n\nIbrahim Sagna \u2013 AFREXIMBANK\n\nSome people show up in your life and leave without notice, not realising how they have impacted you. Such individuals are so consumed by their mission to share what they know that they are not counting or keeping tabs of their impact. Instead, they remain busy improving other people\u2019s lives. Rumi\u2014Persian poet and philosopher\u2014reminds us that, \u201ca candle never loses any of its light while lighting up another candle\u201d.\n\nNnena Nkongho is such a candle. She is that sister who comes into your life without notice; that missionary who enlightens you with the breadth of her knowledge and network in African tech investment and leaves you forever impacted. I had just moved to Cairo, and in one small trip, she had managed to plug me into the local ecosystem and left me at first curious, then ultimately full of passion for the sector and its players.\n\nThe reality is that Nnena was not just remarkable because of her knowledge, network, or dedication to startups. She was remarkable because her fundamental character combined humility and ingenuity on the one hand, and calmness and a zest for life on the other. She gave and gave. She was selfless. We will all miss a phenomenal human.\n\nHer departure leaves many of us in shock. May she rest in perfect peace. Hereby extending our most sincere condolences to her family.\n\nSamer Salty, Managing Partner, Zouk Capital\n\nYou could always tell you are in the presence of a gentle soul when you are speaking with Nnena. She always cared about people, regardless of their walk of life. For her, doing good is good business. It was a great pleasure to have worked with her and known her. We will miss you, Nnena.\n\nIdo Sum, Andreata, and the TLcom team\n\nWe met Nnena first in 2013, through a mutual friend at Kuramo, one of Africa\u2019s very first fund of funds. She was just out of Columbia Business School, helping Africa founders in the very early days of the African tech ecosystem, and keen to play a role in its formation. Our first chat was a sign for the years to come. She was a super open, honest, smart, nice, deliberate, and driven person.\n\nWe remained friends, and over the years after she joined DiGAME, started sharing investment opportunities and insights with each other. Nnena was a voice we listened to. Grounded, rounded, thoughtful, and most importantly, in the early days of African tech, a true optimist.\n\nIn the coming years, our paths crossed many more times. Drinks in Cape Town, dinners in Kigali, Zooms, WhatsApp messages\u2026 She was always keen to collaborate. She was full of good humour and lightened the load of life with a good laugh. When Nnena decided to launch her own fund, we couldn\u2019t have been happier. A women-led team, with a great perspective of the scene\u2019s evolvement and exits expertise, nothing could stand in her way.\n\nOur last catch up was just a few weeks back. As always, future-looking, with her eyes set to conquer the next summit ahead. Little did we know at that time\u2026\n\nWe stand broken-hearted at the loss of one of our true friends in this journey. Nnena will forever be in our hearts. A true leader, early visionary and, above all, a mensch. You will forever be in our hearts.\n\nRaj Kulasingam, Senior Counsel, Dentons\n\nI met Nnena many years ago when venture in Africa was a desert. Since then, whenever we met, I was always struck by her warmth, genuineness, and willingness to share her experience and knowledge.\n\nHer passing will be felt by many I know. I hope we can remember her not only for the contributions she made but also for her warmth and humanity.\n\nStephan Breban, CEO, Giants\u2019 Shoulders Capital Limited\n\nThe first thing to say is that this has hit me far more than I expected. Maybe because she was always so full of life. I\u2019ve lost people closer to me, and in the current environment, it should not be too shocking. But this is. I know many people know her and remember her fondly. There will be many tributes to her intelligence and general investment and tech brilliance, and so I\u2019m going for another angle. I\u2019m going to share my favourite memory of Nnena. We met many times in many different cities, and she would always know the best spot for coffee. She was a proper authority. The first time I met her in London, I knew I had to do something special. No coffee was ever going to impress her, so I took her here, a Victorian urinal that had been converted to a coffee shop. Not sure I can say she loved it, but I made an impression! If you ever get to London, please visit Fitzrovia, have a coffee there, and try to imagine Nnena\u2019s reaction.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ask an Investor: Twelve insights from Africa\u2019s top investors",
          "text": "At one point or the other, every startup founder or CEO was a newbie in navigating the murky waters of institutional investment. They maybe even got burnt because they didn\u2019t know the right questions to ask, or what to look out for.\n\nSo, we started the Ask an Investor series to help explain why and how investments in companies happen in Africa from the people who make them happen.\n\nIn the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed over 20 investors who\u2019ve shared their thoughts on what investors look out for in founders and startups before investing, the lessons learnt and mistakes made, key trends, and other relevant nuggets.\n\nI\u2019ll be highlighting a few insights from the published interviews here and think you should read the full version of the interviews.\n\nFounders Factory: A hands-on approach\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that I learnt early on from my conversations with different investors, it\u2019s that all investors are not the same. Their approach to investing is often influenced by their background and experiences. While most people easily associate investors with just money, Founders Factory Africa (FFA) would rather have you think of more.\n\nIn a conversation with Sam Sturm, one of the founding partners of FFA, he explains why:\n\n\u201cWe believe that capital isn\u2019t the only way to support a business. You need it so that you can execute but at the end of the day, capital isn\u2019t what solves problems. We believe that the challenges of product-market fit, customer acquisition, or retention are not the kind of challenges that capital alone can solve. Those are the challenges that you\u2019re looking to entrepreneurs to solve, that you\u2019re looking to the team to solve. If you can supplement them with experienced and talented people, you\u2019d be successful.\u201d\n\nAlongside providing capital, FFA is a venture building studio, this means that a portfolio startup can expect to get support from private coaches, product managers, product designers, etc.\n\nMicrotraction: A novel approach\n\nFive years ago, Yele Bademosi saw that it was difficult for people to raise funds if they didn\u2019t have a wealthy relative or network, so he set out to make it easier for founders to raise money.\n\nBut first, the Microtraction team had to do away with the status quo. This meant no batches, no programmes, and no demo days. Microtraction invested on the go.\n\nAnother different thing about Microtraction\u2019s approach is its bias for investing in startups with technical founders/co-founders. Why?\n\n\u201cIf we give you money, and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders.\u201d Bademosi explained. \u201cWe\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\u201d\n\nAcumen: Patient capital\n\nThe original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. So Acumen goes a step further beyond providing donations and grants to startups. It\u2019s a non-profit that uses donations received to invest in startups working on socially relevant issues.\n\nMeghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen, explained this: \u201cIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen, and we redeploy and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\u201d\n\nAcumen is able to invest at an early stage and wait a little longer than other traditional venture capital firms because they don\u2019t have to return the money back to donors.\n\nSawari Ventures: North Africa\u2019s leading VC firm\n\n2021 was an exciting year for North Africa as it garnered a lot of attention and funding. Before the boom, Sawari Ventures, which was founded over a decade ago, has been backing North African startups. The founders of Sawari Ventures also founded Flat6Labs\u2014the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator.\n\nIn our conversation, Tamer Azer explained the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup.\n\n\u201cVC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime. They have a 10-year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing, and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\n\u201cJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing cheques, we have to get the money to be able to write these cheques first. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these cheques. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\u201d\n\nUnconventional Capital: Removing gut feelings and bias in startup investment\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of my conversation with Franziska Reh, CEO of Unconventional Capital, I understood why the word \u201cunconventional\u201d was befitting.\n\nHere\u2019s how early-stage investment mostly happens: An investor and an ambitious entrepreneur get talking. After a few background checks and business plan conversations, the investor decides whether to invest. But not before checking their gut feeling. Along the way the investor is constantly asking, \u201cDoes this feel right?\u201d\n\nAt Uncap, the team decided to flip this approach upside down by relying on algorithms to make these decisions.\n\nReh explained, \u201cAt Uncap, in our investment process, no one in our team makes investment decisions. The selection process is based on an algorithm that focuses very much on the potential of the entrepreneur. It\u2019s a model that measures entrepreneurial potential as a predictor of future success. Afterwards, we invest through a standardised model.\u201d\n\nThis model allows Uncap to invest in thousands of entrepreneurs. Interestingly, Uncap exits the portfolio companies gradually over a period of time\u2014an unconventional exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThese companies we invest in buy back their equity through 5% of their quarterly revenues. They transfer 5% of their quarterly revenues to us. By this act, over time, they buy back the whole investment, plus the price that we\u2019ve paid before. It\u2019s a fixed multiple on the investment, it\u2019s basically the same for everyone.\u201d\n\nTomi Davies: Tales of an African angel Investor\n\nThe conversation with Tomi Davies, or TD as he\u2019s fondly called, started off with him explaining how he was able to partner with some of the brightest minds on the continent to build the angel investment space in Africa. He was part of the team that started the Lagos Angel Network and the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nWhile many know TD for his role in the African Angel community, but he\u2019s more than that.\n\n\u201cI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, and sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum,\u201c Davies said.\n\nHe also shared his proprietary framework for investing in startups.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\n\u201cFinally, you ask: is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also, is the business model sustainable? Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\u201d\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: Angel investor and startup advisor\n\nWhen I visited Ghana in July, Ato Bentsi-Enchill was one of the people I met. One thing that stood out to me was that he moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did he learn all these?\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network.\u201d Bentsi-Enchill explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\u201d\n\nAs a startup advisor, he helps African startups raise capital and protects them from difficult investors. In our conversation, he cites some instances where he\u2019s helped.\n\n\u201cFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts\u2014a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\u201d\n\nAdam Molai: African industrialist\n\nZimbabwe is known more for the Victoria Falls (the largest waterfall in the world) than its tech ecosystem, but still, Adam Molai is one of the few investors looking to change that.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice, and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and, through the Jua Fund, has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove, and many others.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye, he shared one of the best practices startups should adopt in getting funded.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund, this is what I must put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\u201d\n\nSunu Capital: A pan-African fund with a solo general partner\n\nSince Benjamin Schmerler left the United States at the age of 18, he\u2019s lived and worked in nearly every corner of the globe. Interestingly, he stumbled on the name for his firm\u2014SUNU Capital\u2014 while in Senegal.\n\nHe heard the word sunu in a song, and when he found out that it meant \u201cour\u201d, it resonated with him. \u201cI used it as the name of my firm because it\u2019s a simple word and, more importantly, because I believe in collective effort; working together to build more wealth for everyone and leave this planet a better place for our children,\u201d Schmerler said.\n\nOne thing he\u2019s been thinking about recently is how to aggregate African markets.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is how to break the borders between countries so we can get a larger aggregated market that can be efficiently served. I believe if we can do this, we would see exits on a scale beyond anything we have seen to date.\n\n\u201cI talk to entrepreneurs all the time and they show me the total addressable market (TAM) of Africa, a map of 54 countries. They hint at the possibility of expansion, and I\u2019m thinking, how do we unlock Gabon? What does it take to be a part of Cameroon as well? There is so much untapped potential all over the continent that I am absolutely excited by infrastructure that turns the 4 or 5 markets where all the activity is happening into 10, 20, 30 countries over the next handful of years.\u201d\n\nKepple Africa: Creating new industries\n\nA few minutes into our conversation, Satoshi Shinada reminded me that I need to visit more African countries. At the age of 18, he left Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years.\n\nFor Kepple Africa Ventures, the big vision is to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nIn our conversation, Shinada shared some mistakes he\u2019s made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything, and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\n\u201cAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\u201d\n\nLoftyInc: Not playing by the rules of VC investing\n\nIn 2012, Idris Bello and his partners, then in their early 30s, left their lucrative jobs and raided their savings to create the LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund. Over the years, through trials and errors, they\u2019ve seen some level of success. Today, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella.\n\nBello, who believes in sharing a full picture of his investor journey, shared some notable deals missed or mistakes made along the way.\n\n\u201cThose are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process there. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\n\u201cMost of the mistakes we made were as a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 cheque. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\u201d\n\nCapria ventures: Backing local funds and startups\n\nFive years ago, Jack Knellinger, Dave Richards and Will Poole formed Capria ventures, an investment firm that started out investing in local funds (VC firms) across the global south\u2014Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Recently, Capria Ventures has begun investing directly in startups, providing the much needed growth stage capital for them.\n\nToday, Capria Ventures has investment activity in about 50 countries with $650 million worth of current assets under management.\n\nIn my conversation with Jack Knellinger, he enlightened me on how they support VC firms\u2014a subject rarely spoken about.\n\n\u201cObviously, the main thing top of mind is fundraising\u2014helping them close their fundraising. Here, it involves everything from introductions to reviewing pitch materials. We look at how the funds are being positioned as well as the terms and negotiations with limited partners to ensure there\u2019s alignment between the fund managers, general partners, and limited partners.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the fundraising is done, we move to portfolio management. How are they putting in place the right systems and processes to grow, scale, and institutionalise the firm? Here, there\u2019s a wide range of things to be done in that regard, from team development to appropriately conducting due diligence before investing. When the fund managers have built up their portfolio of companies, we move to how they think about exits. What\u2019s the right time to exit? Do they want to look at partial exits?\n\nWhen a firm has mastered these aspects and gone on to raise multiple funds. We look at how they\u2019re telling the story of the firm and the funds you\u2019ve managed.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all for this year! Thank you to all the investors who took their time to talk to me and help others learn more about investing in startups.\n\nWhich investors/firms will you like me to talk to in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "GetEquity is changing startup investment in Africa. But how?",
          "text": "GetEquity, a Nigeria-based investment platform, came into the market with the mantra of \u201cchallenging the status quo of startup financing and venture capital\u201d in Africa. The company says it wants to make funding easy and quick for African startups, and at the backend of it, help common people have a bite of the booming startup ecosystem.\n\nLooking back at its activities, that mantra doesn\u2019t seem like a mere marketing play, the startup is indeed walking the talk. But how is it doing that?\n\nCo-founded by Jude Dike, William Okafor, and Temitope Ekundayo, and launched in July this year, GetEquity is a product of a series of iterations. Initially, the co-founders didn\u2019t set out to democratise startup investment in Africa. In fact, Dike and Okafor, who are blockchain engineers, were building a blockchain exchange platform, and Temitope was working around a big data analytics product. But, on getting into the Mozilla Accelerator, the trio realised that they could \u201cmerge forces\u201d and build one of the most innovative products in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cI met Temitope at the Mozilla Accelerator after we\u2019d bantered on Twitter for the longest time. I and William are technical persons and Temitope is a business operator, so I asked Temitope to help us figure out the business side of our product and we\u2019d help him build a technical team for his product,\u201d said Dike, CEO at GetEquity. Apparently, this was the supposed skill trade that would lead to the founding of GetEquity.\n\nThis is how disruption looks like\n\nTake a look at this: Shola, 25, wants to invest in a high-growth startup but doesn\u2019t know where to start, and when he finally finds some answers, his cheque is not enough to be an LP or even get him into an angel syndicate. So, he gives up. On the other side of things, Ada, a young founder, is struggling to raise enough capital to keep her startup running. So, she shuts down the business.\n\nBut what if Ada could find 10, 20, 100, or even more, of Shola who only have maybe $100 or less to invest? She could have raised close to what she needed to keep her business alive. This simple thinking led to building GetEquity.\n\nAcross the world, investing in early-stage businesses is not usually a public affair; it is mostly available to capital institutions, top-tier individual angel investors, syndicates (a group of angel investors), and sometimes, family and friends. Though this is still largely the case, startups like GetEquity are making a decent effort to disrupt this privileged arrangement and open up the space to any interested party.\n\nOn GetEquity, startups get instant access to several angel investors, syndicates and institutional investors. Startups also get the chance to raise investment from their communities and customers, \u201cgiving ownership and building a stronger sense of belonging with their most loyal customers\u201d.\n\nFor instance, Herconomy, a fintech startup for women, closed a $100,000 pre-seed funding round within 24 hours on the platform. That\u2019s 20% of the total funding raised and the portion reserved for its community. Before now, the possibility of a Nigerian startup closing a funding round\u2014both the seeds and the series\u2014within 24 hours was not only a tall order but a fantasy.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Fluidcoins, TalentQL and Mizala have closed $30,000, $25,000, and $25,000, respectively, from users who weren\u2019t necessarily part of their communities.\n\nTo clear the misconception that GetEquity was built on blockchain technology, the CEO said their technology only employs the core blockchain concept, which is tokenisation. \u201cBlockchain is all about ownership, accessibility and security, and we have borrowed this core concept to tokenise funding on our platform,\u201d Dike said.\n\nThis means, when a company wants to raise $50,000, it\u2019s technically selling 5,000 tokens at $10 per one.\n\nDue diligence and investment security\n\nOne of the most important and heaviest stages of investment is due diligence (DD); it\u2019s at this point the worthiness of a company is being tested. A lot of checks and notes comparisons happen at this stage. The question now is if investors can\u2019t carry out DD individually, how do they then know that a business is worth investing in?\n\nApparently, GetEquity operates like every other VC: its team of diverse backgrounds\u2014law, marketing, investment, business development\u2014analyse the potential growth of a startup before onboarding them on their platform. If that\u2019s the case, one can chose to question the validity of the disruption the company promises to bring into startup investment. Isn\u2019t this just a digital VC? Well, it is and it isn\u2019t. GetEquity\u2019s DD process is reportedly fast and doesn\u2019t hold startup to ridiculous equity shares, unlike most conventional VCs.\n\n\u201cWe look through the entire business\u2014the model, product roadmap, founder(s), traction, and revenue. We ensure the business is solid before we enlist them on our platform,\u201d said the company\u2019s head of growth Ekundayo, who doubles as joint CEO at Printivo.\n\nHowever, Ekundayo mentioned that even though the company\u2019s approach to DD is thorough, the company can\u2019t guarantee investors ROI on all their investments. And that\u2019s why GetEquity accepts investments as low as $10; this way investors can minimise risk by putting in small money across a number of startups.\n\nGrowth and Traction\n\nIn addition to the $100,000 GetEquity raised in April this year, it also raised an undisclosed six-figures pre-seed from Green House Capital, a renowned fintech investment shop based in Nigeria, and this validates the potential of its products. Since the investment, according to the co-founders, the company has experienced a 100% growth rate across all metrics. It has over 4,000 users on its platform. About 20 startups are currently listed on its platform and over $400,000 has been invested on the platform.\n\nGetEquity has released a couple of features that make investing on its platform even better; it launches secondaries where users can sell off their equity (token) according to its present value. For instance, if a user wishes to sell their token after buying and keeping for a while, all they need to do is indicate their interest to sell and they will be matched with a buyer, and vice versa.\n\nThe startup also recently just released Dealroom, a feature that allows users, mostly syndicates, to privately raise money faster. Think of a private room where you can quickly meet with your family and then convince them to commit to a course, but here, the course is raising money.\n\nGetEquity has a wallet infrastructure that users can use to hold value until ready to invest in their chosen startup. It charges between 0.5-5% on every transaction, depending on the payment option chosen. There\u2019s also an option to fund a wallet with crypto for those living where crypto dealings aren\u2019t frowned at, thanks to its partnership with Fluidcoin, another startup that has raised on its platform. The company also charges startups 4% commission on transaction.\n\nBoth local and international investors are bullish on Africa, especially Nigeria, which recorded the largest funding of about $1.4 billion out of almost $5 billion funding raised by African startups in 2021. With a more inclusive funding infrastructure built by GetEquity, this trend promises to continue for Nigeria come 2022.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Jack Dorsey\u2019s Btrust members\u2019 plan to facilitate financial freedom",
          "text": "Bitcoin technology is powered by software developers or contributors that work on a pro bono basis. So, the Bitcoin infrastructure would be threatened if these highly skilled developers refuse to work or are not skilled enough to maintain the code that sustains the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIn recent times, there have been efforts to prevent this from happening by supporting Bitcoin software developers to make Bitcoin more private, resilient, and decentralised. In May, popular crypto derivatives exchange, BitMEX, partnered with global non-profit, Human Rights Foundation (HRF), to provide a $150,000 grant for Calvin Kim, a Korea-based Bitcoin scaling researcher, and a $50,000 grant for Abubakar Nur Khalil, a Nigeria-based Bitcoin wallet developer.\n\nIn February this year, Twitter co-founder and former CEO, Jack Dorsey, had also taken a similar path when he announced that he was launching a new endowment called \u201c\u20bftrust\u201d, in partnership with rapper Jay-Z, to fund Bitcoin development in India and Africa.\n\nHe promised to donate 500 bitcoins ($23 million) to the endowment fund and give its board complete autonomy to use the funds as they deemed fit. But he has one ask: \u201cMake Bitcoin the Internet\u2019s currency.\u201d\n\nLast week, he unveiled the members of the board\u2014four of them\u2014to the world: Nigeria\u2019s Abubakar Nur Khalil, Obi Nwosu, and Ojoma Ochai; and South Africa\u2019s Carla Kirk-Cohen.\n\nBoard members with a game plan\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account. He became a contributor to Bitcoin Core\u2014there are less than 40 of them in the world\u2014when he was just 19. But the journey began in late 2017 when he heard about Bitcoin\u2019s price and started reading about it. The following year, he got into programming and built a blockchain-based app, before becoming a contributor to Bitcoin Core in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, he co-founded Recursive Capital, a venture capital that provides crypto-focused startups with seed and early-stage investments, with the aim of contributing to the development of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Recursive Capital is on a mission to facilitate online sovereignty\u2014tools, protocols, and ventures that democratise data ownership and promote privacy, encryption, and financial sovereignty\u2014all driven by Bitcoin. Despite being founded before the Web 3.0 buzz, Recursive Capital had decided that it wanted to enhance financial freedom by decentralising the financial monetary system.\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account.\n\nKhalil, who was recently named Recursive Capital\u2019s CEO\u2014after serving as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO)\u2014explained that Recursive Capital realised that Africa\u2019s financial infrastructure is underdeveloped and cannot handle the amount of load being put on it.\n\nHe explained that this is why it is hard to send and receive money across two African countries, and even more difficult across continents. But he believes that Bitcoin will level the playing field since the requirements for participating are low. All you need is a phone and internet access, and a bitcoin address or lightning address\u2014think email address but for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is democratising financial freedom on a global scale. It is also providing a unified monetary network where individuals from any part of the globe can transact instantly and have settlement across the global ecosystem cheaply,\u201d he told TechCabal in a call.\n\nTalking about the barrier to entry for Bitcoin, Khalil believes a misconception lies in the way people approach it. He explained that Bitcoin should be seen as an investment over a long time. This way, investors don\u2019t bother about how high its current price is. He also believes that an easy-to-use interface on mobile and web-based wallets should be created, so that non-technical individuals can use Bitcoin. This would help in lowering the barriers to entry.\n\nEarlier this year, after realising there is a dearth of Bitcoin developers in Nigeria and Africa, Khalil also founded Qala, to begin a revolutionary campaign of expanding the pool of Bitcoin and lightning developers on the continent.\n\nAll selected \u20bftrust board members\n\nOjoma Ochai, one of the newly appointed board members to \u20bftrust, explained that her selection was based on a combination of her experience in Africa\u2019s creative and digital economy and demonstrated interest in writing and talking about emerging technologies on the continent. Ochai has vast experience in non-profit management and governance across Africa and has run creative and digital economy projects across policy and practice in these sectors, on the continent and beyond. She also has board experience, being the board chair of the British Council Nigeria Programmes entity for two years. She was also involved in initiatives like the African Tech and Creative Group, which aims to capture value for African creatives and the tech sector.\n\nOchai also started a company with CcHub, The Creative Economy Practice, to capture more value for the African creative economy through projects that stimulate innovation and technology and enhance value chains and business models.\n\nWhat will Bitcoin do for Africa?\n\nKhalil believes in educating and enlightening individuals about Bitcoin\u2019s long-term benefits: economic freedom for the entire continent. Khalil believes Africa needs Bitcoin more because the currency of most of its countries are volatile, making it pointless for people to save long term in their native currencies.\n\nHe said that the reason many people see Bitcoin as volatile is that they approach it as a short-term asset: \u201dBitcoin is only volatile in a short timescale\u2014 a week, three months. But if you look at the asset across, for example, an entire year, it is quite stable, compared to some national currencies.\u201d\n\nOn fraud claims around Bitcoin, Khalil argues that Bitcoin is one of the most open monetary systems because the majority of fraudulent transactions still pass through the traditional financial system, where it is relatively easy to track parties involved.\n\nOchai believes that bitcoin will eventually become a viable medium for Africans to do business without restrictions. She added that it would also help the creative industries easily monetise content.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for Africans to be more involved in building solutions that work for us so that we move away from the paradigm of things being done to us and for us to a paradigm where we contribute our skills, worldview, and capabilities towards solving our own problems and being part of a global seismic shift,\u201d Ochai said.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve come across the buzzword, non-fungible tokens (NFT) on the Internet, chances are you have also seen the latest buzzword \u2014 Web3. Both words are generated by proponents of blockchain technology and crypto heads who believe it is the future of the Internet.\n\nAlthough some people like Elon Musk have said the word is a mere \u201cmarketing buzzword than reality right now,\u201d a deeper look at it suggests it could change not just the Internet but the world economy as we know it. But before I suggest that Musk could be wrong and sound like a crypto head myself, what exactly is Web3?\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting web3 is real \u2013 seems more marketing buzzword than reality right now \u2013 just wondering what the future will be like in 10, 20 or 30 years. 2051 sounds crazy futuristic! \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 20, 2021\n\nWhat is Web3?\n\nWeb3 is simply the Internet that belongs to everyone. A decentralised World Wide Web owned by no one but run based on everyone\u2019s decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo get a deeper understanding of what Web3 is and the rationale behind its formation, it is important to start from the beginning \u2014 the first and second generations of the web and how they\u2019re different from the imminent third generation.\n\nWeb1: The beginning\n\nWeb1 is the earliest version of what we call the Internet today. According to a 2014 paper by Nupur Choudhury, World Wide Web and Its Journey from Web 1.0 to Web 4.0, the Web was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1989. He envisioned the Web in three ways: a Web of documents (Web1), a Web of people (Web2) and a Web of data (Web3).\n\nIt is accurately referred to as \u201cread-only web\u201d as there were very few visuals besides text. Unlike today\u2019s Internet that allows users to interact with information online, users of Web1 were more passive and only read things online.\n\nThere was no comment section like you have on the Techpoint Africa website or Twitter or Facebook where you air your views or share your opinion about someone else\u2019s. To get an excellent example of what Web1 is like, visit Cameron\u2019s World, a web-collage of text and images from 1994 to 2009. Another great example will be what CNN used to look like in 2000.\n\nBerners-Lee is a British scientist who worked at Organisation Europ\u00e9enne pour la Recherche Nucl\u00e9aire (CERN). He submitted the proposal for what is known as the Internet today as an effective communication system at CERN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTim-Berners-Lee. Source: Britannica\n\nHowever, Berners-Lee realised that what he had proposed was far more powerful than just being a communication system within CERN but for the whole world. He and Robert Cailliau, a Belgian computer scientist, decided to connect information on the Web with hypertext and the Internet was formed.\n\nInterestingly, the first iteration of the Internet was very different from what we have now. To millennials or Gen Zs, Web1 was more or less looking at an offline doc.\n\nWeb2: Current dispensation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Web1 looks like\n\nBy 2004 the era of Web1 was about to fade away and the second iteration of the Internet was on its way. It would mark the beginning of user-generated content on the web. The same way Web3 is causing a stir now on the Internet, the coming of Web2 also did the same thing. It was dubbed a movement and a new wave of social services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the words of Tim O\u2019 Riley, Co-Founder of the O\u2019Riley Media and the man who popularised the term Web2, \u201cWeb 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move to the Internet as a platform, and an attempt to understand the rules for success on that new platform.\n\n\u201cChief among those rules is this: Build applications that harness network effects to get better the more people use them.\u201d\n\nWeb2 was truly transformative; it birthed social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter, which have dominated online social interactions to date. Cloud computing, eCommerce, financial services and many of the things we enjoy on the Internet today were only possible with the creation of Web2.\n\nAlthough Web2 stirred as much excitement as Web3 is doing now, people calmed down when Web2 became an everyday thing.\n\nThis is Web3\n\nWeb3 underpins the idea behind the creation of cryptocurrencies which is simply decentralisation. The technologies behind cryptocurrency, such as blockchain and cryptography, will also be a crucial part of Web3.\n\nLike Web2, Web3 wants to make the Internet more inclusive but, in contrast, take control away from big corporations like Facebook, Google, and Amazon. It aims to do this by decentralising the Internet.\n\nMat Dryhurst, a Berlin artist and a proponent of the Web3 revolution, says, \u201cThere\u2019s a small group of companies that own all this stuff, and then there\u2019s us who use it, and despite the fact that we contribute to the success of these platforms, we don\u2019t have anything to show for it.\u201d\n\nBut how will Web3 give people control of the Internet? We\u2019re already seeing a glimpse of how Web3 will work with the advent of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, for example, does not belong to anyone and every data on the Bitcoin network is not in a single place, it\u2019s everywhere.\n\nWhat to prepare for with Web3\n\nWith Web3, user data on the Internet is not held by Google or Facebook; it\u2019s on a blockchain that belongs to everyone. According to Business Insider Africa, you\u2019ll only need a single account to do anything on the Internet. For example, the same account will be used for Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, Spotify, Jumia, Bolt, and even Techpoint Africa.\n\nBasically, all of the applications and websites online will be decentralised. So, we\u2019ll log in to these applications the same way we use the Web3 wallet, Metamask, to log into blockchain platforms like decentralised finance.\n\nFor example, to buy or upload an NFT on OpenSea, an NFT market, you only need to connect your Metamask wallet, and it identifies you. The same Metamask wallet can be used to log in to other NFT marketplaces like Rarible and SuperRare. In fact, decentralised finance platforms (DeFi), decentralised exchanges (DEX) and virtually every Web3-enabled application will work with that same wallet.\n\nAnother huge part of Web3 will be artificial intelligence (AI). Although AI works with Web2, the third generation of the Internet will help AI understand the content on the web the same way humans do, making AI a lot smarter. In an example by CoinMarketCap, AI will not just understand words but the emotions behind the words with something called Semantic Web, a writing standard on the web that makes online content readable for AI and machines.\n\nIt is important to note that a large part of what Web3 is said to be capable of hasn\u2019t been seen or tested. However, many venture capitalists seem to believe strongly in the Web3 future.\n\nThis year alone, $27 billion has been raised by Web3-related startups, which is over 1,200% more than what the whole African startup ecosystem raised in 2019 and 2020 combined.\n\nGetting started with Web3 in 2022\n\nAlthough the idea of Web3 isn\u2019t fully formed, platforms that embody the concept already exist, and they\u2019re creating sources of collaboration and income for people. Such platforms include decentralised autonomous organisations (DAO), DeFi platforms, crypto gaming platforms, and even the metaverse.\n\nHowever, there are financial and educational barriers to entering these platforms as they\u2019re very new and complicated. So, the first step to getting started with Web3 will be learning, for instance, knowing how to get into the world of non-fungible tokens.\n\nWhile Web3 might be a new concept, there\u2019s quite enough content about it on the Internet, and a quick Google search could do a lot of wonders.\n\nWhen it comes to earning with Web3, on the other hand, a quick search on the Internet might not cut it. However, gaming seems like the least risky way to profit from the new Internet iteration.\n\nIn Africa, platforms like the Metaverse Magna have made it easy to profit from crypto gaming with their scholarship programme. It provides players with the assets they need to compete on crypto gaming platforms such as Axie Infinity, where they can earn up to $2,000 a month.\n\nA career in Web3 is also another path to profiting from it in 2022. Web3 and blockchain experts are in high demand as the field is still new. Dapp University is a great place to start learning about careers within Web3.\n\nWhile Web3 might be the shiny new future of the Internet, only time will tell if it will deliver on its many promises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2021, due to strong pushbacks from the US government, lawmakers, and parents, Meta (formerly Facebook), Instagram\u2019s parent company, was forced to halt the development of Instagram for Kids for children aged 13 years and below.\n\nThe argument was based on leaked intel revealing that Instagram contributes to the increasing rate of anxiety and depression among teenage girls.\n\nHowever, the global tech company pushed back, claiming that an exclusive photo-sharing platform for children would help parents better supervise their children and control their experience instead of relying on Instagram.\n\nAn official comment from Instagram revealed that parental permission would be required to sign up to join the app. It would not have ads and would only have age-appropriate content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public pushback could be considered suspicious because YouTube, Facebook Messenger, and TikTok already have similar children-exclusive platforms. Apps that don\u2019t develop separate versions have safety/parental control tools.\n\nThis is no coincidence. Social media companies that were created without children\u2019s plans have realised that it is almost unrealistic to build fail-safe underage controls on their platforms to give a level of control to parents. Besides, the age that children have to be before they can use internet-enabled phones has become younger and younger.\n\nOn a macro scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by dole777 on Unsplash\n\nThe approach to addressing the issue of online safety for children \u2014 a global concern \u2014 differs across platforms. Nearly all social media platforms have age restrictions of at least 13 years to use their platform. These restrictions are supported mainly by countries\u2019 data protection regulations.\n\nAll these restrictions are necessary to avoid inappropriate and age-sensitive suggestions popping up on children\u2019s timelines. Also, it would protect them from Internet predators. But this does not necessarily protect young users from other issues that might affect them during their initial exposure to social media \u2014 like an addiction that can preclude anxiety, depression, and other mental challenges.\n\nWhen we discussed the highly addictive nature of social media during one of Techpoint Africa\u2019s team bonding sessions, most of the team opined that just as children below a certain age should be protected from addictive substances, they should also be kept away from social media.\n\nWith many divided on the move, China\u2019s regulatory authority has implemented regulations requiring social media and gaming companies to disincentivise youth from spending too much time on social media.\n\nVideo-sharing app, Douyin \u2014 similar to TikTok \u2014 does not allow people below 18 who open it in Youth Mode to use the platform for more than 40 minutes at a time. Also, the app becomes inaccessible between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. and it screens content.\n\nMeanwhile, a new set of rules was recently released for gaming platforms to only allow young users to play games between 8 pm and 9 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and on official holidays.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile other countries might not take this route, they often find legal means to check the activities of these platforms. In Instagram\u2019s case, US lawmakers stood their ground.\n\nA cursory glance at a report that surveyed nearly 3,000 parents of teenagers in the US shows that parents are aware of the dangers of having their children online, but they either don\u2019t know how to go about it or admit in resignation that it is a necessary evil.\n\n\u201cHow do you want to keep track of your child\u2019s online activities without getting drained or getting them riled up to the point of finding loopholes to get back at you?\u201d complains one bemused parent.\n\nPlatforms and companies can establish restrictive rules, but parents and guardians have a part to play, and ignorance of what to do just won\u2019t cut it.\n\nDon\u2019t be a clueless parent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore exploring the provisions that different social media apps put in place to keep children safe, it is necessary to state that it\u2019s best if parents open social media accounts for their children.\n\nWith that, they can effectively define settings that suit their children\u2019s ages since these platforms only activate specific security restrictions when age is stated.\n\nParents should understand any app their children want to use. Where necessary, they should download the app and familiarise themselves with what goes on there.\n\nFacebook/Facebook Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nFacebook is one of the oldest surviving social networking platforms globally. As of October 2021, with over 2.9 billion users globally, the platform ranked first on the list of the most popular social networks. Attempting to protect a teenager with a mobile phone from the lure of such a platform is probably an exercise in futility.\n\nFor one, a Facebook account cannot be created for someone under 13 years old. For teens 14 years and above, parents have to activate the following settings during account creation:\n\nChange the default audience from \u201cPublic\u201d to \u201cFriends\u201d under the \u2018Audience and visibility\u201d option in the settings menu. With this, only friends can see their activities.\n\nRestrict who can send friend requests from \u201cEveryone\u201d to \u201cFriends of friends\u201d under the \u201cHow people find and contact you\u201d option. Here, you can also remove them from public search; this will stop their profiles from popping up in a Google search or appearing as a suggestion to anyone with their phone number or email address.\n\nAlso, review who can follow, tag, comment, or share their posts by changing the settings to \u201dFriends\u201d or \u201cFriends of friends\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, there is an under-13 child-friendly version of Facebook\u2019s instant messaging platform, Messenger Kids, which allows parents to decide who their children chat with. This was launched in 2017.\n\nTo use the Messenger Kids app, the child does not need a Facebook account or a phone number since activation is only possible via an adult\u2019s account.\n\nAfter installing the Messenger Kids app on a child\u2019s phone, a parent needs to authenticate it with their Facebook account before creating a mini-profile for their child.\n\nThe parent controls who becomes friends, hence who the child chats with. Even though parents control sending and accepting friend requests, they cannot spy on their children\u2019s chats.\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Meta-owned photo-sharing app, Instagram, is another social network that has caught the fancy of young people. Given the several reported cases of online abuse on the platform, online safety precautions need to be taken, especially for young people.\n\nTo keep minors and all its users safe, the platform has several safety features \u2014 particularly \u2018Tools to fight bullying\u2019.\n\nTo manage those that interact with your children, set profile as \u2018Private account\u2019 in the \u2018Privacy\u2019 settings menu. With this, interaction will be limited to only followers. For people younger than 16, their profile is automatically set as \u2018private\u2019.\n\nYou can also control comments, tags, mentions, and unwanted interactions, and direct messages.\n\nYouTube\n\nLike other platforms, YouTube does not allow people under 13 to open accounts unless, of course, the age isn\u2019t reported.\n\nFor teens and tweens, parents can supervise usage, change the video privacy settings, and disable autoplay. They can also take their children through these safety settings.\n\nIn 2015, Google introduced YouTube Kids to give younger users child-friendly content. YouTube\u2019s algorithm directs uploaded videos appropriate for children to the app.\n\nBecause a few cases have been reported where some offensive videos slipped through YouTube\u2019s filters, parents still have to monitor app use and report offensive content.\n\nSnapchat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Souvik Banerjee on Unsplash\n\nSnapchat has been around for a while \u2014 2011 \u2014 and It is popular for sharing temporary videos and images.\n\nUnlike other platforms considered, Snapchat posts \u2014 called Snaps \u2014 disappear after 24 hours. Direct messages also disappear after the recipient views them. However, the ephemeral nature of its content does not guarantee safety. If anything, extra care should be taken.\n\nOne of the ground rules on Snapchat\u2019s Terms of Use is that anyone under 13 is not permitted on the app.\n\nAn excellent way to help teens use the app safely is to discuss staying off explicit content and unfollowing any account that makes them uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, parents can adjust the safety settings and change location sharing settings to \u2018ghost mode\u2019. With this, only followers can see their Snaps or send direct messages.\n\nHere\u2019s how to enable Snapchat\u2019s Parental control features:\n\nOn the profile page, on the settings icon, change the option in \u2018Contact me\u2019 to \u2018My friends\u2019. Select the same option under the \u2018Who can\u2019 section (to manage who can see their snaps).\n\nTo make their account private so that they don\u2019t get suggestions to subscribe to channels or make them appear in other users\u2019 suggestions, uncheck all the boxes in the \u201cSee Me in Quick Add\u2019 section.\n\nTo deactivate location sharing, check \u2018Ghost Mode\u2019 under \u2018My location\u2019 settings.\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nWith over 2.6 billion downloads, TikTok is one of the most used social media platforms globally. Like every other social media platform, it has its safety issues.\n\nThe video-sharing app also has provisions for young users, although, like other platforms, age has to be reported in the account settings to activate the accounts.\n\nThe default account setting for users younger than 16 is set to \u2018Private account\u2019, which means videos will only be visible to followers. Direct messaging is also disabled. This setting can be manually activated in the settings menu.\n\nFor children under 13, TikTok takes them to TikTok Kids, where they are exposed to curated content; sharing, commenting, and messaging are deactivated. In some countries, parents can link their child\u2019s TikTok account with theirs. Once the \u2018Family Safety Mode\u2019 is enabled, parents can manage screen time, restrict content, and supervise messaging, following, commenting, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

          "title": "After 5 reluctant years of bootstrapping, CinetPay is closing in on Francophone Africa dominance",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year is 2016. Idris Marcial Monthe has just graduated from the Abidjan Founders Institute. An amazing three months of learning from the best and Monthe was feeling quite confident.\n\nHe and Daniel Dindji had just launched their payment gateway, CinetPay in the same year with little to no experience in the financial sector. The duo had met each other while studying Computer Science at the New Superior School of Engineering and Technology (ENSIT), Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nThis is not their first rodeo, though. In 2009, Monthe and Dindji created CinetCore, a platform specialising in the sale of domain names. But they soon encountered a problem \u2014 payments.\n\n\u201cIn our region, you have 80% of people with a mobile money account, while the remaining 10 to 20% have a bank account and a card to pay online,\u201d Monthe tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey tried to open several PayPal accounts to get their payments but they were blocked because Cote d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 like many African countries \u2014 has limited usability on PayPal and is unofficially said to be on a blacklist.\n\n\u201cWe saw that we have a good opportunity with mobile money because many people have mobile money accounts. But, the problem with mobile money is that, all the 80% are spread between three or five operators and it\u2019s not easy for a merchant to open four accounts, integrate four APIs, manage four reconciliation, and deal with four partners, just for collection of payments.\u201d\n\nSo, they decided to build a gateway for their website, connecting all of these mobile money operators in one place. But soon, clients were asking, \u201cHow can we recreate this for ourselves?\u201d And CinetPay was born.\n\nThe journey to getting funded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinetPay Founders. Source: Supplied\n\nIn December 2021, CinetPay announced a $2.4 million seed round led by 4DX Ventures and African payment gateway unicorn, Flutterwave.\n\nCinetPay has been Flutterwave\u2019s Francophone Africa partner since 2019.\n\n\u201cI think Flutterwave was looking for a strong partner in Francophone Africa to explore the market, check if we have the capacity to help them in our region and that is how the partnership started. Flutterwave had a customer in Cameroon and wanted to serve this customer with a mobile money solution and when they looked in Cameroon, they saw that their best partner would be CinetPay.\u201d\n\nFor Monthe, it has been a very good partnership, helping both companies share information and experience.\n\nWhen Techpoint Africa asks Monthe if bootstrapping was a deliberate choice, he says, \u201cIt is not our choice. We are in a region where fundraising is very low, and many investors don\u2019t have information about our region, our market, our environment. If we had a choice, we would have raised money since 2017.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompared to Africa\u2019s big four \u2014 South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Egypt \u2014 funding in Francophone Africa is quite low. However, this year has been a good year for the region, with several startups raising some impressive rounds and a unicorn emerging.\n\nMonthe believes that this is good news for them as more investors get interested in Francophone Africa.\n\nA little bit more detail about CinetPay\n\nCinetPay helps merchants in the Francophone Africa region accept and collect online payments from mobile money wallets in nine countries.\n\n\u201cJust to give you an example, if you are an eCommerce website and you want to launch your website in nine countries in Francophone Africa, you need to create 9 companies, you need to sign 36 contracts with each operator present in our region, you need to integrate 36 APIs, and you need to deal with 36 services for reconciliation, which is not very easy.\u201d\n\nWhat CinetPay does is aggregate all these means of payments in one gateway \u2014 a Flutterwave or Paystack, but for mobile money wallets.\n\nThe company is present in Cameroon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Guinea, and Benin.\n\nMonthe believes CinetPay\u2019s geographical presence among other things has helped the company stand out.\n\n\u201cWe are present in more countries than our competitors in Francophone Africa. We also have a large number of methods of payment \u2014130 \u2014 on our website. Our payment page is very simple and seamless; you have just one or two steps to processing payments.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is that we have the capacity to help big companies or institutions and public services. And we help these services to build a great solution. We don\u2019t just provide payment services, but we help our partners to digitise their services.\u201d\n\nWith over 350 merchants on the platform, CinetPay serves public services, schools, banks, financial institutions, eCommerce websites among others.\n\nThe company charges a commission on each transaction, with all merchants paying a $20 subscription fee annually.\n\nChallenges, conquests, and plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdris Marcial Monthe, CEO CinetPay. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen Dindji and Monthe first started, with no idea of how a payment infrastructure works, they began to attend a lot of incubators and accelerators, searching for helpful knowledge.\n\nAfter getting into the Abidjan Founder Institute, they also got into Seedstars. They\u2019ve also made it into several government and private incubators. A chance he believes has helped them grow CinetPay.\n\nInterestingly, Monthe didn\u2019t see their lack of experience as a challenge. It became a passion for him.\n\n\u201cI am very passionate about innovation, So I don\u2019t care about learning anything innovation, I like it. I don\u2019t see it as a challenge, but a passion. My goal is to impact the lives of many people in Francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nThe trick was practicing everyday what he had learnt at all the incubators and accelerators.\n\nIntriguingly, Monthe wants to create a non-profit organisation to help females gain access to education.\n\nAccording to the Francophone Africa and the Equality Challenge 2019 Report by the University of Chester Area Studies Research Group, female literacy rates in Francophone Africa have not been growing consistently, with outdated datasets being used for policy making and decision making.\n\n\u201cI think that the world will be better if many women are educated. The capacity of women to do many things like earn profit, to work hard is very high compared totge capacity of the men. This is my passion and my challenge and in the next five, ten years, this is something that I will launch.\u201d\n\nHe also jokes about being a farmer if he hadn\u2019t started CinetPay.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of trust. To solve this, Monthe says the team has had to adopt a transparency in communication and collaboration. Of course, when dealing with people\u2019s money, this is important.\n\n\u201cWe give the best product because if you cause losses, you lose trust. We work hard to give the merchants the best experience of payment in West Africa. 99% of transactions are in cash; you need to build trust to combat cash.\u201d\n\nWith the challenge of building and retaining talent, Monthe reveals an interesting strategy.\n\n\u201cWe signed a partnership with a high school to help us to recruit the best people, one year before the end of their degree.\u201d\n\nEssentially, building a pipeline of talent at an early stage.\n\nThe plan for now, though, is to focus on consolidating their hold in Francophone Africa. CinetPay is working on a regulatory sandbox with the Ministry of Finance. Building bridges and important connections as they grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "title": "Outlook for 2022: Telcos to focus on cloud, Internet of things, 5G adoption",
          "text": "After emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Nigerian telecom industry is entering a new phase and will be faced with a new set of challenges. This is due to the new innovations \u2013 cloud technology, internet of things (IoT), and 5G network adoption, among others, brought about by the digital adoption of the sector in the outgoing year.\n\nAccording to experts, 2022 is projected to be a unique transition year for the telecom industry. While new government strategies that originated in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak continue to be pumped into the global economy, the telecom sector is not exempted.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the increased need to embrace digital culture. So, as Africans, one of the ways by which we can respond to the challenge thrown by the pandemic is to accelerate our digital transformation,\u201d Isa Pantami, minister of communications and digital economy, said recently.\n\nRead Also:Nigeria\u2019s telcos record first internet subscription growth in nine months\n\nWithin the space of the 5G, the rise of the network as a service will push enterprises to adopt mobile edge computing (MEC). Edge computing in telecom provides execution resources (compute and storage) for applications with networking close to the end users, typically within or at the boundary of operator networks.\n\nEdge computing can also be placed at enterprise premises, for example, inside factory buildings, in homes and vehicles, including trains, planes and private cars. The edge infrastructure can be managed or hosted by communication service providers or other types of service providers.\n\nExperts say as 2022 comes around the capabilities provided by 5G managed services are going to push enterprises to re-evaluate their approach to the edge. Specifically, enterprises will begin to take advantage of the high reliability this distributed architecture provides.\n\nDespite the high concentration on the 5G spectrum and its supporting technologies, Olusola Teniola, Nigeria national coordinator, Alliance for Affordable Internet, told BusinessDay that there was still work to be done as regards the 4G network being accessible across all parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThe focus of the industry will be increasing the rolling of 4G networks alongside the target of the Nigerian broadband plan of 2025. We still need to focus on 4G networks in addition to deploying 5G networks licensing obligations sent by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC),\u201d Teniola said.\n\nThe need for 5G to be adopted in the coming year is for users to begin to experience technologies that have been discussed around gaming, and immersive applications that require low latency to be appreciated by customers.\n\nAlso, increased usage of cloud technology in order to have an uninterrupted broadband experience in terms of high speed is expected. \u201cWe anticipate a gradual migration of cloud technology applications, and data being built inside Nigeria as opposed to outside Nigeria,\u201d Teniola said.\n\nSimilarly, with the 5G spectrum launch, \u201cthe sector will see more foreign direct investments (FDI). For instance, the money for infrastructures is pitched at $500 million and it has to be funded, which will come from foreign investors, although local banks will contribute their quota.\n\n\u201cMore innovation, which includes the internet of things (IoT) now that we have 5G, should also be expected as well as the level of competition will be heightened among telcos,\u201d Ajibola Olude, executive secretary/chief operating officer at Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), said.\n\nThe ability to support both long-term evolution (LTE) and 5G simultaneously will be a competition as the industry transitions from one \u2018G\u2019 to another. While some are excited about this development, others might likely not want to move from a private LTE network to 5G immediately, but will transition over time as its network demands evolve.\n\n\u201cThe service provider or networking vendor that can enable that with the least amount of pain will have a significant advantage in the market,\u201d Olude said.\n\nIn preparation for the 2023 elections, the telco industry is also not left out. Plans are being implemented to ensure that electronic voting is utilised at its maximum, in conjunction with relevant government agencies \u2013 including the Independent National Electronic Commission (INEC).\n\nTo ensure this, experts are clamouring for the adoption of clear data gathering across the country. \u201cThe use of analytics, where telcos can focus on trying to customise their offerings to consumers in a manner that it becomes personalised, will really go a long way. The demographics of the consumer base, the young ones more especially, to experience some of the services which include digital identities, and other forms of data capture,\u201d Teniola said.\n\nIn the case of broadband penetration in 2022, the industry is expected to have access to forex in a meaningful manner. \u201cIts commitment by industry players to commit significant amounts of capital expenditure to ensure that the broadband networks can be extended, not only within the urban areas where it is the capacity focus, but also extend into the rural areas. A lot of equipment, software, and sometimes skill sets need to be encouraged in the country and the industry can only achieve this if they have an enabling environment to be provided by the government,\u201d Teniola stated.\n\nWithout this, broadband penetration might not reach its target rate at 47 to 48 percent by the end of 2022, from where it is now between 41 to 42 percent.\n\nSpeaking on the contribution of telcos towards the country\u2019s GDP, Olude explained that with the presence of FDI in the country, GDP is expected to increase.\n\nTelco operators must therefore transition to the fundamentally new network architecture, which is software-based, fully virtualised and cloud-centric. Seeing that \u201cthe future is digital, we should be committed to supporting and collaborating with African countries to maximise opportunities inherent in digital technologies. We should also be ready to avoid the pitfalls by instituting appropriate regulations,\u201d Pantami said.",

          "title": "\u2018Cheap Lake rice\u2019 eludes Lagosians as debt stalls mill renovation",
          "text": "The last time a bag of rice rolled out of the Imota Rice Mill was in 2019. Two years later, and with the festive season in full swing, there has been no hope for Lagos residents to get the previously cheap Lake rice, as debts owed to the contractors stalled the project.\n\nThe facility stopped producing three years after it first milled rice from a partnership between Lagos and Kebbi states. In December 2016, BusinessDay had reported that Lagosians would have the locally produced rice for consumption during that year\u2019s yuletide season. It was to retail for N13,000 per 50kg bag, considered cheaper than other locally produced brands which sold for an average of N16,000 while the foreign rice sold for N20,000 and more. Today, local rice sells for an average of N26,000 per 50kg bag.\n\nLake rice quickly became a hot cake among consumers, even beyond festive periods because of its affordability. But it soon fizzled out of circulation in 2019. The government said it was renovating the facility to upgrade the mill from 16 metric tonnes per hour to 32 metric tonnes per hour.\n\nThe Imota rice mill project, sitting on 13 hectares of land and initiated by the state government, has been undergoing construction since 2017.\n\nThe mill, dubbed the largest in the world and in sub-Saharan Africa, is projected to produce 2.5 million bags of 50kg rice annually, and also provide over 250,000 jobs in both the upstream and downstream sectors of the rice value chain. It is also equipped with 16 silos which have a combined capacity of 40,000 metric tons. Each has 2,500 metric tons.\n\nIn Dec 2020, the construction moved from between 10 to 15 percent completion rate to 85 percent. At this stage, the state\u2019s ministry of agriculture assured Nigerians that the work would be completed by the first quarter of 2021.\n\nBy May 2021, the state had expended N20 billion on the Imota Rice Mill, out of the N25 billion initial budget for the construction. This represents an 80 percent spend, yet, the commissioning was moved to the end of 2021.\n\nEarlier this month (December 2021), after a tour of the facility with other government officials, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos state governor, said the facility would be subjected to a pre-production test run before the end of the first quarter of 2022; making it the third reported time the government had failed to deliver the mill.\n\nHe said the project was expected to have been delivered by the end of 2020, but for the disruption occasioned by the outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe are going to charge on our contractors working on site to ensure that by the end of the first quarter next year, this mill should have started operations; that is, we should start producing rice from here,\u201d Sanwo-Olu said. While the governor attributed delay to the pandemic, there may be more to the story than just a blame on a virus.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s investigation found there are contractual issues holding the project back, thereby preventing the remaining aspect of the work, especially installations, to be done.\n\nThe equipment to be installed are already at the site, but work has stopped because the government owes Henry Karll Company an undisclosed amount of money\n\nThe boiler, pre-cleaning, and other parts within the rice mill, were sections in need of installation works, when BusinessDay conducted investigations.\n\nCIBA Construction Limited; Henry Karll Company Limited; and B\u00fchler Holding, are the three construction companies involved in the project. While CIBA Construction Limited is the main contractor for the project, Henry Karll Company is the contractor for major installation works while B\u00fchler Holding is in charge of the boiler installation.\n\nRead also: The new Lagos monthly rent scheme\n\nAccording to a source who spoke to BusinessDay anonymously, the equipment to be installed are already at the site, but work has stopped because the government owes Henry Karll Company an undisclosed amount of money.\n\nBusinessDay learnt that workers from the company had been on strike for three months because they were owed salaries and the contractor (Henry Karll Company) said it was because the government was yet to pay it as well.\n\nThe source further explained that the installation is especially needed in the pre-cleaning section to load the paddy when operations begin, adding that Henry Karll Company still needs to run some installations to the Silos area.\n\nWhile B\u00fchler Holding has been unable to come into Nigeria due to the pandemic, the source revealed that CIBA Construction Limited is also being owed, but unlike Henry Karll Company, it has been \u201cusing its money to push the work.\u201d\n\nBusinessDay learnt that on the governor\u2019s visit, release of funds had been promised to the contractors in order for the project to be completed before the end of first quarter of 2022 (the new target).\n\n\u201cThe governor said he will be generous to them. He came here last Friday and promised that he would release money so that by the end of the first quarter next year, they will start production,\u201d the source said.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s efforts to get comments from the companies yielded no result. When contacted via email, the Henry Karll Company declined to provide answers.\n\n\u201cFollowing your email inquiring about the status of Lagos State Rice Mill Project, kindly note that Henry Karll Company Limited has not been authorized to speak to the media. Hence, we cannot provide answers to the questions,\u201d an email from the company reads.\n\nThe company, however, directed enquiries to FAO Consulting, a firm responsible for design, project management and supervision consultant for the project. Phone calls to a number obtained for FAO yielded no response.\n\nSimilarly, CIBA Construction Limited did not respond to a mail from BusinessDay, neither was there response following several calls made to a number gotten from its website.\n\nStill seeking answers, BusinessDay reached out to Adenike Sodipo, information officer at the Lagos State Ministry of Agriculture, who declined comments unless permitted by the commissioner.\n\n\u201cI cannot speak to you because information officers cannot speak to the press. I\u2019ll get back to you. I have to speak to the commissioner. It is the commissioner that will answer,\u201d she said in a phone conversation.\n\nSodipo would later call back, referring this reporter to the governor\u2019s statement delivered after the site inspection (earlier mentioned) even though it was clear the governor did not address the issues of indebtedness raised by BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cGo and read all of them,\u201d she said, when informed the governor did not reference the debts stalling the project. \u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t read all of them. The questions you asked are there. Because there\u2019s a press release on that by the governor and it is widely reported.\u201d\n\nLagos State has a significant food demand of N2.89 trillion to feed its ever-growing population. It produces only about 20 percent of its food needs, meaning that 80 percent of its food needs are met through local and foreign importation.\n\nEarlier this year, Aminu Goronyo, president of Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) said rice production increased from two million tonnes in 2015 to nine million tonnes in 2021. He excitedly stated that Nigeria was ready to now export the commodity.\n\nIf RIFAN\u2019s claims are to be taken as facts, the Imota mill, when completed, could help in reducing price of rice and the pressure to purchase the commodity, at least in Lagos state. However, for now, supplies trucked from hundreds of kilometres away (and those smuggled across the borders with Benin republic), continue to meet the state\u2019s food need.\n\nAs the countdown to yet another pledge by the government to commission the mill in about 3 months time slowly ticks, BusinessDay has found contractors are being owed, despite over 80 percent of the contract sum said to have been spent. The contractors would not confirm or deny this, and neither would the state government.",

          "title": "11 key moments of 2021",
          "text": "For many, the outgoing year cannot end quickly enough. 2021 was the year of firsts, even if many were unpleasant \u2013 a year of triumphs, happy surprises, and bruising pains. Below are some of the key moments of 2021 with significant social, economic and political implications for Nigeria.\n\nBuhari declined signing Electoral Bill\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari who lost three presidential elections to electoral malfeasance should have been the biggest advocate for reforms. But like every other politician who ranks self-interest over the country\u2019s welfare, he again withheld assent to electoral reform law on a claim of \u2018direct primaries,\u2019 a provision he could easily have had amended since he commands worshipful reverence from the current set of servile, spineless lawmakers. This would be the fifth time the so-called \u2018reformed democrat\u2019 would thwart electoral reform, setting the stage for the 2023 general elections to fail.\n\nNNPC says it can no longer fund FAAC\n\nIn 2021, the reality of petrol subsidy hit home when the NNPC said it could no longer fund the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) \u2013 a basket from which allocations are shared to the 36 states. This triggered a nationwide debate over subsidies on over 100 million liters daily petrol importation in a country where poverty is putting cars beyond the reach of Nigerians.\n\nThough Nigeria is basically subsidising petrol for West Africa, NNPC, the sole importer, got the EFCC to track fraudulent marketers who take delivery of the products. But the agency is mostly useful at tracking internet scammers so a powerful cartel of oil marketers with ties to the government-run rings around it. With the planned payment of N5,000 to 40 million poor people to discourage labour unions from calling for a strike, marinating in the stratosphere of inane ideas, next year promises to be interesting.\n\nAfter 20 years, the Petroleum Industry Bill becomes law\n\nOne of the most consequential events in the economy this year was the PIB becoming law. \u201cIt brought certainty, and investors can evaluate its impacts on the existing and future investments,\u201d said Chiwendu Enechi, associate director, oil, gas, and power at Anderson. But it has not halted the exit of oil majors from Nigeria.\n\nThe Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) set new fiscal and regulatory terms, revamped the structure of the state-oil firm, created new rules for administering the sector but failed to acknowledge the reality of energy transition, and did not fix gas pricing hurdles to investments.\n\nThe PIA also provided that 30 percent of NNPC\u2019s profits will fund exploration in frontier basins, allocated 3 percent of oil companies\u2019 capital expenditure to host communities and demolished government structures that aided subsidies. It is yet to be seen how much investment this will attract.\n\nAttack of the Nigerian Defence Academy and kidnappings\n\nThe August 21 invasion of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), a school set up to train Nigerian military personnel, was the culmination of attacks against security formations across Nigeria.\n\nThis feat has achieved fame for its brazenness and the military\u2019s incapacity. A military school with perimeter unguarded and the eventual kidnap of military personnel put in context the incessant attacks on schools across Northern Nigeria by terrorists\u2019 bandits. Hundreds of school children were kidnapped in Kankara and university students at Greenfield University also suffered the same fate.\n\n2021 was the year security formations across the country were stripped of their facade of impenetrability. On April 5, hundreds of inmates were freed by gunmen who attacked the federal prison and police command in Owerri, Imo State. In October, they burnt the operational base of Nigeria\u2019s secret police in Nnewi, Anambra State. Days later, gunmen attacked a correctional facility in Abolongo, Oyo State, freeing hundreds of inmates.\n\nRead also: Listings, delistings that shaped Nigerian stock market in 2021\n\nFlour Mills acquires Honeywell\n\nIn November, Flour Mills of Nigeria plc (FMN) notified the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX) that it was buying Honeywell Group\u2019s 71.69 percent stake in Honeywell Flour Mills Plc and FBN Holdings\u2019 5.06 percent stake in Honeywell, a move that could raise its market share to 42 percent becoming the country\u2019s second-largest miller after Olam.\n\nThis is significant for food security and development of industrial capacity in Nigeria, as the move is expected to reinvigorate the agricultural value chain and backward integration of the food industry. It also creates a stronger brand in the food manufacturing sector to compete and take advantage of opportunities from the African Continent Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nSuper Tucano fighter jets arrive\n\nFrom June 2021, Nigeria began taking delivery of the first batch of the Super Tucano Fighter jets it ordered in 2018. Nigeria purchased the A-29s through the Foreign Military Sales programme, including spare parts for several years of operation, contract logistics support, munitions, and a multi-year construction project to improve Kainji Air Base infrastructure for about $500 million.\n\nThe A-29 Super Tucano supports flight and combat training, close air support operations, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, armed over-watch, counter-insurgency and irregular warfare missions having been successfully deployed in the Middle East.\n\nThe emergency of the Tucano jets has become a game-changer in Nigeria\u2019s counter-insurgency fight. Insurgents have been routed in the North East but it could not be deplored in the North West because the government hesitated to call bandits terrorists. The deal forecloses the use of the jets against non-terrorist targets.\n\nHowever, a court ruling in November designating bandits as terrorists paved the way for the jets to be used in the North West. The last batch was delivered in October giving significant boost to the war.\n\nMTN delivers Nigeria\u2019s first digital IPO\n\nMTN Nigeria opened the country\u2019s first digital-only initial public offer (IPO) on December 1, offering a total of 575 million ordinary shares to retail investors. The public offer is significant because it would contribute immensely towards deepening Nigeria\u2019s equity capital market. Analysis indicates that it could raise the valuation of the Nigerian stock market by as much as $10 billion. This could spur other companies to list on the stock market helping to attract fresh enthusiasm.\n\nThe arrival of Omicron\n\nOn November 26, 2021, the World Health Organisation (WHO) designated the COVID-19 variant B.1.1.529 a \u2018variant of concern\u2019 and named it Omicron. Scientists in South Africa first alerted the world of its discovery and was slammed with travel bans by Western countries. Nigeria was soon included shortly after lifting its own travel ban on South Africa. COVID-19 cases spiked in the country recording over 1,000 cases in a single day in December, spurring the onset of a fourth wave amid a poor vaccination record.\n\nSince the discovery of Omicron, chaos has returned in the aviation sector with new quarantine rules compounding the unpleasantness of air travel in the time of COVID. The UK initially placed Nigeria on a red list and has now placed expensive quarantine rules, disrupting business travel.\n\nAfrobeat goes global\n\n2021 was not just the year Burna Boy won a Grammy, it marked the emergence of Afrobeat on the global scene. From TikTok dance videos to the inclusion of Burna\u2019s hit song in the inauguration playlist of President Joe Biden, Afrobeat achieved global renown in 2021. Chukwuka Ekweani\u2019s \u2018Love Nwantintin\u2019 took over TikTok, recording a massive 15 billion views.\n\nTwitter ban\n\nIn June, the Nigerian government suspended Twitter operations in the country accusing the social media micro-blogging site of allowing its platform to be used for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence. The suspension came two days after Twitter deleted President Buhari\u2019s tweet threatening to deal with some in the South East blamed for attacks on government infrastructure.\n\nThe Twitter ban follows a pattern of overt attempts at vanquishing any form of dissent by the Buhari government. The regime soon followed with draconian rules to gag the press in a proposed law that would require media outlets to be regulated by the government. It further intimidated media outlets, including Channels Television, for broadcasting content it found critical.\n\nNigeria start-ups attract global venture capital\n\nIn 2021, the Nigerian tech ecosystem especially saw the infusion of much capital into their start-up operations. More than $4 billion of funding was raised by start-ups in Africa through 754 deals and Nigeria ranks highest among the top four including South Africa, Egypt and Kenya, with $1.41 billion. The top five beneficiaries who make up the total funding raised in Nigeria include Opay, which secured $400 million, Andela $200 million, Flutterwave $170 million, Kuda Bank $80 million (two tranches), and Decagon $26.5 million (two tranches). Nigeria ended the year with the most unicorns (start-ups with over $1bn) valuation on the continent.",

You have to go to work every day and will be monitored to know your level of performance,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cYou will be evaluated after every three months and if you are not meeting expectations in terms of service delivery, you will be dropped and replaced after six months. We are expecting a lot from you,\u201d the governor charged.\n\nCongratulating the new aides, a party leader in Oredo, Chief Osaro Idah stated, \u201cYou have to register at least 300 new members for our party as our target for membership is to enable us to win future elections.\u201d\n\nOne of the newly appointed SSAs, Osadolor Wellington, thanked Obaseki for finding them worthy, promising not to disappoint the governor and Edo people.\n\n...",

          "text": "The National Union of Nigerian Associations in Italy (NUNAI) has lauded the Federal Government of Nigeria for promptly responding to its appeal for the supply of passport booklets to the Embassy in Italy.\n\nNUNAI disclosed this in a video interview with journalists on Tuesday in Abuja, which refuted recent media reports that over one million, five hundred thousand Nigerians were yet to be issued their passports.\n\nSecretary of NUNAI, Frank David, who described the report as a fallacy, said the total number of Nigerians in Italy is not up to a million.\n\nDavid noted that it was impossible for over one million Nigerians supposedly living in Italy to be stranded for lack of passport.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe noted that currently, there are 209,000 Nigerians in Italy, 180,000 are legally documented with 29,000 yet to be documented.\n\nHe said that as much as NUNAI, the umbrella body of all Nigerian Associations in Italy will continue to appeal to the Federal Government for regular supply of booklets, they also appreciate the intervention so far.\n\n\u201cThe publication by the Nigerians in Diaspora Organisation Europe (NIDOE) which claims that 1.5 million Nigerians in Italy are in need of passport booklets in Italy is a fallacy and we debunk such claims.\n\n\u201cThe population of Nigerians in Italy is not up to one million. And on the issue of passport, yes are requests for people who need to renew their passport of get fresh passports.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cBut the mission has captured thousands of Nigerians who are having issues with passport in the past months and that is a great deal.\n\n\u201cThere was an intervention about three months ago, especially in my own city, Modena we were able to capture about 250 people, we went to another city called Pesaro and we were able to capture 138 people.\n\n\u201cWe went to another city which I supervised and they were able to capture over 170 people. So if you sum all these figures up you will get about a thousand.\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, there are other cities that need to be covered and that is not to say that they are up to a million. I stand to debunk that any day, any time.\n\n\u201cNUNAI as it were is the umbrella body of all Associations in Italy which NIDO should be part of, and NUNAI has been working with Embassies long before the existence of NIDO in Italy.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to speak more in favor or in criticism of NIDO because I do not know their modus of operandi and how they got their information.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cNUNAI has been in the forefront of issues that concerns Nigerians in Italy, in terms of welfare, in term of documentation, we have been working assiduously is collaboration with Embassies,\u201d David said.\n\nFor his part, the Welfare Officer of NUNAI, Frank David, also appreciated the Federal Government, the Nigerian Ambassador to Italy, Mfawa Abam, and the Immigration Attache to the Mission for their swift response.\n\nHe said that Amb. Abam and the immigration attach\u00e9 to the mission have been working tirelessly to ensure the challenges of scarcity of passports was solved to ameliorate the plight of Nigerians living in Italy.\n\n\u201cWe are all aware of the challenges the Nigeria Immigration service is experiencing, which is not only affecting Nigerians in Italy but even those living in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe supply of booklets to Italy is not regular but there are cases where the Embassy gets 1,000, gets 500, gets 2,000.\n\n\u201cAfter we have made a passionate appeal to the two Ministers, the Comptroller General of immigration last month, we have started getting supply.\n\n\u201cBefore the Christmas we got supply of about 1,500 because I work closely with the immigration and they promised to give us more, they are talking of giving us 10,000 booklets to clear the backlog.\n\n\u201cThere is an improvement, and the immigration and the Nigerian mission is working but more need to be done because Nigerians have to renew their passports and get new ones,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Rivers State governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, has narrated how a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Emmanuel Ukala, saved his political career in 1998, when some politicians in Obio/Akpor local government area of the state ganged up and conspired with the police to frame him up for armed robbery.\n\nSpeaking at an event to mark Ukala\u2019s 65th birthday in Port Harcourt on Tuesday night, Wike said his problem started when he declared his intention to contest for the office of the chairman of Obio-Akpor local government council in 1998.\n\nAccording to the governor, Ukala not only intervened then and secured his release, but also defended him from the Tribunal up to the Supreme Court when some vested interests in the council desperately attempted to stop him from being be sworn into office as Obio-Akpor LGA chairman.\n\n\u201cThroughout my chairmanship matter in 1998, when we had election down to April 4, 2000 when Supreme Court finally decided my matter, he (Ukala) never took a dime, one Naira,\u201d Wike said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe also recalled that before he proceeded to then then Rivers State University of Science and Technology, now Rivers State University, to study Law, Ukala had been his family lawyer.\n\nWike also recalled that while studying Law in the university, a chieftaincy dispute occurred in his community which led to the arrest and detention of his father, uncle, brothers and himself on trumped-up murder charge.\n\nThe governor, who was accompanied to the event by his wife, Hon. Justice Suzette Nyesom Wike, said it took the intervention of Ukala as their counsel for them to be discharged and acquitted.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere was a time that the entire family was charged for murder, every male was taken away. We only had women left in the house with children between the ages of 1 and 5. As at that time, I was reading Law at the then Rivers State University of Science and Technology, now Rivers State University.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWike disclosed that the legal luminary, in whose law firm he worked after leaving the Nigerian Law School, took his family\u2019s ordeal very personal and gave his best to ensure that they got justice.\n\nThe governor added that when the Rivers State Election Petition Tribunal annulled the 2015 governorship poll which he said he won convincingly, he contacted some lawyers to defend him in the matter and they demanded as much as N300m to N600m as their legal fees.\n\nHowever, Wike confessed that when he approached Ukala, whom he described as a mentor, he offered him free legal services.\n\n\u201cThen my governorship election, most people may not believe it, from governorship tribunal down to Supreme Court, he never collected one dime,\u201d he said.\n\nWike, who described Ukala as refined and discipline lawyer, applauded the legal icon for being a worthy mentor to him and his wife when they started their legal practice in Port Harcourt.\n\nThe governor showered encomiums on the children of the celebrant for deciding to honour their parents, Emmanuel and Dr Kate Ukala, in appreciation of all the sacrifices they have made in ensuring they become responsible citizens.",

By now, these things should be everywhere. I wonder what is really holding us back from taking some of these steps. Today we have fantastic drones in the market that will carry out surveillance capabilities.\n\n\u201cAll you need to do is to sit at an operations room, give out the command, pressing the buttons and the drones will be busy doing all the jobs, sending in results and so on. By now we should be engaging drones,\u201d he said.\n\nThe retired Army officer also called for more welfare packages for servicemen, saying lucrative salaries would boost the morale of troops at the battle fronts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn addition, he wants the government to consider the plights of officers who put in much effort serving the country only to be abandoned upon retirement.\n\nAccording to him, the current administration has not done much to enhance manpower in the nation\u2019s security architecture.\n\n\u201cWhy are we still delaying whatever we need to do concerning the enhancement of manpower within the security sector looking at the armed forces and even the police?\n\n\u201cI have not yet seen a reasonable level of urgency being exerted by this government to see that we enhance on manpower.

          "title": "Nigeria loses $5bn gold to smuggling in 6 years as Buhari makes crucial demands",
          "text": "To further ensure probity and best practice in the mining sector, President Muhammadu Buhari has directed the Presidential Artisanal Gold Mining Development Initiative (PAGMI) to provide a six-month progress report on the Solid Minerals Development Fund, designed to capture accruals from investments.\n\nAt a briefing by the Steering Committee and Management Team of PAGMI at the State House Wednesday, the president charged the team to scale up operations in the mining sector by ensuring investments go beyond artisanal and small scale levels.\n\n\u201cThe PAGMI Management Team should now develop innovative ways to move PAGMI to the next level to ensure the Nigerian mining story goes beyond artisanal and small-scale mining.\n\n\u201cI support the Steering Committee\u2019s target of aggregating 3-5 tonnes of gold over the next 12 months, as this will deliver tremendous fiscal and economic benefits to the nation. The Solid Minerals Development Fund should work with all relevant Government agencies to identify the support and funding needed to deliver on this aggregation target.\n\n\u201cNow that you have successfully delivered a pilot scheme in Kebbi State, it is time to roll out and expand sustainably across other states. The government is committed to providing all the necessary support required,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari urged PAGMI to ensure the Solid Minerals Development Fund fast-tracks delivery of other directives to support the Presidential Fertilizer Initiative.\n\nHe said all stakeholders should conclude the ongoing assignment of recommending a portion of accruals to be dedicated to the Solid Minerals Development Fund.\n\n\u201cThe dedication of a portion of accruals to create a sustainable income stream for the Solid Minerals Development Fund is essential to delivering the mandates assigned to the Fund. The development of a sustainable funding stream for the Fund will conclude the implementation of the Fund\u2019s Establishment Act, which is a key focus area for this Administration.\n\n\u201cThis initiative is of great pride to me because through our intervention we can reach hardworking Nigerians in the field, toiling and the quarries under the sun trying to earn an honest living.\n\n\u201cWe have been able to protect them from clutches of those who exploit their hard labour, while simultaneously bringing them into the value chain to earn improved income from their hard work. I expect a six-month progress report that will clearly show significant progress by scaling up the program from its current pilot stage,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president commended PAGMI\u2019s Steering Committee and Management Team under the leadership of the Chief of Staff, Professor Ibrahim Gambari as Chairman and Executive Governor of Kebbi state, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu as Vice-Chairman of the Steering Committee for doing such a good job.\n\nHe said the Responsible Mining Framework that was presented would result in an effective and transparent gold supply chain and demonstrate efforts to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, human rights abuses, and respect for the environment.\n\n\u201cI am particularly pleased with the coordination and integration aspects of the document. I want to commend the Central Bank Governor for his support of the Solid Minerals Development Fund in the delivery of PAGMI, particularly in the commitment to paying a fair price to support the artisanal miners and providing a market for PAGMI. The Honourable Minister of Finance, Budget, and National Planning is to be commended also for her support in increasing the capitalization of PAGMI through the already approved facility,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Dr Uche Ogar, who led the delegation, said since the validation of the initiative by the president \u201cto address the structural and institutional factors such as rural poverty and lack of alternative livelihood, and difficulty in meeting legal and regulatory requirements that tends to push artisanal gold mining operators deeper into the informal economy,\u201d PAGMI had created the opportunity for formalisation and mainstreaming of artisanal miners, giving them the economic opportunity to live.\n\nHe said between 2012 and 2018, five billion dollars in gold was illegally smuggled out of Nigeria.\n\nDuring her briefing, Executive Secretary Solid Mineral Development Fund, Hajiya Fatima Umaru Shinkafi, requested the president to, among others, increase the capitalisation of the Fund in order to extend to other states requesting its intervention to enable the committee meet up with its five-tonne target; order an intervention by the Central bank of Nigeria (CBN) to minimise losses by artisanal miners as a result of foreign exchange differentials; declare a ban on artisanal export of gold for at least one year to give PAGMI a chance to checkmate the smuggling activities and give a temporary waiver on royalties presently set at about three percent.\n\nShinkafi called for support of the funding of targeted explorations to catalyse private sector investment and transform PAGMI into a large scale operator in order to sustain the initiative.\n\nShe said the the document, Responsible Mining Framework, presented by the Steering Committee meets international standard, and was produced in conjunction with other stakeholders like NEITI, EFCC and the Nigerian Customs Service.\n\nAccording to her, the document would eliminate criminality, lead poisoning, child labour, sabotage in the economy and terrorism financing.\n\nThe Committee had in 2020 presented the first ever artisanal gold mined and sourced within Nigeria to the president.",

          "title": "Resource location-disputes: Osinbajo to broker truce among Kogi, Anambra, Rivers, others",
          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo is to broker truce among Rivers, Kogi, Anambra states and some others over the contentious boundary conflicts and ownership of some resource locations within and around the states.\n\nThe meeting, according to sources, became necessary following futile efforts by the National Boundary Commission (NBC) to get necessary support from some states to address the conflicts.\n\nKogi and Anambra have been in fierce legal battle over ownership of oil wells found in Ibaji and Agulere, an altercation that defied all technical and professional approaches to resolve.\n\nBlueprint learnt that the federal government is piqued by the untoward muscle flexing and resort to legal battles over ownership of resource locations and other socio-economic as well as political wrangling which could ultimately heighten the insecurity in the land and also lead to economic sabotage.\n\nAccordingly, the federal government has mandated the Chairman of the NBC board, Vice President Osinbajo, to, as a matter of national priority; engage all stakeholders from the contending states with a view to halting further crises in the interest of national security, peace, unity and socio-economic stability.\n\nIt was further gathered that any failure to cooperate and ensure the NBC has unhindered access to appraise boundary lines and demarcate them based on its statutory instrument for doing so, would be met with severe response from the federal government.\n\nSources also hinted that the federal government would no longer tolerate unnecessary and politically-motivated resort to resource location-litigation from any state, non-governmental organisation or individual which could stall the NBC\u2019s efforts to demarcate boundaries and ensure cordial relationships between borders across the country.\n\nNBC Director General Surveyor Adamu Adaji confirmed this at a parley in Abuja.\n\nHe said the federal government intends to put an end to all boundary conflicts arising from agitations over resource locations and thus ensure the right states were adequately captured to benefit from the 13 percent derivation allocation to oil- producing states.\n\nAdaji said: \u201cOne of the bones of contention in resolving boundary problems has been the issue of resources. Yes, there are conflicts between border states based on resource location. There are the cases of Kogi-Anambra, Imo- Rivers, Abia-Rivers, Anambra-Imo, Rivers-Bayelsa. The commission has always maintained that our ultimate concern is not the resources but our focus is on the boundary that is what we set up to address.\n\n\u201cThese resources fall within border towns in states. So we have always demanded that states cooperate with us as quickly as possible so that we can define the boundaries regardless of where the resources are. Once the boundaries are fixed, the location of where the resources are found will not be difficult to determine.\n\n\u201cSadly, we have instances where some states frustrate the quest of the commission to quickly define and demarcate boundaries. Some, for one reason or the other, either back out of the arrangements or refuse to cooperate and we have been discussing with the states.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the chairman of the board of the NBC, Vice President Prof Yemi Osinabjo, has graciously shown commitment and interest to ensure all resource location-boundary conflicts are resolved. He has not relented in partnering with the commission to call the states affected to meetings where decisions at the highest level are made.\n\n\u201cIt is in that regard that he intends to call a broader meeting very soon where some issues about the non-cooperation of some states will be addressed and ultimately action taken to put an end to further legal and other tussles on resource location.\u201d\n\nAt present, eight states namely Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Delta, Edo, Bayelsa, Ondo, Abia and Imo are recognised oil-producing states benefitting from the 13 percent derivation allocation of the federal government.\n\nKogi, Anambra are in contention over crude oil found in Ibaji and Agulere, while Lagos and Bauchi are on the fringes demanding inclusion in the elite oil-producing club.\n\nAdaji also said \u201cthe vice president will soon convene a meeting consisting of a high-powered team from the federation government and key stakeholders from respective states to deliberate on the vexed boundary conflicts between affected states.\u201d\n\nAdaji regretted that \u201cprevious efforts by the commission to carry out its statutory functions to demarcate boundary lines between contending states are variously and repeatedly frustrated by politicians and states with vested interests, who would rather want the contentions to be sustained than allow it to be technically and professionally resolved.\u201d\n\nThe DG said it does not reside within its purview to interfere in situations where the contending states resorted to legal option, saying the commission had deliberately steered clear of involvement in the legal tangle of the states.\n\nKogi as oil-producing state\n\nLast September, the Kogi state government said the federal government had resolved the issue by declaring both Anambra and Kogi states as bonafide members of the oil-producing states and would soon be gazetted to benefit from proceeds of oil exploration within the confines of their states.\n\nNonetheless, the thorny conflicts between Rivers and Imo states generated no little altercation between Rivers and the NBC as the former accused the commission of siding with Imo against its interest, even as both states proceeded to the court for adjudication on where the contentious oil wells reside.\n\nRMAFC okays Anambra, Kogi\n\nThe Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) had in letter signed by its secretary, M.B Shehu, and dated August 24, 2021, with reference RMC/O&G/48/VOL/I/55 addressed to Anambra state Governor, Willie Obiano, conveyed the approval of the attribution of eleven oil wells wholly to the state.\n\nIn the letter, RMAFC also approved the attribution of Anambra River one, two, and three oil wells to be shared on a fifty percent basis between Anambra and Kogi pending the final delineation of boundaries between the two states.\n\n\u201cI wish to refer to your letter dated 24th March 2021 on the above subject and to inform you that the commission at its 139th plenary session held on 27th July 2021 approved the attribution of the following oil wells to Anambra State: Nzam-1 oil well, Alo-1 Oil well, Ogbu-1 oil well, Ameshi 1, 2, 3 and 4 oil wells, Enyie 1, 2, 3 and 4 oil wells,\u201d the letter read.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the Commission also approved the attribution of Anambra River 1, 2 and 3 oil wells on a 50:50 percentage basis between Anambra and Kogi States pending the final delineation of the boundary between the two states,\u201d the RMAFC said.\n\nIn a similar letter to Kogi state Governor Yahaya Bello, dated August 24, 2021, and equally signed by its Secretary, M.B Shehu, the commission attributed Oda River oil well- 1 to the North Central state.\n\nThe letter added that the commission also approved the attribution of Anambra River one, two and three oil wells to be shared on a fifty percent basis between Anambra and Kogi states pending the final delineation of boundaries between the two states.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201cI wish to refer to your letter dated 10 August, 2021 on the above subject and to inform you that the commission at its 139th plenary session held on 27 July, 2021 approved the attribution of Oda River oil well-1 to Kogi State.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the Commission approved the attribution of Anambra River 1, 2 and 3 oil wells on a 50:50 percentage basis between Anambra and Kogi States pending the final delineation of the boundary between the two States.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, Kogi State will start to benefit from the 13% Derivation fund as soon as proceeds from the operation in Oda River 1 oil well or Anambra River 1, 2 or 3 oil well starts contributing revenue into the Federation Account.\u201d\n\nDuring a thank you visit to President Muhammadu Buhari, Governor Bello said with the recognition of the two states, the age-long oil wells dispute that resulted in unwarranted killings and destruction of properties has ended.\n\nHe said: \u201cPresident Buharis\u2019s decision has brought peaceful resolution of the dispute. The disputes between two communities of Odeke in Ibaji local government area of Kogi and Aguleri in Anambra state has come to an end. The Ibaji oil crisis has been going on for a while and has led to large scale destruction of property with the loss of many lives.\n\n\u201cThe Odeke and Aguleri communities of Kogi and Anambra, laid exclusive claim to the ownership of the oil in the disputed area which has been finally resolved in favour of both states.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy history, the exploration of crude oil in Ibaji Local Government Area which comes under the Anambra Basin in geological terms started in 1952 in the villages of Odeke, Echeno, Ihile, Anocha/Uchuchu, Omabo, Ikah, Iregwu and Ujeh all in Ibaji community of the present-day Ibaji Local Government Area of Kogi,\u201d the governor had said in a veiled claim to ownership of the disputed oil wells in those areas.\n\nControversy\n\nThe ownership of the oil deposits situated between Ibaji Area, Idah-1, Alade-l, Atu-l, Inni-1 in Kogi state; Eziagulu Otu, Enugwu Otu, Nzam, Ezi-Anam, Anaku, Omor in Anambra state and Igga, Ojo, Uzo Uwani Areas in Enugu state has generated no little controversies, destruction of property, loss of lives and as well caused untoward socio-economic hardship to the border communities in the three states.\n\nNBC worries\n\nAccording to the NBC, \u201cUntil the NBC is able to decide, using legal notices and ethnographic differences, where the oil well is situated, no clear declaration can be made as to the exact place the oil resides. This is the underlying issue\u201d, the commission said.\n\nMany states are embroiled in legal and related controversies which the NBC has repeatedly said had impeded its effort to delineate and demarcate boundaries among the border states.",

          "text": "Major Hamza Al- Mustapha (retd), ex- Chief Security Officer to former Nigerian military ruler, General Sani Abacha, has alleged that powerful and rich elites supply Nigerian youth weapons and drugs to perpetuate the insecurity bedevilling the country, for them to secure access to its mineral resources.\n\nAl-Mustapha said the people behind kidnappings and banditry in Nigeria are so influential that they can join hands to fight government in cahoot with their local and foreign collaborators, warning that they will do anything and everything to protect their source of income.\n\nHe said that dealing with them would require the contribution of all that are patriotic about the country, adding that government would have to step on toes to address the security situation\n\nSpeaking in a VOA Hausa interview, monitored in Kaduna on Wednesday, Al-Mustapha said, \u201cIt is high time that every patriotic Nigerian, anyone who has Nigeria, Africa or the world at heart, everyone, should stand up and make personal contributions. Things are not moving as expected. There are people spending their money to cause crisis and it appears they are succeeding.\n\n.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom the way they have access to weapons today in Africa, and different kinds of drugs, and from the kind of people that are given such things and they are using it, these have shown that the strength they have has started to overpower the laws of African countries, especially here in Nigeria. That is why I delved on these issues and other issues pertaining to world affairs.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Al-Mustapha, many bad things are happening in the country as some few individuals have become so powerful to have acquired the means of exploring, refining and exporting the nation\u2019s mineral resources without recourse to government, it\u2019s laws and its support. He alleged that the few Nigerians benefitting from the country\u2019s mineral resources seemed to be unstoppable.\n\n\u201cIf you want to stop them, they are ever ready to use all means at their disposal to fight you.They can even do that in collaboration with their local and foreign allies. They are powerful and can fight any government that tries to stop them.\n\n\u201cFighting them will require tact, reverting the laws and educating those carrying out the laws and those in government. They should know where they lag behind and where they are found wanting.\n\n\u201cIf this arises, if things are to be corrected, toes must be stepped upon, people must be shown the right thing to do so that peace and harmony would be restored,\u201d he said.",
