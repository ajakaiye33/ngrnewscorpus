          "text": "The proposed bill, Youth Entrepreneurship Development Trust Fund, on Thursday, at a public hearing, received support from stakeholders for the 5 per cent of annual capital estimates to be contributed to the trust fund.\n\nThe bill was sponsored by Hon. Farah Dagogo, representing Degema/Bonny Federal Constituency of Rivers State.\n\nThe bill was subjected to a public hearing in accordance with legislative procedure after it passed second reading in the House of Representatives.\n\nIn his opening address, Sponsor of the bill, said the Youth Entrepreneurship Development Trust Fund Bill, if passed into law would directly fund youth enterprises and will also help the Nigerian youths to set up their own businesses instead of looking for white collar jobs.\n\nAccording to him, youths are a critical mass in Nigeria with 55% of the entire population, while \u201cthey are highly endowed to the extent that they could contribute to national development, if opportunity was created for them.\n\nThe lawmaker said: \u201cThis bill was conceived in recognition of the enormous potentials of the teeming Nigerian Youths, which constitute over 55 per cent of the country\u2019s population and many of whose budding talents have not been effectively harnessed for the socio-economic growth and development of the country.\n\nHon. Dagogo pointed out that economic constraints were factors working against the youths in bringing out their best in terms of entrepreneurs, noting that the fund would afford them the opportunity to establish their businesses and manage them.\n\nStressing the importance of the bill, he said, once their minds are redirected to establishing businesses on their own with money in form of loan or grant readily made available, many of them would no longer make themselves available for vices.\n\n\u201cWhat went wrong with Nigerian youths, and how can we reverse the trend to galvanize them to become more functional and pivotal to entrepreneurial change?\n\n\u201cHere lies the essence of this Bill. This Bill is monumental, colossal, titanic and a roadmap for safeguarding the future of Nigerian youths. When passed, it would provide the necessary panacea on how to re-invent the economy and jettison poverty with youths taking the lead as tigers of revolution, \u201d he said.\n\nSpeaker of the House, represented by the Majority Leader, Hon. Alhassan Ado Doguwa, said the 9th House of Representatives are desirous of providing legislations that would have long lasting positive effects on the well being of the youths.\n\nChairman of the Committee, Hon. Yemi Adaramodu lauded the sponsor of the bill. He dismissed claims that the youths have been catered for in various youth programme, pointing out that \u2018the so called intervention programme\u2019 were not backed by law and as such difficult to monitor.\n\nA Professor in the Department of History and International Studies, Kogi State University, Prof Patrick Ukase, expressed joy \u2018 that there is a consensus on youth unemployment\u2019 and an urgent need to arrest the situation with the idea surrounding the bill.\n\nSimilarly, Prof Sam Otamiri of the Ignatius Ajuru University, Rivers State described the bill as an idea that should be encouraged. He said the bill is a clear solution to the problems of youth unemployment.",

You have helped many destinies, you have raised many leaders, one can judge by the massive crowd that joined you here today.\n\n\u201cYou have come to the throne of Oduduwa for prayers and blessing. You shall not go amiss.\n\n\u201cYou have never wronged anyone with your affairs. You need to be grateful to God who created you to be a special breed.\n\n\u201cGod caused your popularity to be spreading across the country.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful that you come here today; we are proud of you; you are our star.\n\n\u201cAll the ancestors of Yoruba land will aid your dream. Your steps shall be guided by the spirit of our forefathers.\n\n\u201cGod has given you a good name and he will stay by you, you shall continue to be relevant.\n\n\u201cYou shall get what you are asking for with ease, you have acknowledged the Yoruba traditional rulers here in the source of the whole earth, your prayer shall be answered. You shall not regret your aspiration, you shall prosper.\u201d\n\nTinubu commended Oba Ogunwusi for his unflinching cooperation and support for national integration, unity and peaceful cohesion.\n\nHe said the visit was to intimate the monarch in particular and Nigerians in general of his ambition to run for president, an ambition he described as \u2018timely and prompt\u2019.\n\nTinubu said: \u201cI thank you all. I specifically thank the traditional rulers here present, I came here to seek your prayers. I am here for your support and cooperation.\n\n\u201cI have been supporting the people here and there. We have moved all over the country for one candidate or the other especially in 2015 when we campaigned for President Muhammadu Buhari after his emergence. We equally supported him in 2019.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, what we are doing is to succeed him and I want to vie for President.\n\n\u201cWe believe that once Ooni, Orangun, Awujale, Alake, Owa, among others, speak, it becomes ours. With your support, it will come to pass.\n\n\u201cI am determined, I am prepared and I am ready for it.\n\n\u201cWe should use the diversity that God gave to us to promote peace, unity and stability. Our nation is endowed, I promise, if you push me forward, I will move it from potential to reality.\u201d\n\nThe APC chieftain thanked the people of Osun State, particularly the leaders and members of the ruling party for their unalloyed support and cooperation with Governor Gboyega Oyetola and the party over the years.\n\nHe described Oyetola\u2019s victory at the party\u2019s primaries as an indication of their love for the APC government in the state.\n\n\u201cSo, I thank you, particularly for standing by us, especially our royal fathers. I thank you for not putting our party to shame.\u201d\n\nHe urged Nigerians, particularly the youths who have been aspiring to become president, to champion the virtues of character, capacity, tolerance, endurance, consistency, integrity, diligence and ability to see good things and take leadership positions.\n\nHe also endorsed Adegboyega Oyetola for a second term.\n\nLauding Tinubu, Oba Aromolaran said: \u201cTinubu remains a true democrat that the nation needs at the moment because of his noble contributions to national growth and development.\u201d\n\nThe governor expressed gratitude to Osun people for renewing their confidence in his administration as demonstrated in the last primary election.\n\nHe expressed confidence in the ability, capacity and competence of Tinubu to take the nation to the Promised Land.",

          "text": "Some aspirants for the chairmanship of All Progressives Congress (APC), including ex-Governor Tanko Al-Makura, have rejected the party\u2019s plan to zone national offices and pick officers through consensus.\n\nThe aspirants, who described the adoption of zoning and consensus as a plot to exclude them from the contest, said they will resist it.\n\nAccording to sources, the contenders were miffed by the widely reported story of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s purported endorsement of Senator Abdullahi Ahmed, former governor of Nasarawa State, Northcentral.\n\nAlthough an official zoning arrangement is yet to be released by the party, the remark by Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai that the governors, after their Monday meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari agreed to zone and swap positions between the South and North has generated controversy.\n\nAn aspirant from the Northwest said he would challenge any attempt by the party to foist zoning on the platform.\n\nA source close to him said a team of lawyers have been contacted to challenge the move to exempt him out.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy principal has since yesterday engaged the services of some legal experts to challenge any zoning arrangement that will shut us out of the March 26 national convention.\n\n\u201cThis is a race that has been on for over a year, only for some party officials and governors to now want to impose zoning on us. We shall resist it and we shall challenge it whenever the party releases an official position.\u201d\n\nAnother aspirant from the Northeast said he will not dismantle his campaign structure, despite zoning.\n\nA member of his campaign organisation, who confided in our correspondent in Abuja, said the aspirant will not honour any zoning arrangement.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are set for the convention. We are not going to collapse our structure. This is democracy. Our principal is ready to submit himself to the delegates at the convention.\u201d\n\nThe Al-Makura Campaign Organisation (ACO) denounced the purported endorsement of any aspirant, insisting that Al-Makura will contest.\n\nA statement by the Director of New Media of ACO, Segun Tomori, in Abuja said: \u201cThe attention of the Al-Makura Campaign Organisation (ACO) has been drawn to wide speculations and propaganda making the rounds in some news outlets that President Muhammadu Buhari has endorsed the candidacy of Sen. Abdullahi Adamu as the next chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cWe have been inundated with calls and apprehension by Sen. Umaru Tanko Al-Makura\u2019s teeming supporters across the country. Therefore, we decided to respond, and set the records straight.\u201d\n\nWhat transpired at the meeting of the governors with the President was the ratification of the new convention date and agreement on the zoning formula. On the issue of who becomes chairman, the President asked that consultations continue to produce a credible and widely acceptable choice as a consensus candidate.\u201d\n\nTomori added: \u201cAl-Makura fits the bill. Across the length and breadth of the country, Al-Makura is seen as a bridge-builder, a leader imbued with a calm temperament, renowned with impeccable mobilisation skills and political sagacity that ensured he defeated the then entrenched Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Nasarawa State.\n\n\u201cIt is no wonder that the \u201cwho is who\u201d in Nasarawa political echelon have since thrown their weight behind him and being the political son of the President as the only Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) governor that aided the consummation of the merger, we can almost deduce where the pendulum of presidential backing will swing.\u201d\n\nUrging supporters to remain focused and steadfast, he said the former governor will continue his consultations and mobilisation.\n\nAnother aspirant, Mohammed Saidu Etsu, said in a statement that the purported endorsement was unacceptable, insisting that nothing can stop him from contesting.\n\nEtsu said he was not consulted over any endorsement.\n\n\u201cPolitics is about people, whether directly or indirectly, nominations and consensus should be a game of numbers. We have over 41 million registered APC members across the country, with a number of them being involved in the internal party decision-making process. most of which, I know that are not aware of this claim.\u201d\n\nEtsu said he was set to purchase the nomination form for the convention as soon as the party was ready to start sales of forms.",

          "text": "The resources available to various terror rings is enough to destabilise the country, Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufa\u2019i said yesterday.\n\nHe believes the nature of terrorism in the Northwest is far more vicious than the Boko Haram insurgency in the Northeast.\n\nThe governor spoke at the weekly Ministerial Briefing organised by the Presidential Media Team at the Presidential Villa in Abuja.\n\nHe said preliminary investigations revealed that some security operatives were working for terrorists.\n\nAccording to him, while 937 were killed and 1,972 kidnapped by bandits in Kaduna in 2020, a total of 1,192 were killed and 3,348 kidnapped last year.\n\nThe governor reiterated that the only answer to ending terrorism in all its forms is by total elimination.\n\nHe said terrorists, especially those involved in banditry and kidnapping, have adapted their crime forms into a business, with a financial turnover, their original trades in cattle breeding could not generate.\n\nEl-Rufai said the effort to tackle the menace had been uncoordinated.\n\nHe said some governors thought negotiating with the criminals would solve the problem but realised that it was a mistake.\n\nOn whether the terrorists collude with security agents, El-Rufai said: \u201cYes, we are concerned and it is not impossible to have infiltrators.\n\n\u201cThe preliminary report of Boko Haram financing also showed some links to bandits and pointed to some police and military officers in service as having some communication or connection with the bandits.\n\n\u201cSo, there\u2019s always that risk. In any system you have traitors and we\u2019re concerned about that. But to date, we don\u2019t have any firm evidence of that. I think a lot more work needs to be done.\n\n\u201cWe need to pursue the financing and logistics chain of banditry as well because the amount of money these bandits are making is enough to destabilise this country. It is a lot of money.\n\n\u201cWe only have an idea of what it is because those that make the payments don\u2019t tell us the truth all the time, but we hear from the legal intercepts of the conversations about how much money they are asking for, how much they have received and so on.\n\n\u201cThe numbers are mind-boggling. It\u2019s a major source of national insecurity and it will grow unless it is decisively dealt with. So, yeah I am concerned.\u201d\n\nHe believes the security situation in the Northcentral is far worse than the Northeast.\n\nEl-Rufai said: \u201cI am persuaded that the insurgency in the Northwest is far more lethal, far more serious than Boko Haram, both in terms of the numbers of people affected.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, this is just Kaduna numbers, one or two years. I can assure you the numbers in Zamfara and Katsina are two to three times this if they are keeping tabs.\n\n\u201cThe numbers in Sokoto, Niger and Kebbi will be about this. So, we are talking of tens of thousands of people getting killed, getting kidnapped. It is far more serious than Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cThe only thing is that these guys don\u2019t take territories. They are in the forests, ungoverned spaces.\n\n\u201cSo, they do not attract the same kind of single-minded attention that Boko Haram does and because Boko Haram\u2019s ideologies are religious or contentiously religious, you know, it elicits more passion.\u201d\n\nHe said the state government established the peace commission so as to end the conflicts unsettling Southern Kaduna, emphasising that true peace will not be achieved without dialogue.\n\nHe said the state has also invested a lot into technology to fight crime, adding that some of the gadgets procured had assisted the state to locate the hideouts of the criminals.\n\nThe governor believes the strength of the entire police and armed forces is far below the need of the country.\n\nHe noted that in some cases, the criminals wield more powerful firearms and ammunition.\n\nThe governor said he was not keen to run for another political office at the end of his tenure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an ambitious person. I\u2019m just a person that gets things done when given the opportunity and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve never lobbied for a job, I\u2019ve never desired to.\n\n\u201cEven this governorship, it was President Buhari that literally forced me to run. I wasn\u2019t interested in it. I just wanted us to defeat (former President Goodluck) Jonathan and I\u2019ll come to the Villa and be enjoying myself.\n\n\u201cI would have been one Special Adviser (Domestic). Anytime they are flying to New York, I\u2019m there. That is the life and I would not have had grey hairs.\n\n\u201cBut the President insisted that some of us must go and run for governorship, just in case he did not get elected again. He felt that we needed some strong governors, those were the words he used.\n\n\u201cSo, I was forced into this. I\u2019ve never desired to be Minister of FCT. (Former President Olusegun) Obasanjo just called me and said I am appointing you. I\u2019ve never wanted to be DG of BPE, I was called and given. So, I have zero ambitions. I have no aspirations\u201d, he said.",

We\u2019re strong. We\u2019re ready for anything. We\u2019ll defeat everyone, because we are Ukraine,\u201d he said in a video statement. Ahead of Russia\u2019s attack he had made a last-ditch attempt to avert a conflict, warning that Russia could start \u201ca major war in Europe\u201d and urging Russian citizens to oppose it.\n\nWarning sirens blared across the capital, which has a population of almost three million.\n\nTraffic queued to leave the city during the night and crowds sought shelter in Kyiv\u2019s underground metro stations. Several neighbouring countries have begun preparations to take in a large number of refugees.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t understand what we should do now,\u201d one woman called Svetlana told the BBC. \u201cWe\u2019re now going to a place where we can be safe and we hope we can leave safely.

Then Ukrainian forces said Russian military vehicles had crossed the border near Kharkiv in the north, Luhansk in the east, Russian-annexed Crimea in the south and from Belarus too. Belarus\u2019s authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko said his country\u2019s military were not involved but could be if needed.\n\nRussian tanks were later seen on the outskirts of Kharkiv, a city of 1.4 million people. Russian forces also reportedly landed by sea at Ukraine\u2019s major port cities of Odesa on the Black Sea and Mariupol on the internal Sea of Azov.\n\nUkraine\u2019s army said Kyiv\u2019s Boryspil international airport was among a number of airfields that had been bombed, along with military headquarters and warehouses in the big cities of Kyiv, Dnipro, Kharkiv and Mariupol.\n\nMr Zelensky said Russia had positioned almost 200,000 troops and thousands of combat vehicles on Ukraine\u2019s borders.\n\n\u2018Unprovoked and unjustified\u2019\n\nThe Russian leader launched the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d by repeating a number of unfounded claims he has made this week, including alleging that Ukraine\u2019s democratically elected government had been responsible for eight years of genocide.\n\nHe said the goal was demilitarisation and \u201cdenazification\u201d of Ukraine. Hours earlier Ukraine\u2019s president had asked how a people who lost eight million of its citizens fighting Nazis support Nazism. \u201cHow could I be a Nazi?\u201d said Mr Zelensky, who is himself Jewish.\n\nThere was an immediate response to the invasion from neighbouring countries.\n\nIn the Baltic republic of Estonia which borders Russia, Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said a number of Nato allies that shared borders with Russia has agreed to launch consultations under Nato\u2019s Article 4. Under the defensive alliance\u2019s treaty, Nato can be brought together if any member fears their independence or territory is under threat.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s widespread aggression is a threat to the entire world and to all Nato countries,\u201d she said.\n\nAs cars queued on Ukraine\u2019s border with Moldova, the country\u2019s pro-EU president, Maia Sandu said she was declaring a state of emergency and was prepared to give help to tens of thousands of Ukrainians. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda also said he was signing a state of emergency to be approved by parliament.\n\n\u201cPresident Putin, in the name of humanity, bring your troops back to Russia,\u201d said UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Western allies had repeatedly warned that Russia was poised to invade, despite repeated denials from Moscow. The US, EU, UK and Japan imposed sanctions against leading Russians, Russian banks and MPs who backed the move.\n\nUS President Joe Biden said Washington and its allies would respond to the invasion in a united and decisive way to \u201can unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces\u201d on Ukraine. \u201cThe world will hold Russia accountable,\u201d he added.\n\nEuropean Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen said the EU stood with Ukraine while foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said \u201cthese are among the darkest hours for Europe since World War Two\u201d.\n\nThe EU\u2019s 27 leaders were due to hold an emergency summit meeting later on Thursday.\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \u201cappalled by the horrific events in Ukraine\u201d and that President Putin \u201chas chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack\u201d.\n\n\u201cTogether with allies, we will respond to this barbaric act of aggression,\u201d said Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky.\n\nWhy Russia invaded\n\nEarlier this week Russia\u2019s president announced he was recognising the independence of two self-proclaimed people\u2019s republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe breakaway regions were seized by Russian-backed rebels after Russia invaded Crimea in 2014. Mr Putin launched that attack after mass street protests in Ukraine that ousted pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nSince then more than 14,000 people have died in the east in a conflict between the rebels and Ukrainian forces. A shaky ceasefire had held but there has been a surge in violations in recent days.\n\nMr Putin said the military operation\u2019s objective was to defend the people in the breakaway areas.\n\nKyiv and its Western allies have repeatedly rejected as absurd Mr Putin\u2019s claims that Ukraine was being run by neo-Nazis, instead pointing out that Ukraine was now a nation with growing democratic institutions, unlike an authoritarian Russia.\n\nFears of a Russian attack have been rising for months.\n\nMr Putin has repeatedly accused the US and its allies of ignoring Russia\u2019s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining the Nato military alliance and offer Moscow security guarantees.\n\nBBC\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Rising Oil Prices Worry FG, Says Nigeria Not Gaining from Soaring Rates",
          "text": "\u2022Sylva: Nigeria\u2019s comfort zone is $70-$80\n\n\u2022Fuel scarcity: NNPC distributes 387.5m litres of petrol in one week\n\nEmmanuel Addeh, Udora Orizu and Juliet Akoje in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday expressed concern over the rising international prices of crude oil, saying the increase is not good for the country.\n\nThe government bemoaned waning foreign investment in the oil and gas sector, and reiterated the need to float an African Energy Bank to curb the continent\u2019s dependence on Europe, Asia and America for funding.\n\nAlso, Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited yesterday released details of how it distributed a total of 387.59 million litres of petrol in the last one week to bridge the gap caused by the withdrawal of methanol-blended products in circulation.\n\nThis was as the House of Representatives Committee on Downstream investigating the importation of off-spec premium motor spirit (PMS) grilled other importers and suppliers of the product.\n\nSpeaking on the rising crude oil prices in an interview with Bloomberg Television, monitored by THISDAY, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, maintained that Nigeria\u2019s comfort zone in terms of oil prices was between $70 and $80 per barrel.\n\nAlthough Sylva did not particularly explain why higher oil prices were bad for Nigeria, he stated that at the moment, Nigeria was not gaining anything from the soaring prices.\n\nOn the back of rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine, Brent, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark, on Tuesday hit $99.03, the highest in the last nine years, almost touching the much-talked-about $100.\n\nClearly, the country\u2019s controversial fuel subsidy regime, which would gulp N3 trillion this year, coupled with its inability to ramp up production to meet the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have combined to limit the gains from the oil price hike.\n\nHowever, Sylva blamed the inability of Nigeria to activate the oil wells it shut down when OPEC instructed producing countries to cut production as well as the lack of investment in the upstream sector for the country\u2019s inability to increase production. At the moment, Nigeria is losing at least 300,000 bpd to its capacity challenges.\n\nThe minister stated, \u201cI\u2019m hopeful the prices will move around, maybe $80, maybe $70. We are hoping it will come down to somewhere around $70 to $80, which will be sustainable for us to the end of the year.\n\n\u201cWe are working hard on that (production increase). What happened to us was the fact that we had to cut back at the time, and, of course, in such a way you can\u2019t really cut back mathematically.\n\n\u201cSo, you want to cut back 100,000 barrels that you shut out, maybe we\u2019ll shut down about 200,000 to 300,000 barrels. So at the end of the day, we over-complied because we just couldn\u2019t achieve it mathematically.\n\n\u201cIn trying to cut down, we cut down too much. And now to come back, it\u2019s not been easy for us to get the wells back to production.\u201d\n\nThe minister noted that a lot of additional investments would be needed to ramp up production, but lamented that foreign funding was drying out for the industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very easy these days to get the investments in. We really are not able to meet up our quota now. But I believe that we\u2019re working so very hard to ensure that, because we are not happy at all.\n\n\u201cI mean, with the kind of prices we are seeing. We are obviously not happy about it. So we would like to definitely be back on track by later this year. It\u2019s not been very easy to get investments. A lot of people can\u2019t get investments into the sector.\u201d\n\nOn what was being done to change the dire investment situation, Sylva stated that Africa was now beginning to realise that it could not be completely dependent on foreign funding.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo we\u2019re looking at how we can get our African energy bank set up. Also, we\u2019re looking at how we can rally multilateral funding into financial institutions.\n\n\u201cWe are talking to Afreximbank. We\u2019re working with other African producers to try to rally some funding for our sector in Africa, because we cannot continue to depend on funding that\u2019s not coming.\u201d\n\nThe minister reiterated that the world could not abandon fossil fuels when it had not built capacity to harness the alternative, noting that the decision to withdraw funding was hurting the industry and the countries of the world.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is what we\u2019ve been saying all the time. I mean that we have not been investing in the oil and gas sector for too long. And we expected that this was going to happen at some point, because there will be a gap, because now that gap cannot be filled by renewables.\n\n\u201cAnd that is because you are not also investing that quickly into renewables, you\u2019re not developing renewables that quickly. So now there is a gap. And in addition to this gap, you have all the geopolitical tension.\n\n\u201cWe are saying they must move gradually towards renewables, I mean, because if they take out the investment so quickly from fossil fuels, they cannot develop renewables at that same rate. That is what we are saying.\u201d\n\nSylva further said he was not aware of discussions with the United States for Nigeria to increase supply of gas to Europe on the back of the Russia and Ukraine tensions, explaining that if it has to happen, it would take time and investment. But he explained that in the medium term, the country intended to begin supply to the continent through Algeria and Morocco.\n\nSylva said, \u201cWe are actually having those kinds of conversations with Algeria, we are building a pipeline, the Trans Sahara gas pipeline that is going to take up our gas all the way down to Algeria to Europe.\n\n\u201cWe are also planning a pipeline to take our gas to Morocco. So we are planning two pipelines, one to Algeria, to Europe through Algeria, and one to Europe through Morocco.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re actually planning to take our gas to Europe. But I don\u2019t know of any plan now to take gas to Europe because of the political tensions with Russia.\u201d\n\nOn the Trans Sahara line, he stated that Nigeria had just signed with Algeria and had already started construction from the Nigerian end of the 614 kilometres AKK Pipeline, to take the pipeline all the way to Algeria to the border.\n\nFor the Morocco pipeline, he noted that it was still at the level of studies, with reports being expected.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of excess capacity, but it will take some time to build the infrastructure and, of course, the LNG, it will also take a while. So, there is no spare capacity that we can immediately off-take to Europe now.\u201d\n\nSylva, who spoke on the current OPEC supplies, stated that there was no need to increase quota at this time beyond the already agreed 400,000 bpd, which the cartel embarked upon last year.\n\nHe stressed that he planned to visit the headquarters of Chevron, ExxonMobil, ENI and the rest of the multinationals operating in Nigeria to get their commitments on additional investments in Nigeria, especially with the advent of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which has made investment more attractive.\n\nFuel Scarcity: NNPC Distributes 387.5m Litres of Petrol in One Week\n\nThe release of the document by NNPC coincided with the gradual easing of the long fuel queues, especially in Abuja, where traffic had been mostly grounded due to the closure of some roads by desperate motorists.\n\nTHISDAY observed that even the NNPC mega station along Olusegun Obasanjo Way, in Abuja, which had hitherto experienced intractable lines of vehicles before now, had lighter queues. At the Total filling station on Sultan Abubakar Way, in Wuse Zone 3, which for weeks did not have the product, motorists had also begun buying PMS.\n\nStill in Abuja, retail outlets in the satellite towns, such as Bwari, Lugbe, Kubwa, Zuba, Kuje, and others, which hitherto witnessed product shortages, were seen dispensing petrol to motorists. The story was the same in some areas in Lagos and other major cities in the country.\n\nNNPC said in a statement that the petrol bought by Nigerians through retail filling stations between February 14 and 20 represented an average daily distribution of 55.4 million litres. The weekly national evacuation report released showed that 80 per cent of all the petrol distribution took place at 20 high-loading depots, while 20 per cent took place at the others.\n\nNNPC listed the top 20 high-loading depots used for distribution as Pinnacle-Lekki, which evacuated the highest volume of 70.8 million litres, and NIPCO, which distributed 22.6 million litres.\n\nAITEO distributed 22.3 million litres; Swift, 16 million litres; 11 Plc, 15.9 million litres; Bovas Bulk, 15 million litres; and Frado 14.6 million litres.\n\nOthers were Keonamex, 13.7 million litres; MRS Ltd, 11.9 million litres; Rainoil 11.6 million litres; AYM Shafa, 11.2 million litres; TSL, 11.2 million litres; Rainoil Lagos, 11.2 million litres; and Matrix, 10 million litres.\n\nAlso on the list were Conoil Lagos, 9.7 million litres; AA Rano, 8.8 million litres; Bluefin, 8.4 million litres; HOGL, 8.2 million litres; Ibafon Calabar, 8 million litres; and Mainland, 7.5 million litres.\n\nWith the distribution of 385.59 million litres in one week, NNPC stated that scarcity of petrol was being arrested, with queues drastically reducing at filling stations in Abuja, Lagos, and other major cities.\n\nAccording to the company, selling outlets that had been shut for over a week due to supply gap opened for operations since last Sunday.\n\nThe methanol-blended product, NNPC had earlier said, was imported into the country by four oil marketers through four cargoes under NNPC\u2019s Direct-Sales-Direct-Purchase (DSDP) arrangement.\n\nNNPC had last week promised that over 2.3 billion litres of the product would be delivered before the end of February 2022 to totally arrest the situation.\n\nGroup Executive Director, Downstream, of the national oil company, Mr. Adetunji Adeyemi, had further assured during a media briefing to announce the 2.3 billion litres expected cargoes, that Nigerians would heave a sigh of relief \u201cin days.\u201d\n\nTo lessen the pain and ensure that the long queues disappeared, Adeyemi stated that along with its partners, NNPC was embarking on a 24-hour service, noting that Nigerians can now buy the product round the clock at filling stations.\n\nFurthermore, the executive director had announced that at the time, the country had over 1 billion litres of petrol in stock, adding that all the fuel in circulation in the country is now certified safe.\n\nMany believe the bad fuel may have been fully withdrawn, as cargoes of clean petrol arrive the country daily to bridge the gap created by the withdrawal of the methanol-blended petrol.\n\nNNPC further noted that a monitoring team had been set up with sister government agencies to ensure a seamless process, urging the security agencies to fully cooperate.\n\nHouse Grills Other Suppliers, as Duke Oil, Oando Absolve Selves of Blame\n\nThe House of Representatives Committee on Downstream investigating the importation of off-spec petrol yesterday grilled other importers and suppliers of the off-spec fuel. The two oil companies, Duke Oil and Oando Plc, which were quizzed by the lawmakers, denied culpability in the importation of the bad fuel. Addressing the lawmakers, both companies said their product met the required Nigerian specification.\n\nIn his presentation, Managing Director of Duke Oil, Lawal Sade, said the product his company imported was certified okay both at the port of loading and the port of discharge by the relevant authorities. He said they were notified by NNPC a few hours after the discharge that the product had some particles, which made them to discontinue the process.\n\nSade said the company shared the pains Nigerians went through as a result of the discovery and quarantine of the methanol-blended PMS, adding that Duke Oil has already taken necessary steps to remedy the situation.\n\nHe told the House committee, \u201cMr Chairman, yes, there was a delivery of cargo by Duke Oil, like you have seen in the report, and that cargo met up with the Nigerian spec, as it is both at the loading and discharge ports. There was a confirmation by the regulator, which is the new Nigerian midstream, downstream authority, to discharge that cargo within the stipulated date.\n\n\u201cThe cargo discharged and the vessel sailed. It was just after 24 hours of operation then, that Duke Oil was notified by the NNPC that there was a complaint from some of their customers that the cargo had some particles\n\n\u201cSo, Mr. Chairman, with the notification from PPMC/NNPC, immediately, the management of Duke Oil authorised the NNPC not to evacuate the cargo any further and requested for a recertification. But it is important we reiterate the fact that the cargo has been certified by the midstream and then, there is a joint inspection before the discharge and the specification provided in the contract with NNPC meet up the Nigerian specification.\u201d\n\nHe further said, \u201cAnd then, some remedial actions were taken immediately, Mr. Chairman, to conclude the report and give an assurance to this House committee and, indeed, all Nigerians that Duke Oil, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the NNPC and commercially driven company, we are not just in business to make money, but also to guarantee the energy security of our great nation and we never compromise the quality of the product we supply to Nigeria and any other place we do business and we will always seek to maintain this positive position.\u201d\n\nOn its part, Oando Plc representative, Afanga Afanga, also said their product met the Nigerian specification.\n\nAfanga stated, \u201cIn line with our DSSP contract with the NNPC on January 16, 2022, we delivered 90MT worth of PMS on board the Vessel MT Elka Apollon. It is important to note that this PMS cargo that was supplied met and was in line with all the Nigerian and DSDP contractual specifications.\n\n\u201cThis was confirmed by the mandatory tests that were conducted at the loading port in Europe and before discharge in Nigeria by independent NNPC quality inspectors and finally by agents of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority. It is on this basis that the cargo was certified and accepted for discharge by NNPC.\n\n\u201cAs clearly stated by NNPC last week, when they were before this committee, its current inspection protocol does not include testing for methanol content and, thus, was not detected by the NNPC quality inspectors.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing at this juncture for us is to work with NNPC as we are committed to ensuring that what is brought into the country is well treated and the issues around the situation are alleviated for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe have given assurances and we have also been able to show to be following the right protocol and there was nothing that was breached as being alleged.\u201d\n\nResponding, the chairman of the committee, Hon. Abdullahi Gaya, asked the companies to submit all relevant documents regarding their presentations, adding that they may be re-invited if necessary.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Bala Mohammed: Ruling party\u2019s decision constitutes no threat to us\n\nObinna Chima and James Sowole in Abeokura\n\nThe decision, Tuesday, by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone its presidential ticket to the Southern part of the country, might have put the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in a quandary for contemplating to leave its own ticket open and by implication, put the north at advantage.\n\nBut the Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, yesterday, reinforced the PDP position, when he declared that the zoning of the presidency to the South by the ruling party posed no threat to the main opposition party ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nHis reaction may however underscore a concern in the party even though he tried to put a brave face on it.\n\nUnfortunately for the PDP, the APC seems to be playing a rather smarter card, given the current mood of the nation, and especially, because while most of the governors in both parties wanted power to shift to the south of Nigeria, the governors, being life of the political parties, are consciously working to the answer.\n\nAlthough in the PDP, such leaders like former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki; the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, and his Bauchi State counterpart, Bala Mohammed, are among those, who want the PDP ticket thrown open. The Southern PDP governors are also inclined to power shift.\n\nHowever, the possibility that the PDP too might still go South is high, because once the party had zoned its chairmanship to the North, it is only ideal that its presidential ticket is taken South, a situation that would further give the APC an advantage of southern votes.\n\nThis is not to dismiss the understanding alleged to have been reached by PDP leaders at the point of making Dr. Iyorchia Ayu the national chairman of party, that if the equation changed at the point of choosing a presidential candidate, the chairman would resign if interests clashed.\n\nInterestingly, and based on simple logic, many of the PDP governors knew that the APC would have an advantage in the south if the presidency was zoned to the south.\n\nBut the danger in this is that the party could lose the votes of some northern states as THISDAY had previously extrapolated, a development that could automatically put states like Rivers, Delta and Akwa Ibom in play for the APC that is fielding a Southern candidate.\n\nWhat this means is that with a Southern presidential candidate by the ruling APC and without a concurrent Southern presidential standard bearer in the PDP, those key oil-rich Southern states could be won by APC, while not losing much ground in the north.\n\nAnother factor that many are currently considering as likely to work in favour of the APC is the Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso\u2019s national movement, otherwise known as the third force.\n\nThe movement could divide the PDP further as well as shave valuable votes from the PDP in the North. In other words, the advantage the PDP hopes to gain in the north by potentially fielding a Northerner might be significantly eroded by Kwankwaso\u2019s third force.\n\nThis, nonetheless, Mohammed, who spoke with journalists, shortly after a meeting with former President Olusegun Obasanjo, at his residence within the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL), Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, said the PDP would continue to strategise to rescue Nigeria from the present situation she has found herself.\n\nThe governor, who described Obasanjo as a man with a lot of wisdom and an elder statesman per excellence, said he had come to seek his opinion on some of the things going on in the party.\n\nHis words: \u201cTo me, the zoning of Presidency to the South by the APC is not a threat to the PDP, because each party is trying to strategise, to plan and organise. If they zone to the South, it is open to us to see how it is going to give us more electoral victory or if we put it to the North, it will give us more electoral victory.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of things we are doing: the leg works, the permutations and so and so forth. So that, at least, whatever we are going to do, is to provide for Nigerians to choose between the best alternatives.\u201d\n\nWhile stressing the past relationship with Obasanjo, Mohammed said the issue of PDP, was basically one of the reasons for his visit.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe know that Baba is non-partisan; we know he is an elder statesman per excellence. But, we are rebuilding our party to remove rancour, division and so on. So, we still need him, because his words of wisdom are always very useful.\n\n\u201cSo, I have come to sound his opinion on some of the things going on in the party; to close ranks and make sure that we provide Nigerians with the opportunity to rescue the country, from the present division going around, which we have found ourselves,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Bauchi governor expressed optimism about his chances of getting the PDP presidential ticket to contest the 2023 election.\n\nHe said, \u201cTo me, presidency is a consensus \u2013 a stakeholder and a statesmanship \u2013 it is responsibilities. Of course, every Nigerian should try to contribute his or her quota to the growth and development of the nation.\n\n\u201cMore so, when leadership recruitment should be based on merit, should be based on making sure that, we bring everybody on board and should not be based on manifestation of separatist, which are the instruments and the disgruntlement that are capable of dividing us further.\n\n\u201cNigeria is too large and too important to be ignored. Some of us have benefited so much. It is not about me and my expression, but about the country.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s 5G race: MTN and Mafab pay $547.2m licence fee",
          "text": "Today, February 24 2022, marks a milestone in the race for Nigeria\u2019s 5th generation (5G) mobile network spectrum. The winners of the bid for 3.5GHz 5G spectrum, MTN and Mafab have each completed payment of the $273.6m licence fee required by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).\n\nAside the $273.6 million payment, MTN paid additional $15.9 million, being the bidding sum it offered at the assignment state of the spectrum auction, making it clinch its preferred Lot 1 (3500-3600 Megahertz-MHz) in the 3.5Ghz spectrum; while, Mafab Communications, which bided lower at the assignment stage, consequentially settled with Lot 2 (3700-3800Mhz) at no extra cost.\n\n\u201cI wish to officially announce that NCC has received and confirmed payments from MTN and Mafab for their acquisition of 1 slot of 100Mhz each in the 3.5Ghz spectrum auction, which was successfully conducted by the Commission on December 13, 2021, \u201d Umar Danbatta Executive Vice Chairman, NCC said. \u201cThey both met the deadline of February 24, 2022 as set by the Commission.\u201d\n\nMafab emerges winner\n\nOn December 13, 2021, when the NCC announced that the MTN Nigeria and Mafab Communications were the winners of the bid for the 5G licence, it came as a surprise to many as Mafab is an unknown player in the telecommunications space.\n\nIn response to the announcement, Transparency Nigeria Group petitioned the Federal Government and all relevant security agencies to launch an investigation into the business practices of Mafab Communications Limited.\n\n\u201cMafab Communications was incorporated in 2020, has no comprehensive tax history, and appears to have been specifically set up by connected insiders for the purpose of acquiring one of the highly valued 5G licences,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nHow MTN and Mafab won\n\nThe top bidders were Airtel Networks Limited, Mafab Communications Limited and MTN Communications Nigeria Limited, with the bidding price starting at $199,374,000. After 11 rounds of auction over a duration of 9 hours, the bid price rose to over $200 million with all 3 companies still active.\n\nThe auction process came to an end when MTN and Mafab posted an exit bid of $273 million, while Airtel posted a final bid of $270 million. Simply put, Airtel offered to pay the least amount among the three companies for the 5G licence, thus falling out of the race.\n\nPrior to the auction, Airtel, MTN Nigeria and Mafab Communications had paid an initial non-refundable 10% deposit of $19.75m each, which was statutory and mandatory to qualify them to participate in the bid process.\n\nThere were also allegations put out that Mafab is connected to former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, but the NCC has denied the allegations.\n\nThe NCC also added to its claims that the auction was free and fair by pointing out that it had earlier awarded Mafab with international data access (IDA), inter-connect data exchange (IDE) and Value-Added Service (VAS) licences. The earliest licence being the IDA issued in October 2020, 4 months after Mafab was incorporated.\n\nMafab Communications Limited was registered on July 8, 2020, according to the company\u2019s website and TechCabal\u2019s search on the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) site. It claims to provide and operate local Interconnect and International carrier services; there\u2019s no information about clients on its website.\n\nThe company is led by Musbahu Muhammad Bashir, the chairman of the Althani Group, an Abuja-based holdco that oversees a group of companies, including Eman Homes & Estate, Althani Investment Limited, Salam Takaful Insurance, and Mafab Communications.\n\nDeployment Phase\n\nAfter payment of the licence fee, the next phase for the bid winners is to deploy the 5G network service across Nigeria. According to the Information Memorandum of the 3.5GHz spectrum licence, the licencees have a rollout obligation plan spanning a period of 10 years, beginning from the date the license is award. Between the first and second year of the licence, the operators are expected to roll out the service in, at least, one state in each geo-political zone.\n\nFrom the third to fifth year, they are obligated to cover all the zones. Between 6 to 10 years, they should cover all the states in the country, according to guidelines set out in the Information Memorandum.\n\nRight of Way and energy costs\n\nAt the deployment phase, the two operators will have to deal with the Right of Way (RoW) fees of different Nigerian states. In 2020, the Nigerian government tried to get different states to reduce their RoW charges for fibre cables and adopt the agreed \u20a6145 per linear metre signed by the National Executive Council.\n\nBut only 7 states agreed to this while 29 states stuck to their guns\u2014states like Benue, Ogun and Lagos charge \u20a62,500, \u20a64,000, \u20a6750 per linear metre. The argument of the 29 states is that RoW is a source of revenue for their governments, but the big picture is that if any of these states reduce the fees, they may attract significant broadband investment from telcos.\n\nTelecom operators also have to contend with the heavy power demand of the 5G network infrastructure. Due to Nigeria\u2019s insufficient power system, telecom operators in the country have to generate and distribute the power they use.\n\nThese are some of the obstacles MTN and Mafab will have to surmount along the journey to deploying 5G network in Nigeria.\n\nWhy 5G matters\n\nThe advent of 5G comes with significant advantages, one of which is higher bandwidths. This translates to the ability to transfer large volumes of data at extremely high speed and very low latency. Simply put, 5G is faster than previous generations of mobile networks. It can, for instance, transfer data at 10 gigabits per second\u2014up to 100 times faster than 4G.\n\nThe increase in data transmission speed is important because new technologies and revolutionary innovations such as driverless cars and remote classrooms require faster connectivity and reduced latency to function optimally.\n\n5G networks are expected to make an estimated contribution of $13.2 trillion in economic value globally according to a recent WEF report. It\u2019s also expected to generate 22.3 million jobs from direct network investments and residual services.\n\nThe race to deploy 5G in Nigeria is still on, as MTN and Mafab head into the deployment phase.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "After Njoku Emmanuel\u2019s father seized his laptop for \u201ccoding too much\u201d and not facing his studies, he dropped out of school to focus on coding. 3 years later, he has become one of the best blockchain engineers of his generation, travelled the world, and now runs his own startup Lazerpay, a crypto payment gateway\n\nNjoku\u2019s greeting was casual, like his outfit\u2014a black round-neck t-shirt on jeans. His boisterous laugh set a natural mood for what would become a long but interesting conversation. It was a busy day in Lagos, and the murmuring voices around him indicated he was joining the video call from his office. The walls behind him had \u201cLazerpay\u201d and some motivational quotes written all over them.\n\n\u201cSorry for the noise, bro,\u201d Njoku said, running his fingers through his locks. \u201cIt\u2019s a busy week. We are going out of beta sometime next week, so all hands on deck!\u201d\n\nTo avoid internet fluctuation, we switched off our cameras and dived into our conversation.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLazerpay, a crypto payment gateway startup Njoku co-founded with Abdulfatai Suleiman and Prosper Ubi, was launched in October, and the reception has been massive. During its beta phase, the crypto startup has been endorsed by several tech and blockchain enthusiasts as a necessary innovation needed to accelerate crypto adoption in Africa. But what is even more remarkable about Lazerpay is Njoku, its 19-year-old CEO, who seemed to have emerged from nowhere to become one of the most sought-after young tech darlings in Africa.\n\nExcept he wasn\u2019t a sudden emergence.\n\nThe Njoku we see today is a product of a seed planted about 7 years ago in Port Harcourt, the biggest city in the South-South region of Nigeria. In 2015, at 13, Njoku and his brothers were casually introduced to computer programming by their aunt, who was a robotic engineer. Since then, Njoku chose to write code and never looked back.\n\nThe lofty dream that followed was wanting to build an operating system like Bill Gates had, or a social media platform like Mark Zukerberg did. He wanted to be the African Mark Zukerberg and told everybody that cared to listen so, including his mother who wouldn\u2019t stop jesting him for it. Njoku began to ask questions and pored through every content on computer programming he came across.\n\nBorn to an engineer father and a school teacher mother, Njoku was a mathematics whiz. He represented his school in the mathematics olympiad, won several medals, and lost a few. When his mates had a single mathematics textbook that had different topics like geometry, permutation and combination, and more, Njoku had a different textbook for each topic\u2014each textbook as big as the all-encompassing ones.\n\n\u201cMy father forbade us from using a calculator to solve our mathematics homework. Every computation had to be done with your head\u2014why else do you have a head?\u201d Njoku said. With this, his problem-solving skill was already top-notch; little wonder he was quick to embrace programming.\n\nBecause gaming was one of his favourite activities\u2014having played video games with his siblings\u2014at the time, he began to learn game development and started using C++ to build games. In 2017, he wrote his final secondary school exams and cleared all his papers, with A+ in mathematics and further mathematics.\n\nSurprisingly, his next challenge will be finishing University.\n\n\u201cUniversity was a waste of my time\u201d\n\nLike most Nigerian parents, Njoku\u2019s parents wanted him to become a medical doctor\u2014his older brother was already studying medicine. But Njoku had chosen his own path, one he wouldn\u2019t let go of for the world.\n\nHe got admission to study electrical engineering at Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUT) in 2018. This, his engineer father could live with.\n\nNjoku during one of Lazerpay early ideation sessions in Dubai\n\nIn the same year, he joined Quiva Games, a gaming company based in Enugu, as an intern. Everything was going okay; his plate was full\u2014a tasking engineering course and a job where he could build his coding skill. But, after a few classes in his first year, he realised engineering wasn\u2019t as tasking as he had anticipated.\n\n\u201cI thought everything would be advanced, but it was people packed into a small hall to learn social sciences and general studies. I was like \u2018What the hell is going on here?\u2019 And the maths they were teaching at 100 level was like my JSS 3/SS 1 maths. So, it became a waste of my time.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wasn\u2019t going to do this for another 5 years, so he became laser-focused on coding. \u201cAny time I was going to school, I was going to charge my laptop and code. I didn\u2019t tell my parents. When they gave me money to buy textbooks, I used it to buy coding courses on Udemy.\u201d\n\nHis father somehow found out he has been missing classes and invited home. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was a trick to seize my laptop. I went back to school and had to borrow laptop to finish some projects at hand and keep learning.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 was a blessing in disguise\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit in 2020 and everywhere was locked down, everybody panicked and scared, Njoku was somewhat happy; he\u2019d be away from school without getting into trouble. So, he upped his game and started coding 12 hours a day. He didn\u2019t want to go back to school, and the only thing he had was to learn as fast as he could and get a remote job.\n\nIn March 2020, he got a job as a mobile application developer at Kwivar, a buy-now-pay-later company based in Port Harcourt.\n\n\u201cThe salary was \u20a670,000. When I got it, nobody could talk to me. I was the biggest boy I knew. My parents couldn\u2019t believe you could get a job during the pandemic when companies were laying people off. Though the salary isn\u2019t enough reason to not study medicine, they finally saw what I had seen since 2015.\u201d\n\nIntroduction to the blockchain\n\nBefore the pandemic, Njoku had already started learning about blockchain. He\u2019d taken Udemy courses on blockchain and had entered the finals of a hackathon project that would be held in Lagos in 2019\u2014the first time he\u2019d ever be in Lagos.\n\n2019 was Njoku\u2019s first time in Lagos: Njoku and other participants at the hackathon.\n\nIn April 2020, a month after he started working at Kwivar, he got another offer as a blockchain developer at Project Hydro, a blockchain company based in the British Virgin Islands. He would be paid $700 monthly in Hydro tokens. At this point, he knew he wasn\u2019t going back to school; everything happening to him agreed with that decision.\n\nFast forward to September 2020, he wanted to leave Kwivar and needed something to replace it. So, he reached out to Ugochukwu Aronu, the co-founder of Xend, the parent company of Quiva Games where he\u2019d interned for 5 months, to check if there was an opening. After sharing what he\u2019d done at Project Hydro\u2014decentralised wallet, snowflake infrastructure for decentralised identity\u2014Aronu invited him to come to Enugu and join his new venture Xend Finance, a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform for credit unions, cooperatives, and individuals, backed by Google and Binance.\n\nAt the time, the pandemic was already easing up, and students had started going back to school. So, Njoku told his father he was going back to school. Aronu made him an offer\u2014\u20a6150,000 net salary, a MacBook, and free accommodation.\n\nThe days at Xend Finance: Njoku and Emeka Nweke, the lead blockchain engineer who taught him how to deploy complex smart contracts\n\n\u201cI went to Port Harcourt to show my parents the offer and told them I was dropping out of school. It was obvious they couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Going back to school just to graduate and earn about half or as much as I was already earning wasn\u2019t wise,\u201d Njoku said.\n\nIt was at this point that his parents knew and accepted Njoku\u2019s crazy idea to drop out. At Xend Finance, he had to step in when the lead blockchain engineer was unavailable, and that accelerated his blockchain knowledge. Despite the close call\u2014since they\u2019d already scheduled to launch by December 2020\u2014he led the build but not without a hiccup.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult because I had to take charge of an entire project in the middle of building. I fixed the bug, wrote, and deployed smart contracts. And I lost the company $10,000 because of a deployment error.\u201d So Aronu told him the money he lost would be deducted from his salary. At that point his salary had jumped to \u20a6300,000. He panicked and started applying to international jobs\u2014at least those ones could pay him enough money to service the debt.\n\nHe would later find out Aronu was only joking, but by then he had gotten an offer from MakerDAO, one of the biggest DeFi companies in the world. He was the first Nigerian engineer on the team. As usual, he went home to show his parents his new offer and his mother couldn\u2019t believe her dropout son could earn over $3,000 per month. But that was the beginning.\n\nAfter MakerDAO, the offers wouldn\u2019t stop coming. He got a contract offer from Instadapp, a DeFi protocol company, for $90 per hour. \u201cI was like, these people don\u2019t know me: I\u2019ll work 20 hours per day!\u201d\n\nHe resigned from Xend Finance and was ready to make his mark on the global blockchain ecosystem. He relocated to Dubai.\n\nDubai was his passport to the world\n\nMakerDAO was having an offsite meetup in Portugal and Njoku was supposed to go, but his visa wasn\u2019t approved on time. He was frustrated, so his aunt, the robotic engineer, advised him to try applying to travel to Europe from Ghana or anywhere outside Nigeria. \u201cShe also suggested Dubai, and I took it. After staying in Dubai for a month, I told her I\u2019m not coming back home.\u201d\n\nIn Dubai, more job opportunities came. He was on top of the world; he could now reject offers and travel the world. For an 18-year-old boy, there was enough money in the bank so he told his father to leave his brother\u2019s medical school\u2019s tuition to him. \u201cMy brother is in Bulgaria, so imagine earning in naira and paying tuition in euro. So it\u2019s only right I took that off my father\u2019s plate.\u201d\n\nHe got a contract offer of $3,000 per week from Avarta, a blockchain security company based in Singapore. He joined them and built their entire blockchain infrastructure.\n\nNjoku and Suleiman, co-founder and CTO at Lazerpay, in Dubai\n\nThen he met Yele Bademosi, founder and CEO at Nestcoin, who would later become one of Lazerpay\u2019s early investors. Bademosi then became Njoku\u2019s mentor, so when he wanted to start Nestcoin, Njoku was one of the first engineers he reached out to. It was around this time that the idea to build Lazerpay began to form.\n\nNjoku dropped everything to focus on Lazerpay. Avarta reached out with a full-time offer of $7,000 per month and $50,000 worth of Avarta token, but he rejected it. They came back with another offer of $15,000 per month, but Njoku was running with his new vision now. Before, the vision was to become a great engineer, but now it\u2019s to become a great founder.\n\nSo Njoku forfeited everything. He left MakerDAO in December 2021 and his Maker token that was worth over $200,000 and would have vested this February. He rejected a salary package worth over $300,000 from Avarta. All because he believed Lazerpay is the future of payment and will be worth much more than everything he\u2019s given up. And also because he was already raising funds and had to put his skin in the game.\n\nHe knew what he wanted from a young age and stood by it. His steadfastness has turned everybody around him into a believer; his parents have now begun nudging his youngest sibling to study software engineering.\n\nNjoku isn\u2019t Zukerberg and may never be, but he\u2019s building his own empire in the blockchain world. At 19, this can only be the beginning of his journey.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Last month, Polygon raised $450 million, to expand its portfolio of ethereum scaling solutions and footprints in the developer ecosystem. Ethereum is a blockchain that has attracted developers across the world, but its slow speed and high transaction costs (gas fees) have made many developers reluctant to use it.\n\nPolygon, a side chain firm attached to ethereum, is improving the functionality of the ethereum blockchain by improving transaction speed and cost. While Polygon\u2019s ultimate goal, at least for now, is to scale ethereum, it is processing more transactions than ethereum\u2019s main chain, mostly because of its $1 gas fee cost. As of today, it has processed 3.4 billion transactions and last month claims its 3 million transactions per day volume is double that of ethereum.\n\nOver the past few years, Polygon, previously known as Matic Network, has grown to host over 7,000 decentralised applications, including metaverse projects like Decentraland and Sandbox; popular NFT marketplace OpenSea; and DeFi projects such as Aave, Curve, Pool, Uniswap, etc.\n\nSandeep Nailwal, Polygon co-founder has said that its $450 million funding is to help Polygon build larger developer ecosystems in several markets. At the forefront of this expansion strategy is Nigeria\u2019s Shodipo Ayomide, Polygon\u2019s new Global Head of Developer Advocacy.\n\nBefore Polygon, Ayomide had previously worked with Nigerian tech publication TechPoint as a software engineer, VanHack as a developer advocate, and Stack Overflow also as a developer advocate. Ayomide had rejected multiple managerial and director-level positions to accept his offer at Polygon because he believes \u201cit is the future\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t focused on money or passion, but what excites me is a place I am building something that a billion people are using or is impacting a billion people around the globe. It means I am part of something huge and something bigger than myself.\u201d\n\nAyomide will be working with various teams like the hackathon, community, content team, and an engineering and open-source team, to create written and video content, organise meetups and establish relationships in the Web3 ecosystem of cities across the world.\n\nOne of the developer ecosystem expansion strategies is to establish Polygon Guilds, a structure that will help educate \u201cWeb2 developers\u201d and onboard them to Web3. This guild model will adopt a similar approach to Google Developer Group, a small meetup across different locations where people can learn about Google technologies.\n\nPolygon Guilds are in over 19 cities, a large number of them are in Africa\u2014Lagos, Abuja, Delta, Warri, Port Harcourt, Nairobi, and Mombasa. Polygon is also expanding its presence in France, India, the Netherlands, and the United States.\n\nEarlier this month, Polygon created the Polygon Academy, which intends to be a comprehensive guide for anybody that wants to understand Web3. This academy consists of eight modules and learners will earn an NFT when they complete them.\n\nThe end game of Polygon, Naiwal also said, is to become the AWS of Web3, and if Web3 is going to be as big as investors are saying it would be, its recent efforts will no doubt be a win for African developers.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpace Universe Africa, a technology development company based in Yaba, Lagos, launched its proprietary, needs-driven, multipurpose R & D lab on Tuesday, February 22, 2022.\n\nThrough its R&D lab, Space Universe Africa aims to provide solutions to local and global challenges through innovation and democratise technological knowledge across the industry, reducing inequalities in technological advancements between Africa and the rest of the world.\n\nThe digital revolution has seen the rise of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), Internet of things (IoT), blockchain, Web3, and most recently, the metaverse, among others.\n\nSpace Universe Africa understands the importance of leveraging these technologies to build purpose-driven products based on a unique philosophy called the principle of Ground Truth, which states, \u201cIf you can break down into smaller pieces, identify each component, and couple it back together in a better way, then you can build practically anything, and you\u2019re an innovator.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlamide Habibat, co-founder, Space Universe Africa\n\nThe R&D lab is built on this principle. Also, a significant product of Space Universe Africa known as the School of Ground Truth embodies this principle. Space Universe Africa is solving problems on many fronts, and here are some of their products that are doing just that.\n\nSchool of Ground Truth: Human resource experts agree that tech talents will be hard to find and keep in 2022 and beyond. In Africa, poor access to information and training resources is a major challenge affecting the availability of tech talents needed to take the continent to the next phase of innovation. Through the School of Ground Truth, Space Universe Africa is helping to bridge the talent gap by employing innovative hybrid teaching methods and learning technologies. The School which uses the gamification of learning through AR and VR technologies plans to explore the metaverse and take students on a journey to explore the many possibilities in the virtual world. DevPartners: According to Evans Data Corporation, there are an estimated 26.9 million software developers worldwide; however, according to the international finance corporation (IFC), there are an estimated 83,000 software developers in Nigeria. The data tells a story of the vast talent deficit in Nigeria. DevPartners is solving the tech talent shortage issue in the African tech space by working closely with the School of Ground Truth and other partners in developer communities in upskilling potential tech talent through training, internship, outsourcing, and funding. Communication Arc: This is the company\u2019s digital marketing arm, with a presence in some African countries. They help firms run their communications campaigns, including ads generations and distribution. Communication Arc is associated with two flagship products: RadioAdspread and PopAdlink.\n\nRadioAdspread: RadioAdSpread is a pioneering platform for aggregating global radio stations to ease brand advertisement and aims to solve the challenges faced by SMEs and Radio Stations\n\nRadioAdSpread is a pioneering platform for aggregating global radio stations to ease brand advertisement and aims to solve the challenges faced by SMEs and Radio Stations PopAdlink: PopAdlink is an online platform that provides sophisticated tools advertisers can leverage for traffic and business growth. Both platforms currently serve several customers across the continent.\n\nWith Awamaridi, Space Universe Africa plans to take a bold step into space and chart the unknown to make life better for humans while creating a healthy environment.\n\nAwamaridi is a Yoruba word for \u201cthe unknown,\u201d and the space-focused programme aims to provide sustainable solutions to how energy and data are produced and used without harming the environment.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing we can all agree on, it\u2019s that our online data is being tracked, one way or the other. From the sites we visit to the apps we download, there\u2019s a lot we share on Obasanjo\u2019s Internet \u2014 inadvertently or not \u2014 that end up in the most unlikely places.\n\nLet\u2019s put this in perspective, say you want to buy your dad a birthday gift. You go to your favourite eCommerce store and pick out some shoes and a nice wristwatch, but you aren\u2019t ready to pay. So you add it to your cart and decide to wait till salary week. After all, dad\u2019s birthday is not for a couple of months.\n\nYou clock off the website and go back to your favourite game. Two minutes into the game, you see an ad for some men\u2019s shoes and even a suit. Strange? Maybe not.\n\nSome say data privacy is a myth, and in a world where the free online services you enjoy require some information in exchange for your non-payment, you might be tempted to agree \u2014 sometimes I am too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the last four years, since the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) began, some headway has been made to protect personal data. The use of cookies, emphasis on consent, elaborate \u2014 but still insufficient \u2014 rules on data processing, transfer, and tracking are receiving attention.\n\nBig tech companies have become the subject of extreme scrutiny. They have had to backtrack and find ways to protect user privacy due to the current invasive nature of data tracking and its application to advertising and marketing.\n\nAs of December 2021, per Statista, 97% of apps on the Google Play Store are free. On the Apple App store, that number goes down to 94%.\n\nIn April 2021, Apple finally implemented its App Tracking Transparency privacy policy which meant app developers needed to seek the consent of users before their data could be tracked or given to a third party.\n\nBefore this, Apple allowed app developers to track user data either through its Identifiers for Advertisers (IDFA) or using their own trackers. With ATT, however, once a user chooses to opt-out, app creators would have no access to the IDFA and are urged not to track them on their own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: The Verge\n\nFor privacy advocates and enthusiasts, this was a welcome development. As we\u2019ve discussed in previous articles, consent is one of the fundamental tenets in protecting online privacy. Seeing it put front and centre brought tears of joy to the eyes.\n\nBut not everyone was on board with this. For companies like Meta (formerly Facebook), whose 2021 revenue was 97% ads, this was most definitely a stumbling block. With 98.5% of Facebook users accessing the platform via mobile phones, this was, of course, quite worrying.\n\nSo, in February 2021, Meta took out full-page ads in the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal, claiming it was protesting for \u201csmall businesses everywhere.\u201d However, this was not enough to save them because, by October 2021, investigations by Financial Times showed that Meta, Snap, Twitter, and Google\u2019s YouTube had lost $10 billion in revenue due to Apple\u2019s ATT.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Meta believes that they could lose upwards of $10 billion in revenue due to the ATT by the end of 2022.\n\nHowever, while Meta\u2019s actions in February 2021 might not have been entirely altruistic, it did have a point. Meta is the second-biggest digital ad platform after Google. It is heavily relied upon by pretty much everyone for data to run ads and gain insights into customer satisfaction and usage.\n\nFrom publishers to small and medium scale businesses to large corporations, advertising is an essential source of revenue. And to run the targeted ads which Meta promises, real-time/recent data is critical.\n\nThe question now is, how can these companies balance the competing needs of privacy and profit-making?\n\nA sandbox, but for privacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting the privacy graph\n\nAs of January 2022, 83% of smartphone users in Africa use Android; 70% worldwide. And on Wednesday, February 16, 2022, in a blog post, Google announced that it would be extending its Privacy Sandbox to Android.\n\nAccording to Google, \u201cThe Privacy Sandbox initiative aims to create technologies that both protect people\u2019s privacy online and give companies and developers tools to build thriving digital businesses. The Privacy Sandbox reduces cross-site and cross-app tracking while helping to keep online content and services free for all.\u201d\n\nSince its inception in 2019, Google\u2019s Privacy Sandbox has been mired in controversy. Considering that the company is the largest digital ad platform on the planet and is said to track user behaviour over two-thirds of the Internet, issues were bound to arise.\n\nIn January 2022, the company announced that it was scrapping the controversial Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) and introducing Topics. FLoCs was Google\u2019s plan to phase out cookies using technology that aggregated users into groups of users with similar interests.\n\nSide Note: This excerpt from this article by the Electronic Frontier Foundation explains the issues surrounding the use of FLoCs. TL;DR It was a big tattoo on your digital forehead because it tracked your Chrome browser history.\n\nSide Side Note: Unlike my favourite chocolate chip snacks, cookies are text files with small pieces of data \u2014 like a username and password \u2014 that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network. Using our earlier example, cookies made it easy for them to target those ads at you after logging off the eCommerce website.\n\nBy extending the Privacy Sandbox to Android phones, Google introduces four tools into the equation: Topics, Fledge, SDK Runtime, and Attribution Reporting. These are expected to replace the need for the Google Ad ID (GA ID) \u2014 the equivalent of Apple\u2019s IDFA; although the GA ID is expected to be operational for two more years.\n\nAccording to Daniel Junowicz, Managing Director of LATAM & Africa at AppsFlyer, \u201cThe announcement of the deployment of Google\u2019s Privacy Sandbox on Android is an expected continuation of an ecosystem that continues to prioritise user privacy.\n\n\u201cSince Apple\u2019s ATT Framework set the tone for these changes last year, the mobile marketing landscape has continued to innovate and embrace privacy-privacy preserving ways to drive mobile marketing performance.\u201d\n\nX-raying these tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Topics\n\nIn this video by Debby Reynolds, data privacy & protection expert strategist, she gives a high-level explanation of these four tools. According to her, these tools could \u201ccreate less asymmetry in the relationship between consumers and marketers\u201d while still providing some level of information to the marketers.\n\nTopics is a bit similar to FLoCs in that it categorises your interests based on your browsing history. Currently, Google says there are 300 human-curated topics, and it would be adding to the list as it goes on.\n\nTopics gives you the option to delete topics that are associated with you. In addition, when you first visit a site that has integrated the Topics API, you can choose which topics you are interested in on the website. This helps target specific people without revealing specifics like age, gender, or race for ad companies.\n\nSay one of the Topics is \u2018Food\u201d using our earlier example. If the eCommerce website had integrated the Topics API, you could have chosen only to be associated with Food and would not have seen any ads relating to suits or shoes once you logged off.\n\nFledge gives ad companies access to a custom audience of customers that have expressed interest in a particular product before or have bought a product before.\n\nAttribution Reporting prevents companies from getting specific data of a customer that bought a product. So say after you received your salary, you went on to buy your dad the shoes and wristwatch; Google would prevent the ad company from seeing that it was Sophia who lives on 61, Opebi Road, Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria that bought a gold wristwatch and size 43 male shoes.\n\nSide Note: Attribution is a way for ad companies to gain bonus points for ads that have converted. Basically, if you buy a product through an ad that was targeted at you, the ad company can use this to gain brownie points and know which ads work or not.\n\nSDK Runtime is a firewalled section of the phone to isolate ad tools to limit their ability to see and record what people do. An SDK (software development kit) is a set of tools provided by the manufacturer of (usually) a hardware platform, operating system, or programming language.\n\nThey help developers focus on running their own programme without worrying about having expertise in things like ads or analytics.\n\nWant some more technical knowledge? You can check this out.\n\nBalancing privacy and profit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle\u2019s stake in the ad industry seems to have informed much of what it has proposed. Unlike Apple\u2019s \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach, Google\u2019s method appears to be more balanced and considerate of all parties.\n\nGoogle says it would be working closely with the industry and regulators to finetune the Privacy Sandbox as this is not the final iteration. According to the company, this would take a couple of years before it is ready for implementation.\n\nMeanwhile, Android users can manage activity on their Google dashboard and delete web and app activity or location history or whatever they wish to keep anonymous.\n\nReynolds advises that companies find ways to increase their first-party data using giveaways to help foster that.\n\nAs she says, \u201cNothing stops companies from providing incentives to develop first-party relationships with consumers. I think businesses that cannot show how this data exchange benefits consumers will have a hard time getting people to give them data.\u201d\n\nA position Junowicz holds, \u201cFor Android mobile marketers, having the right technology in place will be crucial in order to continue generating valuable insights without compromising on privacy. For example, the use of predictive measurement solutions in conjunction with creative approaches will be vital to retain, engage and monetise users while providing personalised user experience in a privacy-compliant environment.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the development of data cleanroom technologies will offer a neutral, safe space for multiple entities to collaborate using first-party user data.\u2019\u2019\n\nSide Note: First-party data is information a company collects directly from its customers and owns.\n\nThis would, of course, lead to more companies having to comply with data protection regulations and perhaps better data protection and privacy policies.\n\nHowever, these actions serve to further cement Google\u2019s and Apple\u2019s hold on the industry. Something to chew on and perhaps worry about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

Now, economic activities are speedily returning, and all those who left their homes and businesses behind due to the unending floods are back to their property.\u201d\n\nAnother resident, Odiahi Osaze, who commended the state government for the intervention, said residents of Gapiona and Upper Adesuwa areas were for over 35 years plagued by flood and gully erosion, leading to destruction and loss of properties worth millions of naira, due to the negligence by successive governments.\n\nOn his part, Elder Richard Omwenyeke, a resident of Ebo Street, thanked the government for the massive erosion control projects from Gapiona to Amagba River.\n\nHe said the project has renewed the confidence of residents of the flood-affected and gully erosion areas, adding, \u201cThey can now live and make progress in their communities without fear.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe thank the government for coming to our aid from Gapiona to Ugiokpen, Ebo, Ugbor, Ogumwenyi, down to Amagba,\u201d Omwenyeke added.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "Nigeria should be restructured before 2023 election \u2013 Elliot Uko",
          "text": "By Obinna Ezugwu\n\nEvangelist Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, founder of Igbo Youth Movement ( IYM) and Secretary, Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA), has insisted that Nigeria should be restructured before 2023 election, as according to him, it\u2019s the only way to salvage it and not another election.\n\nEvangelist Uko who gave the advice in a statement on Wednesday, noted that it was regrettable that many have forgotten about restructuring, as all the agitations are now focused on power shift, while noting that power shift alone cannot resolve the contending issues of the Nigerian federation.\n\n\u201cThe political class, clearly excited and overjoyed at the great opportunity power shift ushers, are all presently grinning from ear to ear, over the mood of the country, the subtle agreement by powerful and influential members of the international community and the leadership of the land, that the Presidential seat should move away from the North, at this time,\u201d Uko said.\n\n\u201cThe need to restore sanity in the land, the imperative of weakening the uncontrolled agitation and the inevitable reality that the Government is clearly overwhelmed by the raging inferno in the land, regrettably and unwittingly enabled and fanned by avoidable high handedness, nauseating nepotism, glaring mediocrity and bad governance, coupled with application of wrong strategy in handling the agitation, all influenced the power shift decision.\n\n\u201cErroneous tacit support of the horrific brigandage of a favoured nomadic herdsmen, who in their blind attempt to intimidate and subdue aborigines all over the country, unleashed indescribable terror in the country, convincing all that their land grabbing gambit, has powerful backing, further setting the country on the road to Armmegedon, also made it imperative for certain concessions to be made, if the land would be healed.\u201d\n\nHe warned politicians intending to play politics as usual to understand that things have changed, and they must now shun greed and face the truth about the country.\n\n\u201cProfessional politicians, who are also well-known opportunists and grand exploiters, are now jumping into the fray with their own ideas of power shift. Greed, hubris and conspiracy reign,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOpportunists, exploiters and political hustlers of all shades, are now crawling out of their crevices, hibernation and graves like gouls, finally finding their voices and jostling to take advantage of power shift designed to heal the land, enthrone some kind of fairness and restore faith in the country. And now, everybody wants to be President.\n\n\u201cThese professional power mongers and specialist opportunists who do not appreciate the real reason power shift became inevitable nor do they care a hoot about how it came about, are about to make a mess of eating boiled eggs, as usual.\n\n\u201cDesperate to exploit and hijack the zoning of the Presidential seat southward, these politicos are warming up to display once again their famed self-centered attitude that defined our political space and fortunes as a people for so long. Greed and hubris is clearly powering their decisions and conspiracies. Non is giving thought to the real issues that made this power shift possible.\n\n\u201cNon of them regrettably, care about the real reason power shift became inevitable.\n\n\u201cWere precious lives lost in the agitation that gave impetus to the inevitability of this power shift? Will power shift ordinarily bring resolution and closure to the agitation? Are those angling and jostling to run for President equipped with the neccesary grit, knowledge and wisdom to heal the land at this time? Does power shift mean automatic end to agitations?\u201d he inquired.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe decision to yield to power shift at this time, though very commendable and trite, cannot be substituted for the inevitable reconstruction of the polity along true federalism and devolution of powers.\n\n\u201cPower shift is neccesary and healthy because it is wrong to concentrate Presidential power to one particular region as if others are eternal spectators or second class citizens, but it will be suicidal to pretend that power shift automatically resolves structural deficiencies and inadequacies that gave birth to over 90% of the political, social and economic issues troubling the country today.\n\n\u201cThe current excitement amongst the political class should be urgently traded for soberness and deep reflection on how to genuinely revert to a functional structure that will move the country forward and restore trust and confidence in the system, thereby genuinely healing the land.\n\n\u201cGreed for central power and hubris will most definitely lead to unnecessary errors and mistakes that may lead to untoward consequences.\n\n\u201cConspiracy to outwit, blackmailed and isolate others will lead to unfilled gaps that may eventually bring up unfavourable developments.\n\n\u201cUngoing unholy conspiracies, greed for central power and unbridled arrogance being displayed by politicos who did not in any way contribute to the pressure that made power shift possible, might cost my region and the entire country the most of this golden opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe may wish to remind ourselves that the need and cry for justice, equity, sense of belonging, fairness and level playing field for all, inspired the now-agreed power shift. That lack or absence of equal opportunities and fair treatment for all, resulting to disaffection and loss of faith, led to bitterness and agitations.\n\n\u201cThat the unjust unitary structure deliberately skewed against certain people and region, provided ammunition powering lack of interest in the system and then, agitations.\n\n\u201cThat the brutal and unkind response and erroneous strategy of containment applied by the authorities, only deepened and convoluted the crisis to the point that the land began to hemorrhage, resulting to economic paralysis and sparks of violence leading to killings, arson and shutdowns.\n\n\u201cThat the now-disappeared brutal brigandage of ruthless armed herdsmen, contributed greatly to the apprehension and fears that led to the emergence of armed militias all over the land, that stole peace away from the land, creating sharp divisions and deepening the crisis.\n\n\u201cIt is also important for all to remember that the cry for a restructuring of the country has been on for decades. The refusal to restructure the country before now, created over half of our problems.\n\n\u201cThat the Patriots, NADECO, eminent citizens, Afenifere and other regional bodies have been consistent in their plea for a peaceful and consensual reorganisation of the country\u2019s unkind and unhealthy unitary structure foisted on the country by military regimes. That this unresolved structural issues will not be resolved by power shift. That from the Aburi accord, the Abacha political conference, the Obasanjo National Conference, to the Jonathan CONFAB, the nation has been yearning for a holistic and wholesome reconstruction to true federalism and devolution of power, consensually agreed in order to move the country forward.\n\n\u201cThat the consensual restructuring of the country would enthrone stability, peace and harmony, giving every section a sense of belonging, granting political progress and economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe understanding that the task ahead is grave and delicate would help remove self-centered excitement that breeds conspiracy of power, greed and hubris. May this opportunity not be mishandled as usual.\n\n\u201cBy allowing greed for power, arrogance and conspiracies to becloud our senses and make the mistake of forgetting the onerous and sensitive task ahead in rejuvenating and rebuilding our country, we may be bungling this unique opportunity.\u201d",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nA gubernatorial aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Dele Adeleke, has condemned in its totality, the violence that riddled the Ad-Hoc Delegate Congress of the in Osun State, held on Wednesday, February 23, 2022, just as he commiserated with the families of party members who lost their lives during the exercise.\n\nAdeleke in a statement issued and personally signed copies of which were made available to newsmen in Osogbo on Thursday, stated that, \u201cpolitics should never get to this barbaric and archaic point, where we intimidate, maim and even kill people to win election.\n\nHe said, the particular attribute that makes human being higher than mere animals is our capacity to manage varied interests and conflict, without descending into lawlessness and barbarism.\n\n\u201cThe PDP, a party that prides itself on the ideals of people-oriented politics, should not be found having its internal issues end in violence and the unfortunate death of party members who only came out to express their free desires,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further stated that, \u201cthe PDP is a political party that should set example of peaceful conduct and all well-meaning leaders must rise to condemn this act of thuggery, violence and inhumanity that some persons within the party, displayed yesterday.\n\n\u201cWe are well aware of the persons within the party who are trying hard to foist their desires on other members through any means possible.

          "text": "Chief executive officer (CEO) of the National Library of Nigeria (NLN), Professor Chinwe Anunuobi has said the apex library in the country will embark on the collation and documentation of Nigerian families ancestry in indigenous languages as a means of preserving indigenous mother tongues.\n\nThe national librarian made this known at the conference on the \u201cUse of Technology for Multilingual Learning: Challenges and Opportunities,\u201d organized by the apex library to mark UN International Mother Language Day celebrated annually on February 21.\n\nLamenting the state of indigenous languages in Nigeria, Anunobi noted that only 3,000 texts in indigenous languages are available in the entire repository of the national library, noting that both the library and the Nigerian people are doing a poor job in preserving indigenous languages.\n\nShe, however noted that all hope was not lost as Nigeria can learn how best to preserve and digitalize her indigenous languages from countries as Bangladesh, and Bulgaria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo collate Nigerian families ancestry in the major indigenous languages of Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba, the national library will deploy its national Reading Promotion Campaign, RPC, but this time to reach the hard to reach areas documenting popular personalities, events and edifices in the various communities. The library will also work with researchers and scholars to document ancestral histories.\n\n\u201cI know that so many families, institutions, cultures and socio-political and sociocultural issues have gone past us without remembrance. I sat down to look at some edifice and some prominent people in Nigeria, and even those who may not be deemed prominent nationwide, but in their localities and communities they are very strong and powerful people. However, there is no one to tell their stories, or to tell what they have contributed to their communities and to the nation. Hence, the decision to start the family book club.\n\n\u201cThis is a tall order but we have to start somewhere. I believe in the next twenty years, we will be able to tell a great grandchild of, say Sanusi Dantata, \u2018your daddy was a great man,\u2019 and be able to trace his family history and achievements.\n\n\u201cWe will do sensitization to tell them what we have to do, and collaborate with them, with the aid of the traditional rulers,\u201d she said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBulgarian Ambassador to Nigeria, Yanko Yordanov noted that the national library is collaborating with the Bulgarian National Library in developing meaningful partnerships between Nigeria and Bugarian libraries.\n\n\u201cThe National Director of the Bulgarian Library is exchanging experience and good practices f what we do in this field with Nigeria. They are two great ladies contributing much to bringing closer our two nations in terms of culture and knowledge.\u201d\n\nResponding to the apex library\u2019s quest for the preservation of indigenous languages, Director American Center, US Embassy in Nigeria, Aondoana Orlu, advised that the languages be preserved in its purest form, both sound and written form, via digitacuration for authenticity\u2019s sake.\n\nThe International Mother Language Day was established in Feb 21, 1999 by the United Nations to commemorate the sacrifice and death of hundreds of people in Bangladesh who fought for the recognition of the Bangla Language. The agency has also marked the year 2022 to 2032 as the decade for the preservation and promotion of indigenous languages across the world.",

          "text": "The hope of the South East region producing the next president in 2023 could be thwarted as the insecurity caused by the activities of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), the paramilitary wing of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a pro-Biafra separatist movement, continues in the region.\n\nSecurity sources who spoke with LEADERSHIP said the gruesome activities in ESN camps are enormous and there is urgent need to tackle this menace.\n\nJust last week, gunmen suspected to be members of ESN killed eight traders in Abia market at New Cattle market in Omuma-Uzo in Ukwa West local government area of Abia State.\n\nAbia State commissioner for information, Eze Chikamnayo, who confirmed the incident, said gunmen attacked traders at the cattle market on February 15, at about 11:35pm.\n\nThe commissioner said the government responded swiftly by mobilising security agencies to the scene to secure the lives and property of the traders and fish out the assailants.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpeaking on attacks like this, the source said this is unsettling the security apparatuses in the country and causing tensions in other regions.\n\nThe source, however, said there are already plans underground to ensure that the South East does not produce the next president as there are fears of escalation of ESN activities if someone from the region becomes president.\n\nTo salvage the situation, the source said leaders from the region must come out and condemn the alleged criminal activities of ESN and IPOB.\n\nFormer Senate president and secretary to the government of the federation, Anyim Pius Anyim, is one of the prominent persons from the southeast contesting the presidency in 2023. Our source claimed that he may have fallen out with his major supporter, the governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, but Anyim is still going on with his ambition.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThough there are some cases of alleged corruption against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Anyim is still a prominent voice in southeast hoping to be president come 2023.\n\nThe Coalition of Northern Groups in Nigeria (CNG) and the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) have condemned the gruesome murder of the traders.\n\nCNG spokesperson, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, said the state government must act quickly to bring the culprits to book even as he warned that the North would no longer tolerate unwarranted attacks on its people living as minorities in the South East or any other part of the country.\n\n\u201cWe have studied the unfolding events carefully and with considerable restraint and maturity to the point of condoning and accommodating several unreasonable and unacceptable actions that have been perpetrated against northerners in the South East in particular.\n\n\u201cThe recent attack in Abia has taken matters to a point whereby silence has become complicity and inaction is no longer an option in the face of unprovoked evictions, attacks and killings of northerners in various parts of the South East,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, the national president of the AYCF, Yerima Shettima, said the group was deeply concerned about the killing of the traders doing their legitimate businesses.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile condemning the attack, he welcomed the prompt response of security agencies and urged the state government to pursue its promise to bring the killers to book, in the spirit of national unity and stability.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe AYCF will be closely following the efforts of the Abia State government to fulfill its promise of providing compensation for the families and survivors of the attack. We pray this should be the last bad news we would hear about innocent northern traders, from not just Abia but the entire South East, in the spirit of national unity and stability.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Imo State governor, Hope Uzodinma, had commended security agencies for arresting about 30 suspected kidnappers who he described as \u2018cannibals.\n\nOngoing insecurity in the S/E Not Enough To Deny It Presidency, Says Ohanaeze\n\nHowever, the apex Igbo social-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo yesterday insisted that the current insecurity in the South East was not enough to deny the zone the presidency in 2023.\n\nSpokesman of Ohanaeze, Alex Ogbonnia disclosed this in an exclusive interview with LEADERSHIP in Enugu.\n\nOgbonnia insisted that what was happening in the Northern part of Nigeria before Nigerians decided to concede the presidency to President Muhammadu Buhari cannot be compared with what is happening in the South East now.\n\nHe further pointed out that by the time Nigerians conceded presidency to the South West, they were in agitation over the issue of the late Abiola\u2019s presidency and that the presidency was yielded to them as part of ways to compensate them over the issue.\n\nOgbonnia further stated that there was serious youth restiveness in the South South when Nigerians conceded the vice president to the zone.\n\nHe therefore insisted that over 99 percent of people of the South East are agitating for president of South East extraction, adding the less than one percent making negative impact cannot nullify the interest of the majority\n\nTasks Ahead Of 2023 Elections Challenging \u2013 INEC\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has described the task ahead of 2023 and other off-cycle elections in the country as challenging.\n\nThis is even as the nation\u2019s electoral body noted that it will continue to raise the bar of credible elections in Nigeria. INEC chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, said this during a meeting to welcome six new national commissioners and to swear in a resident electoral commissioner in Abuja yesterday.\n\nHe, however, urged them to quickly settle in and familiarise themselves with the rules, procedures, and responsibilities of their offices.\n\nYakubu also urged them to uphold the tenets of integrity, rule of law, and service to the nation in the discharge of their duties.\n\n\u201cOur success in this arduous task draws largely from our integrity as election managers. We must be strict in the application of the law, firm in handling the public trust bestowed on us, and fair in our dealings with political parties, candidates and other stakeholders and all Nigerians,\u201d he told the new members of the election management body.\n\nShortly after administering the oath of office on the new national commissioner, Olaniyi Babalola Ijalaye, a legal practitioner from Ondo State, the INEC chairman deployed him to Ogun State as the new resident electoral commissioner (REC).\n\nHe said, \u201cThe current REC for Ogun State, Mr Olusegun Agbaje, is redeployed to Lagos State where a vacuum was created with the appointment of Mr Sam Olumekun, the immediate past REC of the state as one of the new national commissioners.\u201d\n\nThe other newly sworn-in members of the Commission are Mrs May Agbamuche-Mbu, Malam Mohammed Haruna, Mr Kenneth Nnamdi Ukeagu, Prof. Rhoda Gumus, and Maj. Gen. Modibbo Abubakar Alkalu (retd.)\n\nYakubu noted that four of them were not new to the Commission.\n\nHe said \u201cAgbamuche-Mbu, a lawyer, and Malam Mohammed Haruna, a journalist, have been re-appointed to serve for a second term.\n\n\u201cOlumekun, a retired civil servant, has served for two terms as Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in many states, including Lagos, while Mr Kenneth Nnamdi Ukeagu has been a career staff of the Commission, rising to the rank of director.\n\n\u201cThe other two national commissioners are Gumus, a professor of Engineering, and Alkali, a retired major general of the Nigerian Army.\u201d\n\nThe INEC boss said that the newly appointed and reappointed officials bring to the Commission their cumulative experiences in diverse fields that will no doubt strengthen the work of the Commission for the reform of the electoral process and the conduct of free, fair, and credible elections.\n\nWith the current appointment, he said the Commission now has the full complement of 12 national commissioners.\n\n\u201cIn discharging our enormous responsibilities, we must abide by our oaths of office. We must continue to defend the choice made by Nigerians at the polls by protecting the sanctity of the vote without which the value of democratic election is diminished,\u201d he added.\n\nElectoral Bill Will Be Signed In Days, Not Weeks \u2013 Adesina\n\nMeanwhile, the special assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media, Femi Adesina, has stated that the President will assent to the electoral Bill in a matter of days.\n\nAdesina stated this at the 21st Century Chronicle Roundtable with the theme \u201cGoing for Broke: Fighting Insecurity in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe cautioned politicians against heating up the polity and pointe out that people had commenced campaigns against the laid-down rules, even as he remarked that election in Nigeria is a natural tension generator.\n\nHe called for sanctions on those breaching the law by campaigning.\n\n\u201cCampaign had already started against the laid-down rules; it started as early as the second term of the president began. Today it is now worse as people are crisscrossing the country. I think those jumping the gun should be penalized.\n\n\u201cIt is very important we should follow the rules; when INEC says we should start campaigns we should. It pays nobody to generate tension. Like I said, the electoral bill would be signed in a matter of hours. It could be days but certainly not weeks.\n\nThe 2023 election would show if we are improving or have not learnt anything,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "FirstBank of Nigeria Limited has created variant of SME Loan products to support the growth of SMEs business with required funds. AMAKA IFEAKANDU looks at the impact and benefits of the SMEs loan facility to the companies and the economy in general\n\nOver the years, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (SMEs) are known as the backbone of many economies around the world, including Nigeria. They account for the majority of businesses and remain important contributors to job creation and global economic development. The SMEs represent about 90 per cent of businesses and more than 50 of employment worldwide. Available data showed that formal SMEs contribute up to 40 percent of national income (GDP) in emerging economies. These numbers are significantly higher when informal SMEs are included. According to World Bank estimates, 600 million jobs will be needed by 2030 to absorb the growing global workforce, which makes SME development a high priority for many governments around the world.\n\nContribution In Nigeria Economy\n\nA recent report showed that more than half of the jobs in developing countries are created by SMEs, and they dominate the private sector space in the same economies.\n\nSMEs constitute essential ingredients in lubrication and development of Nigeria economy.\n\nThe SMEs\u2019 ecosystem as a central pillar for the economic growth, has contributed about 48 per cent to the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), accounting for 96 per cent of businesses and 84 per cent of employment.\n\nWith a total number of about 17.4 million, the sector accounts for about 50 per cent of the industrial jobs and 90 per cent of manufacturing sector, in terms of number of enterprises .\n\nAccording to the 2010 Survey report on SMEs in Nigeria conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in collaboration with SMEDAN, the SME sector in Nigeria is strategically positioned to absorb up to 80 percent of jobs, improve per capita income, increase value addition to raw materials supply, improve export earnings, enhance capacity utilisation in key industries and unlock economic expansion and GDP growth.\n\nImpact of Loan facility to different sectors\n\nManufacturing sector: The SMEs in the country have contributed immensely to the manufacturing sector\n\nThe sector as the backbone of the nation\u2019s economy play a major role in mitigating the problem of imbalance in the balance of payment accounts through its export promotion. Apart from providing opportunities to a large number of capable and potential entrepreneurs, It can as well help to release scarce capital towards productive use.\n\nEducation sector: Education provides the platform to improve the quality of life and continuous regeneration of knowledge, capacity, and skill in the society for continuous productivity and development. The advent of Covid-19 pandemic has revealed the reality of the dilapidation and poor funding of the education sector in the country.\n\nIn Nigeria, basic education is financed through concurrent financing from the three tiers of government\u2014federal, state, and local government authority.\n\nThe federal, state and local governments have the mandate to provide 50 percent , 30 percent and 20 percent respectively for funding of education to maintain/equip facilities in schools. Records show that for the past ten years, the Nigerian education sector allocation has not reached the UNESCO recommended 10 to 15 percent of the budget in developing countries. This has led to teachers\u2019 strikes at all levels of education.\n\nBut today, Apart from government education funding, schools across the country, especially private schools, have opportunity to secure loan from commercial banks like First Bank of Nigeria through its SME Loan products to meet other pressing needs ranging from working capital to assets financing.\n\nIT sector\n\nIt is a known fact that every business across the country from smallest to the largest firms need dependable modern office equipment that is affordable, but getting such equipment to meet company needs can be expensive. In today\u2019s business, technological advancement means equipment replacement or upgrades that are necessary, especially if you want to muscle power with your competitors. Office equipment finance option such as loans set individual business up to pay for the important equipment of your business need\n\nHealth Sector\n\nThe outbreak of COVID -19 pandemic which impacted negatively on the world economy brought hardship to health sector in the country. The pandemic revealed the poor state of infrastructure and facilities in the nation\u2019s health sector. But Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN\u2019s) N100 billion intervention funds in the sector has helped to revive some companies in the sector. Stakeholders in the health sector also said that with the help of the funds, most local pharmaceutical industries have boosted their production capacities to manufacture facemasks, personal protective equipment PPE) hand sanitizer, gloves, antiviral drugs, ventilators, medical supplies among others. The apex regulator also said N93 billion of the funds had already been disbursed and a positive impact is being felt in the private sector. This therefore showed that a well managed loan facility will not only help to grow a company, but also uplift the growth of the economy in general.\n\nKey Challenges of SMEs\n\nDespite the significant contribution of SMEs to the Nigerian economy, it faced with a lot of challenges that hindered the growth and development of the sector. Access to additional funds remains one of the biggest challenges facing SMEs and MSMEs in the country.\n\nOther challenges affecting the SMEs include poor capital structure, high cost of production. limited access to long term funds, poor business continuity/ succession plans, weak value chain, supply distribution, logistics, poor managerial and technical skills, lack of access to international markets and labour intensive production processes..\n\nOther challenges encountered by the sector include lack of skilled manpower, multiplicity of taxes, high cost of doing business, among others. The provision of loan facilities is vital for the growth and development of any business. Accessing loan is a great tool to enhancing a company\u2019s liquidity when no cash is available for financing business requirements. The loan facility from financial institutions is distributed at the company\u2019s discretion and can be applied to different projects and departments in the firm\n\nReasons for SMEs seeking for loan facility\n\nBasically, the major reason why SMEs seek for loans is to enable them finance changes in their business that can result in a high return of their Investment. SMEs consider a small business loan to enable the company invest in an expansion opportunity.

          "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation in Ukraine on Thursday with explosions heard soon after across the country and its foreign minister warning a \u201cfull-scale invasion\u201d was underway.\n\nWeeks of intense diplomacy and the imposition of Western sanctions on Russia failed to deter Putin, who had massed between 150,000 and 200,000 troops along the borders of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI have made the decision of a military operation,\u201d Putin said in a surprise television announcement that triggered immediate condemnation from US President Joe Biden and sent global financial markets into turmoil.\n\nShortly after the announcement, explosions were heard in Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, and several other cities, according to AFP correspondents.\n\nPutin called on Ukrainian soldiers to lay down their arms and justified the operation by claiming the government was overseeing a \u201cgenocide\u201d in the east of the country.\n\nThe Kremlin had earlier said rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine had asked Moscow for military help against Kyiv.\n\nThe extent of Thursday\u2019s attacks was not immediately clear, but Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the worst-case scenario was playing out.\n\n\u201cPutin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes,\u201d Kuleba tweeted.\n\n\u201cThis is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.\u201d\n\nRELATED:\n\nRussia Faces \u2018Unprecedented Isolation\u2019 Over Ukraine Attack, Says EU\n\nBiden Says \u2018World Will Hold Russia Accountable\u2019 Over Ukraine Attack\n\nUkrainians Wake Up To Sounds Of bombings As War Hits Home\n\nBiden immediately warned of \u201cconsequences\u201d for Russia and that there would be a \u201ccatastrophic loss of life and human suffering\u201d.\n\nNATO\u2019s chief condemned Russia\u2019s \u201creckless and unprovoked attack\u201d on Ukraine.\n\nPutin\u2019s move came after Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky made an emotional appeal late on Wednesday night to Russians not to support a \u201cmajor war in Europe\u201d.\n\nSpeaking Russian, Zelensky said that the people of Russia were being lied to about Ukraine.\n\nZelensky said he had tried to call Putin but there was \u201cno answer, only silence\u201d, adding that Moscow now had around 200,000 soldiers near Ukraine\u2019s borders.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday the separatist leaders of Donetsk and Lugansk sent separate letters to Putin, asking him to \u201chelp them repel Ukraine\u2019s aggression\u201d, Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nThe two letters were published by Russian state media and were both dated February 22.\n\nTheir appeals came after Putin recognised their independence and signed friendship treaties with them that include defence deals.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Moment of peril\u2019 \u2013\n\nPutin had for weeks defied a barrage of international criticism over the crisis, with some Western leaders saying he was no longer rational.\n\nHis announcement of the military operation came ahead of a last-ditch summit involving European Union leaders in Brussels planned for Thursday.\n\nThe 27-nation bloc had also imposed sanctions on Russia\u2019s defence minister Sergei Shoigu and high-ranking figures including the commanders of Russia\u2019s army, navy and air force, another part of the wave of Western punishment after Putin sought to rewrite Ukraine\u2019s borders.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council met late Wednesday for its second emergency session in three days over the crisis, with a personal plea there by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to Putin going unheeded.\n\n\u201cPresident Putin, stop your troops from attacking Ukraine, give peace a chance, too many people have already died,\u201d Guterres said.\n\nThe US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, warned that an all-out Russian invasion could displace five million people, triggering a new European refugee crisis.\n\nBefore Putin\u2019s announcement, Ukraine had urged its approximately three million citizens living in Russia to leave.\n\n\u201cWe are united in believing that the future of European security is being decided right now, here in our home, in Ukraine,\u201d President Zelensky said during a joint media appearance with the visiting leaders of Poland and Lithuania.\n\nWestern capitals said Russia had amassed 150,000 troops in combat formations on Ukraine\u2019s borders with Russia, Belarus and Russian-occupied Crimea and on warships in the Black Sea.\n\nUkraine has around 200,000 military personnel, and could call up to 250,000 reservists.\n\nMoscow\u2019s total forces are much larger \u2014 around a million active-duty personnel \u2014 and have been modernised and re-armed in recent years.\n\n\u2013 High cost of war \u2013\n\nBut Ukraine has received advanced anti-tank weapons and some drones from NATO members. More have been promised as the allies try to deter a Russian attack or at least make it costly.\n\nShelling had intensified in recent days between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists \u2014 a Ukrainian soldier was killed on Wednesday, the sixth in four days \u2014 and civilians living near the front were fearful.\n\nDmitry Maksimenko, a 27-year-old coal miner from government-held Krasnogorivka, told AFP that he was shocked when his wife came to tell him that Putin had recognised the two Russian-backed separatist enclaves.\n\n\u201cShe said: \u2018Have you heard the news?\u2019. How could I have known? There\u2019s no electricity, never mind internet. I don\u2019t know what is going to happen next, but to be honest, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a Russian village around 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the border, AFP reporters saw military equipment including rocket launchers, howitzers and fuel tanks mounted on trains stretching for hundreds of metres.\n\nRussia has long demanded that Ukraine be forbidden from ever joining the NATO alliance and that US troops pull out from Eastern Europe.\n\nSpeaking to journalists, Putin on Tuesday set out a number of stringent conditions if the West wanted to de-escalate the crisis, saying Ukraine should drop its NATO ambition and become neutral.\n\nWashington Wednesday announced sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which Germany had earlier effectively suspended by halting certification.\n\nAustralia, Britain, Japan and the European Union have all also announced sanctions.",

          "title": "Russian Military Vehicles Cross into Ukraine from Annexed Crimea",
          "text": "Security camera footage on Thursday shows a line of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine from Russian-annexed Crimea.\n\nRussian troops launched a wide-ranging attack on Ukraine on Thursday, as President Vladimir Putin cast aside international condemnation and sanctions and warned other countries that any attempt to interfere would lead to \u201cconsequences you have never seen.\u201d\n\nBig explosions were heard before dawn in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa as world leaders decried the start of an invasion that could cause massive casualties, topple Ukraine\u2019s democratically elected government and threaten the post-Cold War balance on the continent.\n\nUkrainians started fleeing some cities, and the Russian military claimed to have incapacitated all of Ukraine\u2019s air defenses and air bases within hours.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared martial law, saying Russia has targeted Ukraine\u2019s military infrastructure. Ukrainians who had long braced for the prospect of an assault, while never knowing precisely when it would come, were urged to stay home and not to panic even as the country\u2019s border guard agency reported an artillery barrage by Russian troops from neighboring Belarus.\n\nPresident Joe Biden pledged new sanctions to punish Russia for the aggression that the international community had expected for weeks but could not prevent through diplomacy.\n\nPutin justified it all in a televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine \u2014 a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion. He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia\u2019s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees. He also claimed that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to \u201cdemilitarize\u201d it and bring those who committed crimes to justice.\n\nBiden in a written statement condemned the \u201cunprovoked and unjustified attack,\u201d and he promised that the U.S. and its allies would \u201chold Russia accountable.\u201d The president said he planned to speak to Americans on Thursday after a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders. More sanctions against Russia were expected to be announced Thursday.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the assault as a \u201cfull-scale invasion\u201d and said Ukraine will \u201cdefend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.\u201d\n\nIn the capital, Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko advised residents to stay home unless they are involved in critical work and urged them to prepare go-bags with necessities and documents if they need to evacuate. An Associated Press photographer in Mariupol reported hearing explosions and seeing dozens of people with suitcases heading for their cars to leave the city.\n\n\u201cWe are facing a war and horror. What could be worse?\u201d 64-year-old Liudmila Gireyeva said in Kyiv. She planned to head to the western city of Lviv and then to try to move to Poland to join her daughter. Putin \u201cwill be damned by history, and Ukrainians are damning him.\u201d\n\nThe Russian claims about knocking out Ukrainian air defenses and Ukrainian claims to have shot down several Russian aircraft could not immediately be verified. The Ukrainian air defense system and air force date back to the Soviet era and are dwarfed by Russia\u2019s massive air power and its inventory of precision weapons.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said it was not targeting cities, but using precision weapons and claimed that \u201cthere is no threat to civilian population.\u201d\n\nAnton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, said on Facebook that the Russian military had launched missile strikes on Ukrainian military command facilities, air bases and military depots in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro.\n\nAfter the initial explosions in Kyiv, people could be heard shouting in the streets. Then a sense of normality returned, with cars circulating and people walking in the streets as a pre-dawn commute appeared to start in relative calm.\n\nThe consequences of the conflict and resulting sanctions on Russia could reverberate throughout the world, upending geopolitical dynamics in Europe as well as affecting energy supplies in Europe and jolting global financial markets.\n\nAsian stock markets plunged and oil prices surged as the attack began. Earlier, Wall Street\u2019s benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8% to an eight-month low after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked for military assistance.\n\nAnticipating international condemnation and countermeasures, Putin issued a stark warning to other countries not to meddle, saying, \u201cwhoever tries to impede us, let alone create threats for our country and its people, must know that the Russian response will be immediate and lead to the consequences you have never seen in history.\u201d\n\nPutin urged Ukrainian servicemen to \u201cimmediately put down arms and go home.\u201d\n\nIn a stark reminder of Russia\u2019s nuclear power, Putin warned that \u201cno one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.\u201d He emphasized that Russia is \u201cone of the most potent nuclear powers and also has a certain edge in a range of state-of-the-art weapons.\u201d\n\nThough the U.S. on Tuesday announced the repositioning of forces around the Baltics, Biden has said he will not send in troops to fight Russia.\n\nPutin announced the military operation after the Kremlin said rebels in eastern Ukraine asked Russia for military assistance to help fend off Ukrainian \u201caggression,\u201d an announcement that the White House said was a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation by Moscow to offer up a pretext for an invasion.\n\nPutin\u2019s announcement came just hours after the Ukrainian president rejected Moscow\u2019s claims that his country poses a threat to Russia and made a passionate, last-minute plea for peace.\n\n\u201cThe people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,\u201d Zelenskyy said in an emotional overnight address, speaking in Russian in a direct appeal to Russian citizens. \u201cBut if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.\u201d\n\nZelenskyy said he asked to arrange a call with Putin late Wednesday, but the Kremlin did not respond.\n\nIn an apparent reference to Putin\u2019s move to authorize the deployment of the Russian military to \u201cmaintain peace\u201d in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky warned that \u201cthis step could mark the start of a big war on the European continent.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny provocation, any spark could trigger a blaze that will destroy everything,\u201d he said.\n\nHe challenged the Russian propaganda claims, saying that \u201cyou are told that this blaze will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian people are free.\u201d\n\nAt an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council called by Ukraine because of the imminent threat of a Russian invasion, members still unaware of Putin\u2019s announcement appealed to him to stop an attack. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the meeting, just before the announcement, telling Putin: \u201cStop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.\u201d\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jen Stoltenberg issued a statement condemning \u201cRussia\u2019s reckless and unprovoked attack on Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives. Once again, despite our repeated warnings and tireless efforts to engage in diplomacy, Russia has chosen the path of aggression against a sovereign and independent country.\u201d\n\nEuropean Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised to hold the Kremlin accountable.\n\n\u201cIn these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives,\u201d they said on Twitter.\n\nEven before Putin\u2019s announcement, dozens of nations imposed sanctions on Russia, further squeezing Russian oligarchs and banks out of international markets.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry has shrugged off the sanctions, saying that \u201cRussia has proven that, with all the costs of the sanctions, it is able to minimize the damage.\u201d\n\nThe threat of war has already shredded Ukraine\u2019s economy and raised the specter of massive casualties, energy shortages across Europe and global economic chaos.",

          "title": "Nigeria Airline Operators Deny Fixing Base Fare, Lament Loss of $60m to Bird Strikes, Flight Cancellations",
          "text": "The Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) has denied fixing base fare for economy flight tickets at N50, 000 as travellers insisted that the sudden increase in fares suggested collusion by the association.\n\nThe operators also complained that in 2021, they lost $60 million (N24 billon) to bird strike alone. The amount was used to replace their aircraft engines destroyed by bird strike.\n\nIn addition, they said cancelled flights due to lack of lack of night landing facilities at some airports, known as sunset airports, cost them over N20 billion in 2021.\n\nHowever, indications showed that air travellers have started shunning the airports as airlines have been recording low passenger traffic due to high fares.\n\nSpeaking during a media conference, in Lagos, on Wednesday, the Vice President of AON and Chairman/CEO of Air Peace, Allen Onyema said the N50, 000 ticket price had always been in the airlines\u2019 systems in the last five years, adding that airlines only adjust ticket cost based on their operational costs.\n\nOnyema said what the airlines did was to work out unit cost per seat, which he said determined their basic ticket price.\n\nOnyema who was representing the President of AON, pointed out that cost of aviation fuel was increased by over 200 per cent, with over 100 per cent depreciation in exchange rate in the last two years, while ground handling companies had increased their rates by over 300 per cent, yet cost of air ticket remained below $100.\n\n\u201cPeople have asked us how we maintain our planes with the fares we charge. In as much as we are rendering services, our business must be sustained. The repair of just one aircraft engine can take everything an airline makes in one month. Airline business is not a profitable business,\u201d Onyema added.\n\nHe said that no airline loves to delay flights but factors beyond the airlines\u2019 control cause flight delays.\n\nSome of the causes of flight delays he mentioned included bird strikes, airport apron congestion, lack of space for check-in of passengers, poor airport infrastructure, air traffic flow control, bad weather and unruly behavior of passengers.\n\nOnyema said that bird strike incidents in Nigeria was on the increase despite efforts by the Federal Airports of Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) to stem it, thus forcing airlines to ground aircraft that should be operating and losing huge revenue.\n\nHe, therefore, called on the concerned authorities to provide airport equipment to help reduce bird strikes in Nigeria.\n\nThe AON said it strongly objected to the multiple designation granted foreign carriers such as Qatar Airways and Ethiopian Airlines by the federal government.\n\n\u201cDesignating foreign airlines to multiple airports in Nigeria impede growth of domestic airlines and the aviation sector. All foreign airlines put together do not provide 10 per cent of jobs provided by the smallest airline in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMultiple designation granted foreign airlines would lead to job losses and domestic airlines closing shops,\u201d Onyema added.\n\nMeanwhile, THISDAY investigations have confirmed low turnout of passengers at the airports since Monday, following the hike in airfares to N50, 000.\n\nThis meant that one way tickets would cost over N50, 000 and might increase to N80, 000 to N90, 000 per ticket.\n\nThis was confirmed by some protocol personnel who spoke to THISDAY at the domestic wing of the Lagos airport.\n\nThey revealed that the increase in fares have reduced passenger traffic at the airport.\n\n\u201cYou have to know that the minimum ticket you can buy now is N50, 000. In the last two days I have sold tickets as high as N85, 000; some N75, 000 and some N70, 000. But the traffic is dropping fast. I am sure that if passenger traffic continues to drop, airlines will be forced to bring down their fares,\u201d the source who pleased to remain anonymous said.\n\nTHISDAY spoke to a passenger who travelled from Abuja to Lagos, on Wednesday, who disclosed that many of the seats in the aircraft that brought him to Lagos were empty.\n\n\u201cI was surprised at that time of the day, first flight from Abuja there was so many empty seats. The airlines have to understand that there is no money in this country. It is the middle class that flies. If they shun air travel the money bags cannot sustain their operations,\u201d he said.\n\nA spokesman of one of the major airlines confirmed to THISDAY that passenger traffic has dropped and he was worried that it would drop further.\n\nChinedu Eze",

          "text": "Multinational oil and gas companies, Shell and Total Energies, have stressed the need for the Nigerian government to provide some incentives to attract more investors into the nation\u2019s gas sector.\n\nThe international oil companies (IOCs) specifically called for an amendment in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) to provide more clarity and better fiscal terms for Deepwater gas investments, insisting that more clarity on gas marketing terms would help to attract more investors into the gas space.\n\nThe Managing Director, Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCO), Mrs. Elohor Alboni and the Deputy Managing Director, Total Energies Deepwater, Mr. Victor Bandele, jointly opined that such incentives were needed now that the country is moving aggressively towards gas, having chosen gas as Nigeria\u2019s transition fuel.\n\nThey spoke at a panel at the ongoing sixth edition of Sub-Saharan African Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (SAIPEC 2022) with the theme: \u201cFostering Collaboration to Create Cross Border Partnerships across the Oil, Gas and Energy Spectrum\u201d.\n\nThe topic of the panel session was: \u201cIOCs: Dynamics of Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s Energy, Oil, Gas Industry, as We Strive to Low Carbon Future.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on how the PIA would impact investment in low carbon economy in Nigeria, Bandele said, \u201cSo, there is a drive for gas. We are still asking for the terms of the gas, the terms for the marketing part of the gas, to be such that it would be extremely attractive for the investors.\n\n\u201cBut when you look at the Act itself, it has brought a lot of clarity to the fiscal terms. So, all the investors can now come in and look at the terms and decide whether it is comfortable, that they feel good about it, and want to invest in this country.\n\n\u201cI think that the area that is silent in the Act that I want to really point out is the one around, if one has a solution, that you can actually approach government with the solution and get incentives from government.\n\n\u201cSo, this is something that is not so obvious. But I think they tried to as much as possible bring that out. I think in the coming years or coming months, we would see clarity on how we can move forward on new projects that will be attractive to the investor, and that will be very good for the country itself.\u201d\n\nHe, however, stated that the PIA brought clarity as to where government wants to drive the industry to, adding that most of the government\u2019s aspirations and initiatives being pushed on gas were all expressed in the legislation.\n\nOn her part, Alboni, who was represented at the panel by the General Manager, Business Development and Government Relations, Shell Companies in Nigeria, Mr. Bashir Bello, said issues around Deepwater gas provisions in the PIA need to be reviewed to bring in better fiscal terms.\n\nShe explained that the review of the PIA for a better fiscal terms for gas investment would allow investors to support government efforts in achieving low carbon economy and increasing gas production.\n\nPeter Uzoho",
