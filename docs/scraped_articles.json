          "title": "Despite ransom payment, bandits still kill our people; abduct wives, daughters \u2014 Farmers lament",
          "text": "Bandits\n\n\u2022For how long can we continue like this \u2014 a worried farmer asks\n\nBy Wole Mosadomi\n\nIt sounds unbelievable but it is true. Farmers in Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State are now more worried than their counterparts elsewhere in the state because they have reached the end of their wits regarding what to do in order to survive the persistent attacks and seizure of their men by bandits.\n\n\n\nIncidentally, Shiroro LGA is one of the worst-hit by banditry in the state\n\nand the evil men are not in a hurry to stop their onslaught on people of the\n\narea.\n\n\n\nWhat worries them most is that many in the area have lost their wives, husbands, children and property since the criminal elements have made it a policy to descend on\n\nthem at will. As predominant farmers, this rainy season is the time for them to recoup their losses and forge ahead, but it is becoming one of the worst periods of their lives.\n\n\n\nThey are ready to go back to their ancestral homes to begin life anew by farming but they cannot. Findings by Arewa Voice indicate that in their earnest bid to return to\n\ntheir ancestral homes and carry on with farming, the only occupation they know and have been depending on as their mainstay, the natives entered into verbal \u201cagreements\u201d with the bandits to allow them go back to their farms, but the \u201coath\u201d taken by the two sides have severally been broken by the bandits.\n\n\n\nCo-convener, Concerned Shiroro Youths of Niger State, Comrade Bello Ibrahim, explained that the situation in the area had degenerated to an extent that farmers\n\nin most communities in the areas have to contribute money to bribe the bandits to allow them access to their farms.\n\n\u201cMy area is very wide because it has eight political wards across River Shiroro. Allawa, for instance, has security presence and that is why people from that area have returned to their farms. But the rest of the places don\u2019t have any protection from the bandits and they cannot return to their farms.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, the locals went into a local arrangement with the bandits which now allows them to go back to their homes. The arrangement is that you pay a certain amount of\n\nmoney to the bandits and also bribe them by providing them with motorcycles.\n\nThe number of motorcycles given to them depends on the locality. Even the cash paid\n\nthem also differs. Some three or more communities may come together to contribute the money.\n\n\n\n\u201cI know of a village that paid N2.5m and one motorcycle to the bandits to allow them access to their farms. However, the problem they still have after these payments and\n\nafter returning home is that the communities in question have now become lawless.\n\nLawless in the sense that the bandits after collecting the ransom come in and go out of the communities at will. That is the situation right now.\n\n\n\n\u201cLike in Kurebe, for instance, they have a pathetic experience. These bandits are of two groups. One of them has affiliation with Boko Haram and this Boko Haram group\n\ncame to Kurebe, marched the villagers to the Mosque and ordered that whoever has grown up girls from 13 years upward should get them married soonest.\n\nThe bandits brought Christians and Muslims in Kurebe to the Mosque and warned\n\nthem to comply with their directives to get their daughters married off by them or face their wrath,\u201d the youth leader revealed.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe effect of all these is that if they like your wife, they just point to her and take her away and you have nothing to say. Based on these developments, most farmers have\n\nnot returned home to farm and this poses a great danger not only for food security across the country but a clear indication that all is not yet well in terms of security of lives and properties of the people in Shiroro Local Government.\n\n\n\nSome farmers in the area interviewed also corroborated what the youth leader said, adding that most painful is the fact that despite \u201csettling\u201d the bandits, they still come\n\nback to unleash terror on them, destroying their cash crops and even kill some of them and kidnap others.\n\n\n\nOne of the farmers, Yakubu Ibn Yahaya, a farmer from Shiroro, said there was no indication that the security situation in the areas would ever improve to encourage them to return to their farms in the near\n\nfuture.\n\n\u201cHonestly, there is no security as it is. We farmers contribute money to give to bandits to allow us to farm for this planting season but regrettably, they still come back to\n\nattack us after collecting the ransom. As I am talking to you, about 80 percent of our people have been displaced by bandits, while the remaining ones have taken the risk\n\nto still stay back and farm in their troubled communities.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother farmer, Zubairu Adamu, who is also from Shiroro Local Government said that having been attacked severally most of the farmers in the area had to flee their homes in order to save their lives and were not in a hurry to return home.\n\n\u201cThere is no way I can return home given the level of attacks being unleashed by the hoodlums now,\u201d Adamu said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe contributed money before the rainy season based on agreement between the farmers and the bandits that they would allow us to farm, but to our surprise, when we started farming, some of them came back and started destroying the ripe and\n\nmatured maize we were about to harvest.\n\n\u201cApart from destroying the farm produce, they also kidnap our\n\nchildren and at times our wives,\u201d he lamented.\n\n\n\nYakubu Yahaya, another farmer in Gurmana, described his experience with the bandits thus: \u201cThey will come in the evening, sit with us, chat with us and when going back, they will forcefully go away with one or two of our daughters and at other times, with our wives and sometimes bring them back the next day.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know why they usually take them away and they will tell us not to talk or ask questions. If they see you with an Android phone, they will insist on using it, and we have no option than to give it to them. This is an indication that we are not safe yet.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe, therefore, appealed to government to wade into the matter in order to save the lives and property of people from the area.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we do at times is to leave our families in the town, then go and farm in the villages. But we will later go back home in the afternoon because we cannot spend much time on our farms again. But the question now is: for how long can we continue\n\nto live under perpetual fear?\u201d Yahaya asked.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Lalong signs 2020 revised budget into law\n\nBy Marie-Therese Nanlong, Jos\n\nPlateau State Governor, Simon Lalong has said despite using his position as the Chairman of the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum to prevailed on his colleagues to stand against open grazing by adopting modern ranching, the effort to outlaw the practice in Plateau is being delayed by the State House of Assembly.\n\nHe stressed the bill sent to the Assembly which would outlaw open grazing in the State if passed into law is yet to be passed. Rather, a false narrative accusing the Government of not doing anything is spread in the State.\n\nBut for the recent attacks and subsequent disruptions, the governor disclosed \u201cthe National Livestock Transformation Programme, NLTP would have been launched at the Wase Grazing Reserve to commence ranching and create jobs and other business opportunities.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: Crisis brews in Ondo over Ohanaeze chieftaincy title\n\nSpeaking on Thursday at the Azi Nyako Youth Centre, Dadin Kowa, Jos, while swearing in the Executive members of the Plateau Youth Council, PYC, Lalong urged the youths to be wary of some politicians who take pride in trying to set the youths against the Government by insinuating that the Governor or the Government does not care about the people, or is allowing land belonging to Plateau indigenes to be grabbed by foreign herders.\n\nHis words, \u201cThis is a great opportunity that I have personally longed for, to meet with my dear youths under the umbrella of the Plateau Youth Council which is the beacon of the youth movement in the State.\n\n\u201cThis swearing-in is coming at a time when Plateau State and Nigeria needs the unity, vibrancy, support and positive action of the youths more than ever.\n\n\u201cThat is why I continue to appeal to the youths to eschew violence, hatred, intolerance and bigotry. Rather, our youths should embrace tolerance, diversity, mutual respect and love which are more powerful, enduring, and beneficial to society in the long run.\n\n\u201cYou must resist the toxic narratives that push you to resort to unconventional means of ventilating your grievances. Government shall work closely with the new leadership of the PYC to ensure that our youths are kept abreast and involved in all empowerment programmes of the State and Federal Governments.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he added, \u201cI will like to also speak to my dear youths over the challenges of information mismanagement and politicization of our collective destiny by a few people who want to always cause disharmony between the citizens and the Government using manipulation, lies, propaganda and political gimmicks.\n\nALSO READ: VP Osinbajo blames insecurity on elites\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that in recent times, some politicians have taken pride in trying to set the youths against the Government by insinuating that the Governor or the Government does not care about the people, or is allowing land belonging to Plateau indigenes to be grabbed by foreign herders. This is an apparent lie that has no basis in the face of facts.\n\n\u201cContrary to this mischief, our Government is the first in the history of Plateau State and one of the few if not the only one in Nigeria to sign anti-land grabbing law which we initiated as an Executive Bill. To date, no one has either approached the Courts to lodge any complaint of land grabbing or even sent a petition to me. Yet you hear this narrative being spread like wildfire.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, our efforts to end conflicts between herders and farmers are being ignored and twisted for politics. As Chairman of the Northern Governors, I prevailed on my colleagues to take a position against open grazing by adopting modern ranching.\n\n\u201dI sent a Bill to the House of Assembly which will outlaw open grazing in Plateau State if passed into law. To date, the House of Assembly is yet to pass the law.

It urged President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government to tackle the security challenges ravaging the country to preserve its posterity.\n\nUnited Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria, Mr Edward Kallon, stated this in a statement on the 2021 International Day to Protect Education from Attack.\n\n\u201cUN condemns attack on schools, calls for more efforts to protect students and ensure uninterrupted teaching and learning. Children are traumatised; parents are scared; teachers and school administrators are afraid; attacks on schools are gradually spreading to areas not known to insurgencies. With education under attack, the collective future of Nigeria is under threat. This must stop now,\u201d Kallon said.\n\nHe said whenever teaching and learning is disrupted, the impact on human capital development is enormous as the recovery period always tortuous and longer than the length of the initial disruption.\n\n\u201cAcross the North-East region alone, over 600,000 children remain out of school and some 1.1 million need educational support to stay in school. This has all been compounded by the setbacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States and United Kingdom governments say they have trained nearly 200,000 out of-school-children and youths in Borno and Yobe states.\n\nThey said the training would improved literacy, numeracy, and social emotional skills of the nearly 200,000 out of school children in formal and non-formal settings, with more than half of the numbers, girls.\n\nPresent at the closing ceremony of the Addressing Education in North East Nigeria (AENN) event held in Abuja yesterday were USAID Mission Director, Dr. Anne Patterson, Nigerian education officials and officials of the United Kingdom Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.\n\nThe three-year US and UK government-funded activity would significantly increase safe and relevant educational opportunities for children and youth in crisis environments in Nigeria.\n\nThe programme which was launched in 2018, assisted the Federal Government to create more certified and safe educational environments for girls and boys in Borno and Yobe in collaboration with major local, federal and international education establishments.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

The bill is entitled \u201cA Bill for a Law to Prohibit Open Cattle Grazing in Lagos State, The Trespass of Cattle on Land and for other connected Purposes.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Bill for a Law to impose and charge Value Added Tax (VAT) on Certain Goods and Services, Provided for the Administration of the Tax and Other Related Matters.\u201d\n\nObasa, thereafter, directed the Acting Clerk of the House, Olalekan Onafeko, to transmit a clean copy to Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu for his assent.\n\nObasa commended members of the Assembly for their passion to ensure that the state continue to develop.\n\nThe Assembly had on Wednesday held separate public hearings on the bills with stakeholders expressing support for the bills.\n\nMeanwhile, former president of Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Onueze C. J. Okocha (SAN) has lauded the courage of Governor Nyesom Wike to challenge the constitutional impunity as it relates to VAT collection.\n\nA federal high court in Port Harcourt had placed a restraining order on the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) from collecting VAT in Rivers and directed the state government to take charge of the duty.\n\nFollowing the court judgement, Lagos asked FIRS to stop issuing demand notices for VAT payments in the state.\n\nThe legal luminary noted how such singular courage of the Rivers Government to seek and secure the right interpretation of the constitutional provision has motivated other sub-nationals to also explore their rights as enshrined in the constitution.\n\nOkocha, who spoke on a TV programme monitored in Port Harcourt, stated that the Federal High Court\u2019s declarative ruling in Port Harcourt reaffirmed that Rivers Government was so empowered to collect VAT within its jurisdiction.\n\nAccording to him, the Rivers State Government VAT Law, No. 4 of 2021, that has been assented by Governor Wike is also in line with the country\u2019s constitutional provision.\n\nHe said: \u201cRivers State Government went to court against Federal Inland Revenue Service ( FIRS) and won the case. FIRS later filed an appeal in the Court of Appeal. But returned to the Federal High Court to demand for a stay of execution. But, the court refused the application and dismissed it.\u201d\n\nThe legal icon, who pointed out that though the case is at the Court of Appeal and at the instance of FIRS, it could be a long legal battle that would get to the Supreme Court, but it would not stop Rivers State from collecting VAT within the State.\n\nOkocha explained: \u201cSo, the law now is that Rivers State Government is entitled to collect Valued Added Tax (VAT) in Rivers State. Any other state can make its laws on Valued Added Tax (VAT).\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

It is also another way of defying the federal spirit of the constitution as lands are vested in the state governors.\n\n\u201cIf the governors granted the lands being asked for, cattle colonies would be established in these estates as revealed in the view expressed by Prince Paul Ikonne, the Executive Secretary of the National Agriculture Land Development Agency (NALDA).\n\n\u201cStates should reject this attempt, particularly since the farm estates NALDA is using as an excuse to grab lands for the FG \u201care familiar territory for many states, especially in the South West that inherited farm estates from the defunct Regional Government of late Chief Obafemi Awolowo.\u201d\n\nAfenifere told the Federal Government to stop its actions and policies that are impeding the practice of true federalism in the country, adding that the Rivers State Government has further enhanced the practice of true federalism bases on the litigation it initiated against the Federal Government on Value Added Tax (VAT).\n\nAccording to Afenifere, the rulings by Justice Stephen Dalyop Pam of the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt on August 9 and on September 6, have earned the judiciary an epaulet as an institution that is not only capable of ensuring justice but is actually working on deepening federalism in the country.\n\nJustice Pam had while delivering judgments on August 9 in Suit No. FHC/PH/CS/149/2020, filed by the Attorney-General for Rivers State (plaintiff), against the Federal Inland Revenue Service (first defendant) and the Attorney General of the Federation (second defendant) had said that allowing the Federal Government, through FIRS, to continue to collect VAT would negate the spirit of the federal system of government that Nigeria is supposed to run. The judge reiterated the position, while ruling on Tuesday, September 7, the case brought by the FIRS.\n\nAfenifere called on the state governments to use the opportunity provided by the landmark judgments to explore other areas that the constitution empowers them to assert themselves as federalists, saying they should step up actions that would liberate the states from the stronghold of the Federal Government that has \u201cturned Nigeria into a unitary state, in contradiction to the federal spirit prescribes by the constitution. They should be rest assured of Afenifere support as they give vent to power devolution and entrenchment of true federalism in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAreas in which the states need to assert themselves include agriculture, health, education, electricity, physical planning, title registration, registration and production of vehicle number plates and casino licensing, as Lagos State Government did in the past.\u201d\n\nAfenifere suggested that a roundtable discussion could be held between states and Federal Government to clear the fear on possible multiple taxation. The group also advised FIRS to resist the temptation to keep appealing the judgment that empowers states to collect local taxes, saying \u201csuch a step is another assault on the federal system that we are supposed to be running.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nIslamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, is attempting to relocate fleeing terrorists that are being smoked out of the Northern Nigeria via military operations to Oke-Ogun, which is a political division of Oyo State, with 10 local government areas.\n\nThis allegation was made by a socio-political group, under the aegis of Alliance for Oke-Ogun Development (A.O.D), following Gumi\u2019s recent visitation to Igboho, headquarters of Orelope Local Government Area of Oyo State.\n\nNational Coordinator of AOD, Otunba Abiodun Fasasi, in a statement, described Gumi\u2019s visit to Igboho as a clandestine move by him and others to further deepen the alleged \u2018Fulanisation Agenda\u2019 of Nigeria, adding that the move would make Oke-Ogun area, another hotbed of crisis between the dwellers and the marauding Fulani herders.\n\nA video clip went viral on social media recently in which Gumi was seen with a Professor of Hematology-Oncology, Usman Yusuff, making comments at Muslim Grammar School, Igboho, saying the visit was for the continued unity of Nigeria.\n\nFasasi hinted that the recent victory of the Nigerian Army over terrorists in the North East and other parts of northern Nigeria, necessitated the visit of Gumi, Prof. Usman and others to Oke-Ogun area and called on the traditional rulers in the region to be wary of insiders, who are ready to sell out to terrorists.\n\nThe group also called on the Federal Government, especially the Directorate of State Security Service (DSS) to invite Gumi in a bid to finding out the real reasons for the visit of Gumi and others to Oke-Ogun area.\n\nFasasi stated: \u201cIt is rather mindboggling to hear that Sheikh Gumi and his co-travelers were in Igboho, Oke-Ogun. Sheikh Gumi is known all over the world as the harbinger, mastermind, mouthpiece, solicitor and patron of banditry in Nigeria. To him, there\u2019s nothing wrong with banditry. As a matter of fact, he sees it as a flourishing business.\n\n\u201cIt is more disturbing that an indigene of Oke-Ogun can willingly be a host to a personality like Gumi. We want the DSS to investigate the real reason for his visit. And the host equally, has to be investigated. This is a person consumed by his passion for banditry to the extent of drawing an analogy between banditry and Niger Delta militancy.\n\n\u201cAs if that\u2019s not enough, he is the one saddled with the responsibility of championing the course of amnesty for the bandits. He recently accused the Nigerian President of political gullibility for tackling the bandits, trivializing the military action ongoing in Zamfara State, known as festival of fire by tagging it \u2018unwise decision that no reasonable solution can come out of.\u2019\n\n\u201cAgainst the backdrop of the above, convincingly we now know better who Sheikh Gumi is, having seen the handwriting on the wall as the military action is neutralising, eliminating and destroying the bandits in their scores and as the bandits are fleeing the northern parts of the country, especially Zamfara and its environs.

          "title": "Why Nigeria\u2019s vehicle financing culture is struggling to take flight",
          "text": "Owning a personal vehicle is of economic importance. Next to housing, transportation is often the second largest expenditure for the majority of urban households anywhere in the world. But insufficient purchasing power among middle-class Nigerians coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing puts cars out of reach for over 90% of the population.\n\nIn developed economies, car loans and vehicle financing schemes help people spread out vehicle payments over several months or even years. However, the auto financing space is still very nascent in Nigeria, with available car loans significantly costly and inaccessible.\n\nTwo major factors that influence the access and affordability of vehicle financing in Nigeria are interest rates and the value of the vehicle being financed, according to Gbenro Dara.\n\nOver the past decade, Dara has led four online marketplaces with significant interests in the automotive sector and also pioneered an automated process for used car loans as CEO of Cheki (which was recently acquired by Autochek).\n\nExpensive interest rates\n\nA number of banks and startups currently provide car loans but they aren\u2019t exactly cheap, and accessing them can be difficult due to prohibitive credit criteria and high-interest rates. According to Dara, the latter factor is the biggest drawback when it comes to vehicle financing in Nigeria. \u201cThe interest rates available in the auto financing market is the main challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nFor car loans, banks in Nigeria lend at rates between 18% to 30% per annum compared to an average interest rate of less than 5% available for a 72-month vehicle financing scheme in the United States.\n\nGetting a loan from commercial banks in Nigeria also comes with a lot of paperwork and processes, making their approval rate very low, at about 20%.\n\nMicrofinance banks, on the other hand, are less strict with requirements, as opposed to larger banks which are more focused on mid-to-large corporate clients. Several microlenders have developed vehicle financing programs, which take the asset as collateral. However, they are still not able to offer car loans at significantly lower interest rates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken out a vehicle loan for 4% per month for a 2-year tenor, and ended up paying almost two times the amount of the invoice value of the vehicle,\u201d Dara said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not entirely the fault of the banks as they derive their interest rates from the prime lending rate of the Central bank of Nigeria.\u201d He however called on banks to do better by innovating more for the growth of the automotive sector in Nigeria.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe tokunbo problem\n\nThe vehicle market in Nigeria remains heavily dominated by imported second-hand cars (popularly referred to as tokunbo), primarily due to the inability of most Nigerians to afford brand new cars, including those assembled locally. According to Dara, the predominance of used vehicles discourages banks from providing car loans.\n\nThere are approximately 15 million vehicles on Nigerian roads with most of them older than 20 years. The average age of private cars in major cities in the country is 14 years, most of which are likely to have been resold to more than five owners. For light commercial vehicles such as danfos and molues, the average age is estimated at 24 years.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, total new vehicle registrations annually in Nigeria are estimated at 400,000 (excluding motorcycles), but only 5% of which are brand new vehicles. The rest are mostly shipped in from North America, Europe, and Dubai.\n\nThese vehicles, which have often suffered accidents, been repossessed, are out of warranty, and with little or no history about prior usage and service, are referred to as \u201cgrey imports\u201d. That is, they are traded outside authorised channels and since they\u2019re not purchased from official manufacturers or accredited dealers, do not come with the service support of the producer.\n\nTo minimise the risks associated with providing credit for imported second-hand vehicles, most banks that finance used cars do so through partnerships with car dealers, and not directly. For example, Tokunbocars.ng is backed by Guaranty Trust Bank, UBA, Zenith, and Sterling Bank.\n\nA drag on the local auto industry\n\nThe lack of proper vehicle financing schemes in the country not only deprives the average Nigerian of a chance of getting a personal vehicle but also has implications on the local automotive industry.\n\nDespite being the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria\u2019s new passenger vehicle sales are far behind sales in countries such as South Africa, Egypt, and Morocco.\n\nGlobally, about 80 to 95% of purchases of cars are done through loans and leasing by government or private entities. In the United States, it is estimated that 85% of all new car purchases are financed.\n\nWithout such financing mechanisms available to buy cars in Nigeria, locally-made brand new vehicles are out of the financial reach of most Nigerians, the majority of whom have seen their purchasing power dwindle over the years.\n\nIn 2020, less than 10,000 brand new cars were sold in Nigeria, compared to over 247,000 in South Africa. According to unofficial figures from auto dealers cited by Dara, up to 80% of the purchases in Nigeria were made by the government and large corporations, mostly with bank credit and at non-retail rates.\n\nBeyond the direct impact on how Nigerians commute, the current state of vehicle financing in Nigeria leaves the country\u2019s auto industry facing challenges that stall its growth potential.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "Africa\u2019s largest telecom company MTN Group is reportedly in talks with potential international buyers for its wireless business in Afghanistan per Bloomberg.\n\nThis is part of the company\u2019s plans to accelerate its exit from the Middle Eastern country.\n\nThe South Africa headquartered company is currently the market leader in Afghanistan with a 40% share and is in discussions with several parties in ongoing negotiations to sell its Afghanistan arm. A writedown of MTN\u2019s Afghanistan business without any proceeds from disposal is estimated to cost about R700 million ($49 million) according to undisclosed sources familiar with the negotiations.\n\nThis move is in line with MTN\u2019s announcement just over a year ago to exit countries in the Middle East over the next three to five years, in order to focus on African markets. The carrier earlier this year abandoned its operation in Syria, citing regulatory demands that made operating there untenable; last month the carrier stated that it was still evaluating options in Yemen and Afghanistan.\n\nThe sale of its Afghanistan unit is crucial to MTN as it plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa. The proceeds will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nUnlike MTN, the other telecom companies operating in Afghanistan, which also includes state-owned Afghan Wireless and Etisalat of the United Arab Emirates, have reassured customers and investors that services will keep running following the collapse of the US-backed government last month while trying to secure the safety of their employees in the country.\n\nMTN currently serves over six million customers in Afghanistan, its planned exit could serve as an opportunity for other Afghanistan telecom players to expand their market share, while MTN does the same in Africa.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How Wave became Francophone Africa\u2019s first unicorn startup with \"radically affordable\" money transfers",
          "text": "Within four years, Wave has gone from a spinoff from Asia and Africa-focused cheap remittance company, Sendwave, to a mobile money service provider worth $1.7 billion; the latest unicorn startup in Africa and the first in the French-speaking region.\n\nThe billion-dollar valuation comes after it raised $200 million in a Series A round led by payments giant Stripe; Sequoia Heritage, a private investment fund and unit of Sequoia; Founders Fund; and Ribbit Capital, with participation from other existing investors.\n\nNo other startup operating in Africa has raised as much in a Series A. OPay\u2019s recent $400 million raise is the region\u2019s largest venture round, followed by Interswitch\u2019s $200 million investment from Visa and Flutterwave\u2019s $170 million fundraise. All were Series C rounds.\n\nTaking on incumbents\n\nSenegal is one of Africa\u2019s fastest-growing mobile money markets, according to a 2020 GSMA report.\n\nIn 2015, the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), the common central bank of eight French-speaking countries in the region (including Senegal), allowed nonbanks to operate mobile money in its member states. Mobile money adoption has expanded since then, driven by early telecom entrants that had the requisite infrastructure and user base (mobile networks and subscribers) to establish the service.\n\nOrange is Senegal\u2019s largest mobile operator and controls around 50% of the telecom market share with nearly 8 million mobile users, twice as many as runner-up Free, which has 4.4 million subscribers. Expresso Telecom, a unit of the UAE\u2019s Expresso Telecom Group Limited, holds 22% of the market share, with over 3 million subscribers.\n\nAll three telecom firms provide mobile money services under the Orange Money, Free Money, and E-Money brands respectively, and along with banks, dominate the digital financial services space. Other third-party providers like fintech have had to make do with small market shares while competing with incumbents.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut Wave, a product created by two Americans (Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk) to lower the cost of mobile money transactions, piloted in 2016 and officially launched in Senegal a year later, entered the market with a 70% cheaper service.\n\nWave offers free deposits and withdrawals via its mobile application and applies a fixed transaction fee of just 1% for money transfers between individuals. Unlike its competitors, Wave passes additional fees on bill payments from users on to businesses. For users without a smartphone, it provides a free QR-card to transact with agents, who are able to open accounts, receive deposits, and execute withdrawals.\n\nAccording to co-founder Drew Durbin, Wave is building a mobile money service that is \u201cradically affordable\u201d. The startup has had to build its own infrastructure, including agent and consumer applications, an agent network, and QR cards in order to provide its super cheap service.\n\nWave\u2019s co-founders, Drew Durbin (left) and Lincoln Quirk.\n\nThe startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nWave\u2019s strategy has managed to shake Orange in particular. To match the ultra-competitive offer that the startup has operated with since May 2020, the telecoms company was forced to lower its prices as well, bringing down bill payment fees to 1% from June 1.\n\nPressure on the network operator also saw it stop users in Senegal from purchasing Orange airtime via Wave\u2019s mobile application, a move that\u2019s been described as anti-competitive by the fintech company and resulted in a dispute currently in the hands of the country\u2019s telecoms regulator.\n\nWave\u2019s branch in Dakar \u2013 which is led by IT veteran Coura S\u00e8ne \u2013 claims to be the largest mobile money player in Senegal with over half of the country\u2019s adults, between four and five million people, making up its several million monthly active users. The Wave app has more than 5 million downloads on Google PlayStore. As reported by TechCrunch, the startup processes billions of dollars in annual volume and has partnerships with UBA and Ecobank for its Senegal operations.\n\nHaving previously raised just $13.8 million since its creation, Wave was able to attract the landmark Series A funding from investors to expand its disruptive business model, which has seen it become one of the most-used mobile money services in Senegal and achieved unicorn status \u2013 startups valued at or above $1 billion \u2013 as a fintech in Africa.\n\nOther African unicorns include fintech startups OPay, Flutterwave, Interswitch, Fawry as well as e-commerce giant Jumia.\n\nWith the fresh investment, Wave plans to deepen its presence in Senegal and Ivory Coast, a country it expanded into recently and is currently running communication campaigns to raise awareness. The startup also intends to grow its 800-man team across product, engineering, and business, as well as expand into other markets it considers regulatory-friendly, like Uganda and Mali.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nCBN\u2019s new directive to banks and payment service providers\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s partnership with MTN Group\n\nMTN Nigeria securing a licence renewal for another ten years\n\nCBN\u2019s new directive to banks and payment service providers (PSPs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage credit: Businesstimes.ng\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has directed banks and payment service providers (PSPs), via a circular, to begin processing end-to-end bulk payments or transfers on their platforms and to track accounts that receive credits in the custody of the sender\u2019s bank.\n\nHow were things done before? Originating banks and PSPs passed a debit entry through the initiating customer\u2019s account and multiple credits to beneficiaries without keeping adequate records of the credit entries in their system. This, reportedly, altered the audit trail and reduced transparency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut with the new method, all end-to-end bulk payments or transfers for customers are processed on the platforms of banks or PSPs, with a detailed breakdown of the accounts that receive the credits held in the sender\u2019s bank\u2019s custody.\n\nThe payment technique currently used by banks and other payment providers, according to CBN, inhibits transparency and alters the audit trail.\n\nDid you know? In August 2021, the CBN ordered all commercial banks to publish the names and Bank Verification Numbers (BVNs) of customers who use fraudulent and unscrupulous methods to obtain foreign exchange from banks on their websites.\n\nThe CBN said that the fraudulent practices include using forged visas and cancelling airline tickets following the purchase of Personal Travel Allowance and Business Travel Allowance.\n\nThe CBN also emphasised that all banks and PSPs should fully comply with the new requirement and other payment system regulations.\n\nFlutterwave partners with MTN Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrican payments startup, Flutterwave, has announced a partnership with MTN Group, Africa\u2019s largest telecoms company, to enable businesses in Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zambia to accept payments via MTN Mobile Money (MoMo).\n\nWhat does this mean? Flutterwave can now offer MTN MoMo as a payment method to its business customers.\n\nIn August 2021, Flutterwave appointed Jimmy Ku as Head of US Growth to drive US expansion and offer payment services to US-based clients, local businesses, and companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, the startup is announcing a partnership with MTN to improve local economies and livelihoods, as well as create opportunities for individuals and businesses across the continent.\n\nMTN MoMo is a fintech platform that offers an electronic wallet to consumers and businesses and access to digital and financial services.\n\nPer Statista, the number of active MoMo users grew from 35.1 million in March 2020 to 46.6 million in March 2021. This means MoMo had 11.5 million active users in one year.\n\nFlutterwave and MTN Group believe that this partnership will extend their previous partnership beyond Uganda and Rwanda to deepen the adoption of digital payments and e-commerce in Africa. This market is estimated to reach $29 billion by 2022.\n\nMTN Nigeria secures licence renewal for another 10 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has renewed MTN Nigeria\u2019s Unified Access Service (UAS) licence and spectrum licence for wireless local loop in the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands.\n\nAccording to MTN, the renewal is subject to licence requirements, including additional payments, which are currently being discussed.\n\nThe telecom giant also said that the Commission acknowledged receiving \u20a671.6 billion for the spectrum licence and \u20a6374.6 million for the UAS licence in payment of their invoices for the ten years ending August 31, 2031.\n\nAccording to Karl Toriola, MTN Nigeria CEO, renewing MTN\u2019s licences for the next ten years is important because it allows the company to keep offering services to ensure Nigerians enjoy the benefits of a modern connected life.\n\nThe licence renewal for MTN Nigeria comes as the telecoms industry marked the twentieth anniversary of the commercial launch of digital mobile services by Econet Wireless Nigeria (now Airtel Nigeria) and MTN Nigeria in August 2001.\n\nMTN Nigeria got its first licence from the NCC in January 2001 for $285 million. On May 16, 2001, it became the first GSM network to make a call, ahead of Econet (now Airtel), which received the operating licence first from the NCC.\n\nInterestingly, after two decades of operations in the country, we discussed the telecom giants\u2019 remarkable milestones.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s first Windows 11 commercial features Master Chief blowing stuff up.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmeka was eight years old when he dropped out of primary school. He couldn\u2019t read and write at the time, and his environment was not conducive for learning.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in primary school, I used to think I wasn\u2019t cut out for school. And the fact that I was living in the village didn\u2019t help matters. My classmates would tease me, which would discourage and make me sad,\u201d he recounts.\n\nAccording to African Library Project (ALP), a non-profit organisation that builds libraries in rural Africa, 22% (30 million) of Africa\u2019s primary-aged children were not enrolled in school in 2019.\n\nThe ALP also says that 48 million youth aged 15 to 24 are illiterate, while more than 1 in 3 adults cannot read. This translates to 182 million adults who are unable to read and write.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer Statista, 66.8% of Africans aged 15 and above could read, write, and understand a simple statement in 2019. With an 80% literacy rate, Southern Africa ranked highest, with Northern, Eastern, and Central Africa recording rates above 70%. In West Africa, however, only 51% of adults could read or write.\n\nEmeka believed he wasn\u2019t cut out for school because he could neither read nor write. Something which could easily have been attributed to dyslexia, a learning disability.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that a developmental delay, such as a literacy delay, is not the same as a developmental disability.\n\nDistinguishing development delays from developmental disabilities\n\nA developmental delay simply means that a child is behind on some developmental milestones; it does not indicate a specific health problem.\n\nDevelopmental delays can occur in cognition, communication, behaviour, socialisation or emotional functioning, and motor abilities. That children have any of these delays doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t match their peers.\n\nTherefore, according to Healthline \u2014 an American website that provides medical information and health advice \u2014 early intervention and treatment can help a child achieve normal development as they mature. A delay indicates that the child\u2019s learning problems will be corrected if given enough time.\n\nA developmental disability, on the other hand, is a neurological disorder with long-term outcomes. And the World Health Organization (WHO) states that most disabilities have three dimensions: impairment, activity limitation, and participation limits.\n\nWhen there\u2019s an overlap\n\nStudies have shown that determining whether a child has a developmental delay or a disability can be difficult because a delay can be an early sign of a learning disability, which is not the same as a physical disability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, most professionals can\u2019t detect learning disabilities until a child is old enough to show deficits in courses like math, reading, and spelling.\n\nDespite Emeka\u2019s literacy delay, he could have improved significantly in a better school environment, with supportive parents and early intervention using tech tools. But he only began to make some progress when he was 20 years old after he arrived in Lagos State.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t start to learn how to read and write until I came to Lagos about four years ago. You know, I was surprised to see children as young as seven read and write. That prompted me to buy a smartphone,\u201d he recalls.\n\nWhen mobile phones play a part in literacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Borgen Project, an organisation in the United States focused on improving poverty through online and community presence, reported that mobile phones help thousands of people in developing countries learn to read.\n\nFor emphasis, a different study by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reveals that hundreds of thousands of Africans use mobile technology for texting.\n\nAccording to a World Bank report, illiteracy in Africa is caused in part by a lack of books. It states that this situation is amplified by Africa\u2019s rapidly growing student population, resulting in textbook-to-pupil ratios of 1:11 for reading and 1:13 for arithmetic in some countries.\n\nHowever, mobile phones can help solve this problem. Before the widespread use of mobile phone technology, Africa\u2019s adult literacy rate (pdf) stood at 52%; by 2008, the literacy rate had risen to 63%.\n\nWith a smartphone, Emeka\u2019s ability to read and write improved while using Google Voice, Google Translate, and Predictive Text before he could start writing and reading. It also helped that he had supportive friends.\n\nBesides the tools Emeka used, there are many options to choose from.\n\nThree tech tools to improve literacy\n\n1. Read Along\n\nFormerly Bolo, Read Along is a free Google-developed language-learning app for children launched on March 7, 2019, to help children have fun while learning to read.\n\nRead Along includes an in-app reading companion that coaches children by listening to them while they read aloud, offering assistance when they get stuck, and awarding stars when they succeed.\n\nIt works best for children who already have a basic understanding of the English alphabet.\n\n2. Rewordify\n\nCreated by Illinois-based high school special education teacher, Neil Goldman, Rewordify allows you to copy and paste any text. It also replaces difficult words with simpler ones.\n\nDepending on the settings, those simplified words can replace the original ones, be seen with a mouse click, or displayed next to the difficult words. It appears to be very sophisticated, and the precision of the simplified word choices is exceptional. Unlike some other websites, Rewordify does not just display word definitions.\n\nFurthermore, teachers can use the site to create various learning activities based on the text that students can complete.\n\n3. Newsela\n\nNewsela is an Instructional Content Platform that brings together engaging, accessible content with integrated assessments and insights to supercharge reading engagement and learning in every subject. Content on Newsela covers topics students care about that connect to the core curriculum and align with standards.\n\nThis app and website, designed for pupils just learning to read and write, does a great job of combining how to read and write engagingly. Letter sounds are taught in small groups and include audio and physical cues for learning \u2014 students will hear the sounds and trace the letters with their fingers or a stylus.\n\nIt includes a spelling game and sends weekly update emails to parents and teachers.\n\nThese and other tech tools have revealed the importance of technology on literacy as these tools are available to everyone, regardless of age.\n\nLiteracy is crucial in social and economic development. It expands knowledge, and a literate person is more likely to understand and adjust to society. Increased literacy in youth and adults has the power to change Africa.\n\nTherefore, access to technology, the Internet, mobile phones, and tech tools are critical to closing the gap between increased illiteracy rates and the challenges in the way.",

          "text": "Nigerian stocks are punching below their weight when compared to peer African markets as investors worry over a slowdown in badly-needed reforms to reset a fragile economy.\n\nSince February this year, the NSE ASI has underperformed relative to the NSE20 in Nairobi and the All Share Index in Johannesburg.\n\nIts -2.5 percent decline since the beginning of the year compares with gains of 9.9 percent in Nairobi and 12.0 percent in Johannesburg.\n\nAnalysts say the narrative for the economy nor demand factors are at all supportive. Although the economy grew by 5.01 percent in the second quarter of 2021, the growth was solely down to low base effects following a 6.1 percent contraction in the same period last year. This means average incomes are still under pressure and poverty is deepening.\n\n\u201cPre-Covid there were some reforming signals in Nigeria, but these have disappeared and the Federal government is reluctant to add to the pain felt by the low-income majority,\u201d analysts at FBN Quest said.\n\nSubsidy removal, whether for electricity or petrol, falls into this category of reform.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s slowing inflation leaves investors little to cheer\n\nDaily turnover on the NSE has averaged USD8.6m ytd (at the I&E/NAFEX rate), unchanged from the same period of 2020.\n\nIt has not exceeded USD10m since the first week of May.\n\nIn Nairobi the year to date figure is as low as USD4.9 million.\n\nGrowth prospects, which are a core driver for investors, are dull.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) currently sees 2.5% for Nigeria in 2021. This compares with 7.6% for Kenya and 4.0% for South Africa.\n\nForeign portfolio investors (FPIs) have become less visible players.\n\nThey accounted for 21% of all transactions on the Lagos exchange in January-July 2021, a sharp fall on the 39% posted in the year-earlier period.\n\nThe pipeline of delayed external payments that developed last year is surely a factor.\n\n\u201cWe do hear anecdotal evidence that some FPIs have made at least a partial exit yet these tend to be investors in debt securities rather than equities,\u201d FBN Quest analysts said.\n\nRegulators forget sometimes that FPIs have a large choice of emerging/frontier markets from which to choose.\n\nTheir favourite in Africa remains Cairo. Further afield, they are heavily invested in markets characterized by a combination of economic reforms, entrepreneurial culture and new listings. Vietnam, the Philippines and Bangladesh tick many of the required boxes.\n\nDomestic institutions were responsible for 46% of all transactions in the first seven months of this year.\n\nA sub-group of this category, the PFAs, have added to their holdings from a low base to a total of NGN860bn at end-July.

          "text": "Nigeria may never achieve its herd immunity goal of fully vaccinating up to 70 percent of its population against the coronavirus pandemic, as access to vaccines remains stifled and hesitancy towards uptake draws the country farther from its vaccination target, health analysts say.\n\nAt best, they think Nigerians might have to live with the virus as an endemic disease such as malaria or see it fade away just how the Spanish flu of 1918 disappeared after killing an estimated 500,000 Nigerians.\n\nThe absence of a local vaccine manufacturing capacity in Africa\u2019s largest economy and its beggared posture of relying heavily on reluctant donors have had analysts conclude that the vaccination execution plan is very unrealistic.\n\nNigeria without doubt falls in the group of 42 African countries that the World Health Organisation (WHO) worries will miss the urgent global goal of vaccinating the most vulnerable 10 percent of their populations against COVID-19 by the end of September.\n\nJust over 9.7 million vaccine doses have been received through donations and procurement, as 1.1 million doses of Johnson & Johnson vaccine supplied to the Federal Government on Wednesday by the African Union added to the stock available.\n\nThis leaves Nigeria\u2019s vaccination rate as one of the lowest in Africa with approximately 2.4 percent of the population covered, data from the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ACDC) show.\n\nRoughly 4 million doses have been administered when peers such as South Africa have done 15.3 million, Egypt 9.3 million, and Morocco 33.3 million.\n\nThe country needs additional 285.6 million vaccine doses to reach herd immunity level, according to BusinessDay\u2019s calculations, and must stop infections on its track to hit 200, 000 confirmed cases and rising deaths.\n\nIt seems Nigeria is sitting on a keg of gunpowder that might only take a very dangerous strain of the coronavirus to trigger a full-blown public health crisis.\n\nAnalysts dread that such an instance, if not prevented, could easily overwhelm the already fragile healthcare architecture, force a lockdown measure and push the ailing economy back on its knees.\n\nRead also: Open grazing: Lagos proposes 21 years jail term for erring herders\n\nFemi Olugbile, former commissioner for health, Lagos State, tells BusinessDay that the shortage of vaccines and the high rate of vaccine hesitancy among the population means the pandemic will linger longer than expected.\n\nHe suggests that the government can demonstrate its determination to fix the shortage by allotting more funds to increase the purchase of vaccines and push for the release of patents on vaccines to African countries with the technology to replicate the vaccines and ramp up supplies on the continent.\n\n\u201cThere would probably never be herd immunity. I think we shouldn\u2019t be wringing our hands, feeling impotent, and talking about how it would destroy our economy. I actually think we should brace ourselves and work on the low hanging fruits: reducing vaccine hesitancy and disinformation and use all the political leverage we can muster to collaborate with the South Africans and Kenyans to get a temporary waiver of the patents\u2019 rights so that we can produce locally in Africa. Nigeria also might produce under the same arrangement or any other one,\u201d Olugbile says.\n\nIf the Federal Government can take responsibility for Nigeria\u2019s situation and halt being the subject of help, the country could move closer to its goals.\n\nHow risky is the shortage?\n\nWithout adequate vaccinations, infections will continue to grow and more cost will go out of government and private coffers into managing the disease.\n\nBusinesses might be unable to keep operations running normally, although the apparent low rates of infection seen in Nigeria when compared with some countries in Europe give a bit of assurance that the country might never really face a dire situation.\n\nAyodeji Ebo, head, retail investment at Chapel Hill Denham, predicts that the adoption of mandatory vaccination will increase among companies to curb infections and keep the work environment safe, but the country won\u2019t reach a lockdown decision.\n\n\u201cI think that based on the peculiarity of our situation, we don\u2019t expect to see a significant spread of the virus.

While for the polytechnics a total of 115,243 spaces were allotted but 79,891 were filled, and the colleges of education had 235,240 admission slots on offer but got 47, 920 used leaving a gap of 187,320 unused.\n\nThe JAMB sold UTME forms for N3, 500 and an added N500 for online registration cost, amounting to N4, 000 for each form. When the total cost per form is multiplied by 721, 888 the product is N1.6bn.\n\nExperts say a lack of interest in some courses offered to them and parental pressure to study a particular discipline have accounted for why the courses are rejected.\n\nFriday Ehrabor, public affairs analyst said ignorance plays a role, too.\n\n\u201cI was also a victim of it. I was offered political science in 1989 and I rejected it because I wanted mass communication and of course I got mass communication in 1990. But with the benefit of hindsight, there is nothing I am doing today that a political science graduate who is properly informed cannot do\u201d, he said.\n\nRead also: How NNPC manicured its books to extract N287bn profit\n\nEhrabor said it is quite understandable if someone who intends to study law is offered English and he turns it down, but if a student wants to be an accountant and he is offered banking and finance, why would he want to turn it down when he can still have his banking and finance degree and end up a chartered accountant through professional examinations.\n\nAccording to JAMB data, students who applied for medicine, pharmacy, health sciences were 452,196 last year but only 36,821 students were offered admission, though the available spaces were 43,717.\n\nIsaiah Ogundele, a teacher said economic challenges play a key role in some decisions to reject admission offers.\n\nHowever, university authorities have their own reasons why they offer students courses they did not apply for.\n\nKunle Akogun, director of corporate affairs, University of Ilorin, said such students probably did not meet the requirements for the courses they applied for or were oversubscribed.\n\nAkogun said some courses are traditionally shunned by admission seekers, and such courses cannot be scrapped by the institutions.\n\nHence, some candidates who fail to secure admission into their desired courses are invariably \u2018distributed\u2019 to such departments.\n\nFor Temitope Olowu, a teacher, some of the reasons could be that the facilities available would not be adequate for the number of applicants. Moreover, he stated if the courses chosen did not have enough applicants, they may offer them a different course.\n\nOlowu said the solution to the problem is not one size fits all. \u201cThe education sector has been the pot of soup for politicians. Money allocated, but little is done\u201d.\n\nOn the side of university education, he suggested some solutions such as adequate funding to expand the facilities in order to accommodate more students. He also advocated that governments should establish more universities to cater to the population growth rate.\n\nMeanwhile, Olowu called on all tertiary institutions to get their courses accredited. \u201cTertiary institutions should get accreditation for more courses because if these courses are available in most universities, the pressure would be minimal\u201d, he said.",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi Osogbo\n\nThe Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminent Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, has described the achievements in Osun State within its three decades of existence as one that humbles older states.\n\nAbubakar said it was no surprise that in Osun\u2019s 30 years of statehood, it had produced a galaxy of stars in all the sectors and areas of human endeavour, adding that the State is blessed in both human and natural resources.\n\nThe Sultan, speaking during the 30th anniversary colloquium of Osun as chairman on Thursday, lauded the government for electing to celebrate its landmark anniversary with a colloquium, adding that the initiative was a significant strategy for linking the past with the present and the future to build a sustainable enterprise.\n\nAbubakar lauded Governor Adegboyega Oyetola who he described as a gentleman governor, man of peace, man of honour, a statesman, a bridge builder, a lover of development and a believer in one, strong and indivisible Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI have followed the programmes of Governor Oyetola closely since his assumption of office. A deep thinker and a silent reformer and performer, he came into government with Development Agenda hinged on adequate, quality and equitable service in all sectors. He has also introduced people-oriented policies based on inclusive governance and sustainable development.\n\n\u201cOne other strategy he has employed to further engrain inclusive governance and sustainable development in the polity is organising this Colloquium as part of the programmes for this Anniversary,\u201d Sultan Abubakar said.\n\nAlso speaking at the colloquium, the Ooni of Ife, His Imperial Majesty Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, paid glowing tributes to the past and present leaders in the State, adding that Osun is now better than how it was at creation.\n\n\u201cOsun is better today than it was when it was created. What we are having here today attests to this fact. The journey of 30 years began with some people\u2019s efforts and we appreciate the founding fathers, past administrators and incumbent governor, for their contributions to the growth and development of Osun.\n\n\u201cOsun is greater than every single individual, and it has become necessary to stress this fact for our people to be careful not to allow politics and other interests to disintegrate us,\u201d Oba Ogunwusi said.\n\nIn his Keynote Address, a former governor of the State, Chief Bisi Akande, lauded the founding fathers and past leaders of the State for what he described as achieving an optimum community and laying a foundation for the prosperous future of the State.\n\nIn their separate remarks, former administrators in the State, General Leo Ajiborisha (rtd.), Captain Anthony Udofia (rtd.) and Theophilus Bamigboye, felicitated the government and the people of the State on the anniversary, urging all to continue to sacrifice for the growth and development of the State.\n\nIn his remarks, the Governor of the State of Osun, Mr. Adegboyega Oyetola, congratulated the citizens of the Osun, describing the State as a full-grown entity that had surmounted its challenges with stoic resilience over the years of its existence.\n\nOn the imperativeness of the colloquium to the State\u2019s celebration of its 30 years of creation, Oyetola said: \u201cThis Colloquium has been designed as the intellectual arm of the 30th Anniversary of our State to interrogate the performances of the State so far, examine possible gaps and project for a sustainable future that we all crave for as a people and desire to bequeathe to our posterity.\n\n\u201cAs an Administration, we have instituted this Colloquium to celebrate our shared values and our collective resolve that have delivered the Osun that we desire and to give vent to our dream to prosecute our Development Agenda which is our strategy and road map to put our dear State on the path of sustainable development.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that just as the foundation laid by our forefathers 30 years ago has earned us a viable place in the national and international space, our decision to lay bricks of contemporary governance structures will build a prosperous and sustainable future.\n\n\u201cThis 30th Anniversary is the end of a phase and the beginning of another: the beginning of sustainable governance and development, the beginning of a new era for a generation of Osun citizens that will ride on the wings of knowledge, technology and entrepreneurship to realise their potential, shut the door against unemployment, create wealth and radically transform the economy of the State.\u201d\n\nThe colloquium was moderated by Professor Niyi Akinnaso. Otunba Titilayo Laoye-Tomori, Dr Segun Aina, Professor Banji Oyelaran-Oyeyinka, Dr Yemi Farounbi, Dr. Reuben Abati, Ms. Bamidele Ademola-Olateju, Mr. Mahmud Jega, Professor Simon Oyeweso, Mr. Babajide Kolade-Otitoju, Mr. Steve Nwosu, and Zainab Okino, as panellists.\n\nThe panellists took turns to laud Osun\u2019s sustainability in terms of infrastructure, health, security and education, in spite of the paucity of funds.\n\nSpecifically, the Group Head of Current and Public Affairs of Television Continental Communications, Babajide Kolade-Otitoju, commended the successive administrations since the State\u2019s creation, adding that Osun has witnessed geometric progression.\n\nHe noted that there is no State in the country that boasts of as many urban centres as Osun.\n\n\u201cWhat is required is the need to focus on developing those urban centres. Once this is done, the migration that we see from these centres to cities like Lagos will reduce drastically.\n\n\u201cPopulation is an ingredient of growth and development. What that implies is that the development of those urban centres will help retain citizens and ensure the return of those who have migrated already. Businesses will grow and Osun will remain on top in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI must commend the governor for what he has done so far. People have described him as a gentleman governor, but I will describe him as a positively gentle governor because he is gentle in a way that brings growth and development.\n\n\u201cBut here is my submission to the governor: Let\u2019s build more inner city roads. I know resources are limited but you have already done the unthinkable with the little resources. Some of us didn\u2019t expect what you have done except we want to lie. We thought it would be more difficult. We know the resources are limited, but let us do our best,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Assets of Nigerian Banks hit N53.64trn \u2013 CBN",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s apex bank, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Thursday, disclosed that total assets of the banking industry hit N53.64 trillion in June 2021, up from N47.82 trillion in June 2020.\n\nThe apex bank also disclosed that total deposits rose from N28.42 trillion in June 2020 to N33.85 trillion year-on-year.\n\nThe bank also noted that total credit also rose from N18.90 trillion in June 2020 to N22.04 trillion in June 2021, signaling that its Loan-to-Deposit Rate (LDR) policy is working.\n\nA member of the CBN\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), Professor of Economics, University of Ibadan, Festus Adenikinju in his personal statement during the July meeting said credit expansion to all the sectors of the economy, in particular manufacturing, oil and gas and general commerce is good for the economy, Newsdirect reported.\n\nHe noted that the CBN intervention funds are delivering on their mandate and boosting credits to the MSMEs and households\u2019 credits.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cPersonal and households\u2019 loans are rising after declining in 2020. Development finance interventions rose by 39.33 per cent to N326.22 billion in May/June from N234.14 billion in Mar/Apr 2021.\n\n\u201cHowever, the credit market in the formal banking is tightening as interest rate bands is narrowing. Lending rates increased relative to the saving rate, thus widening the interest rate spread.\n\n\u201cThis is reflective of increased risks and inflationary considerations of the Deposit Money Banks. (DMBs).\n\n\u201cThe liquidity conditions in the economy remain tight due to open market operations, CRR debits and revenue remittances by government agencies.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the fiscal operations remain precarious.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn April 2021, deficit fiscal operations stood at N3.2 trillion, and 70.8per cent of expenditure is in deficit. M3 grew by 2.02per cent month on month in June 2021 driven largely by growth in Net Domestic Assets (NDA) and contraction in Net Foreign Assets (NFA).\n\n\u201cThe latter is caused by decrease in foreign asset holdings of domestic banking system. The persistence of insecurity in major food producing areas is increasingly impacting food supply and prices.\u201d\n\nHe noted that despite the positive real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth and deceleration of inflation, key challenges remain.\n\nHe expressed that economic recovery remains very weak and fragile.\n\nHe explained that, \u201cIn the services sector, trade recorded negative growth. This sector is critical to poverty reduction and gender equality. Second, inflation is still unacceptably high, affecting consumers welfare.\n\n\u201cThird, the state of the fiscal account is very worrisome. There is continuous underperformance of government revenue relative to the budgeted values, affecting capacity of governments at all levels to deliver on government promises and revving up deficits and public debts to worrisome levels.\n\n\u201cIn my view, one way to address the challenging government revenue, high fiscal deficit and inflation induced through the mechanisms for financing the deficit is for government to develop a framework for winding down the unsustainable petroleum subsidy regime which has negatively affected government fiscal space, accretion to foreign reserves, put pressure on the naira exchange rate and hinder the development of the downstream sector.\n\n\u201cThe subsidy on petrol is no longer sustainable and its retention is difficult to justify under the current economic climate.\n\n\u201cThe passage of the PIB is likely to be beneficial to the economy, attracts investment to the oil and gas sector and facilitate employment and growth.\n\n\u201cHence, the National Assembly must quickly resolve the current impasse and ensure that it is sent to the President for his assent. No matter its shortcomings, the PIB will enhance the efficiency of the sector, streamline regulatory framework, removes the cloud of uncertainty around the fiscal regime, facilitate development of the gas sector, improve on the present state of the oil producing host communities and improve the performance of the national oil company.\n\n\u201cThe present state of the economy justifies the continuation of the CBN intervention programme. The rise in unemployment rate to 33.3per cent in 2020Q4 from 27.1per cent in 2020Q2, especially among the youths and the negative per capita income growth justifies continuous unconventional support for the Government.\n\n\u201cWhile it is true that aggregate credit in the economy is expanding, it is important to link the credit expansion to sectors that are most likely to drive employment growth and poverty reduction.\n\n\u201cIn addition, both the monetary and fiscal authorities must explore ways to diversify and expand sources of foreign exchange to the economy, including through the diaspora bonds, support for non-oil exports sectors, reduce the constraints to exports, reorientate agencies link to the export sector to promote export competitiveness of the Nigerian products.\n\n\u201cWe must also explore ways to derisk the economy, encourage credit expansion by addressing issues like land titling, and challenges to foreclosures, insecurity are inhibitors to ease of doing business in the economy.\u201d\n\nDeputy Governor, Financial System Stability, CBN, Aisha Ahmad in her statement said, the Bank\u2019s development finance interventions in critical sectors which increased by 39.33 per cent from N234.14 billion in May 2021 to N326.22 billion in July 2021 boosted supply and contributed somewhat to the moderation being witnessed in domestic prices.\n\nAccording to her, inflation remains on a downward trend, it remains far above the six to nine per cent inflation threshold of the Bank, thus requiring concerted efforts to address structural factors (security, infrastructure, and logistics arrangements) driving domestic price developments.\n\nShe explained further that, \u201cWith the Committee\u2019s decision to discontinue weekly FX sales to Bureau de Change operators, more stability and transparency is expected in the FX market.\n\n\u201cThe Bank is thus advised to sustain the implementation of policy measures aimed at sanitizing the FX market and also vigorously enforce FX regulations to ensure that all legitimate demands for FX are met.\u201d\n\nShe said the banking sector remains resilient with strong fundamentals.\n\nShe revealed that the banking industry continued to post strong growth with total assets increasing by N5.82 trillion or 12.17 per cent between June 2020 and June 2021.\n\nAccording to her personal statement, \u201cFinancial Soundness Indicators were also robust and significantly met minimum regulatory requirements \u2013 Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) ratio declined further to 5.7 per cent in June 2021, 10 bps lower than the rate recorded in the previous month, while capital adequacy and liquidity ratios remained robust at 15.5 and 41.3 per cent, respectively, in June 2021.\n\n\u201cIncreased credit to growth enhancing sectors of the economy such as agriculture, manufacturing and general commerce helped support output recovery recorded in the domestic economy.\n\n\u201cTotal credit increased by N3.14 trillion from N18.90 trillion to N22.04 trillion between end-June 2020 and end-July 2021 due largely to increase in level of funding and the CBN\u2019s LDR policy.\n\n\u201cWhilst noting the satisfactory performance of the financial system, the Bank must remain vigilant and proactively manage operational, asset quality and other risks to financial system stability, especially with the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe Bank is also advised to increasingly consider Environmental, Social and Governance risk factors and ensure their integration into its policy tool kit given recent unprecedented extreme weather conditions and frequent natural disasters being witnessed across the globe.\u201d\n\nAnother member of the MPC, Deputy Governor, Operations, CBN, Folashodun Shonubi, said, \u201cClearly, the domestic economic environment is still challenged on multiple fronts. Inflation has delightfully trended downward for the second consecutive month after nineteen months of consistent increase, but remained at a significantly high level, with implications for investment and purchasing power.\n\n\u201cThough growth is largely driven by the non-oil sector, it remains fragile at below pre-pandemic levels. The situation calls for a redoubling of effort by the fiscal and monetary authorities to intensify implementation of various stimulus programmes.\u201d\n\nShonubi added that, \u201cWhile I recognise that the Federal Government has made some progress in the vaccination programme, and also facilitating further reopening and stimulating the economy, especially in an era of very low revenue.\n\n\u201cThere is room for more to be done to enhance the slow recovery. Government must aggressively explore every collaborative opportunity with the international community to access more doses of COVID-19 vaccine, while also stepping up the campaign to encourage the populace to come forward to get fully vaccinated towards achieving herd immunity.\n\n\u201cAddressing the widespread insecurity challenges is a task that requires Government to step-up efforts in order to reverse the negative effect on the overall business and investment environment. I also reckon that the fiscal authority will continue to explore private-public partnership options to aggressively shore-up investment in public infrastructure.\u201d",
          "summary": "Nigeria\u2019s apex bank, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Thursday, disclosed that total assets of the banking industry hit N53.64 trillion in June 2021, up from N47.82 trillion in June 2020.\nThe apex bank also disclosed that total deposits rose from N28.42 trillion in June 2020 to N33.85 trillion year-on-year.\nHe noted that the CBN intervention funds are delivering on their mandate and boosting credits to the MSMEs and households\u2019 credits.\nAccording to him, \u201cIn April 2021, deficit fiscal operations stood at N3.2 trillion, and 70.8per cent of expenditure is in deficit.\nM3 grew by 2.02per cent month on month in June 2021 driven largely by growth in Net Domestic Assets (NDA) and contraction in Net Foreign Assets (NFA).",

The legal framework is in existence but not strong and efficient for people to pursue justice for the survivors.\n\n\u201cAdamawa State joined the states that have passed the VAB bill. We still need more states. The child right act is what we need more states to also domesticate. It\u2019s not just the law, but we want the survivors to access justice on time,\u201d Mbamalu said.\n\nAlso, the VAB coordinator in the FCT, Dr Ene Ede, said they would push for high level advocacy to achieve the passage of the gender equality bill.\n\n\u201cAll stakeholders have agreed that in all the laws, the VAB act is important and we want all the states to domesticate it.\u201d\n\nWe still have 8 red states that have not done anything on VAB after six years of its passage by the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThere are states that the assembly members have passed the bill, but the governors have held their assent. We want more states to pass the VAB act because only 26 states have domesticated the Act. Centres must be set up to enable survivors to pursue justice,\u201d Ene added.\n\nThe representative of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) Mariam Kadiri who said they will work with all stakeholders in addressing human rights abuses, added that good laws will help victims to get justice.\n\nUnited Nations (UN) Women representative, Kenechukwu Nbajuogu, said elimination of violence against women and children is key adding that they have been working with the National Assembly to ensure adequate review of the gender-based laws.\n\nThe minister of women affairs and social development Mrs Paullen Tallen who was represented by Iliyasu El-Zubair said 22 states have domesticated the VAB Act through her advocacy adding that more need to be done.\n\nThe representative of the Nigeria Police Force, ASP Usman Imam said the police are the first point of contact everyone looks to when rights are violated but added that they are not adequately funded to pursue such cases.\n\n\u201cWe have responded adequately in recent times with the setup of the gender-based unit that are attending to sexual violence issues. No matter how beautiful a law is, if it is not implemented, it is a big problem. We urge the Nigerian public to call for adequate funding to pursue the cases of abuses,\u201d Imam said.",

          "text": "Sheik Ahmad Gumi has lashed out at Femi Adesina after the presidential aide called him a bandit-lover.\n\nFemi Adeshina stated this on Thursday while reacting statement credited to Gumi that the military offensive would not work and that the bandits \u201care going nowhere.\u201d\n\nFemi Adesina said: \u201cA bandit-lover is on record as saying a military offensive would not work, and that the bandits \u201care going nowhere.\u201d True? False. They are going somewhere. And that is: hell.\u201d\n\nHowever, Gumi in his response titled \u201cWAR HAS NEVER BEEN A SOLUTION ANYWHERE ANYTIME\u201d said Adesina is a fool.\n\nRead his Gumi\u2019s full statement below:\n\nYou bootlicker that called me a bandit-lover! I am not one, but my country-lover, my region-lover, my state-lover, and my people-lover, and humanity-lover.\n\nI am a qualified Medical Doctor who knows what it takes to precisely excise a brain tumor without destroying the delicate surrounding brain tissues.\n\nI was a commissioned military officer who knows what the military is for and what is the capability of our military. I am an intellectual with a Ph.D. from Abroad. I am an Islamic scholar who knows the immorality of killing innocent lives. So, silence for me in this ocean of oblivion is not an option.\n\nOnly a fool would allow his dwelling to be a theatre of war. Unfortunately, how many fools are there. Killing rats in your rat-infested sitting room with an iron rod will only end up destroying your gadgets and furniture probably without killing any. We should not mask out poor governance with artillery power.\n\nSome disingenuous people say: peace and negotiations with herdsmen bandits have failed, and your mission has failed!\n\nI said my mission has not failed but it was sabotaged or discouraged by the same influential people that benefit from the chaos or like us to destroy ourselves and leave the herdsmen in perpetual ignorance.\n\nSome said we have tried amnesty but it didn\u2019t work. You didn\u2019t try amnesty but tried amnesia. Amnesty without rehabilitation, reconciliation, and reparation is no amnesty. Ask the former Niger Delta Militants who killed security men in the past what an amnesty is. What stops us from having a federal ministry of Nomadic Affairs where their grievances and complaints will be addressed?\n\nAll the bandit leaders we saw complained of how some repentant ones were picked and extra-judicially killed after the surrender of their weapons.\n\nWithout their trust of the very unjust system all Nigerians complain of, which they took arms to fight, peace and negotiations with them will not work. This brings our role of mediation.\n\nThey know as religious men we will not deceive them, and they came out in troops to meet us. To our astonishment, it is the same unjust system that turns round to betray our peace mission.\n\nSome of the press for giving a negative narrative, whom I also term criminals-in-purpose, some of the politicians who I see as urban-bandits who out of their share mismanagement of our meagre resources and misplacement of priority cause the death and infirmity of more people than the bandits affect.\n\nOf recent, how many Nigerians die of cholera -a water-born disease- because of lack of simple clean water to drink, or typhoid, malaria, and malnutrition? A nation with a maternal mortality rate of almost 500000/annum because of the lack of adequate maternal health facilities and qualified staff. A country where its highly-priced medical personnel is looking for a window to escape the inferno. Such a country, please!\n\nBy the way, what you may not hear, is that the bandits over the years have developed escape routes from aerial bombardments. They told us: you can only kill our women and children with your attacks!\n\nJust yesterday, two contingents of banditry victims came to me that their loved ones were abducted by bandits in Kaduna suburbs \u2013 Rigachukun and Keke. An escapee engineer in the later said, when he overheard and understood that they were strangers in the area as they were calling the locals to lead them, that gave him the courage to slip through densely grown maize plantations to escape. The point is that, if Zamfara is on fire for them, definitely it goes without saying that they will migrate to other areas. So, is the whole of Nigeria going to be under lock-up in incommunicado?\n\nAs for the economic impact of the areas now under siege, it\u2019s just a matter of time, you\u2019ll hear them crying out. Already yesterday a man from Tsafe came begging because of economic stagnation, one would have thought that Gusau the capital is closer than Kaduna to beg.\n\nAs for those cynics that have no value to add in the dilemma except vituperation, and abuses, we know that is the substance they are made up of. No qualms whatsoever! you don\u2019t expect fragrance from feces.\n\nSo, what is the solution?\n\nGood Intelligence! Good proficient policing, engagement of the local herdsmen in policing, rehabilitation, reconciliation, and reparation of all victims of banditry. The good honest judiciary protects people\u2019s rights. Money and time well spent on these will surely kill the disease and heal the nation of this delinquency, crimes, and bad governance.\n\nOh Allah! on Your Mercy we depend.",

          "text": "Ohanaeze Ndigbo, a pan-Igbo socio-political organization, said on Friday that the Southeast needs Bola Tinubu, the All Progressives Congress\u2019s (APC) National Leader, if they want to produce Nigeria\u2019s president in 2023.\n\nTinubu controls the votes in Yoruba land, according to Dim Uche Okwukwu, Deputy President-General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide. As a result, the Igbos rely on him to elect Nigeria\u2019s president.\n\nOkwukwu, in an exclusive interview with DAILY POST, asked the people of the Southeast to demonstrate solidarity with the APC National Leader, who is ill.\n\nAfter Ahmadu Bello, Okwukwu claimed that the previous governor of Lagos State was the most generous Nigerian leader.\n\nAccording to Okwukwu: \u201cMost of my people don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s important to express solidarity with Asiwaju at this moment, the truth is that even if we are to produce an Igbo President we cannot do it without Yoruba votes and that vote is in the hands of one man and i know he has firm control of Yoruba land.\n\n\u201cI studied in Ife, and I understand Nigeria perfectly. In 1959, the progressives lost government in this country to the conservatives because Zik and Awolowo disagreed. In 1979, they lost again because Zik and Awolowo disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe Northern progressives always lost on to the Southern progressives to come together; Asiwaju is one of the few remaining progressives from the UPN, AG, ACN and today to APC; he is one of the few remaining alive. People don\u2019t understand his role, which is to lead the old to the new. This is why he has a lot of influence in Yoruba land.\n\n\u201cI have said this severally, that Tinubu is the only Nigerian that is politically benevolent, no Nigerian today can nominate his boy to become Speaker of the House of Representatives who is bigger than him. The highest Tinubu has ever attained was the governor of Lagos. The Vice President was his Attorney General in Lagos. This is what they call a large heart; the only person who exhibited these qualities in Nigeria was Ahmadu Bello, who allowed Tafawa Balewa to become Prime Minister while he was still in Kaduna.\n\n\u201cWhat is causing the problem of the South is political greed, and we are cultivating a crab culture. If you put crabs in a basket for three years, they will be there with no one escaping. We need to copy from Asiwaju a lot; what I can not do, another person should do it. On the vice president\u2019s issue, Tinubu, who is a Muslim, asked Osinbajo to go because he is a Christian who is far younger than him. The only political position Osinbajo had before becoming the Vice President was the Attorney General of Lagos State; nobody has moved from that position to the Vice President in Nigeria\u2019s history apart from Osinbajo and Asiwaju allowed it.\n\n\u201cIf we follow the lessons of Asiwaju, we would not complain.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has said he would want to be remembered as the Nigerian leader who stabilised the country in the area of security, economic prosperity and triumph over corruption.\n\nThe president spoke in Owerri at a town hall meeting with South East leaders during his one-day official visit to Imo state.\n\nHe also rated the Igbo as being in charge of the nation\u2019s economy, saying it will be unthinkable that Igbo would leave Nigeria.\n\nBuhari said with less than two years left into his eight-year tenure, security still remains a major priority of his administration.\n\n\u201cIf there is no security, there is nothing anyone can do no matter how much you try or the initiative you have. Security is number one priority and then the economy. When people feel secure they will mind their own business,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president told South-east leaders that while fighting corruption in Nigeria had become very sophisticated and difficult, he would continue to strive to leave a lasting legacy of integrity and accountability in the system.\n\n\u201cNobody can accuse me of having companies or mansions anywhere in the country and I thank God that I try to keep myself as clean as possible, so that I cannot be taken hostage.\n\n\u201cI will do my best to ensure that Nigerians that try hard, succeed in their efforts,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the forthcoming 2023 elections, the president reaffirmed his commitment to free, fair and credible polls, urging the leaders to honestly educate their constituencies on the need to hold their elected representatives accountable.\n\nLauds Igbo\n\nAcknowledging the resourcefulness and enterprising spirit of Igbo people, the president said: \u201cThe fundamental thing about the Igbo people is that there is no town you will visit in Nigeria without seeing the Igbos being in-charge of either infrastructure or pharmaceutical industry.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is unthinkable for me that any Igbo man would consider himself not to be a part of Nigeria. The evidence is there for everyone to see that Igbos are in charge of Nigeria\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nWhile stating that no country can make any meaningful progress without the development of infrastructure, the president expressed regret that successive governments at the federal level contributed to the decay of critical infrastructure in the country.\n\nHe promised that the federal government would complete ongoing key projects in the South-east, including the 2nd Niger Bridge as well as the railway lines and routes linking the region with other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that when you get infrastructure right, Nigerians will mind their own businesses,\u201d he said, adding that as a group, the Igbos stand to benefit more from the ongoing development of infrastructure in the country because \u201cthey are more enterprising.\u201d\n\nHails Uzondinma\n\nThe president had earlier commissioned four projects executed by Governor Hope Uzodinma, including the Naze/Ihiagwa/Nekede/Obinze link road, the Balloon Driven/Flood Control drainage at Dick Tiger Road, the Egbeada Bypass road and the New Exco-Chambers, Government House, Owerri.\n\nAddressing Imo residents at the commissioning of Egbeada bypass named after a prominent son of the state, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, the president said he was very impressed with the level of work done by the state government.\n\nHe said: \u201cSeeing is believing. I received invitation to come and see what the governor wanted me to see. I have seen it now, justified by his integrity in making sure he is working very hard to get things that are necessary for the good life of the people of the state. I\u2019m really impressed with what he has done.\n\n\u201cI am very pleased with what I have seen and I assure you that at the center, I will help Imo within the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI thank you very much for being peaceful and providing the weather for us to go round with the governor to see what he is doing in the state,\u201d the president said.\n\nWe \u2018ll remain Nigerians \u2013 Ohanaeze\n\nIn his remarks, the President-General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof. George Obiozor assured the President of the continuous support of Ndigbo.\n\n\u201cNdigbo are committed to Nigerian unity and there is news for those trying to push us out of Nigeria. Ndigbo in Nigeria are like fish in the ocean and no matter how rough the storm is, it cannot drive the fish out of the ocean.\n\n\u201cMr President, it is in this context, that we see a new dawn in your distinguished presence in Igbo land and believe that on your return to Abuja the significance and substance of this visit will form new foundation of a platform for meaningful dialogue on critical issues of concern to the Igbo nation,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernor speaks\n\nIn his remarks at the town hall meeting, Governor Uzodinma said Ndigbo believed in a united Nigeria predicated on \u201cjustice, equity and fairness.\u201d\n\nHe thanked the president for addressing the interests of Ndi Igbo through deliberate policy initiatives designed to give the people a true sense of belonging, including the ongoing construction of the 2nd Niger Bridge, among others.\n\nHe said the people of the region would remain grateful to President Buhari for approving the establishment of a Naval Base in Oguta local government area of the state, adding that as time unfolds, the economic benefits of the base would manifest.\n\nThe governor also commended the president for strongly supporting the appointment of two prominent Igbos into two key international organisations-Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, Assistant Director-General of Health Emergency Intelligence, World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nHe expressed joy that the president made the visit, \u201cdespite challenges.\u201d\n\nUzodinma recalled that his administration commenced virtual commissioning of projects in March by Buhari.\n\nHe described the projects as strategically and economically important to the people of the state.\n\n\u201cWhen I took office last year, I undertook a holistic study of the needs of the people.\n\n\u201cI found out that the infrastructure of the state had totally collapsed as almost all road networks were broken.\n\n\u201cOwerri was worst hit with flood sacking most part of the city, while property owners had surrendered to the flood, especially within D-Tiger and Chukwuma Nwoha axis,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor said the second phase of the Naze Road, through Obinze Link Road, which was abandoned for over 15 years, would be inaugurated before the end of the year.\n\nHe said his administration had done 46 roads, including the Muhammadu Buhari Avenue, housing the Federal Secretariat.\n\n\u201cWe are doing more because we believe that with the right infrastructure, our economic development will be hastened and life would be much better for our people.\n\n\u201cThat is what informed our decision to permanently solve the perennial flooding in the capital city, Owerri.\n\n\u201cThe balloon-driven tunnel at the base of D-Tiger Road was built to check flooding in the area and to recover property swallowed by flood in the last 20 years.\n\n\u201cThe tunnel is 2.45 kilometers in length, 1.8 meters in diameter and between 0.9 and 11.5 meters in depth with 94 manholes,\u201d Uzodinma said.\n\nThe governor expressed confidence that Owerri would become flood-free, when the second phase of the projects would be completed.\n\nHe said the Egbeada Bypass, also inaugurated by Buhari, would help to ease traffic in the city.\n\nUzodinma further said the new Executive Council chambers, which was rebuilt after 40 years, was equipped with modern communication facilities to ease policy and decision making.\n\nHe thanked the president for his swift response to end the \u201cpolitically-contrived security breach\u201d in Imo.\n\nGovernor Uzodinam further expressed his administration\u2019s commitment to the peace and unity of the country by building a mini-Nigeria within the state.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Chairman of the South-East Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ebonyi, Dave Umahi, and Chief Andy Uba, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress(APC) in Anambra, attended the event.\n\nAlso in attendance were some ministers and presidential aides from the southeast, the Executive Secretary, National Agricultural Land Development Authority, Mr Paul Ikonne, and other top federal and state government functionaries.\n\nSit-at-home in Owerri, Enugu\n\nAmidst all this, one of our correspondents reports that the sit-at-home order declared by the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) was still observed.\n\nIt was gathered that all streets and roads in Owerri, the state capital were deserted and a few people who were on the roads had to trek long distance to their destinations as vehicles were not available.\n\nAlso motor parks, shops, supermarkets, banks, Point On Sale (POS) operators were also not available.\n\nAlso in Enugu state, the streets were deserted in compliance with the IPOB order.\n\nBlueprint observes that markets, banks and offices were under lock and key, while no commercial vehicle was seen plying the major roads in Enugu.\n\n\n\nA businessman who spoke to one of our reporters said the deserted streets was a sign that the region was not happy with Buhari\u2019s APC-led government.\n\nHowever, Gariki market, Awkunanaw was partially open for business, indicating that some residents might have become impatient with IPOB\u2019s sit-at-home order.\n\nPDP reacts\n\nHowever, to the opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), the presidential visit was a \u201cmockery of Imo citizenry.\u201d\n\nThe party\u2019s position was contained in a statement by its state publicity secretary, Ogubundu Nwadike.\n\nIt said: \u201cWe received with mixed feelings the news that President Muhammadu Buhari will visit Imo State on Thursday, 9th September, 2021.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, a presidential visit is a grand event. It is something every state looks up to given the fanfare and camaraderie that come with. Presidential visit is also significant because it does not come easy. It usually provides the president an opportunity to share the success story of any state being visited. In the light of the foregoing, the people of Imo state are expected to be elated at the prospect of the visit of the president.\n\n\u201cBut we note with regret that these familiar feelings and moods are absent in the case of the Presidential Visit to Imo state. Rather than be expectant and elated, the people are actually wondering what the president is coming to do in Imo State.\n\n\u201cTheir feeling of loss and consternation derives from the emptiness and despondency that pervades the atmosphere in the state. In recent months, Imo, once a land of peace, was forcibly turned into a theatre of war.\u201d\n\nOgubundu also said \u201cit is also a well known fact that the governor has done very little to improve the infrastructural status of the state. There are no projects in any sector of the economy. In fact, the little economy the state had has been eroded by bad governance.

Abdullahi Bode and the national secretary, Engr. Saleh Alhassan.\n\nThe briefing was attended by national stakeholders of the group with the theme, \u201cNational Cohesion As a Panacea For Peaceful Coexistence Between Farmers And Herders In Nigeria,\u201d and investiture of HRH Queen Mother, Amina Temitope Ajayi Mama Diaspora, as Miyatti Allah brand ambassador.\n\nAlhassan while speaking on behalf of the organisation, called on the National Assembly and President Muhammad Buhari to intervene and stop current attempt by some states governors to criminalise their means of economic livelihood of cattle rearing through the enactment of satanic and obnoxious laws \u2013 \u2018Anti-open Grazing Laws\u2019 targeted at Fulani Pastoralists.\n\nHe further called for proper funding of the National Commission for Nomadic Education and the expansion of its mandate.\n\n\u201cThis oppressive laws and hostile policies being enacted by state governors are fundamentally going against the Fulani Pastoralist culture, economic interest and constitutional rights.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that inter-state movement of pastoralists is analogous to inter-state commerce, which is an exclusive preserve of the legislative powers of the National Assembly under item 62 of the Exclusive Legislative List.\n\n\u201cTo this effect any action taken by any state Assembly that is in conflict with an above section of the 1999 Constitution as amended is null and void. These laws do not take into cognizance the sociology, economic, production system, climate variations and other push factors that are inherent in pastoralists movements across ecological zones.\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge that Nigeria\u2019s mode of agricultural practice is still primitive all over the country are not consistent with global best practices, so why singling out the pastoralists who have been suffering from the cumulative years of neglect in terms of development from both federal and state governments,\u201d they added.\n\nIn similar a vein, the organisation called on the governor of Benue state, Samuel Ortom to offer an apology to the Fulani race for what it described as tissues of lies, propaganda profiling of the Fulani pastoralist and falsehood against them.\n\n\u201cOur organisation totally condemn the continuous extortion and profiling of the Fulani pastoralists by the Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state and call on him to offer an apology to the Fulani race.\u201d\n\nThe organisation also called on the National Assembly to resuscitate and pass the Grazing Reserves Commission Bill and other Assembly and livestock management bills that were initiated by the previous National Assembly.\n\n\u201cOur Organisation totally condemn the vituperations of one Emir of Muri in Taraba state for the genocidal propaganda against Fulani Pastoralist and have since taken the necessary legal steps against the misguided local monarch and also written to the Taraba state Governor to immediately dethrone him.\n\n\u201cWe commend the courageous efforts of the federal government under the progressive leadership of President Mohammadu Buhari for listening to our consistent call to restore the existing grazing reserves and routes and create new ones, as it is the only sustainable solution to the farmers /herders conflicts in the country.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the security issues in Katsina and other north-west states, the organisation condemned the banned of interstate cattle movement in Katsina by Governor Aminu Bello Masari, describing him as a confused and unserious governor.\n\nThe body attributed the security challenge in Katsina, Zamfara, Kebbi and other northern states to failure of governance.\n\n\u201cGovernor Masari is confused and unserious. Most of the herders are from Katsina and the governor should have created ranches for herders to serve as a good example for other state governors to emulate instead of playing to the gallery by ban interstate movement of castles\n\nWhat is happening in Katsina, Zamfara, Kebbi and other northern states is the failure of governance because the governments failed to provide education for teeming youths, leading them to the bandit.\u201d",

When people feel secure they will mind their own business,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President told South-East leaders that while fighting corruption in Nigeria had become very sophisticated and difficult, he would continue to strive to leave a lasting legacy of integrity and accountability in the system.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nobody can accuse me of having companies or mansions anywhere in the country and I thank God that I try to keep myself as clean as possible so that I cannot be taken, hostage.\n\nEducate Your Constituents\n\nOn the forthcoming 2023 elections, the President reaffirmed his commitment to free, fair, and credible polls, urging the leaders to honestly educate their constituencies on the need to hold their elected representatives accountable.\n\nAcknowledging the resourcefulness and enterprising spirit of the Igbo people, the President said:\n\n\u2018\u2018The fundamental thing about the Igbo people is that there is no town you will visit in Nigeria without seeing the Igbos being in charge of either infrastructure or pharmaceutical industry.\n\n\u2018\u2018Therefore, it is unthinkable for me that any Igbo man would consider himself not to be a part of Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018The evidence is there for everyone to see that Igbos are in charge of Nigeria\u2019s economy.\u2019\u2019\n\nNoting that no country can make any meaningful progress without the development of infrastructure, the President expressed regret that successive governments at the Federal level contributed to the decay of critical infrastructure in the country.\n\nHe promised that the Federal Government would complete ongoing key projects in the South East, including the 2nd Niger Bridge, as well as the railway lines and routes linking the region with other parts of the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018I firmly believe that when you get infrastructure right, Nigerians will mind their own businesses,\u2019\u2019 he said, adding that as a group, the Igbos stand to benefit more from the ongoing development of infrastructure in the country because \u2018\u2018they are more enterprising.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari had earlier commissioned four projects executed by Governor Hope Uzodinma, including the Naze/Ihiagwa/Nekede/Obinze link road, the Balloon Driven/Flood Control drainage at Dick Tiger Road, the Egbeada Bypass road and the New Exco-Chambers, Government House, Owerri.\n\nAddressing Imo residents at the commissioning of Egbeada bypass named after a prominent son of the State, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, the President said he was very impressed with the level of work done by the State government.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am very pleased with what I have seen and I assure you that I will support Imo State within the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn his remarks at the town hall meeting, Governor Uzodinma said Ndigbo believes in a united Nigeria predicated on \u2018\u2018justice, equity and fairness.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe thanked the President for addressing the interests of Ndi Igbo through deliberate policy initiatives designed to give the people a true sense of belonging, including the ongoing construction of the 2nd Niger Bridge, among others.\n\nGovernor Uzodinma said the people of the southeast would remain grateful to the President for approving the establishment of a Naval Base in Oguta Local Government Area of the State, adding that as time unfolds, the economic benefits of the base would manifest.\n\nThe Governor also commended the President for strongly supporting the appointment of two prominent Igbos into two key international organisations-Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, Assistant Director-General of Health Emergency Intelligence, World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nIn his remarks, the President-General, Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof. George Obiozor assured the President of the continuous support of Ndigbo.\n\n\u2018\u2018Ndigbo are committed to Nigerian unity and there is news for those trying to push us out of Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018Ndigbo in Nigeria are like fish in the ocean and no matter how rough the storm is, it cannot drive the fish out of the ocean.\n\n\u2018\u2018Mr. President, it is in this context, that we see a new dawn in your distinguished presence in Igbo land and believe that on your return to Abuja the significance and substance of this visit will form a new foundation of a platform for meaningful dialogue on critical issues of concern to the Igbo nation,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

          "text": "British 18-year-old Emma Raducanu on Thursday became the first qualifier in history to make a Grand Slam final when she reached a fairytale US Open decider against another teenager, 19-year-old Canadian Leylah Fernandez.\n\nRaducanu, who was virtually unknown even in Britain at the start of the year, will become the youngest Slam finalist in 17 years after beating Greek 17th seed Maria Sakkari 6-1, 6-4 in a nerveless display.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the final and I can\u2019t actually believe it,\u201d Raducanu said.\n\nFernandez, a 73rd-ranked left-hander, beat second seed Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus 7-6 (7/3), 4-6, 6-4, for her third Open win over a top-five rival, a feat not seen at a Slam since Serena Williams at Wimbledon in 2012.\n\n\u201cNow I can say I\u2019ve done a pretty good job of achieving my dreams,\u201d Fernandez said.\n\nThe teen prodigies will meet Saturday at Arthur Ashe Stadium, where one of them will claim her first Grand Slam title.\n\n\u201cIs there any expectation?\u201d Raducanu said. \u201cI\u2019m a qualifier so technically on paper there\u2019s no pressure on me.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the first Slam final between teens since 17-year-old Williams beat 18-year-old Martina Hingis at the 1999 US Open, and just the eighth all-teen Slam final in the Open era (since 1968).\n\n\u201cI just want to play a final,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy my victory and worry about it tomorrow.\u201d\n\nRaducanu is the youngest Slam finalist since 17-year-old Maria Sharapova won at Wimbledon in 2004.\n\nShe became only the second woman ranked outside the top 100 to reach a US Open final after unranked Kim Clijsters came out of retirement and won the 2009 US Open.\n\n\u201cToday I wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else except for myself,\u201d Raducanu said.\n\nRaducanu is trying to become the first British woman to win a Grand Slam title since Virginia Wade at Wimbledon in 1977 and the first British woman to win the US Open since Wade in 1968.\n\nWade and British legend Tim Henman were watching.\n\n\u201cTim is such a big inspiration,\u201d said Raducanu. \u201cHe has been helping me, telling me take one point at a time. You have to stay in the moment and can\u2019t get ahead of yourself.\u201d\n\nFernandez, who turned 19 on Monday, had earlier ousted defending champion Naomi Osaka and fifth-seeded Elina Svitolina before Sabalenka, 23, become her third top-five victim.\n\n\u201cI had opportunities but I didn\u2019t use them in the key moments,\u201d Sabalenka said. \u201cI didn\u2019t play well. She deserved this win.\u201d\n\nRaducanu could become the first US Open champion not to lose a set since Serena Williams in 2014.\n\nRaducanu saved three break points in her opening service game then broke to lead 2-0. Sakkari double faulted to hand the teen a 4-0 edge and she took the first set in 36 minutes, aided by Sakkari\u2019s 17 unforced errors.\n\nAn errant Sakkari forehand in the third game of the second set handed Raducanu the only break she needed as she advanced after 84 minutes on an overhead smash.\n\n\u201cI played some of my best tennis to date,\u201d Raducanu said. \u201cI knew I\u2019d have to be super aggressive and execute and I\u2019m just really happy with today\u2019s performance.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Years of work\u2019 \u2013\n\nFernandez, never deeper than the third round in six prior Slam starts, showed the mental toughness preached by her father-coach Jorge in the tie-breaker.\n\nSabalenka netted a forehand with a wide-open court to hand Fernandez a 3-2 edge. The teen never trailed after that, winning the last four points to claim the first set in 53 minutes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s years and years of work and tears and blood and sacrifice,\u201d said Fernandez of her mental fortitude.\n\nThe Ashe stadium music director played the Eric Clapton song \u201cLayla\u201d as the crowd roared when she took the set.\n\n\u201cI have no idea (how I won),\u201d said Fernandez. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s thanks to the New York crowd. They helped me. They cheered for me. They never gave up.\u201d\n\nFernandez sent a forehand long to surrender a break in the ninth game and Sabalenka held at love to take the second set.\n\nIn the third, Fernandez held to 5-4 and Sabalenka crumbled with the match on the line, issuing back-to-back double faults to 0-40 and sending a forehand long \u2014 her 52nd unforced error \u2014 to fall after two hours and 21 minutes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how I got that last point in but I\u2019m glad it was and I\u2019m glad I\u2019m in the finals,\u201d Fernandez said.",

Interestingly, however, some Nigerian leaders have dismissed the military campaign going on to crush the bandits.\n\n\u201cSo-called media commentators, religious and other leaders have discredited decisions of government to shut down communication services, markets, etc. in the states where the military operations are taking place. A religious leader has already proclaimed that the military operations against the bandits will fail.\n\n\u201cWhat a jaundiced view. Maybe Nigeria should return to the era when hundreds of millions meant for arms procurement to fight insurgency, banditry, and other criminality will be diverted and given to religious leaders for prayers.\n\n\u201cInstead of mobilising security agencies to fight the criminals, resources being deployed to fight insecurity in the country should be given to religious leaders to pray for the bandits to come back to their senses.\n\n\u201cThis is perhaps what Sheikh Ahmad Gumi is preaching when he insists that government should grant amnesty to bandits in the North just the way the administration of late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua handled Niger Delta militants.\n\n\u201cAnybody who argues this way is already part of Nigeria\u2019s national security problem. Nigerians need to rise to the challenge of regulating the conduct of so-called leaders, including religious clerics. Being jaundiced makes most of these leaders to be antagonistic to initiatives towards nation-building.\n\n\u201cBeyond religious clerics, there are other categories of leaders in the country with similarly jaundiced views. Individuals, who in their rights count as elders and have paid their dues to this country have become very vocal almost virtually against every decision and action of the government.\n\n\u201cIdeally, elders should speak with strong moral voice based on capacity to say more than the ordinary on account of their lived experiences. But when elders speak with the same voice as that of politicians, it weakens their authority and diminishes their influence in society.",

And Hardly, one finds any leader who is raising issues of marginalisation, unfairness and injustice not based on protecting the interests of groups they belong. Consequently, every problem of the country become interpreted based on group interests.\n\n\u201cBut the question remains How can Nigeria manage it\u2019s diversity and build confidence of citizens across every part of the country to have a sense of national belonging?, he queried\n\nSalihu Lukman admittedly says this is one area, which all leaders in the country seems to have common approach defensively.\n\nMr Lukman is of the opinion that If the Nigerian nation is to be developed, there must be leaders who are broadminded enough to campaign for justice, equity and fairness beyond a particular group interests.\n\nHe says therefore, a major challenge of nation building in Nigeria revolves around how to produce a set of true national leaders.\n\nAs long as the determining factor in judging leaders is driven by the frustration that leaders are not meeting citizens\u2019 expectations, prejudiced conclusions against them will be the case. What is it that need to be done to ensure that leaders meet citizens\u2019 expectations?\n\nNo doubt, both President Buhari and APC must be held accountable, But when issues of accountability are reduced to interpreting challenges to mean evidence of failure, it can only re-enforce the conclusion that leaders are bad, which may make it attractive for the campaign to remove leaders out of office, and Most times, the debate about changing leaders is influenced largely by the frustration of getting leaders to meet expectations of citizens.\n\nHe added that It is necessary Nigerians recognise that political parties are the most important democratic bodies to facilitate processes of nation building.",

          "title": "Biden Calls Xi Jinping as US-China Relationship Grows More Fraught",
          "text": "US President Joe Biden spoke with China\u2019s Xi Jinping on Thursday amid growing frustration on the American side that high-level engagement between the two leaders\u2019 top advisers has been largely unfruitful in the early going of the Biden presidency.\n\nBiden initiated the call with Xi, the second between the two leaders since Biden took office. It comes at a moment when there is no shortage of thorny issues between the two nations, including cybersecurity breaches originating from China, Beijing\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and what the White House has labeled as \u201ccoercive and unfair\u201d trade practices by the Chinese.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s aim with the 90-minute call was less focused on any of those hot-button issues and instead centered on discussing the way ahead for the U.S.-China relationship after it got off to a decidedly rocky start in his tenure.\n\nThe White House said in a statement the \u201ctwo leaders had a broad, strategic discussion in which they discussed areas where our interests converge, and areas where our interests, values, and perspectives diverge.\u201d\n\nThe White House is hopeful the two sides can work together on issues of mutual concern \u2014including climate change and preventing a nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula \u2014 despite growing differences.\n\nBeijing, however, has pushed back against U.S. pressure and increasingly has suggested it could remain broadly uncooperative until Biden dials down criticism on what it deems Chinese internal matters.\n\nXi in the call appeared to echo some of the complaints, telling Biden that U.S. government policy toward China caused \u201cserious difficulties\u201d in relations, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\n\u201cThis is not in the basic interests of the two peoples,\u201d the Chinese leader said, according to Xinhua.\n\n\u201cChinese-U.S. confrontation will bring disaster to both countries and the world,\u201d Xi added.\n\nXi said the two sides should cooperate on climate change, epidemic prevention, economic recovery and other issues, Xinhua reported.\n\nAhead of the call, a senior administration official said the White House has been unsatisfied with early engagements with the Chinese.\n\nThe official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said White House officials were hopeful that Xi hearing directly from Biden could prove beneficial.\n\nThe White House official said Biden made clear to Xi that he had no intention of moving away from his administration\u2019s policy of pressing China on human rights, trade and other areas where it believes China is acting outside international norms.\n\nHigh-level engagement in the early going has been most notable for each side blasting the other with recriminations.\n\nLast week, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned Biden climate envoy John Kerry that deteriorating U.S.-China relations could undermine cooperation on climate change. Wang told Kerry, who was visiting Tianjin for climate talks with his Chinese counterparts, by video link that such cooperation cannot be separated from the broader relationship and called on the U.S. to take steps to improve ties, according to the Foreign Ministry.\n\nIn July, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman faced a long list of demands and complaints, including accusations that the U.S. was trying to contain and suppress China\u2019s development. Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng urged the U.S. \u201cto change its highly misguided mindset and dangerous policy.\u201d\n\nIn March, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan had heated exchanges with Chinese Communist Party foreign affairs chief Yang Jiechi when they met with top Chinese officials in Anchorage. At that meeting, Yang accused the U.S. of failing to deal with its own human rights problems and took issue with what he said was American hypocrisy.\n\nAdministration officials suspect that some of the rhetoric in those high-profile meetings was more about playing to a domestic audience through the press than sending a message to the White House. With that in mind, Biden highlighted the importance of two leaders ability to have private conversations and be clear about their priorities, the administration official said.\n\nBiden from the start of his presidency has sought to put greater focus on China, rallying allies to speak in a more unified voice about Beijing\u2019s human rights record, its trade practices and its military\u2019s increasingly assertive behavior that has unnerved U.S. allies in the Pacific. He sees Beijing as the most significant economic competitor to the United States and a growing national security concern.\n\nBut the president has also expressed hope that his long-running working relationship with Xi, one that dates back to when he served as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president, could pay dividends in the two nations cooperating on certain critical issues. The two spent time on the call reminiscing about their time traveling together when they were both vice presidents, the administration official said.\n\nThe White House said the leaders during the call agreed to engage \u201copenly and straightforwardly\u201d on issues where the nations are at odds and where there is agreement.",

          "title": "Biden Orders Sweeping New Vaccine Mandates for 100 million Americans",
          "text": "In his most forceful pandemic actions and words, President Joe Biden on Thursday ordered sweeping new federal vaccine requirements for as many as 100 million Americans \u2014 private-sector employees as well as health care workers and federal contractors \u2014 in an all-out effort to curb the surging COVID-19 delta variant.\n\nSpeaking at the White House, Biden sharply criticized the tens of millions of Americans who are not yet vaccinated, despite months of availability and incentives.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been patient. But our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us,\u201d he said, all but biting off his words. The unvaccinated minority \u201ccan cause a lot of damage, and they are.\u201d\n\nRepublican leaders \u2014 and some union chiefs, too \u2014 said Biden was going too far in trying to muscle private companies and workers, a certain sign of legal challenges to come.\n\nGov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina said in a statement that \u201cBiden and the radical Democrats (have) thumbed their noses at the Constitution,\u201d while American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelley insisted that \u201cchanges like this should be negotiated with our bargaining units where appropriate.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, there were strong words of praise for Biden\u2019s efforts to get the nation vaccinated from the American Medical Association, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Business Roundtable \u2014 though no direct mention of his mandate for private companies.\n\nThe expansive rules mandate that all employers with more than 100 workers require them to be vaccinated or test for the virus weekly, affecting about 80 million Americans. And the roughly 17 million workers at health facilities that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid also will have to be fully vaccinated.\n\nBiden is also requiring vaccination for employees of the executive branch and contractors who do business with the federal government \u2014 with no option to test out. That covers several million more workers.\n\nBiden announced the new requirements in a Thursday afternoon address from the White House as part of a new \u201caction plan\u201d to address the latest rise in coronavirus cases and the stagnating pace of COVID-19 shots.\n\nJust two months ago Biden prematurely declared the nation\u2019s \u201cindependence\u201d from the virus. Now, despite more than 208 million Americans having at least one dose of the vaccines, the U.S. is seeing about 300% more new COVID-19 infections a day, about two-and-a-half times more hospitalizations, and nearly twice the number of deaths compared to the same time last year. Some 80 million people remain unvaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe are in the tough stretch and it could last for a while,\u201d Biden said.\n\nAfter months of using promotions to drive the vaccination rate, Biden is taking a much firmer hand, as he blames people who have not yet received shots for the sharp rise in cases killing more than 1,000 people per day and imperiling a fragile economic rebound.\n\nIn addition to the vaccination requirements, Biden moved to double federal fines for airline passengers who refuse to wear masks on flights or to maintain face covering requirements on federal property in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.\n\nHe announced that the government will work to increase the supply of virus tests, and that the White House has secured concessions from retailers including Walmart, Amazon and Kroger to sell at-home testing kits at cost beginning this week.\n\nThe administration is also sending additional federal support to assist schools in safely operating, including additional funding for testing. And Biden called for large entertainment venues and arenas to require vaccinations or proof of a negative test for entry.\n\nThe requirement for large companies to mandate vaccinations or weekly testing for employees will be enacted through a forthcoming rule from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that carries penalties of $14,000 per violation, an administration official said.\n\nThe rule will require that large companies provide paid time off for vaccination.\n\nMeanwhile, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will extend a vaccination requirement issued earlier this summer \u2014 for nursing home staff \u2014 to other healthcare settings including hospitals, home-health agencies and dialysis centers.\n\nSeparately, the Department of Health and Human Services will require vaccinations in Head Start Programs, as well as schools run by the Department of Defense and Bureau of Indian Education, affecting about 300,000 employees.\n\nBiden\u2019s order for executive branch workers and contractors includes exceptions for workers seeking religious or medical exemptions from vaccination, according to press secretary Jen Psaki. Federal workers who don\u2019t comply will be referred to their agencies\u2019 human resources departments for counseling and discipline, to include potential termination.\n\nAn AP-NORC poll conducted in August found 55% of Americans in favor of requiring government workers to be fully vaccinated, compared with 21% opposed. Similar majorities also backed vaccine mandates for health care workers, teachers working at K-12 schools and workers who interact with the public, as at restaurants and stores.\n\nBiden has encouraged COVID-19 vaccine requirements in settings like schools, workplaces and university campuses. On Thursday, the Los Angeles Board of Education v oted to require all students 12 and older to be fully vaccinated in the the nation\u2019s second-largest school district.\n\nWalmart, the nation\u2019s largest private employer, said in late July it was requiring all workers at its headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, as well as its managers who travel within the U.S., to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 4. But the company had stopped short of requiring shots for its frontline workers.\n\nCVS Health said in late August it would require certain employees who interact with patients to be fully vaccinated by the end of October. That includes nurses, care managers and pharmacists.\n\nIn the government, several federal agencies have previously announced vaccine requirements for much of their staffs, particularly those in healthcare roles like the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Pentagon moved last month to require all servicemembers to get vaccinated. Combined, the White House estimates those requirements cover 2.5 million Americans. Thursday\u2019s order is expected to affect nearly 2 million more federal workers and potentially millions of contractors.\n\nBiden\u2019s measures should help, but what\u2019s really needed is a change in mindset for many people, said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.\n\n\u201cThere is an aspect to this now that has to do with our country being so divided,\u201d said Sharfstein. \u201cThis has become so politicized that people can\u2019t see the value of a vaccination that can save their lives. Our own divisions are preventing us from ending a pandemic.\u201d\n\nMore than 177 million Americans are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, but confirmed cases have shot up in recent weeks to an average of about 140,000 per day with on average about 1,000 deaths, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMost of the spread \u2014 and the vast majority of severe illness and death \u2014 is occurring among those not yet fully vaccinated. So-called breakthrough infections in vaccinated people occur, but tend to be far less dangerous.\n\nFederal officials are moving ahead with plans to begin administering booster shots of the mRNA vaccines to bolster protection against the more transmissible delta variant. Last month Biden announced plans to make them available beginning Sept. 20, but only the Pfizer vaccine will likely have received regulatory approval for a third dose by that time.\n\nOfficials are aiming to administer the booster shots about eight months after the second dose of the two-dose vaccines",
