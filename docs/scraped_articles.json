          "text": "The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission and the Department of State Services have arrested 48 individuals for alleged illegalities in the conduct of the Joint Universities Preliminary Examinations Board.\n\nJUPEB is an advanced level educational examination that qualifies a candidate for admission into 200 level in any Nigerian and foreign universities through direct entry.\n\nIt is coordinated by the University of Lagos and has up to 10 accredited universities.\n\nThe ICPC stated that a joint operation tagged \u2018Operation Combo\u2019 conducted in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, led to the arrests of lecturers, security officers, workers and students from some of the participating universities.\n\nOperation Combo was simultaneously carried out by the operatives of ICPC and DSS in seven states after extensive monitoring of tutorial schools known for compromising JUPEB examinations.\n\nThe sting operation consequently led to the arrest of the President of Tutorial School Owners, the ICPC spokesperson, Azuka Ogugua, disclosed in a statement on Wednesday, titled, \u2018ICPC, DSS arrest 48 lecturers, security officers, ICT specialists over leakage of JUPEB examinations.\u2019\n\nAccording to the commission, the operation, a consequence of a sustained period of surveillance and undercover investigations spanning several weeks, led to multiple arrests of suspects, including parents of candidates.\n\nAlso arrested were lecturers and others involved in examination malpractices and other illegalities in the participating institutions.\n\nSome of the suspects have been granted administrative bail while the investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe suspects were arrested from Wellspring University, Benin, Edo State; Christopher University, Mowe, Ogun State and Crown-Hill University, Ilorin, Kwara State.\n\n\u201cAgain, the raid of tutorial centres by operatives in McPherson and Precious Cornerstone universities in Ibadan and Ilara-Epe, in Oyo State, respectively, led to more arrest of suspects.\u201d\n\nThe ICPC further stated that credible intelligence gathered during the operations showed active connivance of the parents of the students and the management of the universities.\n\nIt added, \u201cThree current Vice-Chancellors have been invited by the ICPC for their roles in the unchecked and massive malpractices reported. It was revealed that syndicated social media platforms were created by the facilitators for leaking questions and circulating answers to students for a fee during examinations.\n\n\u201cInvestigation also revealed that candidates, who are mostly minors, allegedly paid between N350,000 to N500,000 each to the suspects in the various tutorial schools to engage in the illegalities.\u201d\n\nThe anti-graft agency revealed that the cartel, in connivance with the coordinators of the examination centres and other management staff of the institutions allowed candidates to enter the examination halls with smartphones and other electronic devices to send question papers to waiting groups online and subsequently, receive answers to the questions.\n\nArmy roadblocks return as terrorists, bandits lay siege to Abuja\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Akinwumi Adesina\n\nAfrican Development Bank President Dr Akinwumi A. Adesina has highlighted the importance of stopping desertification in Africa\u2019s Sahel and turning the region green.\n\nAdesina spoke at a high-level side event on the Great Green Wall initiative during the ongoing UN global climate conference, COP26, in Glasgow, Scotland. The event was co-hosted by His Royal Highness Prince of Wales, French President Emmanuel Macron and Mauritanian President Ould Ghazaouni.\n\nREAD ALSOHeritage Bank,Next Titanto sustain entrepreneur support with N15m\n\nThe African Development Bank is a major partner in this bold project, which involves building an 8,000 km long and 15 km wide swathe of trees, grasslands, vegetation and plants across the Sahel. It will restore degraded land and help inhabitants of the Sahel produce food, create jobs and promote peace. Yesterday\u2019s gathering focused on marshalling efforts to scale up implementation of the project as a critical nature-based solution to climate change in Africa.\n\nAdesina thanked The Prince of Wales for what he said was the Prince\u2019s global leadership and lifetime commitment to safeguarding nature and the environment.\n\nHe also also commended French President Emmanuel Macron for his passion and leadership on climate issues, especially in Africa, and for appointing him as a Global Champion for the Great Green Wall initiative, to help mobilize financing for it. He said the French president\u2019s leadership in convening the One Planet Summit for Biodiversity earlier in the year and his call for commitment to accelerate actions had been a turning point for the Great Green Wall for the Sahel and the Sahara.\n\nThe African Development Bank chief applauded the leadership and commitment of all African heads of state on the Great Green Wall.\n\n\u201cThe Great Green Wall is not a wall that divides. It is a wall that unites \u2014 uniting livelihoods, resilience, and adaptation against climate change,\u201d Adesina said.\n\nAdesina said desertification, obliteration by sand dunes, and droughts, had continued to pummel vast areas of the Sahara and the Sahel. \u201cLife is unbearable, so people migrate, populations are displaced, conflicts are aggravated as previously co-existing communities of farmers and herders engage in relentless battles over declining communal resources,\u201d he explained.

          "text": "By Job Osazuwa, Luman Olabiyi and Okwe Obi, Abuja\n\nThe death toll in the 21-storey building at Gerard Road, Ikoyi, Lagos which collapsed on Monday has hit 20 while no fewer than nine persons had been rescued after being trapped for almost 24 hours under the debris as rescue and search efforts entered day two, yesterday.\n\nCoordinator of Lagos Territorial Office of National Emergency Management Agency, Mr. Ibrahim Farinloye, said rescue operation was still ongoing as at press time.\n\nDeputy Governor, Obafemi Hamzat, who was at the scene said government was hopeful that more people would be found alive.\n\nThe building construction had been ongoing in the last two years with tens of people working on the site day and night. It was gathered that some persons were using the ground floor for a meeting as at the time the structure went down. q\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nqHamzat said the number of those inside the building cannot be ascertained as two rescued victims gave conflicting figures of 24 and 28.\n\n\u201cWe are not sure of the number of people inside there. It is not a residential building yet; it is not that we have tenants or a list of people.\u201d\n\nHe said the construction site had earlier been sealed in July till November to allow for structural adjustment by the developer, stating that there are always procedures to be followed in demolishing a property for non-compliance.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, if you are aware, this location was sealed for about four months sometimes ago. It was sealed because our agency came in to do structural tests and saw some anomalies. So, they shut it down for those things to be corrected. The second building will also be audited in terms of integrity test, and of course, if we find anything, then the appropriate action will be taken.\u201d\n\nHamzat also clarified that the collapsed building got approval for 21 storeys and not 15 as earlier said by Gbolahan Oki, general manager, LASBCA.\n\nAs part of investigation of the remote and immediate causes of the incident, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has ordered indefinite suspension of Mr. Oki.\n\nA statement by Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotoso, said the state government was setting up an independent panel to probe the incident.\n\n\u201cMembers of the panel will be drawn from the Nigeria Institute of Architects (NIA), Nigerian Institute of Town Planners (NITP), Nigeria Society of Engineers (NSE) and other professional bodies. It will independently investigate the remote and immediate causes of the incident and make recommendations on how to prevent future occurrence. The investigation is not part of the internal probe already being conducted by the government.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu assured that government would find out what went wrong and punish those indicted. Handlers of the project and regulatory agencies are being accused of not adhering to standard and proper quality control in its execution.\n\nThe Lagos State Bricklayer Association of Nigeria has called for inclusion of its members in the independent panel set up by the state government to probe the collapsed building.\n\nSpeaking to journalists at the scene of the incident, president of the association, Oyebamiji Dauda, said they were ready to assist government to unravel the misery behind the incident.\n\n\u2022Tinubu reacts\n\nFormer Lagos State governor and All Progressives Congress National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has backed Governor Sanwo-olu on the probe.\n\nHe said government must get to the bottom of the ghastly occurrence, while adding that he sought not to prejudge anything or anyone.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious and plain to us all that something went terribly wrong. If indeed intentional or reckless wrongdoing has been committed, severe and appropriate sanctions should find those who have been found to have shirked their fundamental responsibilities. The departed, their grieving families and the people of Lagos deserve no less and should perhaps demand even more.\u201d\n\nAsiwaju\u2019s commiseration with the dead, sympathy for other victims of the incident and condemnation of the collapse is contained in a statement by his Media Office in Abuja, yesterday.\n\n\u201cSome tragedies are unavoidable, but most are not. We need to understand what happened here so that we can work harder to prevent a reoccurrence. I endorse Governor Babajide Sanwo-olu\u2019s order for an investigation into this tragedy. There are many questions to ask, and all those questions deserve full and public answers.\n\n\u201cWe must get to the bottom of this ghastly occurrence. I seek not to prejudge anything or anyone, but it is obvious and plain to us all that something went terribly wrong. If indeed intentional or reckless wrongdoing has been committed, severe and appropriate sanctions should find those who have been found to have shirked their fundamental responsibilities. The departed, their grieving families and the people of Lagos deserve no less and should perhaps demand even more.\n\n\u201cAs much as we are in collective pain and grief, we must also be clear and focused. Let us use this tragedy to serve as a strong warning and deterrent to end any malpractices and misconduct that might in any way contribute to such an incident.\n\n\u201cWe must never become numb to the tragedies that befall others; we must work and strive to put an end to these frightening events and the brutal but avoidable deaths that go with them. Lagos is and must forever be a place of light and life where the best of human endeavour is our currency and our calling card,\u201d the former governor said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Government has, through the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Farouq, has expressed shock at the incident.\n\nThe minister in a statement by her Special Adviser on Media, Nneka Ike Anibeze, sympathised with the people and government of Lagos State and directed the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to assist with rescue operations at the site.\n\n\u201cWe have mobilised immediate rescue operations through the NEMA Team from the Lagos Territorial Office to team up with the state SEMA. NEMA has also facilitated mobilisation of response involving heavy duty equipment for rescue operations and security for crowd control. We pray that through the rescue operatives still on ground at the site, many of those trapped will be rescued,\u201d she said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "\u2022How insecurity, IPOB\u2019s threat may undercut chances of parties, candidates\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nWith voter apathy likely in Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Anambra State, a situation occasioned by the palpable insecurity in the state and accentuated by the fear of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), victory amongst the three big contender parties \u2013 the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) \u2013 might be dependent on the fallout of the recent governorship debate organised by Arise News Channel.\n\nThe difference between victory and defeat will ultimately come down to who amongst the three front runners is better able to mobilise his party\u2019s supporters to go out and vote even as the threat from IPOB looms over the election.\n\nWhat this means is that the performance of each of the candidates of the three major parties: Chukwuma Soludo of APGA, Andy Uba of APC and Valentine Ozigbo of the PDP, at the debate might ultimately ride on the back of their ability to mobilise their campaign organisations, in spite of the fear of IPOB in the state.\n\nTherefore, beyond the popularity of the candidates and their parties as well as their avowed war chest, their established presence in the local politics of the state would come to play big time as the major driver of any effective mobilisation by the parties at this time of sweeping insecurity.\n\nSoludo, a former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), was believed to have put up a good showing and expectedly big on data, given his background.\n\nFor a man, who also understood what the issues were, Soludo carefully addressed the threat constituted by IPOB and like others, declined to either take side or condemn the group long proscribed by the federal government, after it was designated a terrorist group.\n\nThe former CBN governor, who identified himself as a pan-Nigerian Igbo man, insisted that the reasons for the agitation by the group needed to be discussed, rather than the use of force.\n\nPutting it on the record one more time that he once visited Nnamdi Kanu in Kuje prison, to dialogue with him and also asked for his release the last time, he believed that everything should be put on the table in a democracy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a consensus that we need to have a dialogue on IPOB,\u201d he said, insisting that what Anambra needed at the moment was a transformational leader, who has had a blameless record of public service.\n\nUnfortunately, for Soludo, who is expected to ride on the record of the incumbent governor of the state, Chief Willie Obiano, the alleged failure of the current administration in different respects and Obiano\u2019s inability to manage the ruling party in the state, APGA, as one political family, might have become an albatross for him in the election.\n\nBesides, as a governorship hopeful, many had also condemned Soludo\u2019s disposition and mannerism at the debate, describing him as both conceited and small-minded, albeit not taking away his brilliance, intelligence and accomplishments.\n\nHis closest rival, Uba of the APC, leveraged his experience as a politician, who had played kitchen cabinet politics and also one who has had a whiff at the governorship seat for a few months, save for the court ruling that sacked him and reinstated former governor Peter Obi.\n\nAt the debate, therefore, Uba was of the opinion that the agitation for secession had only become pronounced because of growing unemployment.\n\nIn breaking down his plan, the federal lawmaker, who seemed to have an insight to some of the possibilities this weekend, stressed that voter apathy had always been an issue in the state, but posited that the situation was compounded by Governor Obiano, who had refused to engage people and consult widely on the security situation in the state.\n\n\u201cThe governor is the chief security officer of the state. Let me tell you, in this case, the governor has not done what he\u2019s supposed to do,\u201d he said, even though he too expressed belief in dialogue, adding that, if he eventually won, he would set up a security response team and have a public phone number that people could call to report cases of insecurity instantly.\n\nWhile a majority of the people believed that Uba and his party, the APC, stood to benefit more from the IPOB sit-at-home order, the governorship candidate explained that instead of condemning or supporting IPOB, Nigeria needed to sit with the agitators to know what they wanted.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t support or condemn IPOB,\u201d he reiterated for the record.\n\nYet, many people believed the debate had inadvertently exposed Uba\u2019s poor intellectual capacity as his answers were said to have shown lack of substance, in addition to his seeming bland personae. Aside poor articulation, he was adjudged to have mostly ended his positions on issues on rather weak notes, coming off a somewhat guileless and impractical candidate.\n\nOzigbo, candidate of the PDP and chartered accountant, largely sold himself as young and untainted, often riding on the clause that he had never been in government before.\n\nLike the other candidates, Ozigbo too held the belief that the popularity of IPOB was clearly due to leadership failure and argued that what Anambra required was a young vibrant, trendy person, who was passionate about the state, and had served in the private sector as well as grown businesses all over the world.\n\nSpecifically, on security, he held the view that what the agencies needed more was intelligence to tackle the situation in the state, contending that the situation has only festered, because nobody has been brought to book for committing crimes.\n\n\u201cAbove security, there\u2019s a lot we can do. There is indeed a lot we can do. Just even go back to when Peter Obi left it. Just providing money monthly to these vigilantes, paying them, providing vehicles and making sure that they are well empowered, because there\u2019s no community that doesn\u2019t know the criminals around them,\u201d he argued.\n\nAccording to him, both the APC and the APGA, had failed the state, but promised to provide resources for vigilante groups, create employment and engage with agitators.\n\nHe however, stated that the reasons for agitations by IPOB were not unfounded and went on to demand the release of Nnamdi Kanu, the IPOB leader, as well as canvassed the de-proscription of the group.\n\nThe former Transcorp president, who promised to cut waste, run a people\u2019s government, curb touting, make Nnewi an industrial hub and Awka a true capital city, said the state under him would attract help from multilaterals to curb erosion, embark on recycling and ensure process improvement.\n\nThese nonetheless, many people believed Ozigbo was not quick-witted in the debate, because he failed to understand that it was an entirely different platform from informal conversations, a situation believed to have prevented him from seizing some of the crucial momentums during the engagement.\n\nThat aside, there are those, who argue that some of his ideas were rather too simplistic, skin-deep and impracticable to fit the concept of ideal government and address real governance issues, especially, that he devoted most of his time doing character debate, as evident in his obsession with Soludo, a co-debator, than selling his own programmes.\n\nAbove all, some also believed Ozigbo was not street smart, at least from his demeanor and answers. The argument supporting this assumption is that, for a candidate, whose party was not in power at the state that is currently up for grab, or at the center, where federal might could be mustered, his devotion to fighting dirty was considered a miscalculation, particularly, when making Peter Obi, who left the state some eight years ago, his campaign issue.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022As body of senior advocates call for thorough investigation\n\n\u2022Incident part of APC\u2019s plot to hijack 2023 elections, PDP alleges\n\nChuks Okocha and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe Supreme Court yesterday said the raid on the Abuja residence of Justice Mary Peter-Odili, a justice of the apex court and next in line to the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), was \u201cimpunity taken too far.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court, in a statement by its Director of Information, Dr. Festus Akande, warned that the judiciary should not be misconstrued by anyone or institution of government as the weeping child among the arms of government.\n\nIt was the first reaction of the Supreme Court to the incident, which occurred on Friday.\n\nOver 50 security operatives, comprising personnel of the Nigeria Police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), had invaded Odili\u2019s house situated at 7 Imo River Street, Maitama, Abuja.\n\nWhile the action of the security agencies came under heavy criticism, the Nigeria Police, EFCC, and Attorney General of the Federation denied involvement in the incident.\n\nEven the Magistrate, who issued the search warrant upon which the said security operatives under the AGF acted, claimed he was misled and subsequently revoked the search order.\n\nThe apex court described the action of the security operatives as uncivilised and a shameful show of primitive force on an innocent judicial officer.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWe are alarmed with the news of the unwarranted and despicable raid on the official residence of one of our senior justices in the Supreme Court, Hon. Justice Mary Peter Odili on Friday October 29, 2021 in a Gestapo manner.\n\n\u201cThe attack unfortunately depicted a gory picture of war by some armed persons suspected to be security operatives representing different agencies of government who seemed to have come to kill and maim their target under the guise of undertaking a search whose warrant was questionable and baseless.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened and taken aback by this uncivilised and shameful show of primitive force on an innocent judicial officer that has so far spent several years of her productive life serving the country she calls her own.\n\n\u201cThis incident brought back, rather painfully, the ugly memory of the October 2016 midnight invasion of the homes of our respected justices with no satisfactory explanations as to the true motive behind such brazen assault on our collective sensibility.\n\n\u201cWe wish to make it abundantly clear that the Nigerian Judiciary is the third arm of the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and should be respected and treated as such.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cWe have had a full dosage of this fusillade of unwarranted and unprovoked attacks on our judicial officers and even facilities across the country and we say it loudly now that enough is enough.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary should never be misconstrued by any individual or institution of government as the weeping child among the three arms of government that must always be chastised and ridiculed to silence because of our conservative disposition.\n\n\u201cThough there have emerged discordant tunes from the various security agencies that allegedly participated in the dastardly act, we are not lying low on this dehumanising treatment meted out to one of our own.\u201d\n\nThe statement disclosed that the apex court had commenced a full-scale independent investigation to unravel those behind the attack as well as their real motives.\n\nIt called on the Inspector General of Police to rise up to the occasion by carrying out a discreet investigation and make his findings known to the public with a view to bringing the perpetrators to justice as quickly as possible.\n\nThe statement added, \u201cThe Nigerian judiciary cannot only bark, but can also bite. We can no longer be treated with disdain and levity. The rule of law and constitutionality must govern our conduct so that we can tag along with the comity of nations and be taken seriously, too.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile the Body of Senior Advocate s of Nigeria (BOSAN), yesterday met with the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, and demanded for a thorough investigation into the siege on the house of the justice. The group, led by a foremost senior lawyer, Chief Adegboyega Awomolo, condemned the act, warning that the development is a threat to the independence of the judiciary and the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nThey insisted that government must uncover those behind the act.\n\nThe senior advocates said, \u201cWe have come to see the AGF concerning the unfortunate and ugly invasion of the residence of Justice Mary Odili of the Supreme Court last Friday by yet to be identified security operatives.\n\n\u201cWhen judges\u2019 lives, careers, security and safety, when their independence is threatened, then democracy is also threatened.\n\n\u201cThe AGF has said he did not have knowledge of the incident and he had written a letter of complaint to the Inspector General of Police for a thorough investigation as demonstration of his sincerity.\n\n\u201cHe said he is open to be investigated if there is any information that connects him to the incident.\n\n\u201cWe are going to meet with the Chief Justice of Nigeria and let him know that the Body of SANs is very concerned about the lives, security and safety of our judicial officers anywhere and everywhere.\n\n\u201cThis incident appears to be in isolation but we cannot let it be swept under the carpet. The incident must be investigated and investigated thoroughly. Nigerians are interested in this matter. It should not be politicised; it\u2019s a matter of grave, political and constitutional importance.\n\n\u201cThere are three arms of government: the executive, the legislature and judiciary. One is not supposed to be in ambush or overriding the other or threaten the other\u2019s existence, otherwise democracy is at risk.\u201d\n\nReacting, the AGF exonerated himself, saying he is open to investigation.\n\n\u201cNeither the federal government nor the office of the AGF is involved in the invasion of the Abuja home of Justice Mary Odili,\u201d the AGF said.\n\nIn a related development, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) alleged that the invasion was part of a renewed plot by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to hijack the 2023 election. The party described the attack on Odili as horrendous, rascally, irresponsible, and unjustified, insisting that it should not be swept under the carpet on the guise of misleading whistleblower operation.\n\nIn a statement by the outgoing National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party stated, \u201cThis is more so as the paw prints of the APC are visible in the incident, in its desperation to cow the judiciary and subvert the cause of justice ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the attack on Justice Odili is part of a renewed script by the APC. Nigerians will recall how, ahead of the 2019 election, former Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen, was clandestinely yanked off from his hallowed chamber, preparatory to the massive rigging that characterised the 2019 presidential election.\u201d\n\nThe PDP said Nigerians could equally recall how respected judges were assaulted by the APC administration through obnoxious sting operations in a bid to arm-twist the judiciary and set the stage for the endorsement of a culture of impunity that characterized the 2019 elections.\n\nPDP cautioned the APC and the presidency \u201cto know that times have changed as Nigerians are not ready to stomach a repeat of APC\u2019s coordinated assault on the institutions of democracy, but will firmly resist them with every means available within the ambit of the law.\u201d\n\nThe party also urged, \u201cThe judiciary to remain firm and not be deterred by the suppressive proclivities of the fizzling APC, that has since been rejected by Nigerians.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Sets up panel of enquiry as death toll climbs to 19, nine rescued\n\n\u2022IGP visits site, Humanitarian Minister mobilises NEMA\n\n\u2022Gbajabiamila, others condole with Lagos Govt\n\n\u2022Another building collapses in Lagos\n\nSegun James and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nAs rescue efforts intensify to try to pull out more persons from the debris of the 21-storey building, which collapsed at Ikoyi, Lagos, on Monday, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in the wee hours of today visited the scene of the incident. He had earlier ordered the indefinite suspension of General Manager of the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA), Mr. Gbolahan Oki.\n\nSanwo-Olu, furious at the building tragedy arrived the site around 1.am this morning and encouraged all federal and state agencies involved in rescue operations.\n\nEarlier yesterday, the governor said an internal panel of enquiry had been set up to look into the role of government officials in charge of ensuring adherence to standards with respect to the collapsed property.\n\nThe death toll from the building collapse rose to 19 on Tuesday, though nine persons were pulled out alive from the rubble.\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mr. Usman Baba, visited the scene of the building collapse on Tuesday.\n\nMinister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar-Farouq, was also at the site on Tuesday. Umar-Farouq directed the immediate mobilisation of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) team from the Lagos Territorial Office to assist in the rescue operation at the site, as she condoled with the state government.\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, also expressed his sympathies to the government and families of victims of the building collapse.\n\nBut barely 24 hours after the collapse of the 21-storey building in Ikoyi, another building under construction collapsed in the neighbouring Lekki area yesterday. At the time of filing this report, it could not be ascertained if there were casualties. But first responders were mobilised to the site of building located at Osapa London, a highbrow area of the state.\n\nThe nine persons rescued from the debris of the Ikoyi building collapse on Tuesday \u2013 all men \u2013 were taken to the hospital for treatment.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, 17 others were brought out dead, as at 2 pm,\u201d the state government said in a statement. The government said more equipment and personnel had been deployed at the site to try to save more lives.\n\nThe statement signed by the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso, disclosed that the government had set up an independent panel to probe the collapse of the high-rise building. It said members of the panel were drawn from the Nigerian Institute of Architects (NIA), Nigerian Institute of Town Planners (NITP), Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE), and other relevant professional bodies.\n\n\u201cIt will independently investigate the remote and immediate causes of the incident and make recommendations on how to prevent future occurrence,\u201d the statement added.\n\nHowever, the statement said the investigation was not part of the internal probe already being conducted by the government.\n\nSanwo-Olu promised that the government would surely find out what went wrong and punish those indicted.\n\nThe governor thanked all first responders and those who joined the rescue efforts, including construction giants Julius Berger, Chinese Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), and NEMA.\n\nOmotoso said a help desk would be set up at the site for people seeking information about their relations who might have been involved in the incident. But he told the media that the government would be releasing information whenever the need arose to avoid sensational reporting of the unfortunate incident.\n\nThe deputy governor, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, was at the site of the collapsed building yesterday to encourage rescuers and comfort relations of those trapped in the rubble. Hamzat also visited the Lagos Island General Hospital to see the survivors.\n\nThe state government said it would embark on further foundation and borehole acidic level tests to ascertain the effect of the collapsed building.\n\nThe government said, \u201cThese tests, particularly the borehole acidic level, is important for the entire Gerrard Road and adjoining areas.\n\n\u201cWe wish to state that there will be no cover-up in the search for the truth in this incident. If anybody is found to have been indicted, he or she will face the law.\n\n\u201cIt is important to restate that all developers and property owners are required to adhere strictly to all Building Codes and Planning Regulations to ensure the safety of lives and property. Those who ignore such regulations, breaking seals and defying enforcement, will surely be prosecuted.\u201d\n\nMinister of the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, who visited the scene of the Ikoyi building collapse on Tuesday, condoled with the state government.\n\nUmar-Farouq said, \u201cThis is tragic. I sympathise with the Lagos State government and families of people still trapped inside the rubble.\n\n\u201cWe have mobilised immediate rescue operations through the NEMA team from the Lagos Territorial Office to team up with the state SEMA. NEMA has also facilitated the mobilisation of response involving heavy-duty equipment for rescue operations and security for crowd control.\n\n\u201cWe pray that through the rescue operatives still on the ground at the site, many of those trapped will be rescued.\u201d\n\nThe IGP came to the compound with an entourage of police cars and heavy security.\n\nGbajabiamila, in a statement yesterday, consoled with families of the victims, saying he shares in their grief. He also sympathised with the government and people of Lagos State over the unfortunate incident.\n\nThe Speaker called for adequate measures to forestall future occurrence, while urging the relevant authorities to double their efforts at rescuing those trapped in the multi-storey building. He added that it was unfortunate the building collapse happened at a time the Lagos State government was doing everything possible to make the lives of Lagosians safer.\n\nThe Nigerian Red Cross Society called on emergency rescue response agencies to speed up efforts to rescue more persons who may still be alive. Chairman of Nigerian Red Cross, Lagos State branch, Adebola Kolawole, said yesterday that the rescue teams should act quickly to recover people from the rubble.\n\nKolawole said, \u201cThey should do something fast; as fast as they can, because time is limited. If they don\u2019t bring them out, they will be suffocated and they will eventually die. We don\u2019t pray for that. We pray that God will bring them out and our own.\n\n\u201cWe should be able to do something fast. I just think time is of the essence so that we can do something fast.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Some people including a family in the Isiala Ngwa Local Government Area of Abia State have suffered a despicable form of treatment that will horrify anyone with any shred of decency or humanity.\n\nOne of the victims of the heinous crime is dead while the others can only be said to be existing and not truly living.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt the victims include Ezumezu Chiemela Onyenma of Ihieorji Ngwa Ukwu village; his wife, Mrs Best; his niece, Miss Mkpuruoma Onyenma; Ubaeze Chiemela Onyenma; one Nnabugwu Godwin Njoku; Chinweuba Nwokeleme and one Nze O. O. Ogwuma.\n\nVideos obtained by SaharaReporters show how some of the victims were put through some of the worst forms of inhumane treatments, which eventually led to the death of one of them, Njoku. The abuse and brutalisation of the victims were said to have been carried out following allegations that Chiemela Onyenma murdered his brother, Otuosorochi Onyenma.\n\nIt was learnt that the others were abused and assaulted along with Chiemela Onyenma because of their association or relationship with him. Some of them shared the heavy dose of assault because they attempted to defend Chiemela Onyenma.\n\nIt all started with allegations by villagers that Chiemela Onyenma killed his brother, Otuosorochi, using juju (charms).\n\nHe and others, including his wife, were held hostage, then their house was looted and razed.\n\nIt was learnt that on Sunday, September 5, 2021, a community member identified as Sunday Njoku had invited Chiemela Onyenma for a meeting at the Ihieorji village hall on Monday, September 13 concerning his family (Onyenma\u2019s).\n\nBut when Chiemela Onyenma, in company with his niece, Mkpuruoma Onyenma got to the village hall, it did not look like a meeting venue but a slaughterhouse.\n\nWhat they met were villagers, including the village head, Monday Dike, with weapons. And not long after, Dike allegedly instigated others to attack Chiemela Onyenma over allegations that he was responsible for his brother\u2019s death.\n\nIt was learnt that in the process, Chiemela Onyenma\u2019s niece, Mkpuruoma was also assaulted and brutalised. She was beaten up for trying to prevent an imminent assault on her uncle, Chiemela Onyenma. Her clothes were said to have been torn and her mobile phone taken by the assailants.\n\nA good Samaritan identified as Nze Ogwuma, who had also tried to intervene was said to have been assaulted.\n\nEventually, some persons were able to sneak Chiemela Onyenma out of the place, leaving Mkpuruoma and Ogwuma to suffer more assault and injuries.\n\nBut it did not end there.\n\nOn Monday, September 27, some angry villagers stormed Chiemela Onyenma\u2019s home and took him, his wife, Godwin Njoku and Chinweuba Nwokeleme hostage.\n\nThe assailants destroyed their properties and from there, the village head, Dike, was said to have initiated their transfer to an uninhabited building in a remote part of the village called Uzoiyi to torture them.\n\nAt the makeshift torture chamber, they were beaten, brutalised and assaulted,\n\nOne of them, Godwin Njoku later died from injuries sustained during the horrible experience.\n\nOne of the videos shows Godwin Njoku crying in pain as the assailants tortured him, by making melted rubber as it was being burnt to drip on his head.\n\nAnother video shows a man standing on the back of one of the victims, whose head was placed on a tyre rim like he was being prepared to be slaughtered.\n\nNjoku allegedly died from his injuries the following night, Tuesday, September 28, with his remains reportedly taken in a wheelbarrow and put in a Toyota vehicle driven by one Chizuruoke Nwogu.\n\nNwogu and some others were said to have taken his corpse to an unknown location, probably for burial in a shallow grave.\n\nMeanwhile, three remaining hostages Chiemela Onyenma, Ubaeze Chiemela Onyenma and Ephraim Nwokeleme were said to have been left at Osusu, a village adjoining Ihieorji.\n\nLater, Chiemela Onyenma\u2019s son, identified as Obinna went to get his father and stepmother at Osusu, from where they were taken to a private hospital \u2013 Ronald Hospital in the same local government area.\n\nIt was learnt that policemen from the state Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (CIID) had visited the hospital to talk to Chiemela Onyenma and his wife, Best.\n\nDenying that he killed his brother, Chiemela Onyenma said, \u201cWhen I got to the village hall that day, I met so many people, including chiefs like me with weapons.\n\n\u201cI asked them why they had weapons, they said nothing was wrong and that they had gathered because of my family\u2019s case. They said they learnt that I was the one who killed my brother, Otuosorochi Onyema. I asked them what I used in killing him- was it a knife or a gun? They said I killed him with juju (Nshi). I told them I didn\u2019t kill anybody. If I killed someone, it will be the government that will be judging the case, not in the village hall.\n\n\u201cThe chairman suggested that they make inquiry into what killed him. When they came back, they still insisted that I killed him with charms.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, one of his brothers identified as Iheoma Onyenma had paid some thugs N600,000 and given them a goat to make them carry out the atrocities they did and hold him responsible for his brother\u2019s death.\n\nHe, therefore, called on the state government and other relevant authorities to look into the crisis in his community and assist in paying their medical bills.",
          "summary": "Some of them shared the heavy dose of assault because they attempted to defend Chiemela Onyenma.\nIt all started with allegations by villagers that Chiemela Onyenma killed his brother, Otuosorochi, using juju (charms).\nAnd not long after, Dike allegedly instigated others to attack Chiemela Onyenma over allegations that he was responsible for his brother\u2019s death.\nShe was beaten up for trying to prevent an imminent assault on her uncle, Chiemela Onyenma.\nMeanwhile, three remaining hostages Chiemela Onyenma, Ubaeze Chiemela Onyenma and Ephraim Nwokeleme were said to have been left at Osusu, a village adjoining Ihieorji.",

          "text": "Two-year-old Daniel Angwe appeared unconcerned about the environment around him as he ran around playing with other children near his mother\u2019s makeshift restaurant. Clothed only to the waist and with snot all over his nose, Daniel broke out in loud cries at intervals and tugged at his mother\u2019s cloth where she sat in the kitchen, cutting vegetables.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComfort Angwe, his mother, tried what she could to appease the child by wiping his tears, and in no time he got distracted and went back to playing.\n\nJust beside where Comfort sat was a three-stone firewood place, with the day\u2019s pot of soup boiling on the fire. Her eyeballs had turned red and tears trickled down her cheeks as a result of firewood smoke.\n\nHer children were also not left out of the effects of the smoke, as she said they sometimes complained of eye pain, headaches and difficulty sleeping at night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt affects them very well, especially their eyes. They usually complain that it is paining them and it makes them cry,\u201d Comfort said.\n\nAccording to her, she would prefer gas because it would help her health and that of her children and also boost her business, but there are no funds.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have money; how will I buy it?\u201d she asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA World Health Organisation WHO report shows that more than one in four deaths of children under five years are attributable to unhealthy environments.\n\nSpeaking on the effects of environmental pollution, Henrietta Fore, executive director, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), called for businesses to \u201censure that their practices are protective of the natural environment on which children depend\u201d.\n\nBut for Comfort, doing business in a polluted environment is a matter of survival.\n\n\u201cI know the smoke will not kill them, except that it is affecting their eyes. My mother used this method of cooking and she did not die,\u201d Comfort said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Adetoun Mustapha, councillor for Africa at the International Society of Environmental Epidemiology (ISEE), says Comfort\u2019s position is wrong because for children, their \u201cimmune systems are still developing, and their lungs are still growing\u201d.\n\nMustapha said children need more air per unit of body weight than adults, but living in close proximity to polluting fuels used for cooking could cause health complications like asthma, decrease in pulmonary function, brain damage and negative effects on their mental and motor development.\n\n\u2018CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE GREATEST THREAT TO CHILDREN\u2019\n\nAccording to the UNICEF climate risk index report released in August 2021, climate change is the greatest threat facing the world\u2019s children and young people, with one billion children at \u201cextremely high risk\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria, Comfort\u2019s children are not alone in their suffering. Out of 163 countries, the country ranks second on the list of nations where children are most vulnerable to climate change.\n\nFor pupils of Lynwofri International Academy at Trademore Estate, Abuja, any rainy day automatically becomes a no-school day as the school cannot risk another experience of what happened on September 13, when flood from rainfall the previous night destroyed exercise books, textbooks, uniforms, desks, creche beds, and computers.\n\nBlessing Nsofor, the school\u2019s head teacher, said she remains grateful that it was a weekend as \u201ca good number of the children would have died because we wouldn\u2019t have been able to save all the children\u201d.\n\nAlthough the school cleared its surrounding gutters and fortified its walls, some parents withdrew their children, while others rush to pick their children from the school once there is any sign of rain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE AND CHILD RIGHTS\n\nAway from education, the issue of water scarcity has become prevalent in Nigeria\u2019s northern region and children are mostly at risk as they have to go long distances in search of water which has become a scarce resource due to climate change.\n\nNgohide Terlumun, aged 11, and 16-year-old Suleman Mohammed are some of the victims affected by water scarcity.\n\nSquatting near a hole to fetch water, Terlumun hung her head in despair when asked about the water situation in Ipav Mbagule, her community in Gboko LGA of Benue state.\n\nShe spoke about constant battles with cholera, diarrhea and bilharzia, adding that sometimes, she doesn\u2019t go to school after fetching water in the morning as a result of house chores.\n\nTerlumum couldn\u2019t converse in English, but with the help of an interpreter, she spoke in her local dialect about what children of her community go through.\n\n\u201cI wish the government can provide another water [dig a borehole] for us so we can stop drinking this water,\u201d she said.\n\nAjibe Terlumum, her father, said they use water from a dirty stream, but when it dries up, they have to dig holes in the ground to find water.\n\nHe also said the community is aware that the water is not healthy but they keep using it because there is no alternative.\n\nChildren in Nigeria\u2019s northern region form part of the 920 million children currently exposed to water scarcity, and the situation is likely to worsen as climate change increases severity of droughts and contamination.\n\nFor Mohammed, he wakes up as early as 6am to find water in Damba, his community in Zamfara where wells have dried up and there are no infrastructural water facilities like boreholes. The only accessible source of water is an algae-covered dam in a neighbouring village 7km away from Damba.\n\nDespite waking up early, Mohammed said he sometimes doesn\u2019t go to school or ends up going late and doesn\u2019t learn much before the 12pm closing time.\n\n\u201cWe have to go a long distance in search of water due to the scarcity. So, we waste time before we make it to school. The school opens by 8am, but we hardly go to school before 10am,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nCircumstances such as climate change and conflict in Nigeria\u2019s northern region have negatively impacted Mohammed\u2019s education. At 16, he is still in primary six and despite having the desire to go to school, there is a tendency that he might not further his education if such circumstances persist.\n\nSpeaking on the development, Habib Muhammed, a climate change researcher, said water scarcity has become more frequent because global warming has caused intense heat which causes more evaporation from the water bodies.\n\nWith children suffering significantly from the impact of climate change, there have been calls for world leaders to take decisive action.\n\nGreta Thunberg, a Swedish climate activist, told world leaders at the Youth4Climate summit in Milan, to move from words to action.\n\n\u201cThis is all we hear from our so-called leaders \u2014 words that sound great but so far have not led to action. Our hopes and ambitions drown in their empty promises,\u201d Thunberg said.\n\nOkunola Olasunkanmi, a disaster risk management expert, said forced migration, food shortages and conflict resulting from climate change can make children develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nWHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS?\n\nIn the words of Fore, children have their whole lives ahead of them and \u201cany deprivation as a result of climate and environmental degradation at a young age can result in a lifetime of lost opportunity\u201d.\n\nAs part of efforts to seek solution to the climate change crisis, the federal government recently announced the adoption of a clean cooking policy.\n\nThere have also been several projects awarded by the federal executive council (FEC) on addressing environmental pollution.\n\nBut stakeholders say more needs to be done.\n\nOn his part, Olasunkanmi advocated sensitisation in schools and communities, adding that climate education be adopted to teach children skills that can help them adapt to climate change in cases of emergency.\n\nElizabeth Andrew-Essien, a professor of environmental resource management at the University of Calabar, agrees that education is pertinent, adding that the UNICEF report is a wakeup call for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t make appropriate investments at that level, in social security, in nutrition, in health care, in education to secure the future of the average child, then we are building children who may not be globally positioned to face whatever insecurities that may come their way,\u201d Andre-Essien said.\n\nShe also called for government partnerships with the private sector for more services to secure children\u2019s future.\n\nRegarding pollution, Mustapha believes that switching to cleaner fuels for household cooking, heating and lighting activities can improve the air quality within homes.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative for the Nigerian government to ensure cleaner fuel such as cooking gas and electricity are available and affordable. Also, to minimise children\u2019s exposure to polluted air, schools and playgrounds should be located away from major sources of air pollution like busy roads and factories,\u201d Mustapha said.\n\nAs the world discusses climate change at COP26, Nigerian children like Angwe, Mohammed and Ngohide silently wish that their concerns would be well represented and that the summit yields results for the protection of their future.\n\nThis story was produced under the NAREP Climate Change Media 2021 fellowship of the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism.",

          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Conrad Onyango/bird\n\nSupport for small businesses keen to trade across the continent\u2019s single market is being eyed as a potentially lucrative market by more and more African fintech startups.\n\nAfrica\u2019s fintech startups are rapidly expanding beyond their host countries\u2019 borders to tap into the anticipated surge in trade and investments with the opening up of the world\u2019s largest single market, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nSurge in intra-continental expansion\n\nIn the last month alone, a number of startups have either raised growth funds, acquired another player present in regional markets within the same vertical, or tapped top talent in the telecoms industry. Their intention appears to be the targeting of small industries and traders seeking cross-border opportunities in new African markets.\n\nKenyan based Asante Financial Services Group, focused on supporting the growth of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME\u2019s), has raised 7.5 million US dollars in series A funding to scale business credit offering to small businesses in Kenya and Uganda access to new markets across Africa.\n\n\u201cThe investment enables Asante to scale its credit offerings to the underserved segment of MSMEs in Kenya and Uganda, and expand to Nigeria and Rwanda,\u201d the start-up said in a statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTala, with African Operations in Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania has begun a \u2018Rebuild Fund Business Program\u2019 targeting Kenya\u2019s hard-hit micro, small and medium-sized enterprises it say will help them build back better post-COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe program comes barely a month after Tala raised 145 million dollars in equity, hinting that part of the growth funds would go toward supporting its geographical expansion.\n\nThe World Bank puts the annual SME credit gap in Sub Saharan Africa at about 330 million US dollars, with traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d lenders turning a blind eye to small traders on account of lack of \u2013 among others \u2013 collateral, high costs of due diligence, customer acquisition, distribution and servicing.\n\n\u201cMSMEs\u2014particularly those in the informal sector\u2014are being held back by a lack of responsible lending from traditional financial services providers who are unable to run accurate credit checks and offer profitable loans to this segment of the market,\u201d said Bitta Wycliffe, Senior Investment Associate at Goodwell Investments.\n\nPan-Africa fintech firm, MFS Africa is also making inroads in Nigeria through the acquisition of Baxi, a Nigerian start-up with a 90,000-agent network. The October move gives Nigerian SME\u2019s listed on Baxi access to MFS Africa\u2019s multiple mobile money payment wallets, currently serving up to 320 million customers in more than 35 African countries.\n\nAnother Pan-African fintech venture, Yabx, with a presence in 12 African countries recently tapped a telecoms industry expert with over 15 years in experience as a new director for its business.\n\nEunice R. Gatama, who has worked for, among others, Kenya\u2019s Safaricom, in its mobile money (M-Pesa) division, as well as NCBA bank, has been tasked with pushing the growth of Yabx digital lending services in new African markets.\n\nUntil recently, a lack of local knowledge and access to trade and market information has been linked to low trade volumes and value. With more money pouring into the hiring of top regional talent, that scenario, too, is likely to change.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "When Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payment company, raised $100 million Series C funding in May this year, the CEO, Ham Serunjogi, without declaring the startup\u2019s current valuation said the company is the most valuable startup in Africa. That sparked a lot of mixed reactions in the ecosystem.\n\nFive months later, it looks like Serunjogi\u2019s claim might not have been far from the truth as today, Chipper Cash announced the extension of its series C and raised $150 million at a valuation little over $2 billion. The investment was led by FTX, the most valuable crypto derivatives exchange company owned by the youngest billionaire in the world, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nWith a valuation of over $2 billion, Chipper Cash has now attained a unicorn status. It joins the ranks of Nigeria\u2019s Interswitch, Flutterwave and Opay, Egypt\u2019s Fawry, Pan-African Andela, and Senegal\u2019s Wave, as the seventh African unicorn.\n\nFounded by Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled in 2018 to offer free cross-border payment service in Africa via a mobile app, Chipper Cash operates in seven African countries \u2014 Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa and Kenya. In May, after the initial $100 million series C round, the company expanded into the UK to power UK to Africa peer-to-peer remittance.\n\nLast month, the startup also entered the competitive U.S market and it\u2019s reported to have started the U.S to Africa remittance in Nigeria and Uganda, with more countries to be added soon. The company also plans to start Africa to U.S remittance in South Africa, Uganda and Ghana next year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarlier this year, Chipper Cash forayed into social payments by partnering with Twitter to offer payment for the social media platform\u2019s Tip Jar feature for African users. The Tip Jar feature was launched early this year to allow Twitter users receive money \u201ctip\u201d directly on the platform.\n\nChipper Cash is FTX\u2019s first investment in Africa. A move that hints that FTX is impressed by how Chipper Cash has been able to scale in the space of three years and its interest in the crypto space. Chipper Cash boasts of having over 4 million users across the world.\n\nThe investment will see FTX partner with Chipper Cash to make money transfer as simple as a text message and accelerate the adoption of crypto within Africa and beyond.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent growth in Africa, moving money across the continent is still slow and expensive. Unsurprisingly it is the fastest growing market with grassroots crypto adoption,\u201d Bankman-Fried, FTX CEO, told TechCrunch.\n\nAs a result of this partnership, FTX will increase its footprint in Africa and Chipper Cash will be integrated into the FTX product so that African users can fund their crypto wallet through Chipper Cash.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a compelling use case for both of our companies as we keep scaling and as FTX keeps scaling their geographical coverage. They do some of the most innovative work in the crypto space, so working with them is going to be quite exciting,\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "Facebook on Thursday, October 28 announced that it has changed its company name to Meta. This change of name was announced by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook\u2019s annual Connect augmented and virtual reality conference.\n\nThe company said it chose the name \u201cMeta\u201d to serve as a reminder that there is always more to build. The rebrand is part of the company\u2019s efforts to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse \u2014 a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.\n\n\u201cRight now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can\u2019t possibly represent everything that we\u2019re doing today, let alone in the future,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cOver time, I hope that we are seen as a metaverse company, and I want to anchor our work and identity on what we\u2019re building toward.\u201d\n\nPer The Verge, \u201cZuckerberg owns the Twitter handle @meta and meta.com, which now redirects to a welcome page on Facebook outlining the changes. The site previously redirected to meta.org, a biomedical research discovery tool that was a project of the Chan Zuckerberg Science Initiative. That\u2019s part of the philanthropic arm Zuckerberg co-founded with his physician wife, Priscilla Chan, in 2015. In a Medium post on Thursday, the group says it\u2019s sunsetting Meta.org on March 31st, 2022.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going to change?\n\nAs expected, the new name implies that some things about the way Facebook operates would change. Facebook said its corporate structure is not changing, however, how the company reports its financials will.

          "text": "The Director General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Lamido Yuguda has stated that the Non-Interest finance segment holds great potential in furthering the development of the capital market and the growth of the Nation\u2019s economy.\n\nThe SEC DG who spoke at a one-day Webinar with the theme \u201cThe Imperative of Non-Interest Capital Market for Pension Industry, said this product has been judged as one of the most appropriate for the funding of long-term infrastructure.\n\nYuguda said the event hosted by the SEC, is the first in a series and it is aimed and providing a conducive platform for knowledge and experience sharing among participants and to enlighten them on this way of investing and financing.\n\nHe said the pension industry is one of the fastest growing sectors in the nation\u2019s economy with assets under management of N13trn as at the end of September 2021 adding that of this impressive amount, less than N80bn is invested in sukuk representing a little less than 1% of total pension assets under management.\n\n\u201cThis calls for more innovative financial products to deepen our market and sustain the growth in the industry especially in the non-interest segment. We strongly believe that the capital market has a leading role to play in this regard by providing a variety of long-term investable products to service the needs of the pension industry as well as other investors with similar focus.\n\n\u201cIt is encouraging that the national pension commission has taken concrete steps to improve the regulatory framework for the investment of pension funds in the non-interest capital market by the introduction of operational framework for the non-interest fund.\n\n\u201cThis will no doubt provide an additional opportunity for retirement savings account holders and retirees to invest their savings in financial instruments that are aligned with their lite goals and objectives. Indeed, the operationalization of the funds definitely accelerates the national financial inclusion agenda while increasing the quantum of investible funds by unlocking the untapped capital.\n\nYuguda stated that as at September 2021, the total assets stood at N7.79bn constituting about 0.059% of total pension assets under management expressing the hope that the fund assets will grow with robust public awareness, education programs and capacity building of stakeholders through seminars, workshops and programs such as this.\n\n\u201cThe SEC in realization of the potential of the noninterest segment of the capital market, has a veritable avenue for providing long-term capital launched its 10-year capital market masterplan with a very strong focus on the development of the non-interest capital market segment through awareness creation, capacity building, review of regulatory framework and development of non-interest projects and services.\n\n\u201cI am happy to report that a significant number of its strategic initiatives have been achieved as several sharia/ethical funds have been registered by the SEC. In addition, the SEC collaborated with the MO towards providing a framework for the issuance of the first FGN Sukuk in 2017 and two other issuances of sukuk have followed.\n\nHowever, we believe that more work still needs to be directed towards achieving other critical initiatives of non-interest in our capital market plan.\n\n\u201cAt SEC, we have been approached by a number of potential corporate issuers of scope and we have registered the first issuer of scope, we are aware that a number of corporate issuers are interested in issuing sukuk, but some of them have noted that they will like clarity on the neutrality of the sukuk vis-a-vis corporate bonds.\n\n\u201cThe increased supply of scope will hasten the development of the non-interest capital market because I am confident that the non-interest finance experts gathered here today will invoke the interest and attention of participants and enhance their knowledge of the subject to eventually lead to the birth of promoters and on takers of non-interest products of the capital market\u201d.\n\nIn a goodwill message, Director General of the National Pensions Commission, PenCom Haji Aisha Dabir Umar commended the SEC for organizing this webinar on the Imperative of non-interest capital market products for the pension industry.\n\nRepresented by Commissioner Administration, PenCom, Dr. Umar Farouk Aminu, the PenCom Boss acknowledged with appreciation, the collaborative efforts of Pencom and SEC which have over the years laid acceptable values and good governance standards in their investments of pension funds in the Nigerian capital market.\n\nShe said, \u201cAs you may be aware, Pencom, recently released a list of operational quidelines for non-interest funds. It is our belief that this singular act will promote financial inclusion in Nigeria, and particularly drive enrolment in the macro pension fund. It is my call that industry practitioners gathered here will come up with practical measures to facilitate the issuance of non-interest instruments in the market\u201d.\n\nShe stated that PenCom remains resolute in ensuring that all instruments meet this requirement before pension investment and commended the collaboration between PenCom and SEC towards deepening the capital market to sustainably introduce non-interest products.\n\nIn his remarks, Secretary General of the Islamic Financial Services Board, Dr. Bello Danbatta said Islamic finance is a complementary system adding that no system would be able to develop without integrating it in its financial system.\n\nHe said \u201cSustainable finance is not complete without integrative finance and integrative finance is only possible when you have non-interest and interest based finance.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nAhead of the Anambra State governorship election billed for Saturday, Nov 6, 2021, the Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), has advised the electorate in the state to go out in their numbers to cast their ballot.\n\nThe foundation which restated its position in a statement on Wednesday by its president, Professor Uzodinma Nwala, said it was unequivocally opposed to the boycott of the election as being canvassed in some quarters.\n\nAccording to it, \u201cBoycotting it means providing opportunity for the candidate of the enemy to be declared winner or to impose the enemy\u2019s candidate as the Administrator of Anambra State if there is no election.\n\n\u201cYes, they are determined to rig the lection no matter what we do. But it is better for the world to be told that they rigged the election than to be told that we boycotted the election and thereby provided them the opportunity to seize political power in Anambra State.\u201d\n\nADF also expressed reservations with the idea of locking down the Southeast geopolitical zone, noting that individuals who have no interest of the zone at heart may be working to weaken its economy and make it vulnerable.\n\n\u201cAs for the Sit-At-Home said to have been declared by some pro-Biafra organizations, ADF has always held the view that you do not force any person to vote or not to vote. Exercise of franchise (the right to vote) is a voluntary right of any normal human being. That right cannot be enforced one way or the other, not even under a dictatorship,\u201d Prof. Nwala said.\n\n\u201cAnybody enforcing Sit-at home is doing so to divide our ranks, to weaken our economy, to promote anarchy and make us easily vulnerably. No sane son or daughter of Alaigbo wants the enemy to have his way; that is to say, to conquer us. No sane son or daughter of Alaigbo would put us in the harm\u2019s way and promote the conquest of Alaigbo either by military might or through promotion of anarchy in Alaigbo.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that the enemy is doing all he can to promote anarchy in Alaigbo in order to scare away our businessmen as well as foreign investors. A good deal of the killings, the horrors and anarchy in Alaigbo today is promoted by the enemy and their allies in our midst. Our duty is to expose them and not to join them in promoting anarchy and making life doubly miserable for our already emasculated people.\n\n\u201cIf, as we all seem to agree, that there should be no enforced Sit-at-home. Our duty is to be in the streets countering anyone enforcing the Sit-at-home with our placards. It is true, as many have said, that the enemy who is armed to the teeth is parading our roads, streets and markets, killing our youths no matter what they say or do.\n\n\u201cADF has always declared our right of self-defense. That right is inalienable.\n\n\u201cYes, Alaigbo is currently under siege. The enemy is in dire haste to overrun and seize our land or make it ungovernable. Our duty is to prevent this by all means possible.\n\n\u201cBut in doing this we must not play into the hands of the enemy. We must not divide our ranks, nor recklessly join in killing our youths.\n\n\u201cYes, there are those among us who are serving the enemy. We know them. But to say that all political leaders, all traditional rulers, all religious leaders, all intellectuals, etc, are enemies or are of no use, is to tactlessly divide our ranks and play into the hands of the enemy.\n\n\u201cADF is aware that there are those in our midst including some politicians, some traditional rulers, some clergy and some intellectuals and women whom we all, including the bulk of our youth respect. If we don\u2019t listen to them now or if we publicly embarrass them, who then are we going to respect or listen to! If nobody is good enough to deserve our respect, then we are saying that we all are anarchists.\n\n\u201cIt is to the joy and advantage of the enemy to have a situation whereby the youth and activists of Alaigbo do not listen to anybody. That is a situation of generalized anarchy. This is the worst thing that can happen to a people surrounded by the enemy.\n\n\u201cNo! we must not allow this to happen to us at this critical time.\n\n\u201cThe Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) calls on our people in Anambra State, saying -Let us go and cast our vote for those we believe can stand for and by us!\n\n\u201cLet us not disrupt the Anambra election. Let us not continue to enforce Sit-At-Home, nor should we disturb those who on their own decise to stay at home.\n\nSit-At-Home must be Voluntary!\n\nLet Election and Sit-At-Home be Voluntary.\n\n\u201cThe Autonomous Republic we yearn for is one to be governed by the rule of law, discipline and brotherhood! Let us not destroy our economy.\n\n\u201cBecause of the prevailing anarchy in our land many of our business men are relocating to the NORTH and the WEST or even abroad. Who is the loser? ALAIGBO!\n\n\u201cThat is what the enemy wants to achieve- to destroy our economy, the main stay of our survival.\n\n\u201cThose of our people abroad, please join us in reviving our economy which the enemy has ruined. Join us to promote the AKURUO ULO Movement, to the prevent hunger, to empower the youth, to protect out farms and communities and to protect our women and daughter and our people in general!\n\n\u201cFinally ADF is one with you is insisting that our son and brother Nnamdi Kanu must be released and freed from the enemy\u2019s bondage.\n\n\u201cADF was the first pan-Igbo organization to visit Nnamdi Kanu and his colleagues when they were in Kuje Prison. ADF was the first pan-Igbo organization to speak and condemn his illegal abduction and deportation to Nigeria. ADF is at the moment joining other well-meaning patriots in seeking a political solution for his release,\n\n\u201cAs for the thousands of our innocent youths, men and women currently being killed or maimed by the enemy, we shall never forget! The Day of Atonement will surely come. God willing! We shall be Free, Strong and Respected within the Committee of Nations!\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "According to the DAILY POST, the previously calm Ogun State is progressively becoming a \u201cbattlefield\u201d where cults carry out their evil activities with no restrictions.\n\nCultists and other criminal organizations have recently defied the police and the state administration by killing and maiming their victims in broad sight.\n\nThis is despite the governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun, threatening to deal harshly with cultists, demolish their homes, and prosecute their parents.\n\n\u201cIf I catch anybody engaging in cultism, the person, his parents and their house will be severely dealt with.\n\n\u201cAny house where a cultist is discovered will be demolished. Parents should warn their children because it is going to be tough.\n\n\u201cOur state is adjudged the most peaceful state in this country. Without peace, there cannot be meaningful socio-economic development. So, we will deal decisively with anyone that wants to disturb our peace in this state,\u201d the governor seriously warned recently.\n\nCult fights were a regular occurrence in Ogun, especially in Abeokuta, the state capital, and Ijebu-Ode, indicating that the governor\u2019s threat had little effect on the cultists.\n\nAbiodun has recognized that cultism is one of the State\u2019s security challenges. He did, however, feel that \u201ccult activities have now abated due to the collaborative efforts of the Nigeria Police, the State Security Services, and the Nigerian Army,\u201d and that \u201ccult activities have now abated.\u201d\n\nHowever, the current reality in Ogun did not match Abiodun\u2019s claim that cult confrontations in the state were subsiding. This is because the cultists, who had previously carried out their murderous battles at night, had suddenly grown bolder, chasing a victim on a motorcycle till he was slashed to death at Kuto around 2:30pm on Tuesday.\n\nOn the same day, a young man merely known as Alagbole was killed in front of traders and passers-by on Elite road in Abeokuta by the same group of people.\n\nThe cultists plunged Abeokuta into disarray by parading through the city on three motorcycles, armed with lethal weapons, with no respect for security agents.\n\nThe police in Ogun State have confirmed the alarming occurrence that has left many people shaken, adding that some of those responsible have been apprehended.\n\nWhile acknowledging that one person was killed on Elite Road, Oyeyemi stated that he had yet to receive information about the Kuto tragedy.\n\nHowever, a trustworthy source told our correspondent that the okada rider who was hacked at Kuto had his body placed at an Abeokuta mortuary.\n\nThe deaths, according to Oyeyemi, could hardly be unrelated to the cult organizations\u2019 typical struggle for supremacy.\n\nGov. Abiodun was in Lagos yesterday as the killings in Abeokuta were taking place, illustrating how the state had dealt with violence and made Ogun safe for investors under his watch.\n\nAbiodun addressed at the Nigeria Police Force, Zone II Headquarters, Onikan, Lagos, 2021 Capacity Building Workshop for security agencies in Lagos and Ogun States.\n\nLocal vigilantes, Community Development Associations, and the Amotekun Corps, he claimed, have been integrated into the state security architecture to improve the efficiency and efficacy of policing in Ogun.\n\nHe stated that if more jobs were produced and more adolescents were empowered, the country\u2019s current instability might be reduced to the bare minimum.\n\n\u201cArming the police and military isn\u2019t the only way to combat insecurity. Insecurity, poverty, education, drug misuse, and all other socioeconomic indicators are linked. As far as equipping the police is beneficial, as we have done in Ogun. It\u2019s critical that we consider all of the available options for reducing unemployment,\u201d he continued.\n\nBecause the national police would not be able to handle the vast security difficulties in all regions of the country, state-based security agencies, according to Abiodun, were developed to deal with unique security challenges.\n\n\u201cGovernor Dapo Abiodun announced open 2021 Capacity Building for Nigeria Police Force in Lagos with the theme: \u2018Internal security operations under a democratic dispensation,\u2019\u201d a local, Michael Ogunsiji, said of the security concerns in Ogun.\n\n\u201cBut, his home state, cultists are having field days carrying arms and other dangerous weapons freely without any disturbance; killing two people at Elite road and Kuto today in broad daylight. Yet, some \u2018no brainers\u2019 are saying Ogun is safe in the hand of the Governor.\n\n\u201cIf this can happen in the state capital without anyone challenging these criminals and other security threats, what would be the faith of the rural settlers?\n\n\u201cMr. Governor, the killings are getting too much. You need to wake up and do something.\n\n\u201cResidents of Sapon, Oke-Ijemo, Ake, Ijemo, Ago-Oko, Oke Lantoro, Leme, Mokola, Saje, Ajitadun, Arinlese, Oju Ogbara, Ijaiye, Ilugun cannot sleep with their two eyes closed.\n\n\u201cIt has worsened to the extent that, residents and shop owners of these areas have to close their businesses as soon it is 7pm for fear of cultists attacks.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, other residents of Abeokuta have called on Abiodun to make good his threat by waging serious way against cultism and other acts of criminality in the State, especially kidnapping which the governor himself has identified as another challenge.\n\nOne Dayo Akanbi narrated how cultists trouble places like Ijemo, Ilogbo, Ago Oko, Isale Ake, Ejigbo, Oke Lantoro and others, asking the police and government to take action.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere is no more security in Abeokuta again. On daily basis, cultists engage in clashes, fighting and killing one another. They are even using the opportunity to rob people in places around Abeokuta. The government should do something before everything gets out of hand.\u201d\n\nIn his word, a commentator, Akorode Khameel, asked, \u201cWhere were the security operatives when these cultists were butchering an Okada rider without getting disturbed right in the act?\u201d\n\nKhameel spoke further that, \u201cTalk of the spate of insecurity again in the state and the country in general. How did we get here? I know cultists have no regard for values but, what about laws? Now people will start living in perpetual fear. The government should please make Abeokuta and other areas in the state safe for us.\u201d\n\nDavid Adegbola suggested that Ogun government should set up a joint security patrol, involving the police and the military.\n\n\u201cI think there should be a joint task patrol in the state, especially Abeokuta metropolis. It is not until an election is coming before joint task force patrol should come up. Also, it should be made up of police, the Army, Navy and other security agencies.\u201d",

          "title": "NEF to FG: Declare bandits terrorists, tackle IPOB for hitch-free Anambra poll",
          "text": "The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has urged the federal government to do everything within its powers to combat banditry, kidnapping and all forms of insecurity in the North-east and other parts of the country, \u201ceven if it means labelling bandits as terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe Forum made the position known in a statement issued Wednesday in Abuja at the end of its meeting under the leadership of its Convener, Professor Ango Abdullahi.\n\nThe meeting, it said, undertook a sweeping survey of recent developments in the country, and resolved to intervene to save Nigeria from further devastation.\n\nThe statement was signed by NEF\u2019s Director Publicity and Advocacy Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed.\n\nThe Forum said formation of a political force to counter the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had become imperative to give Nigerians options outside of the dominant political parties, adding that many politicians were benefiting from the insecurity bedevilling the country.\n\nNEF said: \u201cThe Forum took note of the worsening security situation in the country, in spite of claims by the administration to the contrary. Boko Haram insurgency continues to be a major threat in the North East, while kidnapping and large scale banditry in many other parts of the North are taking over lives of large portions of the population. IPOB threatens to eradicate the influence of legitimate authority in the South East. Politicians and influential people are worsening the nation\u2019s fault lines by the manner they seek political advantages through the exploitation of threats to our unity and peaceful co-existence. Poverty and poor governance are fuelling widespread alienation from mainstream social existence.\n\n\u201cThe Forum joins the nation in its outrage over the fact that Maiduguri, Borno State capital has been without power from the national grid for ten months, and is alarmed by signs that its population could be forced to resign to living with this additional assault on their lives and livelihood. This situation must be reversed at all cost. The planned closure of Internally-Dispersed Persons (IDP) camps should be carefully considered so that it does not place more victims in avoidable peril.\n\n\u201cThe Forum regrets that arguments over labelling bandits as terrorists waste attention and energy. If labelling bandits as terrorists will substantially improve the capacity of the Nigerian state to eliminate this expanding scourge, the Forum supports it without reservation. In any case, all lawful options in bringing this menace to an end must be pursued.\n\n\u201cMeasures put in place to contain its spread should be diligently monitored and evaluated, and those that merely worsen the condition of living of law-abiding population should be removed. Governments should be sensitive to the possibility of severe food shortage in the next few months in many Northern communities, in addition to escalating cost of living, which will combine to confront the poor with intolerable conditions of living.\u201d\n\nIPOB\n\nOn IPOB, Baba-Ahmed said: \u201cActivities of the outlawed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) represent an unacceptable threat to security and rights of fellow Nigerians in the states of the South East region and the country as a whole. Its damage to the economy of the South East is already registered as a major disaster. IPOB\u2019s plans to frustrate the Governorship election in Anambra State this weekend must be resisted. The on-going trial of its leader should proceed in accordance with the laws of the land and elites from the region, who demand that he is accorded special treatment in return for peace, should know that they are merely inviting more threats on the people they should help to protect.\u201d\n\n2023\n\nOn the 2023 general elections, the \u201cForum notes that the nation is coming to terms with a major requirement of the democratic process, which is the right of all citizens to freely participate in all political activities. It is now accepted wisdom that every Nigerian can contest for any office to which he/she is qualified, and voters will choose their next leaders in credible elections.\n\n\u201cThe Forum salutes all Nigerians who toiled to restore a level playing field to our democratic system. It is now left to politicians and other leaders to conduct the type of politics that builds into it real equity, fairness, competence and justice, through inclusive campaigns and responsible approach towards the 2023 elections. The people of the North want to work with other Nigerians to produce a competent and committed Nigerian leadership that will restore confidence in our country\u2019s capacity to survive and rebuild itself for the next generations.\u201d\n\nAdvocates more options\n\n\u201cThe Forum notes that PDP and APC dominate the political landscape. It further notes that Nigerians will benefit from additional options, both to improve competition and to broaden the leadership selection process. The Forum looks forward to the emergence and consolidation of other parties in the political environment. The continued existence of State electoral commissions which conduct elections into Local Government Councils is severely damaging the democratic process. The Forum advises that the on-going constitutional amendments should include the scrapping of these commissions and the assumption of their duties by INEC.\n\n\u201cThe Forum notes that opportunities exist for Nigerians to register to vote in the 2023 elections. Apathy, anger and frustrations arising from failure of elected leaders to improve lives of citizens and insecurity are keeping many Nigerians from their rights and obligations to register and vote. The Forum urges especially Northerners to register and prepare to vote for new and more competent and honest leaders in the 2023 elections,\u201d the statement added.\n\nUS threatens visa ban\n\nIn a related development, the United States said it was paying close attention to actions of individuals who interfere with the democratic process or instigate violence against civilian populations before, during, or after the November 6 governorship election in Anambra state.\n\nIn a statement by the US Mission Wednesday, the American government said: \u201cThe United States looks forward to a gubernatorial election in Anambra state on November 6 that is peaceful and transparent, with results that accurately reflect the will of the state\u2019s residents.\n\n\u201cWe will be paying close attention to actions of individuals who interfere with the democratic process or instigate violence against civilian populations before, during, or after the elections.\n\n\u201cWe will not hesitate to consider consequences, including visa restrictions for those found to be responsible for election-related violence or undermining the democratic process.\n\n\u201cUnder U.S. immigration law, certain violations also may lead to restrictions on family members.\n\n\u201cWe call on citizens, electoral officials, party members, and security force personnel to do their part in ensuring a credible and secure electoral process.\u201d",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said it has contacted the voters yet to collect their permanent voters card (PVC) by text messages and e-mail addresses informing them of the exact locations to collect their cards.\n\nINEC Chairman Professor Mahmood Yakubu stated this Wednesday at the stakeholders\u2019 meeting in Awka.\n\nHe said the commission had through the media, sensitised electorate to the availability of the cards for collection, adding that many had already done so, while appealing to those yet to comply to do so.\n\nYakubu reminded \u201cpolitical parties, candidates and their supporters that vote-buying is illegal under our laws, just like the ban on the use of smart phone or other photographic devices in the voting cubicles is still in force.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cthe anti-graft agencies, who are members of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES), will deploy their personnel to arrest and prosecute violators.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn Saturday 6th November 2021, Anambra state will make history as the first governorship election in Nigeria in which the commission will deploy the Biometric Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) device,\u201d the INEC boss said, adding \u201cthis new device replaces the Smart Card Reader (SCR) used in previous elections since 2015.\n\n\u201cThe BVAS has the dual capacity for fingerprint and facial authentication of voters. This is to guard against voting by identity theft where one person uses another person\u2019s Permanent Voter\u2019s Card (PVC) to vote using the incident form.\n\n\u201cWith this development, the use of the incident form is abolished. No voter without genuine PVC will vote. No voter who has not been successfully accredited electronically using the BVAS will vote,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nHe added that \u201cthe BVAS is also equipped with a camera. Therefore, it has the capacity to snap Polling Unit level result and upload same to the INEC Result Viewing (IReV) portal so that citizens can view results as election is concluded in each polling unit.\u201d\n\nThe INEC chairman further stated that \u201cthere is no need for the Z-Pad since its functions have been embedded in the BVAS. I am glad to report that all the BVAS required for the election on Saturday have been configured and delivered to Anambra state.\u201d\n\nHe also told stakeholders that \u201celection duty staff have also been trained on the use of the device and we have sufficient technical staff to respond to any glitches that may occur.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Anambra state governorship election holds in the next three days. As far as INEC is concerned, there are two activities left in our Timetable and Schedule of Activities. The first one is the end of campaign by political parties which is at midnight tomorrow Thursday 4th November 2021.\n\n\u201cThe second is the election day which is Saturday 6th November 2021. These two activities will conclude the 14 items listed in the Timetable for the election released by the commission about 11 months ago on 19th January 2021. INEC has diligently implemented every activity on schedule.\n\n\u201cThe Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) for Anambra state has just briefed us on our detailed preparations for the election, including logistics and the recruitment, training and deployment of election duty staff. Non-sensitive materials have been delivered to the 21 Local Government Areas of the state.\n\n\u201cThe sensitive materials are secure in the branch of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) here in Awka. As is always the case on the eve of major elections, INEC will invite political parties, civil society organisations and the media to the CBN tomorrow Thursday 4th November 2021 to inspect the sensitive materials and to witness their movement to the various Local Government Areas under security escort.\n\n\u201cBy the same arrangement, the materials will be delivered to the Registration Areas or wards on Friday 5th November 2021 to facilitate the opening of polling units at 8.30am on Election Day i.e. Saturday 6th November 2021.\n\n\u201cI want to assure all voters in Anambra State that in designing the sensitive materials for the election, the Commission has introduced additional visible and invisible security features, including different colour codes.\n\n\u201cMaterials have also been customised by Local Government Areas and Polling Units. Let me therefore warn those who may attempt to compromise the process that we have put in place sufficient safeguards to detect counterfeits.\n\n\u201cWe are also determined to prosecute perpetrators of electoral malpractice, including any election duty staff found to be complicit. The choice of the next Governor of Anambra State is in the hands of the eligible voters and their will must prevail.\n\n\u201cThe commission is also aware of the concern expressed about the availability of PVCs for new registrants in Anambra State. At the end of the recent Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise, a total of 138,802 citizens completed the registration. After cleaning up the data, the Commission identified and archived 62,698 multiple registrants.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the number of valid registrants is 76,104. This figure has been added to 5,674 requests for transfer, update of voter information and replacement of lost or damaged PVCs, bringing the total of valid registrations to 81,774. I am glad to report that the PVCs have been printed and delivered to all the Local Government Areas for collection by voters.\n\n\u201cWe have also contacted the voters by text messages and e-mail addresses and informed them of the exact locations to collect their cards. Through the media, we have also been sensitizing them to the availability of the cards for collection. Many of them have done so already. Let me therefore once again appeal to those that have not done so that their cards are available for collection.\n\n\u201cAnother issue that I need to address is the distribution of voters by polling units in Anambra state. About four weeks ago, the Commission published the register of voters for the election on 7th October 2021 i.e. 30 days to the election as required by law. Each of the 18 political parties was given a soft copy of the register here in Awka.\n\n\u201cIn addition to meeting the requirement of the law, the presentation of the register is significant for another reason. The Anambra governorship election is the first time that voting is taking place in polling units since the recent successful conversion of voting points arising from the expansion of voter access to polling units in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAn additional 1,112 polling units were established in Anambra state in addition to the existing 4,608 locations. This brings the total number of polling units in the State to 5,720.\n\n\u201cVoters were encouraged to seize the opportunity of the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise to transfer to the new polling units most convenient for them. Many did not do so. This can be partly attributed to the security situation in the State which has affected the Commission\u2019s pre-election outdoor activities, including voter education and sensitisation. Understandably, the voters have also been cautious.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the Commission did not use its powers under Section 42 of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) to allot voters to the new polling units to minimise the disruptions that may occur from such a decision in view of the forthcoming Governorship election.\n\n\u201cConsequently, out of the 5,720 polling units in Anambra State, 86 (1.5%) have no voters. Consequently, the Commission will not be deploying personnel and materials to these polling units.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, 894 (15.6%) of the polling units have between 1 and 49 voters. Election will hold in these polling units. We will continue to work with all stakeholders to ensure that all polling units have voters allotted to them ahead of the 2023 General election.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, in our avowed commitment to transparency, the Commission has compiled a comprehensive list of all the polling units without voters as well as those having under 50 registered voters. Last week in Abuja, we had a special consultative meeting with the leadership of all political parties in and shared with them copies of the comprehensive locations of these polling units.\n\n\u201cWe appealed to them to quickly inform their branches in Anambra state as well as their candidates for the election. I would like to seize this opportunity to draw the attention of political parties, candidates and other stakeholders to this situation. Copies of the list have been distributed to all stakeholders at this meeting. Already, the same document has been uploaded to our website and social media platforms for public information.\n\n\u201cOn this note, let me reassure all stakeholders of the commission\u2019s commitment to inclusivity. In line with our policy for equal opportunity for all Nigerians to participate, the Commission introduced assistive devices for Persons With Disability (PWDs) during elections.\n\n\u201cThis includes the Braille Ballot Guide and magnifying glasses at polling units for the visually impaired as well as voter education posters for the hearing-impaired. I am glad to report that the Braille Ballot Guide and magnifying glasses will be deployed in the election this Saturday.\n\n\u201cI wish to reassure you that INEC will remain an equal opportunity commission for all Nigerians irrespective of disability. As an affirmation of this commitment, data on disability is being collected in the ongoing CVR to enable us to serve this category of voters better.\n\n\u201cI call on the leaders of political parties and candidates to continue to appeal to your supporters to eschew hate speech or disruptive behaviour before, during and after the election. Doing so will only further compound the current situation and scare voters away from exercising their rights as citizens. Working with the security agencies, we have put so much in place for the successful conduct of this election.\n\n\u201cLet us by our words and action support the peaceful and credible conclusion of the 2021 Anambra state governorship election,\u201d the commission\u2019s chairman pleaded.\n\n",

          "text": "Frontline Islamic human rights organization, the Muslim Rights Concern, MURIC , has urged the Kwara State government to waste no time in implementing the recommendations of an 11-man committee set up to investigate the corporal punishment meted to some Arabic students in Ganmo, Irepodun local government area of the state.\n\nThe committee had in its report recommended the regulation of Arabic and Islamic schools and also advised the government to immediately reconstitute the Arabic Education Board in the state.\n\nReacting to the development, MURIC, in a statement signed and released yesterday by its founder and director, Professor Ishaq Akintola, also commended the committee for doing a clinical job.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe Kwara State Government has received the report of the 11-man committee set up to investigate the corporal punishment meted to some Arabic students in Ganmo, Irepodun local government area of the state on 9th October 2021. The Justice Haroon-led committee recommended the regulation of Arabic and Islamic schools in the state and the reconstitution of the Arabic Education Board\n\n\u201cMURIC commends the committee for treating the matter with military dispatch and for addressing the core issues involved. Inaugurated on the 15th day of October, 2021, the committee commenced sitting immediately up till the 24th day of October, 2021 and submitted its report the next day. This is record time.\n\n\u201cWe implore the state government to speedily and steadily implement the committee\u2019s recommendations. The state government should also note that the success of its implementation depends on its sincerity and commitment to the cause of Arabic education.\n\n\u201cIt is equally important to point out the immense benefits which the state government stands to reap from paying adequate attention to Arabic and Islamic education. In the kitty are a steady fall in crime rate, reduction of corrupt practices in both public and private sectors and stability in family affairs as a result of the infusion of moral guidelines in young Muslims in the Arabic schools.\n\n\u201cArabic and Islamic studies as a twin discipline is the bedrock of morality in any society and any government that undermines any of the two does so at the risk of moral degeneration, unbridled chaos and criminality ad infinitum.\n\n\u201cWe invite the Kwara State government to ponder over the cassu belli for the preponderance of high moral value in scholars of Islam and other Muslims who passed through Arabic schools.\n\n\u201cWe glow with pride that President Muhammadu Buhari who sits on Nigeria\u2019s humongous wealth but who refuses to steal one kobo is a product of the Arabic school and he is Qur\u2019an-literate. The secret behind the uncommon, unequalled and jet-age performance of the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ali Pantami, can be traced to the fact that he is a Shaykh and a cerebral Islamic scholar.\n\n\u201cThere is also no gainsaying the fact that Professor Ishaq Oloyede, a professor of Islamic studies who is making waves at the Joint Admissions Matriculation Board, JAMB, has proved beyond reasonable doubt the stuff Islamic scholars are made of as ambassadors of integrity, credibility, probity and accountability.\n\n\u201cIndeed, in those three Muslim public officials alone the Kwara State Government stands a good chance of setting up stainless models for young Muslims in Kwara State.\u201d",
          "summary": "The committee had in its report recommended the regulation of Arabic and Islamic schools and also advised the government to immediately reconstitute the Arabic Education Board in the state.\nThe Justice Haroon-led committee recommended the regulation of Arabic and Islamic schools in the state and the reconstitution of the Arabic Education Board\u201cMURIC commends the committee for treating the matter with military dispatch and for addressing the core issues involved.\nThe state government should also note that the success of its implementation depends on its sincerity and commitment to the cause of Arabic education.\n\u201cIt is equally important to point out the immense benefits which the state government stands to reap from paying adequate attention to Arabic and Islamic education.\n\u201cIndeed, in those three Muslim public officials alone the Kwara State Government stands a good chance of setting up stainless models for young Muslims in Kwara State.\u201d",

          "title": "Ikoyi Building Collapse: Mistakes Were Made From All Angles \u2013 Sanwo-Olu",
          "text": "Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has decried the tragic building collapse in Ikoyi which has so far claimed 21 lives, saying \u201cmistakes were made from all angles\u201d.\n\nThe governor spoke about the tragedy on Wednesday when he visited the site of the building collapse where emergency workers remain engaged in a rescue operation.\n\n\u201cThis is an event that could be described clearly as a national disaster. Mistakes were made from all angles,\u201d the governor said, adding that such an event \u201creally should not be happening in a modern-day city like Lagos.\u201d\n\nThe governor who extended his condolences to the families and people whose loved ones were affected by the tragedy also announced members of a panel of inquiry to probe the collapse.\n\nREAD ALSO: Ikoyi Building Collapse: Sanwo-Olu Visits Scene, Unveils Probe Panel Members\n\nHe promised that those found culpable will be made to face the law.\n\nAmid questions over what led to yet another building collapse in Lagos, the governor suspended the General Manager of the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA), Gbolahan Oki, indefinitely on Tuesday.\n\nHe explained that the suspension was just a first step in the quest to hold those responsible to account.\n\n\u201cWe will say that we had to take from the head; from the leadership of that agency,\u201d he said on Wednesday. \u201cAnd you can rest assured that if they are other people that are found in the course of the investigation, they will face the full wrath of the law.\u201d\n\nNo Manifest\n\nAsked if there were violations of the National Building Code in the construction, the governor answered in the affirmative.\n\n\u201cI will not have the details but from preliminary investigation, yes, there would be violations. The simple thing such as not having a manifest on site is a violation of the law in itself. So, there are several violations that would have happened here.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the importance of having a manifest at a construction site, the governor explained how it has affected the rescue operation.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, what we have seen in the last 48 hours is that we do not have the manifest of everybody that was on site which is against the law,\u201d he said. \u201cOn a daily basis, you are meant to have a manifest of everybody that is working in a construction (site). There is no manifest.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd unfortunately too, it\u2019s also been very difficult for us to identify or for anybody to come forward as, maybe a project manager or a staff of the developer or contractor.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the government and emergency workers have been \u201cwithout having full information\u201d about the construction company\u2019s mode of operation.\n\n\u201cThat is why we do not know what numbers we are dealing with, or what the mix (of workers) is, or what work they are doing there,\u201d Governor Sanwo-Olu said.\n\n\u201cWhat we do know, as we speak now, is that we\u2019ve been able to rescue nine individuals. Six of them are still in the hospital\u2026 So, we have all their names, their telephone numbers, their pictures and everything; and three that have been discharged for minor injuries.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we have 21 confirmed mortality meaning people that have been taken out from this site and taken to the morgue\u201d.\n\nTragic Monday\n\nIt was a tragic day for family members whose loved ones had left home for the site for one business or the other. In a situation like this, the victims are likely to be engineers, construction workers, and hawkers who sell food and other items to workers at building sites.\n\nThe 21-storey building which was under construction and located along Gerrard Road collapsed on Monday afternoon.\n\nSince the incident, the Deputy Governor of Lagos, Dr Obafemi Hamzat, has visited the site at least twice.\n\nAmid concerns that Governor Sanwo-Olu did not visit the site the day the building collapsed, he explained that he was out of the country at the time.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for me to let you know where I have been in the last one-and-a-half days,\u201d he said. \u201cI actually travelled out of Nigeria in the early morning of Sunday. I had to travel to Rome to attend the G20 Summit in Rome.\n\n\u201cThere was a side conference by the European Commission for African and Asia and I was invited to a speaking engagement and so we had engagement throughout Sunday night and also on Monday.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I was actually on the rostrum speaking on Monday when I got a call of what had happened here in Lagos, and I had to turn back because I was also due to go to the COP26 Climate Change Conference where I had a speaking engagement but we had to terminate and truncate that and made a turnaround back to Lagos.\u201d",

          "text": "Unai Emery has ruled himself out of contention to be Newcastle United\u2019s next manager, saying he is \u201c100%\u201d committed to Villarreal.\n\nThe former Arsenal boss confirmed on Tuesday he had been approached by the Premier League club, who made him their first choice to replace Steve Bruce.\n\nIn a social media post on Wednesday, Emery said Villarreal is \u201cmy home\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am grateful for the interest of a great club, but even more grateful to be here,\u201d he wrote.\n\nEmery thanked Villarreal president Fernando Roig and his family for their support, adding: \u201cNo matter how much noise there was yesterday in another country, within the club there was transparency and loyalty with the Roig family and with my squad, and for me it is the most important thing.\n\n\u201cVillarreal is my home and I am 100% committed.\n\n\u201cThat is why I communicated to Fernando Roig my decision to want to continue being part of this project because of the commitment and respect that I perceive from the club and from my players, which is mutual and reciprocal.\u201d\n\nNewcastle had hoped to have the Spaniard in place by the weekend.Instead, their manager search continues, with former Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe and Paulo Fonseca, who left Roma in May, possible alternatives.\n\nSpanish football expert Guillem Balague says those advising Emery were left feeling uncertain about the club\u2019s strategy, with stories in England emerging that the shortlist was down to him and Howe \u2013 two men with contrasting approaches and vastly different levels of experience within European football.\n\n\u201cEmery felt a huge pressure on the day of their match [a 2-0 win over Young Boys in the Champions League on Tuesday],\u201d said Balague.\n\n\u201cAnd then there was the lack of a clear vision from the club. If you want him, do you approach him in such a rushed way, without an official offer and with it coming out from the English side that it is all practically done?\n\n\u201cAlso, the different number and style of the candidates being considered appears to be a sign of a confused vision. That was a concern to some of those involved in conversations with the club hierarchy.\u201d\n\nAnalysis\n\nUnai Emery\u2019s decision to stay at Villarreal rather than take over as Newcastle United\u2019s new manager is a bitter blow to the club\u2019s Saudi Arabian hierarchy and continues a faltering start to their time in charge.\n\nIn a blizzard of optimistic messages coming out of the north-east of England on Tuesday, it seemed Emery would find the attraction of Tyneside impossible to resist and he would be in his post before the end of the week to oversee the great revival.\n\nThere was even a video unearthed of Emery supposedly gazing wistfully around St James\u2019 Park during his time at Arsenal, presumably suggesting that this was the place he was always destined to come.\n\nNot quite.\n\nIt emerged in Spain, after Emery had guided Villarreal to victory over Young Boys of Berne in the Champions League on Tuesday night, that this was not quite the done deal and he was supposedly less than impressed by the lack of a clear vision in Newcastle\u2019s future plan.\n\nThe confirmation of this damaging setback came in statement from Emery re-affirming his commitment to Villarreal, leaving Newcastle\u2019s money-no-object owners to leaf through the list of candidates below Emery on their list.\n\nThis has been a less-than-ideal dawn to this brave new world at Newcastle United, with Steve Bruce\u2019s inevitable sacking delayed, more poor results and their top target staying put in Spain.\n\nThe usual suspects will now be rounded up, with former Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe the early alternative, but they will all know they are second choice at best after Emery\u2019s very public rejection of any interest Newcastle had shown.\n\nNewcastle cannot afford any more mis-steps. They need to get their new man in and quickly because, just in case anyone has forgotten amid the hysteria and jubilation of former owner Mike Ashley\u2019s departure, they have a team that currently has \u201crelegation\u201d stamped over it and all the money in the world might not help them unless they stay in the Premier League this season.",

          "title": "Swiss Prosecutors Charge Blatter and Platini with Fraud",
          "text": "Former FIFA President Sepp Blatter and ex-UEFA President Michel Platini have been charged with fraud over unlawfully arranging a payment of two million Swiss francs ($2.19m), according to the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) of Switzerland.\n\nThe two men were indicted on Tuesday following a six-year investigation into the payment that Blatter authorised to be paid from world football\u2019s governing body FIFA to Platini in 2011. Blatter and Platini said the payment was for backdated salary.\n\n\u201cThis payment damaged FIFA\u2019s assets and unlawfully enriched Platini,\u201d Switzerland\u2019s OAG said.\n\nThe OAG accused Blatter and Platini of \u201cfraud, in the alternative of misappropriation, in the further alternative of criminal mismanagement as well as of forgery of a document\u201d. Platini, a football great who captained France to victory in the 1984 European Championship, was also charged as an accomplice.\n\nThe Swiss investigation was opened amid a series of scandals that engulfed FIFA. The affair led to a FIFA ethics investigation, following which both men were forced to leave their positions.\n\nBlatter, 85, and Platini were both banned in 2016 from football for six years over the payment, made with Blatter\u2019s approval for work done a decade earlier. Both have denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cI look forward to the trial before the Federal Criminal Court with optimism and I hope that this story will come to an end and that all the facts will be dealt with properly,\u201d Blatter said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cRegarding the payment of the sum of two million francs from FIFA to Michel Platini, I can only repeat myself: It was based on an oral contract that regulated Platini\u2019s advisory activities for FIFA between 1998 and 2002,\u201d he added.\n\nBlatter said the payment had been delayed because FIFA was not able to pay the entire amount and that Platini only made his claim for the money in 2010.\n\nThe former FIFA president said that the payments had been approved by \u201call responsible FIFA bodies\u201d and that Platini had paid tax on the amount \u201cat his Swiss place of residence\u201d.\n\nPlatini said he had only heard news of the trial through media reports.\n\n\u201cThese methods are an extension of the prosecutor\u2019s relentlessness to unduly implicate me in a case in which my entire good faith has been recognised. I fully challenge these unfounded and unfair accusations,\u201d he said.\n\nPlatini\u2019s lawyer Dominic Nellen said he was confident the former Juventus midfielder would prove his innocence.\n\n\u201cIt is shocking that the Federal Prosecutor\u2019s Office brought charges against my client without hearing the witnesses we have requested during the procedure,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFrom the defence\u2019s point of view, it is clear that the investigation should have been discontinued long ago. There are enough witness reports and documents in the case files that prove my client\u2019s innocence.\n\n\u201cI am 100 percent confident that we will be able to prove my client\u2019s innocence in court,\u201d he added.\n\nThe OAG said its investigation revealed that Platini worked as a consultant for then FIFA president Blatter between 1998-2002 and that an annual compensation of 300,000 Swiss francs was agreed in a written contract.\n\nThe OAG said Platini had sent an invoice and had been paid in full but the 66-year-old continued to demand payment.\n\n\u201cOver eight years after the termination of his advisory activity, Platini demanded a payment in the amount of two million Swiss francs,\u201d the OAG said.\n\n\u201cWith Blatter\u2019s involvement, FIFA made a payment to Platini in said amount at the beginning of 2011. The evidence gathered by the OAG has corroborated that this payment to Platini was made without a legal basis.\u201d",

          "text": "A UN joint investigation into alleged atrocities in Ethiopia found all sides committed grave abuses that may amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes in the yearlong war in the Tigray region.\n\nThe report, a collaboration by the UN human rights office with the government-created Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC), was released on Wednesday as the country enters a new state of emergency with rival Tigray forces threatening to advance on the capital, Addis Ababa.\n\nMore than 1,300 rapes were reported to authorities, with many more likely to have been unreported.\n\nMichelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said the Tigray conflict has been marked by \u201cextreme brutality\u201d.\n\n\u201cCivilians in Tigray have been subjected to brutal violence and suffering,\u201d Bachelet said in a press conference on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe joint investigation team has covered numerous violations and abuses including unlawful killings and extrajudicial executions, torture, sexual and gender-based violence, violations against refugees and forced displacement of civilians.\u201d\n\nThe majority of the violations documented between November 2020 and June \u201cappear to have been committed by Ethiopian and Eritrean forces.\u201d The UN has since seen an increase in the number of reports of abuses by Tigrayan forces, as well as by Ethiopian and Eritrean forces.\n\n\u201cIt is vital that all parties heed the repeated calls to end hostilities,\u201d Bachelet said.\n\nThe probe found several Ethiopian military camps were used to torture captured Tigray forces or civilians suspected of supporting them. Others were detained in \u201csecret locations\u201d and military camps across the country, with arbitrary detentions in many cases.\n\nTigray forces detained some ethnic Amhara civilians in western Tigray in the early days of the war on suspicion of supporting the military and in some cases tortured them, the report found.\n\nEthiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said the report dispelled false accusations against his government, including the deliberate denial of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population in Tigray.\n\nThe UN findings \u201cclearly established the claim of genocide as false and utterly lacking of any factual basis,\u201d Abiy said in a statement posted on his Twitter account.\n\nEthiopian authorities have launched their own investigation into the crimes, with some perpetrators already reportedly convicted.\n\nBachelet has expressed concern over a \u201ctroubling lack of transparency\u201d surrounding the investigation conducted by Ethiopian national institutions.\n\n\u201cA key concern of our report is accountability,\u201d the UN official said, adding that an independent investigative mechanism should be considered if national authorities fail to deliver justice to the victims.\n\nThe UN human rights office in Geneva on Tuesday said the Ethiopian government had tried to limit the joint investigation.\n\nUN officials told The Associated Press news agency the collaboration with the government-created EHRC was a precondition for the team to gain access to the war-torn region. Yet, UN officials were unable to visit some of the deadliest sites of the war, including the city of Axum, because of security and other obstacles.\n\nThe joint investigation mentioned a number of obstacles, including the Ethiopian government\u2019s failure to release satellite phones procured for the investigation.\n\nIndependent journalist Samuel Getachew told Al Jazeera the investigation confirmed the accounts that reporters on the ground had been hearing from the very start of the conflict in November 2020.\n\n\u201cThis is an independent investigation, this is the moment we had been waiting for,\u201d Getachew said. \u201cEthiopia needs to address what really happened without making any compromise.\u201d\n\nEthiopia\u2019s cabinet declared on Tuesday a six-month state of emergency that could further aggravate the humanitarian condition in several parts of the country.\n\nPatrick Youssef, regional director of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Africa, told Al Jazeera that the situation in Ethiopia is \u201cextremely dire.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe continue operating within the limits of a rapidly evolving situation and we are currently assessing the impact of the nationwide state of emergency,\u201d Youssef said.\n\n\u201cAs Tigray and other regions remain sealed off, the dire humanitarian conditions are further aggravated.\u201d\n\nYoussef said telephone networks are down in the embattled areas, making it hard for the organisation to assess the needs on the ground.",
          "summary": "A UN joint investigation into alleged atrocities in Ethiopia found all sides committed grave abuses that may amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes in the yearlong war in the Tigray region.\nMichelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said the Tigray conflict has been marked by \u201cextreme brutality\u201d.\nThe probe found several Ethiopian military camps were used to torture captured Tigray forces or civilians suspected of supporting them.\nThe UN human rights office in Geneva on Tuesday said the Ethiopian government had tried to limit the joint investigation.\nYet, UN officials were unable to visit some of the deadliest sites of the war, including the city of Axum, because of security and other obstacles.",

          "text": "Facebook has announced it will no longer use facial recognition software to identify faces in photographs and videos.\n\nThere have been growing concerns about the ethics of facial recognition technology, with questions raised over privacy, racial bias, and accuracy.\n\nRegulators had not yet provided a clear set of rules over how it should be used, the company said.\n\nIt has faced a barrage of criticism over its impact on its users.\n\nUntil now, users of the social media app could choose to opt in to the feature which would scan their face in pictures and notify them if someone else on the platform had posted a picture of them.\n\nIn a blog post, Jerome Pesenti, vice president of artificial intelligence at the firm said: \u201cAmid this ongoing uncertainty, we believe that limiting the use of facial recognition to a narrow set of use cases is appropriate.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, a US government study suggested facial recognition algorithms were far less accurate at identifying African-American and Asian faces compared to Caucasian faces.\n\nAfrican-American women were even more likely to be misidentified, according to the study conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\nLast year, Facebook also settled a long-running legal dispute about the way it scans and tags photos.\n\nThe case has been ongoing since 2015, and it was agreed the firm would pay $550m (\u00a3421m) to a group of users in Illinois who argued its facial recognition tool was in violation of the state\u2019s privacy laws.\n\nOther tech firms such as Amazon and Microsoft have both suspended facial recognition product sales to police as the uses for the technology have become more controversial.\n\nFacebook, which as well as running the world\u2019s largest social media network also owns Instagram and the messaging service Whatsapp, has come under growing pressure from regulators and politicians.\n\nIt is facing increased scrutiny from regulators including the US the Federal Trade Commission, which has filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging anticompetitive practices.\n\nAnd last month, a former employee accused the company of unethical behaviour. Frances Haugen released a cache of internal documents which she said showed Facebook had put profit before user safety.\n\nChief Executive Mark Zuckerburg said Ms Haugen\u2019s claims were part of a co-ordinated effort to \u201cpaint a false picture\u201d of the company.\n\nThe firm recently announced a new name, Meta, for the broader parent company following a series of negative stories about Facebook.\n\nMr Zuckerberg said the existing brand could not \u201cpossibly represent everything that we\u2019re doing today, let alone in the future\u201d and needed to change.",
