          "text": "The Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Ahmed Audi, on Tuesday said the agency had concluded a vulnerability survey on schools across the nation.\n\nAccording to him, the survey was to enable the corps to devise strategies in order to secure schools nationwide.\n\nFrom the survey, Audi revealed that there are over 81,000 schools in the country out of which over 62,000 are susceptible to attacks, adding that most of the schools are government-owned.\n\nHe spoke at the maiden commandant general\u2019s conference during which he rolled out operational vehicles and inaugurated 200 housing units for junior and intermediate officers in Abuja.\n\nAudi said the corps\u2019 female squad had been established to secure school environments to protect children who had become targets of attacks by bandits and kidnappers.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs part of the achievements of the corps from March 1 till date, we have carried out vulnerability survey of all schools in the country to enable us to work out strategies to effectively secure our school environment as part of efforts towards achieving the Safe School Initiative of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cFrom the survey, we discovered that the nation has over 81,000 schools, but it was very surprising and disturbing that out of this figure, over 62,000 schools are very insecure.\n\n\u201cThey have no presence of physical security and there is no fence, which shows how vulnerable our children are to any attack. Most of these schools are public schools.\u201d\n\nHe also hinted that arrangements are in top gear for the deployment of technology solutions for surveillance and monitoring of critical national assets and infrastructure in the country.\n\nAudi called for synergy among security agencies in the country and citizens to contain the rising insecurity.\n\nHe added, \u201cNigeria is going through a new phase of insecurity conflict, which is otherwise known as asymmetric conflict.\n\n\u201cWe are not conversant with this conflict but I think we are getting over it. We have realised that the only strategy to nip this in the bud is that we must return to the basics and work assiduously to use critical intelligence and strategies properly.\n\n\u201cThis synergy should not be among the security agencies alone, the citizens must be part of this so that we can find a solution to this conflict.\u201d",

That is why he is the Generalissimo of our race. He wouldn\u2019t shy away from speaking the truth to power.

Nothing more. Those that perpetrated the evil acts decided to unleash the terror on our people simply because we have been so accommodating. The north has taken us for granted, killing and maiming our people at will. Has any Yoruba man or group unleashed terror in the North? No.\n\n\u201cRather than consoling us for the death of over 50 innocent people, destruction of cars, houses, and the monarch\u2019s palace, the northern group\u2019s only words were to caution Aare Adams, and making unsavoury statements.\n\n\u201cNo good leader will take pride in spilling the blood of innocent citizens through killings, banditry and kidnappings. It is only here in Nigeria that a section of the country relishes in killing other sections without blinking an eye.\n\n\u201cThe CNG needs to understand the implication of its statements against Aare Adams. Do we need any Prophet to tell us that those that perpetrated the dastardly acts are criminal Fulani herdsmen and bandits? The north has a target, but we will stand against all attempts to destroy or decimate our region.\n\nIt is the duty of the police to unravel those behind the killings.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Neither good nor bad. Not because I did not like him, but because I do not know where his powers came from.\n\nSenate mourns TB Joshua\n\n\u201cSo, rather than say what I do not know, I kept mute. But now that he is dead, let him be. It is unChristlike to celebrate death, or mock the departed.\n\n\u201cBut beyond being unChristlike, it is also ungentlemanly to wait until someone is dead before you attack him. If you must attack, do so while he yet lives, that he may have a chance to defend himself.\n\n\u201cScripture asks us to \u201crejoice with those who rejoice, mourn with those who mourn\u201d-Romans 12:15\u2032.",

Fr. Ejike Mbaka to Abuja for interrogation.\n\nMbaka had last Sunday told worshippers at the Adoration Ground that operatives of the DSS visited the church to deliver the letter of invitation but did not meet him.\n\nThe operatives were said to have been told to come on Monday when they would meet the priest.\n\nBut checks at the Adoration Ground by The Nation on Tuesday showed the secret security operatives did not show up on Monday neither did they come on Tuesday to deliver their letter.\n\nThis, it was learnt, is fueling speculations that the DSS may have dropped the summons.\n\nOne of the security men at the Emene ground, who preferred anonymity, told our correspondent that Fr. Mbaka was in office on Monday and Tuesday but did not see anyone with such invitation letter.\n\n\u201cI have been here since yesterday and I have not seen anyone coming to deliver any letter. Father (Mbaka) has been in his office. He is not running away.\n\n\u201cSo, anyone who wants to see him is free. But, we have not seen anyone coming to deliver any letter to him,\u201d the man said.\n\nDetails of why the intelligence unit had wanted to summon the priest were not stated but it might not be unconnected with Mbaka\u2019s criticism of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration in recent times.\n\nThe priest recently said God had rejected the President and unhappy with his leadership.\n\nBut the Catholic Diocese of Enugu has said that it would only react to the invitation by the DSS if it sees its contents.\n\nSpokesman of the diocese, Rev. Fr. Benjamin Achi, said: \u201cMbaka is our priest and we would do anything to protect him. But in this case, we cannot talk about people we don\u2019t know and didn\u2019t see.\n\n\u201cAll we know about it was what Fr Mbaka said that the DSS came. He didn\u2019t see them.\n\n\u201cSince that time, we have not seen them. I was with Fr Mbaka throughout Monday and nobody came to give him any invitation.\n\n\u201cSo, we have nothing to say for now because we need to know who those people really are because Fr Mbaka didn\u2019t see them.

Anyone that has lost a close relative knows what it means to lose parents or children. I am more concerned about the lives lost because of the trickle down effects on families.\n\n\u201cOur people are not known for burning homes to punish enemies. Destroying police stations and infrastructures can never be the best path to express grievances. Whenever the 1967 \u2013 1970 civil war is mentioned, it\u2019s an emotive experience for any peace loving Nigerian not just an Igbo man.\n\nContinuing, he said \u201cWe should not either by words or actions pursue a repetition of that horrible genocide. We should come to understand that every war ends on a table. Instead of destructions before coming to the table, is it not wiser to come to table and avoid destruction? We need infrastructure, we need investments, we don\u2019t need hostilities. So we are pleading with you to stop and embrace peace,\u201c he said.\n\nOn the killing of innocent young people, kalu charged the security agencies to desist from harassment , molestation and killing of innocent young people in the region.\n\nHe said he is worried that some security agents have been reported to be killing innocent souls .\n\n\u201c It is better to thoroughly conduct your investigations and avoid the indiscriminate killings of young innocent Igbo men . Our people have raised alarm and we are very worried at the rate of disappearance and deaths of innocent young men . Some of our young people now live indoors for the fear of being tagged unknown gun man \u201c He said\n\nThe Chief Whip also reaffirmed his call for a national dialogue chaired by the President.\n\nHe noted that the need for a national dialogue is eminent to douse tensions in the country .\n\n\u201cWe have come a long way , our entanglement is so deep that all we need is diligent and deliberate efforts to realize the great dividends of diversity and pluralism. Our unity is our strength and can forever live in unity notwithstanding the diversity in culture, religion and tongues. A dialogue that has all stakeholders on the table and the president chairing it will go a long way in dousing tension across regions .\u201d Kalu said",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu and Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nFour days after the Federal Government slammed indefinite ban on use of Twitter, prominent Nigerians have continued to flout the order.\n\nThose who have dared the FG include Governors of Kaduna and Ondo states, Nasir El-Rufai and Rotimi Akeredolu respectively, former Ekiti governor, Ayo Fayose and senators Dino Melaye and Shehu Sani\n\nGovernment had on Friday imposed suspension on Twitter alleging persistent use of the platform for activities capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the ban on activities of the microblogging platform by Information Minister, Lai Mohammed, Minister of Justice and AGF, Abubakar Malami have directed the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation (DPPF) in his office to swing into action and commence the process of prosecution of violators of the Federal Government\u2019s de-activation of operations of Twitter\n\nBut prominent clerics, General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Enoch Adeboye and the General Superintendent, Deeper Christian Life Ministry, Pastor William Kumuyi, yesterday, posted separate tweets reacting to the ban of the microblogging platform.\n\nAdeboye said tweeting is in accordance with Article 19 of the UN universal declaration of human rights.\n\n\u201cThe Redeemed Christian Church of God is domiciled in more than 170 Nations & Territories. The tweets here are in accordance to Article 19 of the UN universal declaration of Human Rights,\u201d the cleric tweeted.\n\nExplaining why Deeper Life Church would remain active on Twitter, Kumuyi said his tweets were targetted at over 100 nations where the church has branches. He said the church made use of Twitter to share contents from any of the locations across the five continents.\n\n\u201cIn view of the Twitter ban in Nigeria, please note that the content shared on this handle is targeted at a global audience in more than five continents and over 100 nations and we share the content from any of these locations,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nMocking the FG last night, Shehu Sani tweeted: \u201cYou have to come to Twitter to know who is in Twitter and coming is a Taboo.\u201d\n\nAlso defying the order, yesterday, Ayodele Fayose tweeted: \u201cAnyone they arrest will only end up being celebrated. No one should be moved by empty threats of arrest. Certainly, what has a beginning must have an end. This dictatorial govt came and shall definitely go. No shaking!\n\n\u201cGood days ahead\u201d while Melaye agreed with Pastor Adeboye that \u201cUnited Nations Charter of which Nigeria is a signatory and have since domesticated.\u201d\n\nEarlier, El-Rufai and Akeredolu, both members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), had tweeted through their verified accounts, daring Malami\u2019s prosecution threats. At exactly 9:37 p.m. on Sunday, Kaduna governor shared an opinion article titled: \u201cBased Nigeria: African country teaches US lesson in how to handle Big Tech tyranny\u201d.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu also posted a statement reacting to the night attack that claimed several lives in Igangan community in Oyo State on Sunday.\n\nGovernor El-Rufai\u2019s media aide, Muyiwa Adekeye said he had been outside the country for over a week, noting, \u201cthe activities of Twitter is not banned in the country.\u201d\n\nSpokesperson of Governor Akeredolu, Olabode Richard, also argued that the microblogging platform was accessible to Nigerians on Sunday, adding that his principal did not make use of the Virtual Private Network (VPN) or other alternatives being explored by Nigerians.\n\nIt, however, remains unclear if the order from the office of the AGF would be effected on, Adeboye, El-Rufai, Akeredolu and other \u201coffenders\u201d.\n\n\u2022FG could have handled it a lot better, says Sanwo-Olu\n\nSpeaking on a live television interview programme, yesterday, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said considering the economic implications of the decision, the Federal Government could have handled the situation better.\n\n\u201cFederal government can handle this a lot better. Because of the number of eCommerce, the number of youths doing digital stuff on the internet, and we cannot throw that away and say it\u2019s not happening. I believe there could be a lot of restraint and better management from both sides,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\u201cOn both sides, there are issues that can be resolved between Twitter and the government and I think what they\u2019ve done is not a ban but a suspension like they said, so in the period of suspension let us sit down.\n\n\u201cIf we have 40 million users of that micro-blogger and another country has five million and they chose to take their investment to a country that have five million compared to a country with 40 million. It speaks to the reason we need to have that conversation with them. Probably if they have an office here things would have been done a lot quicker and better.\u201d\n\n\u2022Envoys maintain position on ban\n\nFederal Government, yesterday, met envoys of the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the Canadian Government and the Government of Ireland over their response to its ban on Twitter\u2019s operations in the country.\n\nThe meeting which was at the instance of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, followed a statement jointly issued by the United States, the United Kingdom, the Delegation of the European Union to Nigeria and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Canadian Government, and the Republic of Ireland at the weekend, expressing disappointment over the ban on Twitter\u2019s operations.\n\nPrior to the joint statement, the United States Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria, had issued a separate statement where it said the ban on Twitter\u2019s operations in the country was an infringement on the rights of Nigerians to freedom of expression.\n\nPresent at the meeting were the United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard; the British Deputy High commissioner, Gill Atkinson; Canadian High Commissioner to Nigeria, Nicolas Simard; the Political Adviser on Maritime and Security, Politics, Press and Information Section, Delegation of European Union to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Thomas Kieler; and the Charge d\u2019Affaires of the Embassy of Ireland, Mr Conor Finn.\n\nOnyeama said the meeting was as a result of the statement jointly issued by the missions which was forwarded to him.\n\nOnyeama further said he felt it was absolutely appropriate to take their comments very seriously and meet with the heads of missions due to the respect for their countries and in view of the relationship with the affected countries.\n\nHe also said the meeting was in their usual friendly way, to discuss and share opinions with respect to the Twitter ban and clarify certain things.\n\n\u201cSo, it was for that reason that I have invited you here this morning, not summon, invited to discuss some of these issues,\u201d Onyeama said.\n\nResponding on behalf of other envoys, Leonard said as partners, they want to see Nigeria succeed, unified, peaceful and prosperous.\n\nAsked if they were withdrawing their statement, Leonard said they recognised that there were issues of irresponsible use of social media, but \u201cwe remain firm in our position that free access to the ability to express oneself is actually very important, and perhaps, even more important in troubled times.\u201d\n\n\u2022FG to sanction broadcast stations using Twitter\n\nThe Federal Government has directed broadcast stations to de-install twitter handles and desist from using twitter as a source of information gathering for news and programmes presentation, especially phone-in programmes.\n\nThe directive was issued in Abuja by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) in a statement by its Acting Director-General, Professor Armstrong Idachaba.\n\nNBC said it would be unpatriotic for any broadcaster to continue to patronise the suspended Twitter as a source of its information.\n\n\u201cConsequent on the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the Federal Government over the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining the corporate existence of Nigeria, the National Broadcasting Commission directs all broadcasting stations in Nigeria to suspend the patronage of Twitter immediately.\n\n\u201cIn compliance to the above directive, broadcasting stations are hereby advised to de-install twitter handles and desist from using twitter as a source of User Generated Content (UGC) of information gathering for news and programmes presentation, especially phone-in.\n\n\u201cSection 2(1) r of the NBC Act entrusts the commission with responsibility to ensure strict adherence to the national laws, rules and regulations. Also, section 3.11.2 of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code provides that \u2018the broadcaster shall ensure that law enforcement is upheld at all times in a matter depicting that law and order are socially superior to or more desirable than Crime and Anarchy,\u201d Idachaba said.\n\nIdachaba further said attention was also drawn to Section 5.6.3 of the Broadcast Code which required broadcasters to be mindful of materials that may cause disaffection, incite to panic or rift in the society in the use of a UGC.\n\n\u201cNote that it will be unpatriotic for any broadcaster in Nigeria to continue to patronise the suspended Twitter as a source of its information therefore strict compliance is enjoined,\u201d Idachaba said.\n\n\u2022Asking TV, radio stations to deactivate accounts unlawful \u2013 SERAP\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has condemned the directive by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to all broadcast stations in the country to suspend patronage of Twitter with immediate effect as \u201cthe patently unlawful and unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nNBC had reportedly stated that the decision followed the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the Federal Government over purported use of the platform for \u201cactivities that are capable of undermining the corporate existence of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSERAP in a statement by its Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare said the directive by the NBC is itself unlawful because it is based on another unlawful decision by the Federal Government to suspend Twitter in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe NBC\u2019s directive has political interference written all over it. It is a blow to Nigerians\u2019 rights to freedom of expression, media freedom, media independence and diversity. The directive must be immediately withdrawn. Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right. This action by the NBC is yet another nail in the coffin for human rights, media freedom and independent journalism under this government.\n\n\u201cThe Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights should publicly and vigorously express concerns over the Nigerian government\u2019s increasingly brutal crackdown on media freedom, and use all possible means to urge the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to protect and respect freedom of expression.\u201d\n\n\u2022Stop mocking democracy, Norsemen tell FG\n\nAn international humanitarian body, De Norsemen KClub International has kicked against the Nigerian government\u2019s ban on Twitter, saying it was an ambush on the nation\u2019s fledgling democracy.\n\nThe group said the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration was mocking democracy, adding that it was appalled that a government that came in through a democratic process, and prided itself as an upholder of democratic principles, could take such brazing unpopular decision without recourse to democratic principles and constitutionality.\n\nIn statement by it International President, Dr. Adeshola Giwa, on Monday, De Norsemen stated its belief and commitment to free speech, noting that only a government that had something to hide would abridge freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cDe Norsemen Kclub International wish to remind the Federal Government that a government that has nothing to hide is not afraid of free speech. The rule should be: let the people express themselves and take responsibility of their expressions. We want to emphasize that freedom of speech is an inalienable constitutional right of citizens. Citizens\u2019 right to free expression is non-negotiable and it is only a court of competent jurisdiction, and not the fiat of government, that can determine when the expression of citizens runs foul of the law.\u201d",

          "text": "From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nThe Imo state Commissioner of police, Abutu Yaro, has ordered a thorough investigation into the alleged killing of a German-based Nigerian, Oguchi Unachukwu, who was said to have been shot by the personnel of the 211 regiment of the Nigerian Air Force.\n\nThe deceased and his family were said to be on their way to catch a flight at the Sam Mbakwe International Cargo airport, Owerri, to Lagos, for an onward movement to Humburg, Germany, when he was shot at the tollgate of the airport, on May 31.\n\nThe CP, sequel to the call by the widow of the slain Unachukwu, Mrs Ijeoma Unachukwu, and other concerned citizens, to ensure that the killers did not go unpunished, swiftly commenced investigation into the killing.\n\nThe CP, in a statement issued by the command\u2019s Spokesperson, Bala Elkana, assured that his office would ensure that justice prevailed.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cThe Commissioner of Police Imo State Command, Abutu Yaro, has ordered an in-depth investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of one Uguchi Unachukwu \u2018m\u2019 near the toll gate of Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport, Owerri, on May 31, 2021, at about 0804 hours.\n\n\u201cThe deceased person is alleged to have been shot by personnel suspected to be staff of 211 Regiment of the Nigerian Air Force, responsible for the security of the International Airport. The deceased was said to be on his way to catch a flight to Lagos. A survivor stated that one of the Air Force operatives shot the car of Oguchi when he failed to stop at the Air Force checkpoint after they had flagged him down.\n\n\u201cFollowing the information, the Air Force team at the toll gate, who were already on red alert, especially considering the recent killing of a high profile politician around the same area, intercepted a fast approaching Mercedes Benz vehicle.\n\n\u201cThey flagged down the vehicle and ordered the driver to park by the roadside for search, but the driver who, at first, slowed down and pretended to move to the side of the road, suddenly took off.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Air Force, being suspicious of the mission of the occupants of the said vehicle at the International Airport, they made an effort to demobilise the vehicle. When the vehicle eventually came to a halt, the operatives rounded it and ordered the occupants out.\n\n\u201cIt was at this point that a female passenger in the car mentioned that the man driving the vehicle was her husband and that he was rushing to catch his flight. He was, however, rushed to the hospital by the Air Force team for medical attention, where the doctors on duty made frantic efforts to stabilise him. He later died at about 1900 hours of the same date.\n\n\u201cImo State Police Command has commenced investigation into the case.

          "text": "\u2022Govt communication system in shambles as agencies return to old, archaic mode of information dissemination\n\n\u2022Buhari, Osinbajo, MDAs suspend tweeting\n\n\u2022Akeredolu, el-Rufai, Makinde defy directive\n\nBy Chiemelie Ezeobi in Lagos, Adedayo Akinwale and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nFederal government\u2019s suspension of the operation of American micro-blogging company, Twitter, in Nigeria, might have left both in a catch-22 situation as the duo have lost millions of followers that they had built for more than half a decade.\n\nFor Twitter the saga has cost it billions of cash, while Nigerians, in both private and public sectors have lost their means of instant communication.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, had last week announced the suspension of Twitter after the firm deleted some aspects of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet, which the company found to be in breach of its rules.\n\nFollowing searing attacks of the suspension by social activists, who said it was an abuse of Nigerians\u2019 freedom of expression as guaranteed by Section 39 (1) of the Constitution as altered, Muhammed added an extra reason for the act, saying the temporary prohibition of the internet platform was a response to the firm\u2019s persistent violation of the nation\u2019s national security interest.\n\nThe suspension order had attracted a directive from the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), asking all Telcos and broadcasting media to deactivate their Twitter handles and block access to the internet facility.\n\nMany Nigerians, have, however, circumvented the federal government\u2019s blockage of the micro-blogging facility, resorting to the virtual private network (VPN) to connect Twitter.\n\nAlthough THISDAY\u2019s checks showed that Buhari, his deputy, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo (SAN), and many government agencies, including the armed forces, ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs), have suspended tweeting, some governors including Malam Nasir el-Rufai (Kaduna), Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo) and Mr. Seyi Makinde (Oyo) have continued to tweet in defiance of the federal government\u2019s directive.\n\nAnalysts, however, told THISDAY yesterday that both the federal government and Twitter must be feeling the rough edges of the suspension as they suffer its adverse effect.\n\nFor the Nigerian government, its agencies and millions of private sector users of the micro-blogging facility, it amounts to a loss of an instant communication tool, which had helped to facilitate the dissemination and receipt of information necessary for the conduct of their businesses.\n\nBuhari, for instance, said an analyst, has lost millions of his followers that it has taken him six years to build. \u201cHe may have to start afresh when he returns to the site,\u201d he said.\n\nAgencies like Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) that had used its Twitter handle to instantly communicate with the public information on the COVID-19 pandemic, would now have to revert to other pre-Twitter messaging platforms, including e-mail, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram that are not as fast, another analyst explained last night.\n\nA day after Mohammed announced the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria, the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, had warned that violators of the ban would be prosecuted.\n\nBut senior lawyers have questioned the legality of Malami\u2019s order, saying that it is not grounded in law, adding that Nigerians could not be prosecuted for offences not specified by law.\n\nTo calm the global outrage that the suspension of Twitter has generated, the federal government yesterday met with ambassadors of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, the European Union and Ireland in Nigeria and sought their understanding on its suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria.\n\nBut save for the First Lady, Hajia Aisha Buhari, who deactivated her Twitter handle following the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in the country, Buhari, Osinbajo and some other top government officials still retained their accounts, although they\u2019re inactive.\n\nHowever, the federal government\u2019s directive suspending Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria was silent on whether or not Nigerians should deactivate their accounts.\n\nBut a directive yesterday by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) had directed road and television stations in the country to de-install their Twitter accounts.\n\nChecks by THISDAY yesterday showed that Twitter accounts belonging to government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) are also being retained.\n\nSome of the accounts being retained belong to the Foreign Affairs Minister, Chief Geoffrey Onyema; Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN); and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).\n\nOthers include the Nigerian Police, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the\n\nSuper Eagles, the official Twitter account of Nigerian football team; and the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF), among many others.\n\nWhile most of these accounts are not active, the same cannot be said of their aides who have bypassed the networks to tweet with their Virtual Private Network (VPN).\n\nAlso active are Twitter accounts of former Senators Shehu Sani and Dino Melaye, as well as el-Rufai who tweeted the link of a story on \u201cNigeria: African country teaches US lesson in how to handle Big Tech tyranny \u2014 RT Op-ed.\u201d\n\nWhile Akeredolu\u2019s last tweet, on the attack on Igangan community in Oyo State was at 7.11 pm on Sunday, Makinde, at 9.45 am, on Sunday, tweeted to urge for calm over the attack on Igangan.\n\nAlso, most churches are still active on Twitter with both Deeper Life Bible Church and Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), justifying their accounts being active on the grounds that they need to reach congregants in other countries.\n\nThe RCCG, in a clarification, said: \u201cThe Redeemed Christian Church of God is domiciled in more than 170 nations & territories. The tweets here are in accordance with Article 19 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\u201d\n\nArticle 19 of the UDHR said: \u201cEveryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Deeper Life General Overseer, Pastor Williams Kumuyi said: \u201cIn view of the Twitter ban in Nigeria, please note that the content shared on this handle is targeted at a global audience in more than five continents and over 100 nations and we share the content from any of these locations.\u201d\n\nFG Seeks Support of US, UK, Others over Twitter\u2019s Suspension\n\nThe federal government yesterday sought the understanding of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, the European Union and Ireland over its suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria.\n\nIt, however, gave conditions to lift the suspension.\n\nAlso yesterday, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, called for a speedy resolution of the dispute.\n\nAddressing a press conference after a meeting with the five representatives of the missions in Abuja, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Onyeama, said they had a discussion concerning the issues of Twitter ban and based on the joint press statement earlier made by the missions.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe had a useful discussion with the countries that are considered to be close friends and partners of Nigeria. We sat down and reviewed the whole situation and we stated the security concern of Mr. President and the whole Nigerians and the very strong steps we\u2019ve taken to address the security challenges of the country.\u201d\n\nOnyeama said they presented first-hand information about the security challenges of the country and also the role of the social media.\n\nHe stated that social media is good for dissemination of information, but it can also be used for good and the bad.\n\nHe added that the bad side of it has dire consequences on human lives and property.\n\nAccording to him, it is germane to keep the unity of the country and to achieve all these, a decision has to be taken and measures put in place to ensure the social platforms are used responsibly.\n\nHe said as a democracy, the issue of fundamental human rights was expected to be respected, especially freedom of speech, adding that this should not be allowed to bring the country down.\n\nHe stated that the five missions and their countries have been supporting Nigeria even with its security and development challenges.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have been having partnership and solidarity with the five countries. They have supported us very strongly in our security challenges, humanitarian crisis, development challenges and economic challenges, so we can say that these countries are our partners. We are asking them to also support us as we continue to confront all these challenges.\n\n\u201cWe have listened to them and they also have their views on all of these issues and we gave them the opportunities to also expressed themselves.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly gratified with the statement and reassurance of support and friendship towards Nigeria. We have to keep an eye on the main objective of this government, when Mr. President was elected, security was number one of his priorities and it is something he really wants to be able to deliver for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWithout security, everything else fails, investments go out of the country, regular migration out, it will be a vicious cycle.\n\n\u201cWe will all be losers and our children, generation to come will all be affected. What we do today will really determine the future of this country. That is why this government gives priority to security, that this government would have to live in peace and security. And we have to keep our country together.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done today, will really define the future of the country and that is why Mr. \u201cPresident is absolutely determined that security has been made and Nigerians have to live in peace and security and that we have to keep our country together. We listened to each other and clarified some areas.\u201d\n\nOnyeama, however, said the government was already discussing with Twitter on lifting the suspension.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs you yourself have said, discussions are ongoing with Twitter, we want to see how that progresses. So I cannot say for now the duration of the suspension. There are conversations with our partners and with social media.\n\n\u201cThe basic condition is really responsible communication. We know the power of words and the power of words for good and the power of words for bad. You know when you have that kind of power to manage and facilitate the communication of billions of people around the world; it has to come with responsibilities. Absolutely, it has to come with responsibilities. So the condition will be a responsible use of media and that really has to be adhered to.\u201d\n\nIn her response on behalf of the five missions, the US Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth- Leonard, said: \u201cI will say that first of all that we recognise that there are issues of responsible use of social media but we remain firm on our position that free access to the ability to express one\u2019s self is actually very important perhaps on one part, but also at trouble times.\u201d\n\nShe urged Nigeria to identify those who commit crimes and use judicial processes to deal with offenders, adding \u201cbut to constrain, that is not the behaviour.\u201d\n\nThe envoy added that they were glad to hear that Nigeria was interacting with Twitter.\n\nOn the challenges confronting the country, she said: \u201cI think we made that statement very clear that we are Nigeria\u2019s strong partners. We recognise the daunting times in the area of security challenges that confronts Nigeria. Well, they are daunting, they are not insurmountable and part of the way you surmount them is through partnership.\u201d\n\nThe federal government had earlier summoned the envoys over their recent comments on the suspension.\n\nThe missions had in a joint statement condemned the suspension.\n\nNBC Orders Broadcast Stations to Suspend Twitter Patronage\n\nThe National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) has ordered all broadcast stations to suspend the patronage of Twitter with immediate effect.\n\nNBC said the decision followed the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the federal government over the persistent use of the platform for activities that could undermining the corporate existence of Nigeria.\n\nThe acting Director-General of the NBC, Prof. Armstrong Idachaba, in a statement directed the broadcast stations to \u201cde-install Twitter handles and desist from using Twitter as a source (UGC) of information gathering for news and programmes presentation especially phone-in.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cConsequent on the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the federal government over the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining the corporate existence of Nigeria, the National Broadcasting Commission directs all broadcasting stations in Nigeria to suspend the patronage of Twitter immediately.\n\n\u201cIn compliance to the above directive, broadcasting stations are hereby advised to de-install Twitter handles and desist from using Twitter as a source (UGC) of information gathering for news and programmes presentation, especially phone-in.\n\n\u201cSection 2(1) of the NBC Act entrusts the Commission with the responsibility to ensure strict adherence to the national laws, rules and regulations. Also, Section 3.11.2 of Nigeria Broadcasting Code provides that \u201cthe broadcaster shall ensure that law enforcement is upheld at all times in a matter depicting that law and order are socially superior to or more desirable than crime and anarchy.\n\n\u201cAttention is also drawn to section 5.6.3 of the Code which requires Broadcasters to be mindful of materials that may cause disaffection, incite panic or rift in the society in the use of user-generated content (UGC).\n\n\u201cNote that it will be unpatriotic for any broadcaster in Nigeria to continue to patronise the suspended Twitter as a source of its information therefore strict compliance is enjoined.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Uneasy Calm over Buni\u2019s Alleged Plans for APC Chairmanship",
          "text": "\u2022Media aide dismisses speculation\n\nBy Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThere is rising tension in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) following an alleged plan by the Chairman of the National Caretaker Committee and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, to transmute to the national chairman of the party, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that Buni\u2019s alleged ambition may have stopped the caretaker committee from announcing dates for national and states congresses in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory to usher in new party leadership.\n\nSources familiar with the power game in the party told THISDAY that Buni\u2019s game plan is to resign his position as governor and join the race for the party\u2019s national chairman.\n\nHe\u2019s billed to end second term tenure in May 2023.\n\nBut in a swift response, Buni dismissed the claim, saying he has no intention to resign his position as governor.\n\nThe caretaker committee was given up to this month to conduct a national convention and states\u2019 congresses after a reconciliation of the members as well as the revalidation of membership registers.\n\nThe sources said a self-succession motive by Buni to become the substantive national chairman is currently stalling moves to hold a national convention.\n\nHowever, many of the governors elected on the platform of the party are said to be opposed to Buni\u2019s bid to transform into the substantive chairman of the party.\n\nThe APC governors opposed to the Buni\u2019s ambition, it was learnt, are those who would be rounding off their second term in office by 2023.\n\nAlso, the ministers who have political ambitions by 2023 are opposed to the transmutation plans of Buni and some selected members of the APC caretaker committee.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that a National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party would soon be summoned.\n\nA special NEC meeting of the APC in June 2020 had appointed Buni, a former national secretary of the party, as chairman of the caretaker committee following the leadership crisis triggered by the suspension of the then National Chairman of the party, Mr. Adams Oshiomhole.\n\nThe caretaker committee was given a six-month mandate to organise a convention that would elect a new National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nBut the committee sought and was granted a six-month extension to complete its mandate.\n\nBut after 12 months in office, no date has been announced for the election of the executive committee members.\n\nTHISDAY also gathered that the Buni-led caretaker committee has begun to plan another meeting of NEC to seek an elongation of its tenure.\n\nA member of the committee that spoke to THISDAY in confidence said there is a plot for the Buni committee to seek an elongation or an outright self-perpetuation of members in office.\n\nThe argument, the source said, would be that an election from ward to states and eventually, national convention in the party would further divide the party at a time when it should be consolidating in the states ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt was against this backdrop that some committee members, albeit with the consent of Buni, were considering presenting to the NEC that he should rather resign as governor and continue at the national convention, where he would be affirmed as the substantive national chairman of the party.\u201d\n\nThe source stated that since his emergence as caretaker committee chairman, Buni has not spent up to four days a week in Yobe State as he stays in Abuja most of the time.\n\nBefore winning the election to become the governor, he was the national secretary of APC when Oshiomhole was the national chairman.\n\n\u201cAlthough this has not been tabled before the NEC, members of the party, who should know, were already protesting against the idea of members self-perpetuating themselves under any guise,\u201d the source said.\n\nSome of the APC members who did not want to be quoted said they had concluded plans to seek legal action against any plans by the committee members to self-perpetuate themselves in office.\n\nAnother member told THISDAY that the Buni committee has already overstayed its welcome.\n\nA member of the committee also confirmed the self-succession bid, saying: \u201cWe were appointed to right the wrongs of Adams Oshiomhole, and not this idea of not announcing the dates for the wards, local government, states and national convention.\n\n\u201cAnything outside announcing the dates of the national convention and other dates for the states congresses is outside our mandate. If by the next month, there is no date announced for the elections, I will speak out and also resign. What is happening is not our mandate.\n\n\u201cWe were appointed in June 2020 and our mandate was renewed in December to end in June. Any further plan to seek an extension or perpetuate us in office, count me out.\u201d\n\nBut in a swift response, Buni dismissed the allegation of self- perpetuation, saying he has no intention to resign his position as the governor of Yobe State to become the substantive chairman of the party.\n\nBuni\u2019s Director of Media, Mr. Mamman Mohammed, said he already has a job, and he is not looking for another one.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is a blatant lie; it is just a fabrication. The governor has a job, which he\u2019s doing and he is not looking for any other job. It is not even worth responding because it does not even get an inch close to anything obtainable with the governor.\n\n\u201cThe task before him is to build a viable and vibrant political party; organise a very successful congress and convention and handover the party to elected officials.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted yesterday on the purported plan to convey NEC meeting of the party to seek further extension, the National Secretary of the party, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, said \u201cno comment.\u201d\n\nBut a party source, who pleaded anonymity, told THISDAY that conducting party congresses and convention this month was not feasible, as there is no road map.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe president has not agreed with what the caretaker committee is trying to do as regards another elongation. The president is still adamant, he has not said anything. He is waiting for them to convince him.\n\n\u201cIf we want to conduct the congress, it starts from the ward to the local government to the state. It is those who emerge from these congresses that will form the national delegates to the convention. But we have not done any of this and there is no date scheduled for it at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe party source added ward congress will take a week or two, same as local government congresses and state congresses.\n\nHe said there would also be an appeal for ward, local and state congresses which would take two weeks each.\n\nThe source added: \u201cNow we are in Lagos to authenticate the membership register for it to be used for the primary election, which we are in the process. We have done that of Ogun, we are now in Lagos. We have not authenticated that of other states, how do you now expect a congress to come up.\u201d\n\nAsked if the membership register was authenticated by the party officials before the primary, he replied: \u201cThey didn\u2019t use it, they by-passed it. If there is any litigation against them, they will win in court. They didn\u2019t use the approved membership register; they falsified the one they used. Even in Abeokuta, they are falsified.\u201d\n\nThe source stated that there is no way the party can conduct congress without authenticating and finalising the registration of new members.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "INTERVIEW: Cross River remains PDP stronghold despite Ayade's defection, says Liyel Imoke",
          "text": "Liyel Imoke has held many positions since emerging in the political space. Most notably, he has served as a minister twice and is also a two-time governor of Cross River. In this interview, he speaks on helping to lay the building blocks of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in his state, the recent defection of Governor Ben Ayade to the All Progressives Congress (APC), and his party\u2019s foothold in Cross River.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheCable: Good afternoon, your excellency. Let\u2019s talk about developments on the political terrain in Cross River State. You are a founding member of the PDP. You\u2019ve also held various key positions in the country, including being minister of power and steel, and for a while minister of education before going on to become the governor for 8 years. Tell us, what vision and strategies characterised those early days, your roles, and how the foundation was laid for the current republic?\n\nImoke: This question takes me down memory lane. It takes me back to the early days. When I say the early days, I mean my early days in politics. As you may recall, as far back as the early 1990s I got involved in politics because of my interest in public service and in contributing to the growth and development of the society that I come from and giving back, as it were to the society. The then governor of Cross River state, Mr. Clement Ebri, was someone that I worked with and admired. He supported me when I ran for senate; under the same political platform, I got elected as a senator in 1991/92. That was the real beginning of my political career. As you may be aware that dispensation ended with the Abacha coup and after the Abacha coup it was basically back to the trenches.\n\nHowever, I remained in communication with a lot of our political supporters and members of our team and we still had a common vision, a vision for a new Cross River state. That vision was borne out of my experience, campaigning literally door-to-door to get elected into the senate. The campaign provided me an opportunity to see the state of our people and the conditions they lived in, especially in the rural communities and that was really a driving factor for us, in terms of coming together and thinking that Cross River state needed a new order. It was through that process that I started convening meetings in my house in Lagos at the time, which were attended by young Cross Riverians as it were, to build and share a vision, and also chart a new course for Cross River State. Amongst those who attended those meetings were the former governor, Donald Duke, Senator Gershom Bassey, Bassey Eyo Ndem who became a commissioner in the state and MD of Tinapa; Essien Ayi who is now a member of the house of representatives, and several others, all young men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe also had among those who attended the meetings people like Victor Okon and a number of young aspiring Cross Riverians and a lot of my colleagues like Dennis Nkiri, who was in the house of representatives when I was in the senate, were also part of that process. They saw the vision and bought into it from day one. We all stood firmly, sharing a common vision and came up with a blueprint for a new Cross River state. It was through that process that we decided to participate actively in the transition that took place under that Abacha administration; but we were of the progressive orientation, as such we did not join any party that we thought Abacha would control and manipulate. We opted to join the NCPN and when the NCPN was eventually decimated by the same Abacha administration, we joined the DPN. In providing leadership to that generation of people we were able to work collectively as a team to go into an election at the time, of course, there were all kinds of idiosyncrasies and all kinds of theories about power and who had it and who could give it and where it could go to. But as young men, we thought that we could chart a different course for the state and it was on that basis that we ultimately joined the People\u2019s Democratic Party and by so doing, we were taking a position against a significant number of our leaders, including my boss, Clement Ebri, who was in the APP; Dr. Joseph Wayas and several others who opted for the APP.\n\nBy joining the PDP we had room as it were, to build a new order, and not just build a new order but to bring young people into the politics and that led ultimately to winning the elections with Donald Duke as our candidate, going against the odds at the time where they said no Efik man can be governor of Cross River state. I couldn\u2019t understand why a citizen of the state was not entitled to become an elected representative of the state especially if they\u2019re qualified to occupy that office. So I championed that cause and a lot of people came against me saying I was not Efik and as such why was I championing a cause for the Efiks. At the end of it all, by the Grace of God we succeeded and Donald became the governor of Cross River state and he got elected for a second term. We built a strong political family and this translated to a marginal victory for the party.\n\nTheCable: It\u2019s understandable; because the big weights were on the other side?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImoke: The big weights were on the other side and we were on this side, so we were quite satisfied with the marginal victory. After the elections, we engaged the young people who may have been in the other political party to bring them to understand and appreciate that it was better if we worked collectively. So as leader of the team, as the campaign manager for all the elections, that was my responsibility. We brought these young people together and by the 2003 elections, we had a formidable team going into the elections. So even though there was a strong anti-Efik sentiment and a strong anti-Donald Duke sentiment represented in a group of leaders organised under the aegis of Atam Congress, we stood firmly against it. I led that movement to ensure that the state was united and I think 2003 was the one election that united Cross River state and that united our political party, the PDP. Since then, until now, the PDP has remained the overwhelming dominant political force in Cross River State.\n\nTheCable: So one can say that you were actually the pillar behind Donald Duke becoming governor?\n\nImoke: Well at the risk of sounding immodest, the answer is yes; but we had a formidable team and we were extremely focused. Our major strength was the ability to strategise to win the hearts of the people. I led a strong team of young men and women who worked selflessly. I think that\u2019s the history of our state and I think through that experience we were able to strengthen our party and it became the dominant party. I contested the elections and the party won all the seats at every level and everybody that has contested election in Cross River state thereafter has won with similar margins. The struggle was for the PDP ticket, once you had the PDP ticket, you are literally elected. Through the years up till the emergence of Governor Ben Ayade, PDP has been firmly the party of choice of the people. I think it\u2019s not just our style and approach that achieved this. We introduced a collegiate leadership model at all levels. This engendered confidence in our supporters as it was a bottom-up approach and afforded them not only the freedom of choice but also an opportunity to take ownership and responsibility. We also had a strong connection to the grassroots and I think that was something that we deliberately embarked upon especially given my own experience in going round campaigning, first for senate and then subsequently for Donald to become governor and then my own eventual emergence. So we endeared ourselves to the electorate and that is where the strength of the PDP lies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheCable: That\u2019s a very interesting history. Things are looking a little bit different now. Your state governor, Senator Ben Ayade, recently defected to the APC. How will that affect the fortunes of the PDP in the coming elections in a state that has a history of being a PDP state?\n\nImoke: I\u2019m glad you ended that question with saying that it\u2019s a state that has a history of being a PDP state. I think in the past you would see that states that have that type of strength irrespective of a defection tend at all times to remain strong. There\u2019s a reason for that. What you perceive as power will determine how you lead. If you perceive power to be a political party, then you will be moving from one political party to another but if you understand that power ultimately is the people and that it belongs to the people, you will appreciate that it is not about the party. PDP in Cross River State has always been about the people and I think we still remain about the people; so the party has endeared itself to the people and as such, a movement by the governor does not of its own translate to the people moving into another political party, because they have already identified strongly with the party \u2013 the PDP. It is sort of like what you have in the United States and other countries where there are strongholds; a state like California, it is defined as a Democratic stronghold. Cross River State is a PDP stronghold.\n\nTheCable: That\u2019s interesting; that means there is still hope?\n\nImoke: Hope? The truth is that they have an uphill task to remove the PDP in Cross River state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheCable: Governor Ayade is known for appointing thousands of youths as special assistants or advisers, in what he describes as a policy to put food on the table for them. Do you think this is a good policy for youth engagement especially given the need for human capital development and provision of infrastructure for overall development of the state?\n\nImoke: I think it was the philosopher Thomas Hobbes who basically attributed all power to the king, and that the king had power to do what he chose to do and how he chose to do it and the masses were obliged to follow. That theory has been disproved over the years, over the centuries and that has led to democracy and what we have now. Through the years, various philosophers: Karl Marx, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and several others, have come and not only discredited Hobbes\u2019 theory but have clearly shown that power could belong to the people. So you cannot oppress the people without a reaction; power must go to them. And I think that no matter how subjugated a people are, at some point in time they are going to fight for their rights and for whatever they are entitled to. They are entitled to certain freedoms, they are entitled to earn a living, and they are entitled of course to safety and security; those are critical components of life. So when you are dealing with a generation of young people in a society like ours, you must deliberately make an effort not just to give them the ability to succeed but you must also, as they say, teach them how to fish.\n\nI don\u2019t think that the average Cross River youth is lazy, I don\u2019t think that the average Cross River youth is looking for food on the table; I believe that the average Cross River youth is confident and strong, is well educated and wants to earn a decent living. And I think we cannot take away from that fact, It\u2019s even Biblical, if you recall the story of Esau and his birthright. But for the fact that he gave up his birthright, he would be Israel. The people of Cross River will not give up their birthright for a mussel of food. I don\u2019t think that those are Cross Riverians, that\u2019s not the nature of the Cross Riverian. The Cross River youth that I know are energetic and want an opportunity. So for us to build a sustainable economy we need to create wealth for the people, to provide them with opportunities to express themselves, opportunities to grow themselves, to provide them opportunities to provide for family; and, a food on-the-table policy doesn\u2019t seem to provide such necessities for the long term. So, yes there are a number of people who will be engaged on those terms but not the larger society, the generation of Cross Riverians that I know, have energy, they are resourceful and they are committed to not just a better society but having a better livelihood and those are the people that I believe are in the majority in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheCable: Your predecessor, Donald Duke, in a statement he issued on the heels of the defection of Governor Ayade, accused you of hoisting, in his words \u201cautocratic leadership style\u201d where \u201ccommunication with party members declined,\u201d and that \u201cemergence in the party was determined not by the party constitution or structures but by the whims of the state\u2019s chief executive;\u201d directly accusing you of bringing Ayade and imposing him on the people. How do you react to these accusations?\n\nImoke: I believe that his statement was issued after I was informed of his joining the party and had called him welcoming him back to the party. So let me use this opportunity to again welcome him back into the party and assure him of our commitment to working with him and making sure he is fully reintegrated and understands who we are and what we have always done as a party. I think his decision to re-join the party speaks volumes and it is indeed a very good decision. Our major strength has been, and will always be, carrying everyone along and making sure that each person\u2019s opinion is sought and recognised. As he returns to his foundation, he will definitely have every opportunity to make his own contributions towards the growth and development of the party. As a party, we are proud of the fact that we have since inception, consistently and without fail achieved significant successes in Cross River state. We have done extremely well. Holding the ground and keeping the states under the umbrella has been no mean feat but the PDP has done this successfully over the years. This I think is commendable. Whether we are looking at Ayade, Donald himself, or myself, the party\u2019s style of leadership through the years it has been in control of the state has always been a collegiate style of leadership and an appeal to the grassroots. It is this acceptance by the grassroots that has always ultimately delivered 99% success at the polls. That is the style that we have adopted over the years and it has kept us firmly on the ground as the most popular and accepted party in Cross River State. Donald\u2019s return should add value to what we\u2019ve done and will continue to do. We have not changed and we will continue to blaze the trail. He has returned to our great party and to his foundation at a time when the governor has defected; since I am not God, only God knows the hearts of men, so I am not going to speculate on the reasons behind Governor Ayade\u2019s departure from the party. But as I said, I welcome Donald back to the party and I look forward to working with him.\n\nTheCable: So you won\u2019t agree to what he says about your \u2018autocratic style of leadership\u2019?\n\nImoke: I believe that the key to our success which has been acknowledged, beyond the party and the state and I believe has even been recognised and acknowledged by Donald himself in re-joining the party, is clearly the collegiate rather than autocratic style of leadership. So let\u2019s not dwell on that but welcome him, and assure him of not only his full membership but also of the key leadership role that he is expected to play. We\u2019re all looking forward to working closely with him and improving the fortunes of the party in the state.\n\nTheCable: Now that governor Ayade has defected from your party. Do you regret supporting him to be a governor, do you feel any disappointment and betrayal by the defection?\n\nImoke: No; I don\u2019t actually. I don\u2019t have any regrets; as I said, the only authority that has the benefit of hindsight is God. So you can\u2019t say I regret or I don\u2019t regret, no; certainly not. At the time when Ayade contested for the governorship, we gave him all our support. He would not have been governor without our building a consensus and without the party taking him to the people and the electorate to solicit for their support. So when he emerged through a rigorous state-wide internal party caucus selection process through the 18 local government areas, we believed that the people had made their choice. We believed he was the right man for the job at that time and I think he came out and appealed to Cross Riverians across the 18 local government areas. It wasn\u2019t a pronouncement; it wasn\u2019t a dictatorial imposition. He went through a very lengthy and hectic process of campaigning, of reaching out to the people and enjoying their support. So, we can\u2019t say we regret that if we are honest. What we\u2019ll say is yes, at that time, he enjoyed the popular support of the party and of course ultimately the people. I remember telling him on the day he was sworn in that his popularity would begin to erode from his first day in office but how fast it would happen depended on him. It\u2019s always the case with elected leaders.\n\nTheCable: Your tenure as Governor of Cross River was synonymous with what many described as grassroots development, including access roads to several rural areas. Do you think such commendable populist projects can return again in Cross River in the coming years, as many have lamented that in the last 6 years, the state has lost its glory?\n\nImoke: I think like you called them, populist projects; the most important thing for me was being responsive to the needs of the people. Every administration has its own style and every administration has its own approach to governance. In my own case, I tried to be as responsive as I could to the needs of the people. I never took it for granted that because I had become the governor I knew what they wanted better than they did. So in making decisions, I inevitably would make sure that we went back to the people who elected us to understand their needs, and sometimes their needs were as small as a police post, sometimes as small as a road, classroom blocks, quality education, healthcare. So we were responsive to those needs and in so doing, we were able to reach a lot of communities across the state. And by so doing, not only did we respond to their needs, but we also got from them a lot of support. So I think that that was the style at the time, I think that the more responsive an administration is to the needs of the people, the more they will enjoy the support of the people.\n\nTheCable: Politics is local. You have played a noble leading role as a national and state leader of the PDP. What message do you have for members of your party in the state who look up to you as their leader given the events of the recent past with the defection of Governor Ayade? Will PDP retain (or win back) Cross River in the next election?\n\nImoke: PDP is Cross River, and Cross River is PDP. So, Cross River is a PDP state, we know no other party as it were. And as I said over the years, PDP has performed in governance and has basically reached the people at various levels. So an introduction of a new party would translate into a bit of confusion for the people and it will take a long time for them to even understand either the reasoning behind it and the concept of that new party. The second point is that the young people who are going to be part of this process have grown up with an understanding of the party and I believe that this is a time for us to move power to a new generation of young people, just like we benefitted by the actions that we took and it provided us with the opportunity to serve. There is no greater privilege than the privilege of service; so a new generation of young people, who are committed to the party, who understand the philosophy of the party, who understand how democratic the party is and how resourceful the party can be, will be the new leaders of Cross River State come 2023. Cross River State will remain PDP, it has always been PDP. So I am not in doubt as to the capacity of these people to stand firm and resolute and say listen, come 2023, we are PDP.\n\nNow on our own part as a party, we need to provide leadership that gives them hope, gives them an opportunity. For me as a leader, that is what I have always been about. It\u2019s about engagement, it\u2019s about empowering our people, it\u2019s about meaningfully responding to their needs and their demands, it\u2019s about creating wealth, it\u2019s about growing the various sectors of the economy, whether it\u2019s the tourism sector, or the social sector, or the industrial sector, private sector engagement, public sector engagement, and all of that. It\u2019s only the PDP that has ever provided it. So I don\u2019t see any room for any other party that means well for Cross River state. Moreover, if you look at the way the country is today and you do a comparative analysis between governments under the PDP and governments under the APC, I don\u2019t think Nigerians will by any stretch of the imagination, especially Cross Riverians, say that we are better off today than we were six years ago. I believe that every Nigerian is worse off today than they were six years ago. So this provides us with an opportunity for new leadership, an opportunity for new participation, an opportunity for a new order and I believe that that is what will be achieved in Cross River State come 2023.\n\nTheCable: Talking about tourism, Cross River was once regarded as the tourism destination in Nigeria, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors from home and abroad. What do you think is responsible for the loss of this prime economic position and what, as a leader of the state, will you do or advise to be done to reverse the fortunes of the state?\n\nImoke: I think the success of tourism is tied to many things; one of them is security. For instance, it\u2019s difficult to grow tourism in a state of insecurity. And Nigeria is presently challenged with significant security issues, so tourism is not likely to thrive in that environment. Also, the other factors that drive tourism policy-wise, have to be addressed. For me, I inherited a vision which I shared and was a part of; so I could build on it. For me it wasn\u2019t about what I started, I didn\u2019t start it, it was sustainability and that\u2019s the key. My predecessor had started working on the ranch (Obudu Resort), we sustained the effort and kept the ranch running along with the Obudu International Mountain Race; my predecessor had also built Tinapa, and we kept Tinapa as functional as we possibly could in the circumstances, bringing in people like Mo Abudu and her entire production team into the state along with her television station and all the shows we could engage in, in Tinapa, growing the sector. We made use of tracks that were imported by my predecessor to complete the first phase of the monorail project connecting Tinapa to the International Conference Centre. My predecessor did two Calabar carnivals as governor; I did eight; so I grew the base of the carnival and its brand. So you have to share a common vision and you have to expand and grow that vision over a number of years with the right policies that will ensure that you attract visitors to the state and that becomes the challenge of the future. Also, some governors have different priorities, there might be an orientation towards industrialisation and whatever it is, but I think they can all go hand-in-hand, one does not have to happen at the expense of the other. So that remains the challenge for that new generation of leaders that will emerge in 2023.\n\nTheCable: With Governor Ayade\u2019s defection, what is your message to members of the PDP in Cross River, including national assembly members elected under your party and those at the state house assembly and chairmen of local government?\n\nImoke: It was very interesting that I haven\u2019t seen governor Ayade hold a broom, but I have always imagined in my head that Ben would look at the broom once or twice before he holds it (laughing). Because in all honesty, even that is alien to him. So to the people of Cross River, I say: stand firm, we are PDP, we are committed, we are resolute, we are a grassroots party and we are sufficiently strong. I want to commend the strength and the will of the people who said listen, we are not going, PDP is our party, we will remain here. So you have members of the state executive council, we have members of the state assembly, of course the national assembly members, we have party chairmen, leaders in our state, all of them standing resolute for the party that they know they belong to. So that movement did not have the expected effect. The perception that Cross River state has become an APC state has clearly been debunked by the fact that a good number of people stood firm. And even amongst those who have moved, there\u2019s something that we say \u201cyou can move but don\u2019t join\u201d. So even amongst those who have moved, we know that they have moved but they have not joined. And I think that there will be opportunity for everybody to reassess the situation going into 2023 and come back together again, and again do what they have always done. I will never take the credit as leader for the work that they do, I believe that they are standing firm, they are committed, they are resolute and indeed they know that by the Grace of God come 2023, PDP will be Cross River and Cross River will remain PDP.\n\nTheCable: Interesting! One last comment sir, while you were speaking earlier, you welcomed former Governor Donald Duke back to the party heartily. If as you said, Senator Ayade may not be able to know how to hold a broom; if he realises that he is in a strange environment and wishes to come back, what would be your reaction, will you welcome him?\n\nImoke: I will welcome him; I will definitely welcome him. Ben and I don\u2019t have any differences, personal differences, maybe political differences and that\u2019s why I said that his decisions may be personal to him. So certainly if he gets there, and it doesn\u2019t look as good as he thought, then for us we\u2019ll be glad to welcome him back as one of us, it\u2019s a game of numbers so the more the merrier. I don\u2019t believe that we should create enmity out of politics. Yes, it\u2019s a game of power which should be played fairly and everybody has a right to take whatever decision that they chose and we should not hold it against them in eternity; so certainly for anyone that wants to work to see the growth and development of Cross River state, we are willing to work with them at any time.",

          "text": "Liyel Imoke has held many positions since emerging in the political space. Most notably, he has served as a minister twice and is also a two-time governor of Cross River. In this interview, he speaks on helping to lay the building blocks of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in his state, the recent defection of Governor Ben Ayade to the All Progressives Congress (APC), and his party\u2019s foothold in Cross River.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheCable: Good afternoon, your excellency. Let\u2019s talk about developments on the political terrain in Cross River State. You are a founding member of the PDP. You\u2019ve also held various key positions in the country, including being minister of power and steel, and for a while minister of education before going on to become the governor for 8 years. Tell us, what vision and strategies characterised those early days, your roles, and how the foundation was laid for the current republic?\n\nImoke: This question takes me down memory lane. It takes me back to the early days. When I say the early days, I mean my early days in politics. As you may recall, as far back as the early 1990s I got involved in politics because of my interest in public service and in contributing to the growth and development of the society that I come from and giving back, as it were to the society. The then governor of Cross River state, Mr. Clement Ebri, was someone that I worked with and admired. He supported me when I ran for senate; under the same political platform, I got elected as a senator in 1991/92. That was the real beginning of my political career. As you may be aware that dispensation ended with the Abacha coup and after the Abacha coup it was basically back to the trenches.\n\nHowever, I remained in communication with a lot of our political supporters and members of our team and we still had a common vision, a vision for a new Cross River state. That vision was borne out of my experience, campaigning literally door-to-door to get elected into the senate. The campaign provided me an opportunity to see the state of our people and the conditions they lived in, especially in the rural communities and that was really a driving factor for us, in terms of coming together and thinking that Cross River state needed a new order. It was through that process that I started convening meetings in my house in Lagos at the time, which were attended by young Cross Riverians as it were, to build and share a vision, and also chart a new course for Cross River State. Amongst those who attended those meetings were the former governor, Donald Duke, Senator Gershom Bassey, Bassey Eyo Ndem who became a commissioner in the state and MD of Tinapa; Essien Ayi who is now a member of the house of representatives, and several others, all young men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe also had among those who attended the meetings people like Victor Okon and a number of young aspiring Cross Riverians and a lot of my colleagues like Dennis Nkiri, who was in the house of representatives when I was in the senate, were also part of that process. They saw the vision and bought into it from day one. We all stood firmly, sharing a common vision and came up with a blueprint for a new Cross River state. It was through that process that we decided to participate actively in the transition that took place under that Abacha administration; but we were of the progressive orientation, as such we did not join any party that we thought Abacha would control and manipulate. We opted to join the NCPN and when the NCPN was eventually decimated by the same Abacha administration, we joined the DPN. In providing leadership to that generation of people we were able to work collectively as a team to go into an election at the time, of course, there were all kinds of idiosyncrasies and all kinds of theories about power and who had it and who could give it and where it could go to. But as young men, we thought that we could chart a different course for the state and it was on that basis that we ultimately joined the People\u2019s Democratic Party and by so doing, we were taking a position against a significant number of our leaders, including my boss, Clement Ebri, who was in the APP; Dr. Joseph Wayas and several others who opted for the APP.\n\nBy joining the PDP we had room as it were, to build a new order, and not just build a new order but to bring young people into the politics and that led ultimately to winning the elections with Donald Duke as our candidate, going against the odds at the time where they said no Efik man can be governor of Cross River state. I couldn\u2019t understand why a citizen of the state was not entitled to become an elected representative of the state especially if they\u2019re qualified to occupy that office. So I championed that cause and a lot of people came against me saying I was not Efik and as such why was I championing a cause for the Efiks. At the end of it all, by the Grace of God we succeeded and Donald became the governor of Cross River state and he got elected for a second term. We built a strong political family and this translated to a marginal victory for the party.\n\nTheCable: It\u2019s understandable; because the big weights were on the other side?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImoke: The big weights were on the other side and we were on this side, so we were quite satisfied with the marginal victory. After the elections, we engaged the young people who may have been in the other political party to bring them to understand and appreciate that it was better if we worked collectively. So as leader of the team, as the campaign manager for all the elections, that was my responsibility. We brought these young people together and by the 2003 elections, we had a formidable team going into the elections. So even though there was a strong anti-Efik sentiment and a strong anti-Donald Duke sentiment represented in a group of leaders organised under the aegis of Atam Congress, we stood firmly against it. I led that movement to ensure that the state was united and I think 2003 was the one election that united Cross River state and that united our political party, the PDP. Since then, until now, the PDP has remained the overwhelming dominant political force in Cross River State.\n\nTheCable: So one can say that you were actually the pillar behind Donald Duke becoming governor?\n\nImoke: Well at the risk of sounding immodest, the answer is yes; but we had a formidable team and we were extremely focused. Our major strength was the ability to strategise to win the hearts of the people. I led a strong team of young men and women who worked selflessly. I think that\u2019s the history of our state and I think through that experience we were able to strengthen our party and it became the dominant party. I contested the elections and the party won all the seats at every level and everybody that has contested election in Cross River state thereafter has won with similar margins. The struggle was for the PDP ticket, once you had the PDP ticket, you are literally elected. Through the years up till the emergence of Governor Ben Ayade, PDP has been firmly the party of choice of the people. I think it\u2019s not just our style and approach that achieved this. We introduced a collegiate leadership model at all levels. This engendered confidence in our supporters as it was a bottom-up approach and afforded them not only the freedom of choice but also an opportunity to take ownership and responsibility. We also had a strong connection to the grassroots and I think that was something that we deliberately embarked upon especially given my own experience in going round campaigning, first for senate and then subsequently for Donald to become governor and then my own eventual emergence. So we endeared ourselves to the electorate and that is where the strength of the PDP lies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheCable: That\u2019s a very interesting history. Things are looking a little bit different now. Your state governor, Senator Ben Ayade, recently defected to the APC. How will that affect the fortunes of the PDP in the coming elections in a state that has a history of being a PDP state?\n\nImoke: I\u2019m glad you ended that question with saying that it\u2019s a state that has a history of being a PDP state. I think in the past you would see that states that have that type of strength irrespective of a defection tend at all times to remain strong. There\u2019s a reason for that. What you perceive as power will determine how you lead. If you perceive power to be a political party, then you will be moving from one political party to another but if you understand that power ultimately is the people and that it belongs to the people, you will appreciate that it is not about the party. PDP in Cross River State has always been about the people and I think we still remain about the people; so the party has endeared itself to the people and as such, a movement by the governor does not of its own translate to the people moving into another political party, because they have already identified strongly with the party \u2013 the PDP. It is sort of like what you have in the United States and other countries where there are strongholds; a state like California, it is defined as a Democratic stronghold. Cross River State is a PDP stronghold.\n\nTheCable: That\u2019s interesting; that means there is still hope?\n\nImoke: Hope? The truth is that they have an uphill task to remove the PDP in Cross River state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheCable: Governor Ayade is known for appointing thousands of youths as special assistants or advisers, in what he describes as a policy to put food on the table for them. Do you think this is a good policy for youth engagement especially given the need for human capital development and provision of infrastructure for overall development of the state?\n\nImoke: I think it was the philosopher Thomas Hobbes who basically attributed all power to the king, and that the king had power to do what he chose to do and how he chose to do it and the masses were obliged to follow. That theory has been disproved over the years, over the centuries and that has led to democracy and what we have now. Through the years, various philosophers: Karl Marx, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and several others, have come and not only discredited Hobbes\u2019 theory but have clearly shown that power could belong to the people. So you cannot oppress the people without a reaction; power must go to them. And I think that no matter how subjugated a people are, at some point in time they are going to fight for their rights and for whatever they are entitled to. They are entitled to certain freedoms, they are entitled to earn a living, and they are entitled of course to safety and security; those are critical components of life. So when you are dealing with a generation of young people in a society like ours, you must deliberately make an effort not just to give them the ability to succeed but you must also, as they say, teach them how to fish.\n\nI don\u2019t think that the average Cross River youth is lazy, I don\u2019t think that the average Cross River youth is looking for food on the table; I believe that the average Cross River youth is confident and strong, is well educated and wants to earn a decent living. And I think we cannot take away from that fact, It\u2019s even Biblical, if you recall the story of Esau and his birthright. But for the fact that he gave up his birthright, he would be Israel. The people of Cross River will not give up their birthright for a mussel of food. I don\u2019t think that those are Cross Riverians, that\u2019s not the nature of the Cross Riverian. The Cross River youth that I know are energetic and want an opportunity. So for us to build a sustainable economy we need to create wealth for the people, to provide them with opportunities to express themselves, opportunities to grow themselves, to provide them opportunities to provide for family; and, a food on-the-table policy doesn\u2019t seem to provide such necessities for the long term. So, yes there are a number of people who will be engaged on those terms but not the larger society, the generation of Cross Riverians that I know, have energy, they are resourceful and they are committed to not just a better society but having a better livelihood and those are the people that I believe are in the majority in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheCable: Your predecessor, Donald Duke, in a statement he issued on the heels of the defection of Governor Ayade, accused you of hoisting, in his words \u201cautocratic leadership style\u201d where \u201ccommunication with party members declined,\u201d and that \u201cemergence in the party was determined not by the party constitution or structures but by the whims of the state\u2019s chief executive;\u201d directly accusing you of bringing Ayade and imposing him on the people. How do you react to these accusations?\n\nImoke: I believe that his statement was issued after I was informed of his joining the party and had called him welcoming him back to the party. So let me use this opportunity to again welcome him back into the party and assure him of our commitment to working with him and making sure he is fully reintegrated and understands who we are and what we have always done as a party. I think his decision to re-join the party speaks volumes and it is indeed a very good decision. Our major strength has been, and will always be, carrying everyone along and making sure that each person\u2019s opinion is sought and recognised. As he returns to his foundation, he will definitely have every opportunity to make his own contributions towards the growth and development of the party. As a party, we are proud of the fact that we have since inception, consistently and without fail achieved significant successes in Cross River state. We have done extremely well. Holding the ground and keeping the states under the umbrella has been no mean feat but the PDP has done this successfully over the years. This I think is commendable. Whether we are looking at Ayade, Donald himself, or myself, the party\u2019s style of leadership through the years it has been in control of the state has always been a collegiate style of leadership and an appeal to the grassroots. It is this acceptance by the grassroots that has always ultimately delivered 99% success at the polls. That is the style that we have adopted over the years and it has kept us firmly on the ground as the most popular and accepted party in Cross River State. Donald\u2019s return should add value to what we\u2019ve done and will continue to do. We have not changed and we will continue to blaze the trail. He has returned to our great party and to his foundation at a time when the governor has defected; since I am not God, only God knows the hearts of men, so I am not going to speculate on the reasons behind Governor Ayade\u2019s departure from the party. But as I said, I welcome Donald back to the party and I look forward to working with him.\n\nTheCable: So you won\u2019t agree to what he says about your \u2018autocratic style of leadership\u2019?\n\nImoke: I believe that the key to our success which has been acknowledged, beyond the party and the state and I believe has even been recognised and acknowledged by Donald himself in re-joining the party, is clearly the collegiate rather than autocratic style of leadership. So let\u2019s not dwell on that but welcome him, and assure him of not only his full membership but also of the key leadership role that he is expected to play. We\u2019re all looking forward to working closely with him and improving the fortunes of the party in the state.\n\nTheCable: Now that governor Ayade has defected from your party. Do you regret supporting him to be a governor, do you feel any disappointment and betrayal by the defection?\n\nImoke: No; I don\u2019t actually. I don\u2019t have any regrets; as I said, the only authority that has the benefit of hindsight is God. So you can\u2019t say I regret or I don\u2019t regret, no; certainly not. At the time when Ayade contested for the governorship, we gave him all our support. He would not have been governor without our building a consensus and without the party taking him to the people and the electorate to solicit for their support. So when he emerged through a rigorous state-wide internal party caucus selection process through the 18 local government areas, we believed that the people had made their choice. We believed he was the right man for the job at that time and I think he came out and appealed to Cross Riverians across the 18 local government areas. It wasn\u2019t a pronouncement; it wasn\u2019t a dictatorial imposition. He went through a very lengthy and hectic process of campaigning, of reaching out to the people and enjoying their support. So, we can\u2019t say we regret that if we are honest. What we\u2019ll say is yes, at that time, he enjoyed the popular support of the party and of course ultimately the people. I remember telling him on the day he was sworn in that his popularity would begin to erode from his first day in office but how fast it would happen depended on him. It\u2019s always the case with elected leaders.\n\nTheCable: Your tenure as Governor of Cross River was synonymous with what many described as grassroots development, including access roads to several rural areas. Do you think such commendable populist projects can return again in Cross River in the coming years, as many have lamented that in the last 6 years, the state has lost its glory?\n\nImoke: I think like you called them, populist projects; the most important thing for me was being responsive to the needs of the people. Every administration has its own style and every administration has its own approach to governance. In my own case, I tried to be as responsive as I could to the needs of the people. I never took it for granted that because I had become the governor I knew what they wanted better than they did. So in making decisions, I inevitably would make sure that we went back to the people who elected us to understand their needs, and sometimes their needs were as small as a police post, sometimes as small as a road, classroom blocks, quality education, healthcare. So we were responsive to those needs and in so doing, we were able to reach a lot of communities across the state. And by so doing, not only did we respond to their needs, but we also got from them a lot of support. So I think that that was the style at the time, I think that the more responsive an administration is to the needs of the people, the more they will enjoy the support of the people.\n\nTheCable: Politics is local. You have played a noble leading role as a national and state leader of the PDP. What message do you have for members of your party in the state who look up to you as their leader given the events of the recent past with the defection of Governor Ayade? Will PDP retain (or win back) Cross River in the next election?\n\nImoke: PDP is Cross River, and Cross River is PDP. So, Cross River is a PDP state, we know no other party as it were. And as I said over the years, PDP has performed in governance and has basically reached the people at various levels. So an introduction of a new party would translate into a bit of confusion for the people and it will take a long time for them to even understand either the reasoning behind it and the concept of that new party. The second point is that the young people who are going to be part of this process have grown up with an understanding of the party and I believe that this is a time for us to move power to a new generation of young people, just like we benefitted by the actions that we took and it provided us with the opportunity to serve. There is no greater privilege than the privilege of service; so a new generation of young people, who are committed to the party, who understand the philosophy of the party, who understand how democratic the party is and how resourceful the party can be, will be the new leaders of Cross River State come 2023. Cross River State will remain PDP, it has always been PDP. So I am not in doubt as to the capacity of these people to stand firm and resolute and say listen, come 2023, we are PDP.\n\nNow on our own part as a party, we need to provide leadership that gives them hope, gives them an opportunity. For me as a leader, that is what I have always been about. It\u2019s about engagement, it\u2019s about empowering our people, it\u2019s about meaningfully responding to their needs and their demands, it\u2019s about creating wealth, it\u2019s about growing the various sectors of the economy, whether it\u2019s the tourism sector, or the social sector, or the industrial sector, private sector engagement, public sector engagement, and all of that. It\u2019s only the PDP that has ever provided it. So I don\u2019t see any room for any other party that means well for Cross River state. Moreover, if you look at the way the country is today and you do a comparative analysis between governments under the PDP and governments under the APC, I don\u2019t think Nigerians will by any stretch of the imagination, especially Cross Riverians, say that we are better off today than we were six years ago. I believe that every Nigerian is worse off today than they were six years ago. So this provides us with an opportunity for new leadership, an opportunity for new participation, an opportunity for a new order and I believe that that is what will be achieved in Cross River State come 2023.\n\nTheCable: Talking about tourism, Cross River was once regarded as the tourism destination in Nigeria, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors from home and abroad. What do you think is responsible for the loss of this prime economic position and what, as a leader of the state, will you do or advise to be done to reverse the fortunes of the state?\n\nImoke: I think the success of tourism is tied to many things; one of them is security. For instance, it\u2019s difficult to grow tourism in a state of insecurity. And Nigeria is presently challenged with significant security issues, so tourism is not likely to thrive in that environment. Also, the other factors that drive tourism policy-wise, have to be addressed. For me, I inherited a vision which I shared and was a part of; so I could build on it. For me it wasn\u2019t about what I started, I didn\u2019t start it, it was sustainability and that\u2019s the key. My predecessor had started working on the ranch (Obudu Resort), we sustained the effort and kept the ranch running along with the Obudu International Mountain Race; my predecessor had also built Tinapa, and we kept Tinapa as functional as we possibly could in the circumstances, bringing in people like Mo Abudu and her entire production team into the state along with her television station and all the shows we could engage in, in Tinapa, growing the sector. We made use of tracks that were imported by my predecessor to complete the first phase of the monorail project connecting Tinapa to the International Conference Centre. My predecessor did two Calabar carnivals as governor; I did eight; so I grew the base of the carnival and its brand. So you have to share a common vision and you have to expand and grow that vision over a number of years with the right policies that will ensure that you attract visitors to the state and that becomes the challenge of the future. Also, some governors have different priorities, there might be an orientation towards industrialisation and whatever it is, but I think they can all go hand-in-hand, one does not have to happen at the expense of the other. So that remains the challenge for that new generation of leaders that will emerge in 2023.\n\nTheCable: With Governor Ayade\u2019s defection, what is your message to members of the PDP in Cross River, including national assembly members elected under your party and those at the state house assembly and chairmen of local government?\n\nImoke: It was very interesting that I haven\u2019t seen governor Ayade hold a broom, but I have always imagined in my head that Ben would look at the broom once or twice before he holds it (laughing). Because in all honesty, even that is alien to him. So to the people of Cross River, I say: stand firm, we are PDP, we are committed, we are resolute, we are a grassroots party and we are sufficiently strong. I want to commend the strength and the will of the people who said listen, we are not going, PDP is our party, we will remain here. So you have members of the state executive council, we have members of the state assembly, of course the national assembly members, we have party chairmen, leaders in our state, all of them standing resolute for the party that they know they belong to. So that movement did not have the expected effect. The perception that Cross River state has become an APC state has clearly been debunked by the fact that a good number of people stood firm. And even amongst those who have moved, there\u2019s something that we say \u201cyou can move but don\u2019t join\u201d. So even amongst those who have moved, we know that they have moved but they have not joined. And I think that there will be opportunity for everybody to reassess the situation going into 2023 and come back together again, and again do what they have always done. I will never take the credit as leader for the work that they do, I believe that they are standing firm, they are committed, they are resolute and indeed they know that by the Grace of God come 2023, PDP will be Cross River and Cross River will remain PDP.\n\nTheCable: Interesting! One last comment sir, while you were speaking earlier, you welcomed former Governor Donald Duke back to the party heartily. If as you said, Senator Ayade may not be able to know how to hold a broom; if he realises that he is in a strange environment and wishes to come back, what would be your reaction, will you welcome him?\n\nImoke: I will welcome him; I will definitely welcome him. Ben and I don\u2019t have any differences, personal differences, maybe political differences and that\u2019s why I said that his decisions may be personal to him. So certainly if he gets there, and it doesn\u2019t look as good as he thought, then for us we\u2019ll be glad to welcome him back as one of us, it\u2019s a game of numbers so the more the merrier. I don\u2019t believe that we should create enmity out of politics. Yes, it\u2019s a game of power which should be played fairly and everybody has a right to take whatever decision that they chose and we should not hold it against them in eternity; so certainly for anyone that wants to work to see the growth and development of Cross River state, we are willing to work with them at any time.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a resolution to investigate the legality of the suspension of Twitter in the country. Announced on Friday, the controversial decision has stoked national conversations and attracted international criticism over the last few days.\n\nThe investigation by lawmakers represents the first major move by the legislative body on the suspension of Twitter and comes after widespread criticism from Nigerians over the silence and inaction of the National Assembly since the ban was imposed.\n\nMembers of the lower chamber have been \u201cinundated with comments about the decision (suspending Twitter), requests for intervention and criticism\u201d since the announcement, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, said during the resumption of the plenary session of the House in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the House recognises that Twitter, like other social media networks, is an important tool for communication and commerce in Nigeria \u201cparticularly amongst the younger generation who have used these networks for enterprise and innovation with great success.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker however cautioned that although the social media platform is a very important means of communication and business for the younger generation of Nigerians, the government has a responsibility to ensure it is not used to undermine national security even as lawmakers must see to it that government policies are in line with the law and without adverse consequences on the people.\n\nAs part of the investigation that will be carried out by the House Committees on Communication, Justice, Information & Culture, and National Security & Intelligence, the Minister of Culture & Information, Lai Mohammed, has been invited to brief the House on the objectives, intent, and duration of the suspension of the operations of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe committees are expected to question Lai Mohammed and report to the House within 10 days to guide further action by the lawmakers on the matter, Gbajabiamila said.\n\nThe embattled minister who announced the suspension of Twitter, cited a \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d as reason for the ban. The U.S. social media giant has said it is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the ban.\n\nNigerians continue to use Twitter, however, thanks to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) that have helped bypass the ban. In response, the Nigerian Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has ordered the immediate prosecution of people still making use of the microblogging platform. The country\u2019s broadcast regulator has also ordered television and radio stations to suspend their use of Twitter.",

Wuri Ventures and Capria Ventures also participated investing $1.5m. This investment comes a year after the company raised a $7.5 million Series A round from investors including Google and Toyota Tsusho. This brings the total raised by the company during its Series A funding to $22 million.\n\nFormed in 2016, WhereIsMyTransport is a big data platform that provides sustainable mobility solutions in emerging markets. It maps formal and informal public transport networks. The company then uses data obtained to improve the public transport experience, making commutes safe and accessible.\n\nIts products are used by cities to coordinate and monitor services, operators to integrate their systems, and passengers, who access the platform through apps and endpoints connected to the WhereIsMyTransport platform. WhereIsMyTransport has been used to enrich Google Maps in Mexico and has helped the World Bank examine access to job opportunities via public transport in 12 African cities.\n\nWith this new investment, WhereIsMyTransport plans to continue its expansion across emerging markets, with a launch in Peru planned for later this year. It has already mapped 34 African cities and has over 100,000 users in Mexico.\n\n\u201cWhereIsMyTransport started in South Africa, focused on becoming a central source of accurate and reliable public transport data for high-growth markets. We\u2019re thrilled to welcome Naspers as an investor as our journey continues in megacities across the majority of the world,\u201d said CEO Devin de Vries.\n\nFabian Whate, head of Naspers Foundry, said WhereIsMyTransport had a strong track record of developing the best-in-class technology for improving the daily commutes of people across the world.\n\n\u201cThe mobility technology company is a great addition to the Naspers Foundry investment portfolio and we look forward to working with the WhereIsMyTransport team as they take their business to the next level,\u201d he said.\n\nMobility in emerging markets via public transportation is often a hassle \u2013 it\u2019s inefficient and time-consuming. The successful expansion of WhereIsMyTransport would reduce friction in the movement of people and goods across Africa and other emerging markets.",

          "text": "HELPING AFRICAN CONSUMERS SEND AND RECEIVE AS LITTLE AS $1 USING CRYPTO\n\n\u2013 FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD \u2013\n\nEasyShare; a fast, reliable, and super affordable way to send and receive money to anyone in Africa using crypto has officially launched in beta mode in Africa.\n\nBy using innovative low-cost crypto-technology to drastically cut transaction fees, Easyshare will also allow consumers to perform micro-transactions safely, securely and affordably.\n\nSpeaking on the launch of the beta platform, Ben Onuoha Co-founder and Head of Partnerships & Community at EasyShare.Africa said, \u201cEasyshare was born out of a lot of research. Bitcoin and Ethereum have definitely offered more people access to the global financial system \u2014 but African consumers have repeatedly told us that Bitcoin and Ethereum can still be way too expensive to use in many cases, and it is therefore, not necessarily the answer for the financial needs of all communities. More African Bitcoin and Ethereum users are increasingly using other cryptocurrencies which offer better value for money\u201d\n\nOnuoha added: \u201cIn response to consumer demand, we are solely focused on the ease of sending and receiving value through cryptocurrency using the most affordable means. Our vision is to bring Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to low and middle income countries where remittances account for 5% or more of GDP and make these DeFi services more accessible.\u201d\n\nThe threshold for sending and receiving money using crypto on EasyShare.Africa is capped at a maximum of US$2,500 per transaction and a minimum of US$1. Users can seamlessly send money to a mobile wallet or bank account using crypto in five easy steps. EasyShare.Africa supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT ERC20) and other low transaction cost cryptocurrencies such as Binance Coin (BNB), Litecoin (LTC), Tether (USDT TRC20) and Tron (TRX). More cryptocurrency options will be added in due course.\n\nThe Easyshare.Africa platform is crowdsourcing to meet its expansion plans\n\nIn addition to serving ordinary consumers, Easyshare.Africa is committed to extending its impact, by pioneering the world\u2019s first decentralized network of verified peer to peer crypto-powered remittance agents. Current crypto remittance systems and peer to peer platforms use centralized escrows to guarantee settlement. This centralized escrow model is oftentimes plagued with bad actors, as well as centralized judges and juries settling disputes. EasyShare.Africa improves on this crypto peer-to-peer remittance model by adding a decentralized layer where verified remittance agents can stake SHARE Token \u2013 the native crypto of the Easyshare ecosystem \u2013 as collateral/insurance to guarantee the agents complete transactions.\n\nThe Easyshare model is poised to contribute to eight out of the seventeen United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by making a case for the unbanked and underbanked through offering various services such as micro remittances, microfinance loans, savings, insurance, payments, e-commerce and more for low-income populations in Africa and other emerging markets.

          "text": "Digital transformation has reinforced the importance of investing in the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for asset monitoring, data collection, and decision making, to maximize value from operational assets in advanced and emerging economies.\n\nLagos, Nigeria: Today, PlugnPlay IoT, a subsidiary of NovaTrack Limited announced that it will be organizing a private Asset Tracking seminar in Lagos, Nigeria that will discuss the importance, necessity, and the \u2018how\u2019 of adopting the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for business advancement, especially in emerging economies through digital transformation focused on asset management and tracking.\n\nThe seminar, as part of the PlugnPlay IoT measures to help businesses in emerging economies scale by revealing how businesses, regardless of size can reduce operational cost in the areas of asset maintenance, security, data collection, etc., will be held this year, precisely on the 15 June 2021.\n\nAs rightly stated by PlugnPlay IoT, \u201cthe recent security challenges in major African economies, especially Nigeria highlight the need for increased security protocols for valuables. In the case of businesses, these valuables are referred to as company assets. These are infrastructure, equipment, or personnel that have some reasonable and clear lifetime value pegged on them. Aside from security, businesses that wish to stand strong through time naturally seek to improve operational processes, especially with technology and innovation that provides an unfair advantage.\u201d\n\nHowever, some business assets may not deliver direct value but will have other processes or operations dependent on their indirect value. Such business assets are often mistaken for less important but they should be secured to avoid or reduce unwanted events like operational downtimes which may lead to loss of trust and reduced work efficiency all of which runs down any business.\u201d\n\nThese challenges are common to all; Oil & Gas, Construction, Manufacturing, Financial Services, Logistics, Energy Supply and Distribution, Facility Management, etc., and there is always a place for IoT to satisfy these. Industries like these have been seen to speedily displace entities that fail to evolve with technological advantages because advancements such as IoT drastically improves operational success and reduces risk while increasing customer satisfaction. For example, the advent of GPS tracking revolutionized the logistics sector, and those able to perfectly fit it into business processes now lead the industry. This is why PlugnPlay IoT has put together the Asset Tracking 101 Seminar to present industry leaders who participate with the unfair advantage of business asset tracking with IoT technology.\n\nA representative of PlugnPlay IoT also mentioned that \u201cthe seminar, to be held on June 15, will privately engage high-level participants from both the public and private sector; CEOs, CTOs, CIOs, Senior Managers, Government Heads, and will focus on the key issues surrounding business innovation and the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology for asset tracking to increase profitability and boost economic prosperity.\u201d The program will include training and updates on new products/solutions with speeches delivered by highly ranked business leaders in Nigeria and as a private event, it is strictly on invitation. However, business leaders who consider themselves qualified to participate can request to attend on their webpage.\n\nAbout PlugnPlay IoTPlugnPlayIoT is an IoT service provider, powered by NovaTrack Ltd, that empowers system integrators, technology experts, software developers and entrepreneurs to build and scale their own IoT business verticals at a relatively low cost. Our solutions enable our channel partners to deploy wireless connected sensors with remote monitoring capability, data analytics and real-time alerts for various industry applications.",

          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nUberX Hourly launches in Nigeria\n\nMoneyHash pre-seed investment round\n\nUpdates on the Twitter ban in Nigeria\n\nUber Launches UberX Hourly in Nigeria\n\nOn Monday, June 7, 2021, US-based ride-hailing platform, Uber, announced the official launch of UberX Hourly in Nigeria.\n\nWith this new feature, riders can stop at multiple locations to carry out activities without requesting several rides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat this means is that you can book a ride to an event centre but also stop by the pharmacy to get drugs or the supermarket to grab a few things with the same ride. Of course, you can\u2019t do all that with the initial amount paid.\n\nHow it works is, on the Uber app, you can order a ride as usual, but this time, you\u2019d select an Hourly Driver. Then, put in your destination and send your driver an in-app message to discuss how much time you think you might spend on all trips. Upfront charges are based on the minimum per hour, and consequently, per minutes.\n\nThis launch follows a warning strike action carried out by Bolt and Uber riders under the Professional E-hailing Drivers and Private Owners Association (PEDPA) in April and a 13% increase in fares in Lagos in May.\n\nBefore now, UberX Hourly was only available in Africa in Tanzania\u2019s largest city, Dar Es Salaam. According to Uber\u2019s Country Manager for Nigeria, Tope Akinwumi, the warm reception of the product by both riders and users in that city reflects its viability and scalability in Nigeria. .\n\nEven if there is some excitement about the feature in the country, the drivers\u2019 concerns haven\u2019t been addressed. Time will tell how affordable UberX Hourly will be.\n\nMoneyHash raises undisclosed pre-seed round\n\nL-R MoneyHash co-founders Nader Abdelrazik, Anisha Sekar and Mustafa Eid. Source:The Capital Quest\n\nEgypt-based fintech startup, MoneyHash, raised an undisclosed pre-seed investment on Monday, June 7,2021. The round was led by COTU ventures, a leading seed-stage venture firm in the Middle East.\n\nOther investors in the round include Kepple Africa Ventures, Nigeria-based early-stage VC, Ventures Platform, and some angel investors.\n\nThe startup is currently building an API to help businesses access all payments and fintech services across the Middle East region. This will help eCommerce merchants provide users with a seamless experience during checkout and create a compact user database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounded by Nader Abdelrazik, Mustafa Eid, and Anisha Sekar, MoneyHash launched in December 2020. The app is currently running a private beta mode. The funding will be put towards a public launch, product development, and team growth.\n\nIt goes to say that more startups realise the necessity of fintech platforms in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. This should be no surprise as it\u2019s a region where only 40% of the population have access to bank accounts. The fintech and digital banking scene is plagued with issues like lack of a unified data system and payment integration; startups like MoneyHash are looking to provide viable solutions to these problems.\n\nStill on the Twitter ban in Nigeria\u2026\n\nA lot seems to have happened since the Federal Government of Nigeria banned the use of microblogging platform, Twitter, on Friday, June 4, 2021.\n\nThe news was received with a bitter counteraction by a large number of the public, as it poses a threat to the core values of free speech and freedom of expression that are the bedrock of a democratic state.\n\nHowever, it is one thing to react to a wrong, and it is another to be aware of the facts as to why an action may be wrong or right.\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo picked the brains of three lawyers to find out the legality of the directive. What\u2019s your guess?\n\nYou should check it out: #TwitterBan: Exploring the legal intricacies of Nigeria\u2019s decision\n\nThat\u2019s not all. In a bid to access Twitter, Nigerians currently have to resort to using Virtual Private Networks (VPN). Questions like \u201cShould all VPNs be trusted?\u201d have been asked.\n\nYou can find answers here: #TwitterBan: Should Nigerians be worried about VPNs?\n\nRemember, safety first!\n\nAnd in a latest development, the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) has given orders to broadcasting stations to deactivate their Twitter accounts and desist from reporting to their audience via that platform.\n\nRead more: #TwitterBan: Nigerian TV, radio stations, others can no longer tweet or patronise Twitter\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government is reportedly drafting new rules that will mandate foreign companies like Twitter to get a licence before they can operate in the country.\n\nSmoke without fire? This Bloomberg article has it that the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, through his special assistant on Media, has denied that the government is planning to partner with China to build an Internet firewall. He calls it \u201ca figment of the reporter\u2019s imagination.\u201d\n\nWhile this gives some sort of relief, it\u2019s still clear that freedom of speech is under threat.\n\nIn Case You Missed It\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading:\n\nFaceTime is coming to Android and Windows via the web.

          "text": "China has announced a series of measures for high-quality development of public hospitals in the next five years, including providing medical resources to underdeveloped areas and improving public health emergency policies.\n\nDrawing lessons from the COVID-19 epidemic, the government has vowed to oversee the high-quality development of its 12,000 public hospitals over the next five years.\n\nThis offers a clue for Nigeria in easing the pressure often placed on big public hospitals in city centres by large population of those who rely on government facilities to offset treatment cost.\n\nFor years, the Chinese government has been advising people to seek treatment in nearby medical centres, instead of going to big hospitals in big cities.\n\nSince 2019, top public hospitals in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai have been encouraged to set up sub-branches in provinces that have a large population, but don\u2019t have advanced medical resources. And authorities say the plan has been working. The 10 pilot projects have helped patients get treatment in local hospitals.\n\nRead Also: Healthcare delivery suffers in Ondo as 105 medical doctors resign\n\n\u201cIn Henan, there\u2019s a sub-branch of Beijing Children\u2019s Hospital in the provincial capital Zhengzhou. In 2020, the province saw a big drop in the number of patients who went to the Children\u2019s Hospital in Beijing. The number of out-patients has dropped by 63 percent, and the number of hospitalized patients has dropped by 51 percent,\u201d said Sun Zhicheng, director of Social Development Department of the National Development and Reform Commission.\n\nThese sub-branches are called regional medical centres and will be expanded to all provinces by the end of next year. The government also requires every city to choose one comprehensive hospital to focus on the epidemic.\n\nHospitals specialising in infectious diseases will also receive support to improve their facilities. These are just part of the new blueprint.\n\nLi Bin, vice-minister of the National Health Commission, explained what the government aims to achieve in the next five years.\n\n\u201cPublic hospitals will focus on improving quality and efficiency rather than expanding in scale. Their operation and management will be more delicate and will focus on talents and technologies, instead of materials and equipment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAll these measures aim to provide efficient medical services with high quality, and to prevent and fight major epidemics and public health emergencies. They\u2019ll support the construction of a healthy China,\u201d Li added.\n\nThe central government is requiring public hospitals to be better prepared for major epidemics.\n\nOne of the issues of concern to public health systems in Nigeria is that people often bypass secondary healthcare facilities to move cases directly to tertiary hospitals believed to be better equipped and managed experienced health experts.\n\nAlthough many secondary healthcare facilities run the Lagos state government for instance has at least a surgeon, obstetrician, gynaecologist, paediatrician and specialist equipment, resident still both in city centres and suburbs still overlook them due to delays in access and sometimes unavailable of the experts.\n\n\u201cPeople will not go to any of those secondary hospitals. They prefer to come to LASUTH. So, we are overs-subscribed. As we speak, we have over 37 medical emergency beds,\u201d Adetokunbo Fabamwo, chief medical director, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) told BusinessDay earlier in an interview.",

Osaigbovo Iyoha, said his administration will continue to work for the people of Edo State.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn my first term, I promised to tar community roads in Ekosodin. I kept to my promise as a lot of work has been done in developing the area. We will continue to do more for the community.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on developing the State. I charge you to protect all government facilities and infrastructure in your community. I call on the community to own the process and not allow vandalism. If government\u2019s property is maintained, our unborn children and the coming generation will benefit from it.\u201d\n\nThe governor further assured them that his administration will partner the community in improving security, noting, \u201cSecurity requires collaborative effort. We all need to partner and ensure our state and the nation is safe for us all. When the state is safe and secure, investors will come in to develop the area.\n\n\u201cThe government plans to drop one of the power-line for 24/7 electricity in Ekosodin and establish an innovation hub in the area to empower the youths and artisans.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to partner with people of Ekosodin Community to make the area comfortable for our youths and students.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Odionwere of the community, Pa Samuel Aimufua, whose speech was read by the community\u2019s Public Relations Officer, Engr. Osayomwanbor James, commended the governor for the tremendous work done to develop the community.\n\nHe noted: \u201cSince 1970, when Samuel Ogbemudia established the University of Benin, we have suffered under-development, as several administrations did not look towards our direction. The present administration, led by Governor Godwin Obaseki came to the rescue. It has brought development to the people of Ekosodin Community in Ovia North-East.\u201d\n\nIn another engagement, Odolevbo O\u2019sioba Initiative, led by the Commandant General, Comr. Taju Owen Balogun, commended Obaseki for the peace and unity witnessed in the state, expressing the readiness of the group to collaborate with government to improve security.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to keep the highway safe for the people, as we will help to check the activity of criminals who hide in the forests to commit nefarious acts.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who expressed his appreciation to the group for the gesture, assured them that his administration will partner with them to keep the state safe for all.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to collaborate in the area of security, as we have made great impact in the area of keeping the state safe and peaceful,\u201d he said.\n\n...",

I am sure that when we are done, it will be one of the most viable road networks in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe scheme has been designed in such a way that it will allow for private investment on such roads. We are designing a new road from the Benin River Port to Okpella. Hopefully, one day in our development plan, we would be able to put a rail link there,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki further noted that, \u201cWhen you try to get a flight to Edo State now, it becomes difficult because a lot of people are trying to utilize the business friendly environment created by this administration.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nKidnappers are demanding a N10 million ransom after abducting a tailor, Mary Adi, in Kuje Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nMs Adi, a native of Cross River, left home on Sunday afternoon for a friend\u2019s place but could not be located afterward until the kidnappers called to demand the ransom.\n\nSpeaking to PREMIUM TIMES on Monday, a boss to Ms Adi relation, Cherish Ogenyi, confirmed the incident. Mr Ogenyi said he had the privilege to speak with the kidnappers because he could communicate in Hausa.\n\n\u201cShe is a tailor, she left the house at 3 p.m. yesterday (Sunday). The mother called her at 7 p.m. to buy sugar for house use on her way back home. Later that night, all efforts to reach her mobile number failed until this morning that the number started going through.\n\n\u201cSo, early this morning, the kidnappers called and demanded N10 million.\n\nWhen my staff got the phone, she pleaded with me to speak to them since I can speak Hausa. It was the Fulani accent that I was hearing. They refused to tell me their location. I pretended to be a relative of the lady. They said any further delay, they would kill her and sell her body parts.\u201d\n\nMr Ogenyi said he pleaded with the abductors to review the amount downward but all his entreaties fell on deaf ears.\n\n\u201cWhen they asked me how much we had, I told them N200,000. They were furious with me.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday evening, a relation to the victim, Janet Odule, said the case had been reported to the police. She said the kidnappers made further contact and announced their readiness to accept the N200,000 offer.\n\n\u201cHer brother just told me now that they (abductors) are ready to collect the N200,000 but they (family) do not have it. I don\u2019t even know what to do now,\u201d she lamented.\n\nWhen contacted, the spokesperson of the FCT police command, Mariam Yusuf, asked if the matter had been reported to the police, which our reporter affirmed.\n\nShe was, however, yet to respond to subsequent enquiries as of the time of filing this report.\n\nKidnapping for ransom has become rampant in many parts of the country, worsening the security situation of the country.\n\nA report published in May by SB Morgen (SBM) Intelligence said between 2011 and 2020, Nigerians paid at least $18.34 million (\u20a67 billion) as ransom to kidnappers.\n\nAcross the six geopolitical zones, armed bandits kill and kidnap at will despite the efforts of security agencies.\n\nThis newspaper had reported that no fewer than 201 were killed and 137 abducted in violent attacks across Nigeria last week.",

          "text": "IZUNWANNE, a body of senior journalists from the Southeast geopolitical zone, has condemned what it called wanton violence in the zone, while calling on President Muhammadu to deescalate tension by embracing more dialogue, just as it called on those carrying out attacks on public institutions in the zone to drop their weapons and embrace peace.\n\nThe group in a statement on Tuesday, by its chairman, Sir Abuchi Anueyiagu and secretary, Elder Ngwuoke Ngwuoke, also condemned the wanton killing of innocent youth of the zone by security agencies in the guise of fighting Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\n\u201cIZUNWANNE condemns in strong terms the wanton violence that has suddenly engulfed the Southeast and Southsouth geo-political zones of the country, and call for the return of peace,\u201d the group said.\n\n\u201cWe also condemn in very strong terms the attack on government agencies and assets, as well as the killing of security personnel by whichever unidentified gunmen in the zones. This should stop,\u201d the group said.\n\n\u201cOur association also roundly condemns the attendant indiscriminate killing of innocent persons in the guise of going after the arsonists and destroyers of public facilities in the area.\n\n\u201cThe situation in Owerri where security agents indiscriminately go after mass arrests of youths in churches and their families is unacceptable to IZUNWANNE and should stop forthwith.\n\n\u201cIZUNWANNE pleads with President Muhammadu Buhari to cool his temper as the father of the country and review his \u201cshoot at sight\u201d order to stop security operatives from taking advantage of the order to engage in indiscriminate shootings and mowing down of the lives of many vulnerable, helpless and innocent people in both southeast and Southsouth zones of the country, as is currently the case in the two zones. Such approach can never bring peace but would rather compound issues, lead to intimidation, suppression and coercion. There are better other possible and legal ways available to government to responsibly bring about peace and tranquility in the zones than the present path which the security forces are taking.\n\n\u201cWe support a UNITED Nigeria, where equity, justice and fair play are the principles that should govern the co-existence of all peoples of the country.\n\n\u201cNo organisation linked with violence should be linked with Ndi Igbo as a people. Ndigbo are not in support of any group of persons who have taken to violence under whatever name or guise.\n\n\u201cThe Igbo are peace loving enterprising people who live everywhere in Nigeria and have investments there and will never as a people support or resort to using violence as a means of settling issues with anyone. Wherever they are found outside their homelands they always live in peace with their hosts.\n\n\u201cAs a people, Ndigbo do not support the killing of security forces and burning of public and private properties by unknown gunmen on one hand and the indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians by enraged security personnel on the other hand hand, in the Southeast geo-political zone.\n\n\u201cWe call for refrain from engaging in such atrocities by the parties involved.\u201d",

Our Passenger Service Executive, being suspicious of the duo\u2019s behaviour, questioned them about the babies. They said the babies belonged to them and were travelling to Asaba.\u201d\n\nOlisa disclosed that as the suspicion intensified, the two adults, who hinted that the babies were 3-month-old each, were further questioned by another counter attendant and a security personnel but they gave a different narrative.\n\n\u201cThe two adults gave conflicting explanations to different staff that the babies were being taken to United Kingdom to unite them with their parents and later they said they were sending the babies to Zimbabwe for adoption,\u201d he added.\n\nUpon further questioning, the adults confessed that they were not the parents of the babies. Consequently, Air Peace\u2019s security unit took both of them to the MMA2 Police Station where they admitted they were agents who traffic children for adoption.\n\nThe Police said they would transfer the case to the National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) for further investigation and action.\n\nIt could be recalled that Air Peace crew also prevented two children from being trafficked in June 2018 on a Lagos\u2013Banjul flight and in January 2019 on a Lagos-Port Harcourt flight.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe airline, however, commended its staff for preventing the crime.",

          "text": "A 35-year-old woman, Oluwadamilare Aremu, has accused the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital of negligence leading to the amputation of her right leg.\n\nAremu told PUNCH Metro that she was admitted to LASUTH in December 2018 when an 18-passenger vehicle she boarded was involved in a crash on the Third Mainland Bridge, leading to her suffering a broken thighbone.\n\nShe alleged that doctors at LASUTH assured her that she would walk again, but her hope was dashed after two surgeries with the doctors still demanding funds for a third and final surgery, which they claimed would solve the problem.\n\nShe told PUNCH Metro that she was discharged on July 8, 2019, to go and find the money for the third surgery, adding that she was already broke as a result of the bills she had to pay while on admission.\n\nAremu stated, \u201cI was involved in an accident and rushed to LASUTH on December 16, 2018. LASUTH doctors told me that I would walk again. But after two surgeries in 2019, I was told that I needed a third and last one.

But no surgery was performed from 2019 till 2020.\n\nAremu said she sought alternative medical help at the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, Lagos, in October 2020, adding that she was advised that the leg would have to be amputated.\n\n\u201cLASUTH readmitted me and kept postponing my surgery from 2019 till October 2020 on COVID-19 excuses.

Igbobi told me that amputation was the only solution left because my leg had been mismanaged. But I would have to wait till 2021 because of the queue for amputation surgery. LASUTH didn\u2019t tell me the truth from the outset,\u201d Aremu lamented.\n\nShe told PUNCH Metro that she attempted to poison herself when the pain became unbearable, adding that she opted to amputate the leg at the Oak Hospital, Ikeja.\n\nShe also alleged that one of her doctors at LASUTH was a consultant at Oak Hospital.\n\nShe stated, \u201cI opted to have the leg amputated at Oak Hospital, Ikeja. The pain was so much that I once tried to commit suicide. Oak Hospital couldn\u2019t remove the iron that LASUTH inserted in my leg, so they called a consultant to come. It was Dr Afariogun of LASUTH, who came.\n\n\u201cHe was surprised to see me. Afariogun told me that he couldn\u2019t tell me the truth, because he was afraid of his seniors at LASUTH. Dr Soga, Dr Afariogun and Dr Ajiboye were the three doctors, who attended to me at the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe victim told our correspondent that she was still in pain despite the amputation of the leg and lamented that LASUTH wasted her money and rendered her immobile.\n\n\u201cEven after the amputation surgery, the damage LASUTH did to my leg could not be undone.

          "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\n\nFor the past two weeks, Acme Road, a major industrial hub in Ogba area of Ikeja has been under siege by the Lagos All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Lagos State Police Command.\n\nThe police have shut the road for two weeks now preventing motorists, workers from carrying out their activities. The action of the police has caused extreme gridlock on Part of Acme Road, Wemco Road as well as Ogba.\n\nThe road was blocked few metres before getting to the APC Secretariat and after the secretariat with barriers to prevent motorists from accessing the road.\n\nWorkers on Acme Road using public transport are forced to alight before the APC Secretariat, cross the barrier on foot and then board another bus to First Gate, paying double fare.\n\nOwners of private vehicles are forced to make use of Wemco Road to link Agidingbi and then to Acme Road. This has led to traffic gridlock on Wemco Road down to First Gate.\n\nAsides those working on Acme Road, the popular road serves as a link for those working at the Secretariat, Alausa to link Agidingbi and then proceed to Ojota, Obalende, among others.\n\nWhat the closure of the road has caused is that traffic has been diverted to Wemco Road with untold hardship and pains as motorists could stay on this gridlock for hours.\n\nThe popular Acme Road was shutdown the moment the APC held their sham Local Government primary elections with attendant violence and killings two Saturdays ago.\n\nThe primaries were marred by imposition, leading to fear that the APC secretariat would be razed by aggrieved party members.\n\nThe police, in connivance with APC leadership in Lagos, thus barricaded the busy road, inflicting pains and anguish on passers-by and motorists.\n\nOn Tuesday, PM NEWS reporter confronted the police officers barricading the road on why the popular road had been blocked for two weeks, one of them said the order was from the Lagos State Police Commissioner, Hakeem Odumosu and he did not say anything more and turned the reporter back to drive through the gridlock on Wemco Road.\n\nWhen contacted Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, Lagos Police Command, Muyiwa Adejobi said the action the command had taken was for the good of the people and security reason.\n\nHe did not disclosed what security breach would warrant the closure of a popular road for two weeks, punishing motorists and commuters who are not politicians.\n\nIn his words: \u201cWhatever action the command has taken is for the good of the people and for security reason, nothing more, that is my reaction.\u201d\n\nLagos APC spokesman, Seye Oladejo did not pick calls made to his phone by PM NEWS.\n\nWorst still, the Lagos State Government has not done anything to salvage the situation. The LASTMA officials directing traffic in the area are over-stretched and they are complaining bitterly.\n\nAngry motorists have taken their time to lash out at the Lagos State Government, the APC and the police over the harrowing experience they are made to go through on daily basis following the closure of the road and demand immediate re-opening as they have no business with APC and its sham primaries.",

          "text": "By Abankula\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has been dragged to ECOWAS court over \u201cthe unlawful suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe legal fight is being spearheaded by Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and 176 concerned Nigerians.\n\nNigeria\u2019s leading human rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana is representing the 177 plaintiffs.\n\nThey sued Buhari for criminalisation of Nigerians and other people using Twitter, and the escalating repression of human rights, particularly the rights to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom in the country.\u201d\n\nFollowing the deletion of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed last week announced the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe government has also threatened to arrest and prosecute anyone using Twitter in the country, while the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) has asked all broadcast stations to suspend the patronage of Twitter.\n\nIn the suit No ECW/CCJ/APP/23/21 filed today before the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice in Abuja, SERAP and the concerned Nigerians are seeking: \u201cAn order of interim injunction restraining the Federal Government from implementing its suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe 177 Nigerians also seek a stay order on government from subjecting anyone including media houses, broadcast stations using Twitter in Nigeria, to harassment, intimidation, arrest and criminal prosecution, pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.\u201d\n\nIn the suit filed by Solicitor to SERAP, Femi Falana SAN, the Plaintiffs contend that \u201cif this application is not urgently granted, the Federal Government will continue to arbitrarily suspend Twitter and threaten to impose criminal and other sanctions on Nigerians, telecommunication companies, media houses, broadcast stations and other people using Twitter in Nigeria, the perpetual order sought in this suit might be rendered nugatory.\u201d\n\nThe suit, read in part: \u201cThe suspension of Twitter is aimed at intimidating and stopping Nigerians from using Twitter and other social media platforms to assess government policies, expose corruption, and criticise acts of official impunity by the agents of the Federal Government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe free communication of information and ideas about public and political issues between citizens and elected representatives is essential. This implies a free press and other media able to comment on public issues without censor or restraints, and to inform public opinion. The public also has a corresponding right to receive media output.\u201d\n\n\u201cFreedom of expression is a fundamental human right and the full enjoyment of this right is central to achieving individual freedom and to developing democracy. It is not only the cornerstone of democracy, but indispensable to a thriving civil society.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe arbitrary action by the Federal Government and its agents have negatively impacted millions of Nigerians who carry on their daily businesses and operational activities on Twitter. The suspension has also impeded the freedom of expression of millions of Nigerians, who criticize and influence government policies through the microblogging app.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter is arbitrary, and there is no law in Nigeria today permitting the prosecution of people simply for peacefully exercising their human rights through Twitter and other social media platforms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension and threat of prosecution by the Federal Government constitute a fundamental breach of the country\u2019s international human rights obligations including under Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Nigeria is a state party.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension has seriously undermined the ability of Nigerians and other people in the country to freely express themselves in a democracy, and undermined the ability of journalists, media houses, broadcast stations, and other people to freely carry out their professional duties.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of Nigerians at home and abroad rely on Twitter coverage of topical issues of public interest to access impartial, objective and critical information about ideas and views on how the Nigerian government is performing its constitutional and international human rights obligations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implication of the decline in freedom of expression in Nigeria is that the country is today ranked alongside countries hostile to human rights and media freedom such as Afghanistan, Chad, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Zimbabwe and Colombia.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nDrama ensued on floor of the House of Representatives on Tuesday, as Caucus of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) moved in protest against the recent suspension of operations of the social media platform, Twitter in Nigeria by the federal government.\n\nSpeaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila had at the commencement of the day\u2019s plenary, recalled that the suspension has generated fierce debate. \u201cThe House of Representatives has since the announcement been inundated with comments about the decision, requests for intervention and criticism\u201d, he stated.\n\nThe speaker went further to announce the decision of the leadership, mandating Committees on Communication, Justice, Information and Culture, and National Security and Intelligence to immediately commence an investigation to determine the circumstances of the decision, as well as the legal authority for the ban on the operations of Twitter in Nigeria, and report back the findings within 10 days.\n\n\u201cThe report of the Committees will guide further action by the House of Representatives on this matter. Therefore, I urge the Committees to act with speed and sound judgment to address this issue that has animated our national conversations over the last few days\u201d, Gbajabiamila had noted.\n\nMidway into the session, leader of the PDP caucus, Kngsley Chinda however raised a point of order, citing provisions of the fundamental human rights, and the African Chatter on people\u2019s rights, and concluded that the suspension was in breach, praying that the House urged executive arm of the federal government to \u201cin the meantime, lift the suspension\u201d until the outcome of the expected intervention by the named committees.\n\nHe was immediately ruled out of order by the speaker, who cited the rules of the house to the effect that a matter for which decision had been reached cannot come back on the floor, unless through a substantive motion of rescission. Attempt by Chinda to continue talking was interrupted by Majority Leader, Ado Doguwa who warned that he should be \u201cproperly guided\u201d, and to \u201csit down\u201d.\n\nA new twist was added to the drama when Chinda in company of some members of the caucus staged a walkout, following which Yusuf Gagdi yet through an order on privileges recalled that media reports over the weekend suggested that the PDP caucus\u2019 move was pre-planned with the intent to disrupt the plenary, saying the Ethics and Privileges committee of the House should investigate the lawmakers involved, a request that was turned down by the speaker.\n\n\u201cI think we should rest this matter. It is unfortunate that seasoned parliamentarians who should know better are the ones doing this\u201d, the speaker noted, insisting that the earlier decision of the leadership subsists, as he commended members of the opposition political parties who stayed back.\n\nAddressing journalists later, the group, led by Chinda explained that the call fell within the rules of the House, since what the speaker presented was a decision of the leadership, and not a motion for debate and subsequent vote, which should have ended as a resolution of the entire house.\n\n\u201cSincerely, I would have been surprised if the speaker did not take that step.

          "text": "The African Centre for Leadership Strategy and Development (Centre LSD) has officially unveiled the \u201cCentre LSD Build Grant,\u201d to bridge the unacceptable gender imbalance in the extractive industry in the country.\n\nThe Centre said the Build Grant is for general support for strengthening an intersectional approach to gender and natural resources management, and a project for institutional strengthening.\n\nThe Programme Coordinator, Centre LSD, Ms. Victoria Udoh said this while unveiling the Grant in a press conference in Abuja.\n\nShe said that the Mineral and Mining Act 2007 which guides processes and procedures in the sector is gender blind and as a result, company-community consultation and decision-making are done in alienation of women and their perspectives.\n\nShe added that the result of the above scenario is increasing gender inequality and further disempowerment of women.\n\nMs. Victoria explained that the overarching goal of the project is to build strong and resilient organizations that will contribute to elimination of all forms of gender-based violence in the extractive sector in Nigeria.\n\nShe said that the project which is supported by Ford Foundation is divided into two fold, \u201cInstitutional Strengthening Interventions\u201d and \u201cProgrammatic Interventions\u201d.\n\n\u201cInstitutional Strengthening Interventions seeks to build the capacity of staff to deliver on the BUILD grant and beyond. It is also designed to strengthen the systems and structures of the Centre through the procurement of ancillary resources needed to interrogate systems, structures and practices that have put women and children in disadvantage in the extractive sector in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhile Programmatic Interventions is dedicated to the implementation of activities geared towards reducing the barriers faced by women in the extractive industry. During the project lifespan, activities and programmes to reverse the identified practices and barriers faced by women in the extractive sector will be our focus\u201d.\n\nGiving insight into factor that attracted the grant to the centre, Ms. Victoria said: \u201cIn Nigeria, women faces systematic discrimination in all phases of extractive industry. The entrenched gender bias not only prevents women from engaging in and accessing economic benefits, but also manifests in how companies and governments engage with communities at all stages of extractive activities. The Mineral and Mining Act 2007 which guides processes and procedures in the sector is gender blind and as a result, company-community consultation and decision-making are done in alienation of women and their perspectives. The result is increasing gender inequality and further disempowerment of women.\n\n\u201cThe African Centre for Leadership Strategy and Development (Centre LSD) in sync with the government\u2019s determination to reform the extractive industry and diversify revenue sources to include non-oil revenue, implemented the strengthening civic engagement and advocacy for effective natural resource governance in Nigeria project. The aim was to mobilize citizens to participate in the governance of natural resources for the mineral sector to contribute significantly to the Gross Domestic Product. During the implementation of this project, emphasis was not placed on the humans as well the effect on men varies from effects on women and children. For example, as land is expropriated for extractive industry projects, so are family farms that women often manage. These farms give women the ability to earn income, some level of independence and decision making power in the household and community\u201d.\n\nTo address these anomalies, she concluded that the centre is implementing a grant, still in the extractive sector, specifically looking at how to integrate gender in its extractive work.",

No one is going to come out a winner.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, right-wing president Nicolas Sarkozy had a security scare in southwest France when he was grabbed violently by the shoulder by a 32-year-old local government employee.",

          "title": "Bosnian Serb Commander Ratko Mladic Loses Genocide Appeal",
          "text": "Ratko Mladic, the military chief known as the \u201cButcher of Bosnia\u201d for orchestrating genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in the Balkan nation\u2019s 1992-95 war, lost his final legal battle Tuesday when U.N. judges rejected his appeals and affirmed his life sentence.\n\nThe ruling involving his 2017 convictions and sentence closed a grim chapter in European history that included the continent\u2019s first genocide since World War II \u2014 the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys.\n\nThe now-frail Mladic, often belligerent at his court appearances in The Hague, showed no reaction other than a scowl as Presiding Judge Prisca Matimba Nyambe of Zambia said the panel had dismissed, by a vote of 4-1, his appeals of convictions for crimes including genocide, murder, extermination and terror for atrocities throughout the war that killed more than 100,000 and left millions homeless.\n\nThe 79-year-old former general is the last major figure to face justice from the conflict that ended more than a quarter century ago.\n\nHis former political chief, ex-Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic, already is serving a life sentence after being convicted for the same crimes. Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who was accused of fomenting the ethnic conflicts that tore apart the Balkans in the 1990s, died in a U.N. cell in 2006 before judges at his trial could reach verdicts.\n\nSerge Brammertz, the prosecutor who finally brought both Karadzic and Mladic to justice, said Mladic \u201cranks among the most notorious war criminals in modern history\u201d who abused his position of power to commit crimes including genocide.\n\n\u201cMladic should be condemned by all responsible officials in the former Yugoslavia and around the world,\u201d Brammertz said. \u201cHis name should be consigned to the list of history\u2019s most depraved and barbarous figures.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said the \u201chistoric judgment shows that those who commit horrific crimes will be held accountable. It also reinforces our shared resolve to prevent future atrocities from occurring anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy thoughts today are with all the surviving families of the many victims of Mladic\u2019s atrocities. We can never erase the tragedy of their deaths, but I hope today\u2019s judgment provides some solace to all those who are grieving,\u201d a statement from Biden said.\n\nThe court also rejected an appeal by prosecutors of Mladic\u2019s acquittal on one other count of genocide linked to ethnic purges early in the war.\n\nAs commander of the Bosnian Serb Army, the once-swaggering Mladic led troops responsible for atrocities ranging from \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d campaigns to the siege of Sarajevo and the war\u2019s bloody climax in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.\n\nIn Sarajevo, applause broke out among those watching the proceedings. Mayor Benjamina Karic called it \u201ca day of justice\u201d for Sarajevo, Bosnia and innocent victims of the war.\n\nMladic\u2019s toxic legacy continues to divide Bosnia and his dark shadow has spread far beyond the Balkans.\n\nTo Serbs in Bosnia, he is a war hero who fought to protect his people. To Bosniaks, mostly Muslims, he will always be a villain responsible for their wartime suffering and losses.\n\nNedziba Salihovic, who lost her son and husband in the bloodshed, watched the court hearing on a large screen in Srebrenica.\n\n\u201cThis means a lot to me, my heart is racing,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was punished. It is not important where he\u2019ll end up (to serve his sentence). Like mothers of Srebrenica, he\u2019ll spend the rest of his life without his family.\u201d\n\nBosnian Serb separatist leader Milorad Dodik blasted the final verdict as \u201cselective justice\u201d and \u201csatanization of Serbs\u201d which will only deepen the existing ethnic divide in Bosnia so many years after the war.\n\n\u201cThe court did not prove Mladic\u2019s direct guilt,\u201d Dodik said. \u201cIt is clear that genocide in Srebrenica never happened.\u201d\n\nMladic\u2019s son, Darko, who was part of his defense team, said in The Hague: \u2019\u2019This traveling circus (the tribunal) has finished its job like it started. The general had no chance of a fair trial.\u201d\n\nMladic was first indicted in July 1995. After the war in Bosnia ended, he went into hiding and was finally arrested in 2011 and handed over to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia by the then-ruling pro-Western government of Serbia.\n\nThe judgment was welcomed as \u201can important affirmation of the rule of law\u201d by Kathryne Bomberger, director-general of the International Commission on Missing Persons that helped locate and identify victims of atrocities in Bosnia.\n\n\u201cRamifications of the judgment in case of Mladic and in previous cases, such as that of Radovan Karadzic, go beyond the Western Balkans. This gives hope to survivors of atrocity, including families of the missing and disappeared persons around the world, that justice can be delivered,\u201d Bomberger said.\n\nAmnesty International\u2019s Europe Director Nils Mui\u017eniek said the ruling \u201csends a powerful message around the world that impunity cannot, and will not, be tolerated.\u201d\n\nNedzad Avdic, who survived a mass execution in Srebrenica, said he was satisfied \u201ceven though nothing can erase what we\u2019ve been through nor bring back our dead.\u201d\n\nThe judgment \u201cwill make denying the crimes more difficult. This and other verdicts will be the starting point for anyone who cares about truth,\u201d he added.\n\nThe shadow of Mladic and Karadzic has spread far beyond the Balkans. They have been revered by foreign far-right supporters for their bloody wartime campaigns.\n\nThe Australian who shot dead dozens of Muslim worshippers in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019 was believed to be inspired by the wartime Bosnian Serb leaders, as was Anders Breivik, the Norwegian white supremacist who killed 77 people in Norway in 2011.\n\nThe U.N. tribunal that initially indicted Mladic has since shut its doors. His appeal and other legal issues left over from the tribunal were being dealt with by the U.N.\u2019s International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, which is housed in the same building as the now-defunct court for the former Yugoslavia.\n\nOutside the court, another mother from Srebrenica, Munira Subasic had a message for young people in Serbia and the Serb part of Bosnia.\n\nShe urged them to study the court\u2019s judgments and indictments, and \u201cstop hating and create a better future for themselves and our children.\u201d",
