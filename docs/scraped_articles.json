          "text": "Big Brother Naija ex-housemate, Khafi Kareem, has expressed grief as she marks the second year anniversary of her brother\u2019s death.\n\nHer brother, Alexander Kareem, was shot close to his family house in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, West London by a yet-to-be-identified person in 2020.\n\nIn an Instagram post on Thursday, the reality TV star shared a song by her other brother, @kabiz_k which he wrote as a tribute to the deceased.\n\nKhafi further called on persons who might have information on the shooting to come out and help in identifying the murderer.\n\n\u201cToday marked two years since my brother Alex was murdered in cold blood on the streets of London. It feels so wrong to commemorate this kind of anniversary; wedding anniversaries, birthdays, etc. are things that should be celebrated and remembered, not a day of death. But two years on and still his murderers have not been found.\n\n\u201cThis is NOT OKAY. It hurts me every day and is not getting any easier, I just find better ways to suppress my grief as time goes on, but every time it arises it is like a dagger to my chest afresh. It has made me so sensitive to any news of death, especially shootings like those in Owo, Uvalde, and particularly news of young black boys dying needlessly. They trigger so much for me.\n\n\u201cSo I was dreading today. And if I had it my way I would have buried my head in the sand and pretended this isn\u2019t my reality. I had 3 brothers and now I only have 2. And the people responsible are still walking the streets.\n\n\u201cIt makes me so so angry. But my brother @kabiz_k wrote this song (full song in my bio) and it expresses so much of how I feel, I couldn\u2019t share it. Please listen, in memory of my brother Alex and all the fallen. Their deaths will not be in vain. And if you have any information on Alex\u2019s death, it is not too late to speak up,\u201d she wrote in the caption.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nSmarting from his landslide victory at the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential Special Convention, former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has vowed to crush the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which he mocked as \u2018geckos\u2019 in the presidential poll slated for 2003.\n\nTinubu had defeated 13 others to set up an electoral challenge with Atiku Abubakar, who clinched the main opposition party\u2019s ticket on May 28.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nTinubu polled 1,271 votes to defeat his closest rivals, former minister of transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi who scored 316 votes and Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo who garnered 235 votes.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Tinubu stressed the need for unity, cohesion and understanding among all party members to ensure electoral victory for the party.\n\nHe said he held no grudges against those who contested against him, saying all hands must be on deck to ensure PDP is stopped from coming back to power in 2023.\n\n\u201cThe competition is now over, those who did not support me, you have nothing to fear. I hold no grudges or grievances.\n\n\u201cLet us each agree to join hands in defeating the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and beating back our common foes of poverty, terror and violence.\n\n\u201cWe now have a date with destiny in February 2023, let us win so Nigeria can become the nation it is intended to be.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cToday is another historic day and we thank God Almighty that we are alive to witness today. This victory has gone beyond the party and has become a Nigerian project\u2026.\n\n\u201cNow that we are here, we will roar, we will develop the building. Tell the Property Development Party, the PDP, that we are capable enough to fix Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThen to the Progressive Governors Forum, we are truly progressive. We are confident that this nation is back on track. I didn\u2019t know what I did that gave you the confidence to nominate me as the candidate of the party. We will worry and eliminate the intruders in the party. No intruders, no destroyers can bring Nigeria backward.\n\n\u201cI must thank our men in uniform for their sacrifices and fight for the survival of this country. You will certainly get reward and enjoy your sweat.\n\nHe promised insurgents and bandits hard times.\n\n\u201cWe are not the barbaric human they think we are. The Bible told us to love our neighbours not to kill them. We have to learn to accept mistakes not to take lives. The hate you spill cannot cure your hunger. We have to learn to tolerate one another. We are all human beings that should leave together. We have to be tolerant and perseverance. Don\u2019t take the lives you did not create.\u201d\n\n\u2022APC confident of victory \u2013Lawan\n\nSenate President, Ahmad Lawan, said the emergence of Tinubu has reassured the party of winning the presidential poll.\n\nIn a letter of congratulations he personally signed, Lawan said outcome of the election process had shown that Tinubu was the popular choice of his party.\n\nThe letter read: \u201cThe Presidential Primary of our great party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), for the 2023 general election has come and gone.\n\n\u201cI am elated and proud that the Presidential primary was manifestly free and fair, and conducted within our APC family under a most convivial atmosphere.\n\n\u201cThe success of the event demonstrates the capacity of our great party to run its internal affairs smoothly and devoid of rancour.\n\n\u201cAs Your Excellency is aware, I offered myself alongside your good self and other patriotic members of the party to fly its highly coveted flag in the 2023 presidential election,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that he did so in the belief that he had the knowledge base, ideas, experience and desire to provide leadership for our dear country at these most trying times.\n\n\u201cHowever, the outcome of the election process has shown that Your Excellency is the popular choice of our party for that assignment.\n\n\u201cI do not have an iota of doubt in the wisdom of that decision by our party\u2019s delegates from across the country.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that with your credentials, experience, antecedents and political sagacity, our great party will go into the 2023 contest confident of victory,\u201dLawan said.\n\n\u2022Afenifere, MBF react\n\nThe Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF), yesterday, congratulated former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu for securing the All Progressives Congress (APC) 2023 presidential ticket.\n\nSMBLF consists of Afenifere, representing the South West; Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, representing the South East, the Middle Belt Leaders Forum (MBF), representing the Middle Belt and Pan Niger Delta Forum, (PANDEF), representing the South South.\n\nMBF President, Dr. Pogu Bitrus, said the South East deserved the ticket more than the South West, but that the body is all the same, contended that a southern candidate emerged from the platform of one of the major political parties.\n\nHe pledged that members of the forum would work together and ensure that a southern candidate wins the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cOne, we commend the APC for selecting a southern candidate, two we congratulate Bola Ahmed Tinubu on winning the ticket, three, we commend President Buhari for keeping to his words, and four we also commend Gov Akeredolu for standing firm on insisting on a southern candidate emerged from their platform. What is important now is how a southern candidate will win the election. We are all committed on the emergence of a southern president in 2023, there are many southern candidates and Tinubu has emerged from the platform of a major party. Going from our analysis, the South East deserved it more than the South West, but all the same we are happy that a southern candidate has emerged from a major political party.\u201d\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi said the emergence of Tinubu on the platform of APC is delightful.\n\nHe said the APC has met the \u201cminimum condition of fielding a Southern candidate.\u201d\n\nAfenifere has been in the forefront of organisations advocating power must shift to the southern part of Nigeria come 2023.\n\n\u201cFor power to move to the South, there must be southern candidate or candidates. That was why we were strident in our calls on the political parties to field Southern candidates in the forthcoming presidential election.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope, indeed our demand, that the next president must get the country restructured immediately on assumption of office if the present administration under retired Gen. Muhammadu Buhari failed to do so before leaving office. The next administration owes us the duty of ensuring that the country is not only safe for everybody, the operational system must be such that no section or group would be in a position to dominate the other. In summing up, the emergence of a person of Southern extraction is highly welcomed. It is our hope that this will translate into power shifting to the South come 2023.\u201d\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nWriting on his twitter, Atiku, described the exercise that produced Tinubu as a hard-fought contest. \u201cCongratulations, Bola Tinubu on your emergence as your party\u2019s presidential candidate. It has been a hard-fought contest, but that you prevailed confirms your tenacity.\u201d\n\nSpeaker Gbajabiala said with Tinubu\u2019s victory, APC stand a good chance of retaining power in 2023, noting that Nigerians across board recognised his contributions to the nation\u2019s development.\n\nGbajabiamila, who described Tinubu as a dogged fighter who stood his ground to compete in the presidential primary in a democratic manner, said the presidential candidate remains a hero.\n\nHe called on him to be magnanimous in victory, as that has been his attitude, and carry other aspirants along for the party\u2019s victory at the general elections.\n\nSimilarly, the Amaechi Presidential Media Committee in a statement by the Committee\u2019s Chairman, Kingsley Wenenda Wali, called on all the aspirants to come together to work for the victory of Tinubu and APC in the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge that his victory follows a highly charged contest, which as expected, could only produce one winner. It is, therefore, our hope that following the emergence of Sen. Bola Ahmed Tinubu as our party\u2019s presidential candidate, all aspirants will now close ranks and work hard to ensure our party\u2019s victory at the 2023 presidential election.\u201d\n\n\u2022Kalu: APC won\n\nDr. Kalu congratulated the former Lagos State governor for emerging victorious in the primary. He equally extended the congratulatory message to Lawan, who he described as a dear friend for the wonderful outing and all the other aspirants who participated in the process.\n\nIn a statement he personally signed, Kalu said all the aspirants campaigned well enough to have won the primary, but reminded them that at the end of the day it was only one candidate that would represent the party in the general election.\n\n\u201cTo my friend and colleague, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who has been elected as our party\u2019s presidential flag bearer, big congratulations to you; the APC won. As a faithful party man, I also congratulate the party for its victory and I encourage all other aspirants to accept this victory in the spirit of sportsmanship. We owe the party an open mind and total support.\u201d\n\nHe expressed hope that the victory would stir a deeper reflection about the South East and North East geo-political zones in the country\u2019s affairs.\n\n\u2022Akeredolu hails emergence\n\nOndo State Governor and Chairman, Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, Rotimi Akeredolu, said contest was a brotherly scramble and urged aspirants, and leaders of the great party to leverage on their political strength to build the party and reposition it for even greater victory.\n\n\u201cIt is time to justify our zeal and passion for the party. The instruments of the party must be fully deployed for the rescue mission of the nation. Let us expend our strength and reach to replete the party with brighter prospects. Ours is to plough not to plunder. Our struggle for the service of the people must reflect in our support and incurable commitment to unity geared towards the good of the people and the country at large\u2026 As a leader of the party, it is time to galvanise supports and calm frayed nerves. The reconciliation process must start immediately. The time has come to be United for victory.\n\n\u201cWe have a big task ahead. Let us put the past behind us for the greater objective to oil the wheel of peace, progress and unity in our party. We must all win together.\u201d\n\n\u2022Truly deserving \u2013Kwara gov\n\nKwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq described the emergence of Tinubu as truly deserving, saying the ballot represents a resounding vote of confidence by the largest majority of party faithful and leaders in his capacity to lead the party to another victory.\n\n\u201cIt was a moment to speak to the direction the party must take to consolidate on its own wins, build on the many successes of President Buhari, and raise a dynamic successor team that is able to take up the challenges of nation-building and development in a peculiar age of changing metrics of governance and collective security. In antecedence, capacity, and reach, there is no doubt that Asiwaju ticks all the right boxes. With his emergence, our party is clearly destined for a big win in the next general elections.\u201d\n\n\u2022Oyetola: Victory for democracy\n\nOsun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan, said the emergence of Tinubu was a clear indication that the country was on the verge of democratic rejuvenation.\n\nHe expressed confidence in the capacity and competence of Tinubu to deliver victory for the APC in the 2023 presidential election, adding that the former Lagos governor would deploy his administrative acumen to take the country to enviable heights ever known in history.\n\nThe governor said the APC standard bearer has the requisite leadership qualities and experience to govern the country, and would consolidate on the track records of President Buhari when he gets to power.\n\n\u201cYou are not just a leader of leaders, but a finest politician who had used his God-given wisdom and wealth to build humanity and advance the socioeconomic fortunes of our dear country. It is on record that your phenomenal leadership and enigmatic fortress had in no measure contributed significantly to the growth and development of Lagos State where you served as a two-term governor and of course Nigeria as it is evident in your influence across the nooks and crannies of the country,\u201d Oyetola said.\n\n\u2022Great moment party \u2013 Ekiti gov\n\nEkiti State Governor and presidential aspirant, Dr. Kayode Fayem, in a statement said Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s emergence represents the collective wish of the vast majority of party members, adding that the former Lagos State governor has proven his dedication and competence to lead the country at such an important time in history.\n\nDr. Fayemi who stepped down and endorsed Tinubu at the convention, described the APC flagbearer as a \u201clong distance runner\u201d, who has the capacity to lead the country to greater heights come 2023.\n\n\u201cIt is a great moment for our party. I congratulate Asiwaju Tinubu for the well deserved victory and the leadership of the party as well as the convention committee members for a great job.\u201d\n\n\u2022Testimony to acceptability in north \u2013Ganduje\n\nFor Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, the victory showed his acceptability in the north as a bridge builder.\n\nHe said the entire process was conducted peacefully and thanked all those who participated in it for promoting good democratic process.\n\nGanduje expressed optimism that the election would make APC stronger as the 2023 general elections draw nearer.\n\nHe praised northern governors for their unanimous decision to shift power to the South and also President Buhari for accepting their proposal.\n\n\u201cThis patriotic decision will further cement all parts of the country. President Buhari\u2019s role in making sure that democratic principles are safeguarded in the process is highly commendable and exemplary,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Expression of national unity -Gombe\n\nGovernor Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State described the victory as a good omen and an expression of national unity of purpose.\n\n\u201cThe victory is a manifestation of his years of personal commitment, sacrifice, tenancy, political experience and service to the nation. As an enigmatic leader and strong pillar with immense influence, Tinubu, the APC flagbearer has the capacity to win the general election in 2023 with resounding victory,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor expressed optimism that when eventually elected President of Nigeria, Tinubu would bring to bear his wealth of experience to build on the successes of the Buhari-led administration in all facets of human endeavour.\n\nHe said Tinubu has proven ability and capability to lead the nation, having governed Lagos State with a magic wand.\n\nYahaya applauded President Buhari for providing leadership and guidance that led to the enthronement of a transparent internal democratic process which resulted in the successful conduct of the primary.\n\n\u2022Omo-Agege: We proved our critics wrong\n\nDeputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, expressed optimism that Tinubu would emerge victorious at the 2023 presidential election.\n\nHe called on Tinubu to be magnanimous in victory and stressed the need for all presidential aspirants to join hands with the APC\u2019s presidential candidate and the party in ensuring victory.\n\n\u201cNot everyone gave APC a chance to conduct a free, fair and credible presidential primary. With the undercurrents in the build-up, some had predicted that our great party would go into extinction after this convention. With the transparent process that saw the emergence of Asiwaju Tinubu as our party\u2019s standard bearer, I am confident more than ever before that this is the beginning of even greater tidings for our party. We proved our critics wrong. We have shown that with unity of purpose, the sky is our starting point,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2022Reaffirms his wide acceptability \u2013Andy Uba\n\nDr. Andy Uba, in a statement noted that his emergence is a victory gained from a free, fair and credible process and also reaffirms his wide acceptability to rescue Nigeria from its current state of despair\n\n\u201c I heartily congratulate Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and all our APC delegates for voting massively for the candidacy of Tinubu as our flag bearer. As a party we have demonstrated that APC is the only truly democratic and progressive party that is desirous to correct all the malady currently faced by Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is not only the choice of APC delegates at the APC Special National Convention but the generality of Nigerians who believe in his ideology to turn the nation\u2019s economy around for good, through concerted grassroots development, Job creation, total fight against insurgency among others within a short time \u201c\n\n\u201cIt is my sincere hope that leaders, stakeholders and members of the APC will work assiduously to sell the profile of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to Nigerians.

We call government to bring this strike to an end without further delay.\n\n\u201cWe are appalled and opposed to the growing resistance against trade unionism through obstructions of freedom of association, freedom to organise, freedom to collectively bargain, right to strike and the irresponsible violation of collective bargaining agreements especially by multinational companies. Globally, workers are concerned about the rise of fascism, ultra-nationalism, unilateralism, irresponsible capitalism, and despotism which threaten not only the fabrics of harmonious industrial relations but also the foundations of global peace and our collective survival.\u201d\n\nWabba said the NLC would continue to support the striking universities workers until all issues that led to the industrial action are resolved.\n\nThe NLC president stated that though the Congress earlier issued an ultimatum to the government, which has now elapsed, he said the nationwide strike was put on hold following the intervention of notable individuals in the country.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to achieve from the ultimatum was to get attention, which I would say we were able to achieve. The Sultan of Sokoto, Secretary to the Federation of Nigeria and others intervened and tell us to give them sometime to intervene. We are actually waiting for them. That is also in conjunction with the ILO which believes more in dialogue than shut down. Also for us as a labour centre, strike is always the last option when other avenues have failed.

          "text": "By Gabriel Dike\n\nThe West African Examinations Council (WAEC), yesterday, expressed concern over the activities of rogue website operators in the ongoing May/June 2022 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE).\n\nThe council in a statement signed by its acting Public Affairs Officer, Mrs. Moyosola Adeyegbe, condemned candidates and parents for patronising rogue website operators.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nAdeyegbe drew the attention of stakeholders and the public to the unwholesome activities perpetrated by unscrupulous elements in the conduct of the 2022 WASSCE.\n\n\u201cThe council is aware of the operations of these vile individuals, most especially the rogue website operators, who are hell-bent on sabotaging the noble efforts and concrete arrangements put in place by WAEC to ensure the successful conduct of the examination. The council is equally aware that these individuals perpetrate their dastardly acts through various social media platforms, such as Blogs, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram.\u201d\n\nAdeyegbe said these unpatriotic individuals see WASSCE and other examinations as a business venture and an avenue to make money, thereby deceiving innocent and gullible candidates and their parents.\n\nShe said exam fraudsters lure candidates and their parents by proposing shortcuts to examination success by lying to them that WAEC questions can be accessed earlier than the due date.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing but a lie from the pit of hell. Please, for the avoidance of doubt, and for the benefit of the general public, this is not true. The council works hard to put firm security measures in place to protect the integrity of its test items. Unfortunately, some candidates have fallen prey to the \u2018trash\u2019 being served on these rogue platforms. They no longer read their books because of the promise of access to \u201cWAEC questions!\u201d This is a very sad and dangerous development.\u201d\n\nThe image-maker said the council assured the general public that the rogue website would not go unpunished as they will be brought to book and made to pay for all their crimes, noting \u201cthe council will stop at nothing to ensure that the fight against this societal ill is won at all costs. We are grateful to the Nigeria Police Force for the robust collaboration in this regard.\u201d\n\nThe council reminded candidates that there are no shortcuts to examination success ands warned that any candidate caught in the act would be appropriately sanctioned as approved by the Nigeria Examinations Committee (NEC), the council\u2019s highest decision-making organ on examination-related matters.\n\n\u201cIt will be painful to spend six years in secondary school and not have any results to show for their learning and efforts.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, the council advised parents to encourage their children/wards to study hard and desist from patronising these evil peddlers who are out to destroy the destiny of their children/wards. Parents are equally advised to stop funding these illicit acts.\n\nThe council used the medium to appeal to the various ministries of education to warn invigilators, supervisors, school administrators, and school owners who are fond of extorting and harassing candidates to pay for \u201cexamination settlement\u201d, that such actions will not be tolerated, and any school caught will face appropriate sanctions.\n\nThe council appeals to all concerned to disregard these rogue website operators and their various platforms and join WAEC in the fight against examination malpractice.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

The comparative figures for December 31, 2021, were N39.56 trillion or $95.78 billion.\u201d\n\nThe total public debt stock, the agency said, included new domestic borrowing by the FGN to partly finance the deficit in the 2022 Appropriation Act, the $1.25 billion Eurobond issued in March 2022 and disbursements by multilateral and bilateral lenders.\n\nAccording to data posted by the DMO, the federal government\u2019s total domestic debt as at March 31, 2022, stood at N20.144 trillion (N20,144,027,724,703).\n\nIn the same vein, the federal government\u2019s domestic debt service of N668,685 billion for the review period was for Nigerian Treasury Bills (NTBs), Federal Government Bonds, FGN Savings Bond, and FGN Sukuk Rentals.\n\nA breakdown of the debt service obligations showed that N188,364,772,069.17 was paid out in January, N103,883,183,876.20 in February and N376,437,754,167.61 in March.\n\nFederal government bonds accounted for the lion share of N630,535,774,886.21 followed by NTBs with N29,642,197,193.31 and FGN Sukuk Rentals N8,167, 315,066.60. Similarly, FGN Savings Bond took the rear with N340,422,964.8 million. Total debt service for NTBs in January was N3,220,890,038.78, while February and March were N7,23, 906,633.90 and N19, 189,400,520.63.\n\nFor Federal Government Bonds, a total debt service of N185,026,886,879.94 was paid in\n\nJanuary, N96,527,951,065.07 in February, and N348,980,936,941.20 in March. Also, the DMO data showed that FGN Savings Bond gulped debt service of N116,995,150.45 in January, N123, 326,177.23 in February and N100,101, 637.18.\n\nThere was no debt service pay out for FGN Sukuk Rentals in January and February, but in March, a total of N8,167, 315,066.60 was paid.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria\u2019s external debt stock as at March 31, 2022 stood at $39,969.19 billion.\n\nThis comprised debts for multilateral and bilateral creditors as well as commercial loans.\n\nNigeria owes the largest chunk of $18,957.22 billion to multilateral creditors, including the World Bank Group, International Monetary Fund (IMF), African Development Bank, European Development Fund Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, Islamic Development Bank, and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).\n\nOut of the $18,957.22 billion owed multilateral agencies, $12,229.43 billion and $486.10 million respectively to the International Development Association (IDA) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)- two members of the World Bank Group.\n\nIt is also indebted to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to the tune of $3,395.08 billion and $4 495.87 billion to bilateral creditors, including China Exim Bank $3,667.65 billion), Agency Francaise Development of France ($567.89 million) and KfW of Germany ($164.04 million), among others.\n\nNigeria\u2019s second external debt obligation were commercial loans, standing in excess of $15.918 billion. This included Eurobonds and Diaspora Bond.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Bank Group has slashed its global growth forecast to 2.9 per cent for 2022, 1.2 percentage points lower than the 4.1 per cent it had predicted in January.\n\nIn its latest Global Economic Prospects report, the bank warned that the world economy could slip into a period of stagflation reminiscent of the 1970s.\n\nAccording to the report, against the challenging backdrop of higher inflation, weaker growth, tighter financial conditions, and limited fiscal policy space, governments across the world would need to reprioritise spending toward targeted relief for vulnerable populations.\n\nStagflation occurs when there is a steep rise in inflation rate, slow economic growth rate, and unemployment remains steadily high.\n\nThe June Global Economic Prospects predicted growth in Sub-Saharan Africa to moderate to 3.7 per cent in 2022 and rise to 3.8 per cent in 2023.\n\nThe report noted that the Russia-Ukraine war was compounding the damage from the COVID-19, leading to higher inflation and tighter financial conditions.\n\n\u201cThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has magnified the slowdown in the global economy, which is entering what could become a protracted period of feeble growth and elevated inflation.\n\n\u201cThis raises the risk of stagflation, with potentially harmful consequences for middle- and low-income economies alike.\n\n\u201cGlobal growth is expected to slump from 5.7 per cent in 2021 to 2.9 per cent in 2022\u2014 significantly lower than 4.1 per cent that was anticipated in January.\n\n\u201cIt is expected to hover around that pace over 2023-24, as the war in Ukraine disrupts activity, investment, and trade in the near term, pent-up demand fades, and fiscal and monetary policy accommodation is withdrawn,\u201d the report stated.\n\nAs a result of the damage from the pandemic and the war, it stressed that the level of per capita income in developing economies this year would be nearly five per cent below its pre-pandemic trend.\n\nCommenting, the World Bank President, David Malpass said: \u201cThe war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid.\n\n\u201cMarkets look forward, so it is urgent to encourage production and avoid trade restrictions. Changes in fiscal, monetary, climate and debt policy are needed to counter capital misallocation and inequality.\u201d\n\nThe June Global Economic Prospects report offers the first systematic assessment of how current global economic conditions compare with the stagflation of the 1970s \u2014 with a particular emphasis on how stagflation could affect emerging market and developing economies.\n\nThe report observed that recovery from the stagflation of the 1970s required steep increases in interest rates in major advanced economies, which played a prominent role in triggering a string of financial crises in emerging market and developing economies.\n\nAccording to the Director of the World Bank\u2019s Prospects Group, Ayhan Kose, \u201cDeveloping economies will have to balance the need to ensure fiscal sustainability with the need to mitigate the effects of today\u2019s overlapping crises on their poorest citizens.\n\n\u201cCommunicating monetary policy decisions clearly, leveraging credible monetary policy frameworks, and protecting central bank independence can effectively anchor inflation expectations and reduce the amount of policy tightening required to achieve the desired effects on inflation and activity.\u201d\n\nThe report noted that current global economic situation resembles the 1970s in three key aspects: persistent supply-side disturbances fueling inflation, preceded by a protracted period of highly accommodative monetary policy in major advanced economies, prospects for weakening growth, and vulnerabilities that emerging market and developing economies face with respect to the monetary policy tightening that would be needed to rein in inflation.\n\nHowever, it pointed out that the ongoing episode also differs from the 1970s in multiple dimensions: the dollar is strong, a sharp contrast with its severe weakness in the 1970s; the percentage increases in commodity prices are smaller; and the balance sheets of major financial institutions are generally strong.\n\nIt added that more important was that, unlike the 1970s, central banks in advanced economies and many developing economies now have clear mandates for price stability, and had over the past three decades, established a credible track record of achieving their inflation targets.\n\nThe report projected that global inflation was expected to moderate next year, but would likely remain above inflation targets in many economies.\n\nIt stressed that if inflation remained elevated, a repeat of the resolution of the earlier stagflation episode could translate into a sharp global downturn along with financial crises in some emerging market and developing economies.\n\nThe report also offered fresh insights on how the Russia-Ukraine war\u2019s effects on energy markets are clouding the global growth outlook.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe war in Ukraine has led to a surge in prices across a wide range of energy-related commodities. Higher energy prices will lower real incomes, raise production costs, tighten financial conditions, and constrain macroeconomic policy especially in energy-importing countries.\n\n\u201cGrowth in advanced economies is projected to sharply decelerate from 5.1 percent in 2021 to 2.6 per cent in 2022\u20141.2 percentage point below projections in January. \u201cGrowth is expected to further moderate to 2.2 percent in 2023, largely reflecting the further unwinding of the fiscal and monetary policy support provided during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cAmong emerging market and developing economies (EMDES), growth is also projected to fall from 6.6 per cent in 2021 to 3.4 percent in 2022\u2014well below the annual average of 4.8 per cent over 2011-2019.\n\n\u201cAlso, the negative spillovers from the war will more than offset any near-term boost to some commodity exporters from higher energy prices, the report said, adding that\n\nforecasts for 2022 growth have been revised down in nearly 70 per cent of EMDEs, including most commodity importing countries as well as four-fifths of low-income countries,\u201d it added.\n\nThe report highlighted the need for decisive global and national policy action to avert the worst consequences of the war in Ukraine for the global economy.

          "title": "Tinubu\u2019s Search for Running Mate Begins, Who Are the Likely Contenders?",
          "text": "Olawale Olaleye\n\n\n\nThe emergence, yesterday, of a former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), was the first and most important leg in the journey to next year\u2019s presidential bout.\n\nThat, of course, ushers in the second leg and sets a new challenge for the ruling party, which is the search for a suitable running mate, whose combination could help the party to victory in the 2023 elections.\n\nAnd, since the choice of a running mate is as critical as the candidate itself, to the outcome of a presidential election, it is expected that certain factors would be put into consideration, too, in settling for anyone at all.\n\nHowever, to guide the APC in the choice of its running mate to Tinubu are a few factors, including capacity, education, experience, exposure, political networth, ethnicity and religion. While the APC is certain to go to the north for its pick, the part of the north it chooses to pull the lucky one from is equally germane to several other considerations as much as religion, which is a chief factor in the north.\n\nIronically, Tinubu, a Muslim southerner, is surrounded majorly by more Muslim northerners than their Christian brothers. In other words, the APC ticket appears to lean more to a Muslim-Muslim pairing than a Muslim-Christian blend. Yet, none of the options is cast in stone, as it were.\n\nThus, given the importance of this choice and how it could impact the election, what are the options before the APC? There are many of them, but a few readily come to mind.\n\nThey are the Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu; Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai; Kano State Governor, Abdulahi Ganduje; Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong; Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Gida Mustapha and Malam Kashim Ibrahim-Imam.\n\nAtiku Bagudu\n\nThe Kebbi State governor is the Chairman of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum and has been in the thick of events in the party, helping to moderate situations and proffering solutions to even the most difficult situations. From the North West zone, Bagudu is a loyal ally of the president, who is urbane and well-spoken. He is also popular amongst his peers, having chaired their elite group well for some time. He is a strong contender to the office, although a Muslim like Tinubu.\n\nNasir El-Rufai\n\nControversial, but principled and outspoken governor of Kaduna State, was about the first northern governor to speak in support of power shift to south and he sustained his position to the very end. Interestingly, Kaduna is a very crucial north central state, whose votes could help put the party in good stead. With an El-rufai, another Muslim on the ticket, it could as much strengthen the place of the party and at the same time stand in its way.\n\nAbdulahi Ganduje\n\nGovernor of the North West Kano State, Ganduje, has always been in contention, indeed, advantaged by his state, which churns out very good votes, enough to determine any election. Ganduje, a Muslim, becomes more important in the equation, because aside giving some good votes, he could also help to neutralise the Kwankwasiyya influence in the state. Kwankwasiyya is a political movement led by a former governor of the state, Rabiu Kwankwaso influence, who is also contesting the presidential election on the platform of New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP).\n\nSimon Lalong\n\nA strong ally of former Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi, the Plateau State governor, could be a compensation for the Amaechi group, given their influence as evident in Amaechi\u2019s emergence as the first runner up at the election. Besides, as the Chairman, Northern APC governors, Lalong has been critical to practically all that went down before and at the convention, which culminated in Tinubu\u2019s emergence. He is, however, a Christian, which provides a good balance to the ticket, especially, coming also from North Central. But will the north accept him?\n\nBoss Mustapha\n\nSecretary to the Government of the Federation, Mustapha, is today about the most visible functionary in the presidency, working closely with the president and helping to navigate practically all the sensitive and not-so-sensitive assignments. With capacity and deep knowledge about the workings of the government of the day, particularly the presidency, no one sits better as a choice for running mate than Mustapha. What more, the cerebral and cosmopolitan Mustapha, is a Christian from Adamawa State, North East, the same place as the First Lady, Aisha Buhari, and which he has since held down for the party as a promising strong hold.\n\nKashim Ibrahim-Imam\n\nA former PDP governorship candidate in 2003 and 2007 in Borno State, Ibrahim-Imam, is a noted confidant of the APC presidential candidate, and one believed to have held different positions in trust for him, with a relationship spanning over 40 years. A devout Muslim from Boko Haram-ravaged Borno, Ibrahim-Imam, could easily reap from the quiet effort, albeit on all sides, to give the North East some sense of belonging by putting them on the presidential ticket. A retired banker, accounting and finance expert, Ibrahim-Imam is a consummate politician, former President of Kings College Old Boys Association, KCOBA, who is grounded in pension funds management. Although urbane, cosmopolitan and well liked by friends and associates, he too remains a product of Muslim-Muslim combination, which raises concerns for the ticket.\n\nBut if Tinubu is looking for someone he can trust, then of course, Kashim fits the bill.\n\nAbubakar Badaru\n\nCurrent Governor of Jigawa State, Badaru, is another force among the governors with promising political career. Urbane, reserved and sound, he has both the academic and political aptitudes for the job, seen largely by his colleagues as a thinker and worthy ally to network with. He, like Bagudu of Kebbi, has been involved in the affairs of the party at the highest level and had done so much to help stabilise it at the highest level. His joining the presidential race was not an accident, likewise his withdrawal and standing down for Tinubu, was allegedly strategic on his part. Yet another Muslim from the North West, he fits the bill, no doubt, save for the same reservation that applies to the others.\n\nBabagana Zulum\n\nThe Borno State Governor is one state chief executive, who had been marked early in the race for presidency as suitable for running mate. The debate about his choice became so debated that he issued a statement, dismissing the idea. Instead, Zulum stated he he would rather return to Borno and finish off what he started. Curiously, his name wouldn\u2019t stop popping up, because of his stellar performance in his state and also because he has also become sellable over the years. A candidate of the academia, who is neck-deep in practical politics of development, Zulum is arguably an asset to the ticket, even though he is a Muslim. He is young and seen as a breath of fresh air in the murky waters of politics.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Hostel.ng wants to connect Nigerian students to quality and affordable hostels",
          "text": "In 2016, when Davidson Okafor gained admission into the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, southeast Nigeria, he learned that the university\u2019s on-campus hostels couldn\u2019t accommodate all admitted students; rooms were already overcrowded, and the overall living conditions in and around them were bad\u2014dirty rooms, broken windows, and nasty bathrooms. Like many students, he decided to find accommodation off-campus, a search that would turn out arduous. For starters, he had to shuttle between his home Lagos and Awka, an unfamiliar environment, in his hunt for a hostel room. One time, when he found a hostel room he wanted and was about to pay the rent, he discovered the agent he was liaising with was an imposter. Another time, after he had reached an agreement with the hostel manager about payment and returned to Lagos to pick up his things, the hostel manager gave the room to another tenant who had sooner than Okafor could.\n\nAlthough, as a first-year student, Okafor had a month before lectures started, the one-month search for accommodation made him miss important orientation sessions for new students.\n\nWhen Okafor realised his unpleasant experience was shared by many other students, he started thinking of creating a solution that would make it easier for students to secure accommodation off-campus.\n\nDuring a nationwide university lecturers\u2019 strike in 2016, he enrolled at a computer training institute to improve his coding skills, and it was there he met Folaranmi Olujobi, who was lead tutor at the institute, and who would later join him, as Chief Technology Officer (CTO), to co-found Hostel.ng, an off-campus accommodation solution for students.\n\nOkafor started building Hostel.ng in 2019, with help from his co-founders, Olujobi and Tobi Otomewo, a frontend developer. Hostel.ng\u2019s website allows students to explore the available hostels in their area of choice and inspect them while the Hostel.ng team confirms the availability of the rooms and schedules an appointment with an agent on behalf of the student.\n\nFrom the Nnamdi Azikiwe University campus, where the startup has its only operations, Hostel.ng currently has 150 hostels housing about 2,000 rooms on its platform and has connected about 500 students to their dream hostels.\n\nAccommodating revenue\n\nIn search of revenue, Hostel.ng has made several iterations over the years. In 2019, after building a minimum viable product (MVP), Okafor discovered that while a lot of students were coming to their website to check out their listings, they were not paying for the listed hostels via Hostel.ng\u2019s payment portal, even though there was a button for them to do so. Instead, after these students found their choice hostel on the website, they proceed to pay directly to the hostel\u2019s manager, as they didn\u2019t feel comfortable paying to a random website they\u2019d found on the internet.\n\nHostel.ng\u2019s search for a revenue model got successful in 2021 after it made money earning a 20% service fee during the beta testing phase on its short-stay leasing feature. The short-stay leasing feature allows students to rent out their hostels to other students who are on a short visit. This will put money in the pockets of students, especially in the light of the ongoing universities strike, which began on February 14, 2022, and has left in its wake empty hostels already paid for.\n\nLater this year, Okafor said, Hostel.ng will launch a rent financing feature that would allow students to pay for hostel accommodation in instalments, spread over 6 months. By partnering with Kwaba, a rent financing startup, to ensure verification of lenders, and disbursement and collection of the credit, Hostel.ng will be making this technology available to hostel managers across the country who wish to allow their tenants pay in instalments. Okafor recalls that while he was still in the university, it was not an easy task for his parents, at the beginning of each school year, to pay his rent and that of his 2 brothers, all at once. He said that it would have been more convenient if they had to foot that bill in instalments.\n\nIn 2020, Hostel.ng joined the Lagos Innovate Idea Hub Programme, a 20-week incubator for early-stage tech businesses, organised by the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund (LSETF), which gave them much-needed exposure to the tech ecosystem. Hostel.ng also went through the TVC Labs accelerator in 2021 and, after a successful outing, landed long-time startup investor, Tomi Davies, on its advisory board. Davies mentors the team and assists with refining their ideas.\n\nLast year, Hostel.ng introduced its short-stay lease on WhatsApp by manually pairing students who wanted to lease their hostels with those in need of accommodation. It was able to successfully facilitate some bookings and get about 30 students who were ready to sublease their rooms for up to \u20a63,000 per day. During a concert that took place at the Nnamdi Azikwe University, students from different other universities came to visit, and this led to a spike in requests for Hostel.ng\u2019s short-stay lease feature. The founders couldn\u2019t meet up with over-40 requests it got, so they built out a feature that would automate the process.\n\nOkafor attributed the website\u2019s growth to organic bookings from its SEO-friendly name, as they don\u2019t have a marketing budget. He believes the launch of the short-stay lease and rent financing features will make Hostel.ng profitable. He also intends to close a pre-seed funding round for Hostel.ng before the successful launch of these features. For now, Hostel.ng is currently building a wait list for its sub-leasing and rent-financing features.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The Kenyan government has announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nEarlier this week, a proposal submitted to the Parliament included an amendment to the Excise Duty 2015 of the Finance Bill, which provides for a 20% tax on all digital loans.\n\nLike many other countries on and off the continent, Kenya\u2019s digital lending space is rapidly growing. At least 13% of Kenya\u2019s population of 53.7 million people have taken digital loans from more than 120 digital lenders operating in the country. As at April 2021, the lenders were disbursing over Ksh 2 billion ($17 million) per month in loans.\n\nThe introduction of the tax could also mean increased interest rates for users of digital loan apps like Tala, Branch, Timiza, and O-Kash, most of which already charge high-interest rates from borrowers. Branch, for example, charges a 17% monthly interest rate, while Tala charges as high as 19%.\n\nKenya leans on digital loans\n\nThe proposed tax is the latest in Kenya\u2019s moves to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nSince 2021, the Kenyan Parliament and the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) have taken active steps in curtailing the activities of digital lenders who charge predatory interest rates and engage in unethical loan recovery practices like debt-shaming.\n\nLast year, Parliament approved the Central Bank of Kenya (Amendment) Bill which bestowed the Central Bank with the power to regulate digital lenders. The approval also subjected digital lenders to the Data Protection Act, which prevents them from violating users\u2019 privacy through debt-shaming.\n\nThis March, the CBK also published the Digital Credit Providers Regulations, 2022 which requires digital lenders to obtain licenses from the CBK in order to operate in the country. The regulations also provided that lenders seeking licensing would be required to disclose and verify their sources of income. These regulations have not yet been implemented; the law will go into effect in September.\n\nThe proposed 20% tax could have unintended effects on the millions of Kenyans who use digital loan apps. Parliament will deliberate the proposal until Thursday, June 9th before taking a final decision.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Ikpe Traditional Tittles Dispute And Oba of Benin Resolutions \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nIT was wide jubilations and a carnival of sorts in Ikpe Village of Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area of Edo State as the Odionwere, Elders, women and youths of the Community in their large numbers rolled out drums in estacy to celebrate the peaceful resolution by the Benin Monarch, His Royal Majesty, Omo N\u2019Oba N\u2019Edo, Uku Akpolokpolo, Ewuare II, Oba of Benin Kingdom over age-long traditional titles dispute in Ikpe. It was so visible to the blinds and audible to the deafs as the joy of the people of Ikpe knew no bound, a suggestion that the people were actually waiting for a day like that where the eluded peace and tranquility would returned to the village. This was no doubt the case on Wednesday, April 13, 2022 as the people breathed fresh air of new life.\n\nThe people in their hundreds commended the Oba of Benin for restoring peace to the village through the resolution which bestowed the traditional leadership of the Community in the hands of the Odionwere, Elders and Okaeghele respectively. I\u2019m fact, prior to the Monarch\u2019s resolution, there have been claims and counter claims to different traditional positions in the village raging from \u201cEnogie,\u2019 \u201cOkao\u201d, and \u201cOhen\u201d as the Claimants\u2019 were using these different positions to lay clam to the traditional leadership of the people.\n\nWhile the people were waiting eagerly to see amongst these three Claimants\u2019who we become the chosen traditional leader in the village, the Odionwere, Elders and the Okaeghele were fervently praying for the right person that would bring the needed peace and development to the people to be chosen amongst the trio Claimants\u2019. This is even as it was strange to the people the three positions (Enogie, Okao and Ohen) as there has never been any of these position or title in Ikpe Village.\n\nLittle did the Odionwere, the Elders and Okaeghele know that the mantle of leadership would be bestowed on them by the Oba. This spanked up wide jubilations amongst the residents and indigenes of Ikpe Village right inside the palace of the revered Benin Monarch. The people eulogies the Oba with different appellations and sang his name to high heavens for what they described as royal resolution.\n\nLeading the rain of commendations, the Village Head, Pa. Thompson Omorotionmwan, said: \u201cI on behalf of the elders and the people of Ikpe Village thank the Oba of Benin for the peaceful resolution of the dispute in the village.\n\nThis traditional dispute has been on for a long time until recently when our great Oba resolved the dispute amicably. This is peace now in our Community and we are poised to developing the village more than before.\n\n\u201cIn fact, there has never been the position of Enogie, Ohen or Okao as we only have Odionwere, Edion and Okaeghele in Ikpe Village. This was further affirmed by the Chief Custodian of our Culture, Tradition and Heritage- Oba Ewuare II. His ruling has again saddled the Off, Edion-nene and Okaeghele with the responsibility of taken care of the village for the one which is the Oba\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on the issue of Ohen in Ikpe, the village head said a woman from Evboarue village has been the Ohen not a man as claimed by One Victor Eghenahiore Ekhoesuehi. \u201cFrom time immemorial, a woman has been the Chief Priestess (Ohen) of the village. There was never a time we have Enogie, Ohen or Okao in Ikpe and these people: Victor Eghenahiore Ekhoesuehi, Solomon Obaze and were only clamming this positions because of the development in the village\u201d. \u201cIndeed, Sold Obaze is from Ova in Ovia North-East Local Government Area of Edo State and want to forcibly become the Enogie of Ikpe, but the Oba has ended that ambition now.\n\nSpeaking with our news crew, the Okaeghele of the village, Mr. Alele Alex Ighiriaho commended the Oba for what he described as erudite and sound ruling, adding that the people of the village would continue to be grateful and loyal to the Oba who he opined has brought unprecedented peace and progress to the Benin Kingdom. We are all going to join hands with our Odionwere, Pa. Thompson Omorotionmwan, the Elders towards developing our village and our mode of chosen Odionwere is based on seniority not when one was admitted into the Elders (Edionfold) forum. Our Odionwere is the oldest man in Ikpe.\n\nMr. Alele posited that one of the beauty of Ikpe is that the people does not indulge in any act of land grabbing or any act of the Proscribed Community Development Associations (CDAs) in Ikpe. \u201cWe don\u2019t indulge in any land grabbing or CDA activities in Ikpe Village. This is why developers are happy coming to our community to acquire landed properties.\n\nSpeaking on his ordeal which led to his reminder in prison custody for over two years, Mr. Alele Alex Ighiriaho while narrating what transpired sternly denied involvement in the death of one Iyobo Ilebor and others maintaining that it his prison custody was caused by some mischief-makers in the village who where not happy with him over his stance to maintain peace in Ikpe.\n\nAccording to Alele: \u201cAfter my appointment as Okaeghele of Ikpe by the Odionwere and the elders, the people then decided that it was imperative with demarcate our boundary with Ukhiri Community and other boundary communities as we have common boundaries with Obagie, Utesil, Evbokagba and Ukhiri Villages respectively.\n\n\u201cDuring this period, we were all working togethe as one in the village including Mr. Michael Agbonlahor, the self-styled Ohen, Solomon Obaze, the self acclaimed Okao, Victor Eghenakhahiore, self cliamed Enogie, and others.\n\n\u201cOn the said day of our boundary demarcation with Ukhiri, it was my assistant, Iyobo Ilebor also known as Agada, and one Dangote were the people that led others for the demarcation as i was not around and they could not wait for me to come before they went for the boundary demarcation with Ukhiri people.\n\n\u201cMind you, the decision to know and have all our boundaries demarcated was a collectively taken by the Odionwere, elders and the people.\n\nIn fact, it was Mr. Michael Agbonlahor that supported the boundary demarcation with the sum of N300,000.\n\nwhile I was at somewhere in a neighbouring village waiting for the people that went for the boundary demarcation to return to Ikpe, information got to me that my people that went for the boundary demarcation were attacked by the poeple of Ukhiri Village.\n\n\u201cI was told that Dangote was shot while the whereabouts of Iyobo Ilebor and others were unknown. So, I left the hotel i was for Ikpe and not quite long after I arrived Ikpe, some of the peole that went for the boundary demarcation started returning back to the villge and said that they did not see Iyobo Ilebor and others as Dangote was shot as Ukhiri people attacked them during the boundary demarcation.\n\n\u201cThereafter, myself and the Okaeghele of Ukhirir were invited to Ugbekun Divisional Police Headquarters by the then DPO, one Mrs, Philo for interrogations and questioning about what happaning during the boundary demarcation exercise. It was at this stage that both elders of Ikpe and Ukhiri now decided to call for an enlarge meeting with a view to unravel what happen during the demarcation. During the meeting with both communities, it was decided that both parties should maintain peace while investigation is ongoing.\n\n\u201cBut this same Michael, the self acclaimed Ohen called and said I should join hands wit him to chase Solomon Obaze,Eghenayahiore, the self accaliamed Enogie and Okao respectivey away from the community so he, Micheal can assume the leadership position in ths village. But i told him no that I cant do what he said I should do that we are all from the same community, hence he becaame angry with me and singlehandedly appointed one Desmond Idele, a maternal relation of mine as a factional Okaeghele of Ikpe.\n\n\u201cSo, Michael and Solomon then decided to cause crisis and confusion in the community until this Wednesday when our Oba now resolved the crisis and brought peace back to our commuvity again. Again, because I refused to join Michael to chase Solomon and Eghenayahiore away from the community, they and brought out the issue of Iyobo Ilebor and accussed me of having hands in the yet to be confirmed death of Iyobo.\n\n\u201cI was arrested by the DSS on frivolious accusations and later reminded to Oko Prison. But I thank God, our ancestors and the great Benin Oba that I was vindicated, discharged and aquitted from the allegation at the hend of the day by the court. Painfully, these persons are still writing different frivolous petition still against me over the issue of Iyobo Ilebor to Alagbon,CIID, Force Headquaters, Abuja.\n\n\u201cI want to state emphatically here again to members of the public that i don\u2019t have hand in the suspected death of Iyobo Ilebor and that it was the communal crisis between Ukhiri and Ikpe that led to the disappearance of Iyobo and others yet to be seen.In fact, as at today, whether Iyobo is dead or alive I don\u2019t know. They were five persons that went missing after the attack of Ukhiri and we have not seeing them till now.\n\n\u201cBut we are hearing that one of the five missing persons has travelled abroad through land and whether Iyobo is alive or not we don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cI have being taken to court in three different occasions over the issue of Iyobo and I am the person that gave this same Iyobo a car, opened business centre for him, rented a flatfor himand als open a business shop for his wife. Someone that was working with me and I have been assistig, how will I kill such person? So, I dont have hand in whatever that happened to Iyobo Ilebor\u201d, he stated.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

That may not be enough as the country loses forests at a faster pace.\n\n\u201cProtecting the forest means protecting ourselves.

Some of these pastors manipulate your belief in them. Believe in God not your pastors!\n\nTunde Bakare is a well known manipulator. He has lied in God\u2019s Name not once or thrice. Please research these by yourself: In 1999, he claimed God told him Obasanjo would die and not be sworn in. In 2006, he claimed Buhari was part of Nigeria\u2019s decaying past.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nIn a landslide victory, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu defeated Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmed Lawan and former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, among others, to emerge presidential candidate of the governing party.\n\nTinubu scored 1, 271 to emerge winner of the APC presidential ticket.\n\nWhile Amaechi came second, VP Osinbajo and Senator Lawan came third and fourth respectively.\n\nTinubu\u2019s emergence was made easy due to the gale of withdrawals from the race by some prominent aspirants across the geo-political zones.\n\nAt the convention ground, the first to announce his withdrawal in support of the former lawmaker was former governor of Akwa Ibom state and former Minister of Niger Delta, Godswill Akpabio, followed by former governor of Ogun state, Senator Ibikunle Amosun and one of the other prominent aspirants, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti state.\n\nIt was gathered that while South-west APC leaders were able to persuade Fayemi and Amosun to step down for Tinubu, the withdrawal of Governor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa state was a major boost for Tinubu in the North.\n\nThree other aspirants who announced their withdrawal for emergence of Tinubu as APC presidential candidate include; former Speaker, House of Representatives Dimeji Bankole, Senator Ajayi Boroffice and Uju Ohanenye, the only female contestant in the race.\n\nTwenty-three (23) aspirants were cleared for the presidential primary but 9 of them withdrew from the exercise while 14 aspirants finally contested.\n\nOne of the other presidential aspirants, Felix Nicolas, however stepped down for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nThe declaration\n\nAnnouncing the results of the election, Wednesday at Eagles Square, venue of the exercise, chairman of the Election Management Committee and governor of Kebbi state, Atiku Bagudu declared \u201cformer Minister of State for Education Emeka Nwajiuba got 1 vote, Ebonyi state Governor Dave Umahi got 38 votes, Pastor Tunde Bakare got 0 vote, Ahmed Sanni Yerima got 4 votes, Rotimi Amaechi got 316 votes, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo scored 235 votes, Senator Rochas Okorocha scored 0 vote, Governor Yahaya Bello scored 47 votes, Tien Jack-rich scored 0 vote, Chief Ogbonnaya Onu scored 1 vote, Senate President Ahmed Lawan scored 152 votes, Prof. Ben Ayade scored 37 votes, Ikeobasi Mokelu scored 0 vote.\u201d\n\nWith this victory, Tinubu would be contesting the presidential election in 2023 against former Vice President Atiku Abubakar of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), former governor of Kano state Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) and Peter Obi of Labour Party (LP) among several others.\n\nAcceptance speech\n\nAddressing the gathering after he was declared winner, the APC presidential candidate said he was not expecting the victory and that it also got him intoxicated.\n\nThe excited Tinubu said: \u201cI did not expect to win and I have won and intoxicated by the victory.\n\n\u201cToday is another historic day and we thank God Almighty that we are alive to witness today. It has gone beyond the party and become a Nigerian project. We are very grateful to President Muhammadu Buhari and his supportive vice president.\n\n\u201cI also thank the Senate President. I would have been upset that you competed with me but you can easily leak your wound.\n\n\u201cTo the chairman of our party, it appeared some weeks back that some newspapers and many people are willing to write the obituary of this party. But we pulled out as a cat of nine lives. We batched the roof and steady the pillars. Shame to those already building the coffin of the APC.\n\n\u201cTo the Progressive Governors Forum, we are truly Progressive. We are confident that this nation is back on track. I didn\u2019t know what I did right that gave you the confidence to nominate me as the candidate of the party.\n\n\u201cWe will worry and eliminate the intruders in the party. No intruders, no destroyers can bring Nigeria backward. I must thank our men on uniform for sacrifices and fight for the survival of this country. You will get reward and enjoy your sweat.\n\n\u201cI salute my wife for enduring my long absence but I have told her that I chose politics ahead of Accounting because that is the best way I can make impact in repositioning the country.\u201d\n\nWhile commending other aspirants that contested against him, Tinubu said: \u201cThe competition is now over and those that did not support me have nothing to fear. I hold no grudges against you. We must work together to defeat the PDP and their retrogressive ideals.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey (PDP) left us with hunger, and we must do everything to defeat the agents of poverty, terror and lies. They are the creator of abandoned projects and they can\u2019t count. They don\u2019t even know arithmetic. They are known for their container economy.\n\n\u201cWe will dredge Calabar and make it a hub. We will fabricate engine and revive our economy to compete with other big economies of the world,\u201d he promised.\n\nGbajabiamila, Wase laud victory\n\nCommending the APC over the victory, Speaker House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila and his deputy, Idris Wase have congratulated Tinubu on his victory.\n\n\n\nIn his message through his most senior media aide, Lanre Lasisi, the speaker said he was elated that his political mentor won the APC ticket.\n\n\n\n\u201cI congratulate my mentor for this victory. This is a victory for democracy and Nigerians as a whole. With the manner he went about his campaigns, Asiwaju has proved to be a hero of our democracy.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom day one, he stood his ground that the APC must organize a free, fair and transparent presidential primary if it wanted to remain the party to beat. He advocated that and remained steadfast. This will make the party come out peaceful and victorious in the end.\n\n\n\n\u201cI commend the Asiwaju\u2019s doggedness, determination, resilience and tenacity in pursuing his ambition without indulging in any activity that would affect other aspirants and the image of the party\u201d, the speaker said.\n\n\n\nAlso in his congratulatory message, Wase in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Umar Muhammad Puma, described the process that led to the emergence Tinubu as one of the most transparent in the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cYour emergence in a transparent process is a testament to the fact that the APC is now more united and stronger and has sent a strong message about our resolve to bring about the desired national transformation needed to turn around the fortunes of our beloved country Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy this convention and all the primary elections, we have demonstrated uncommon desire to be different from the inefficiency and maladministration of the opposition PDP that have stunted our country\u2019s march towards greatness\u201d, Wase said.\n\n\n\nAtiku hails Tinubu, says victory confirms tenacity\n\nAlso, the PDP presidential flag bearer, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has described Tiinubu\u2019s victory as the manifestation of his resilience and determination.\n\nThe former Vice President, who spoke Wednesday on his verified Twitter handle, praised the energy invested by the national leader of the ruling party to win the APC presidential ticket.\n\nThe tweet read: \u201cCongratulations Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on your emergence as your party\u2019s president candidate. It has been a hard-fought contest, but that you prevailed confirms your tenacity.\u201d\n\nTinubu had also congratulated Atiku after the former Vice President emerged as the PDP flag bearer.\n\nOyetola too\n\nAlso, Osun state Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, described the emergence of the former Lagos state governor as a victory for democracy, and demonstration of his influence and acceptability, not only within the APC but across the length and breadth of the country.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday by his Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan, the governor noted that the emergence of Tinubu in the hitch-free electoral process was a clear indication that the country was on the verge of democratic rejuvenation.\n\nHe expressed confidence in the capacity and competence of Tinubu to deliver victory for the APC in the 2023 presidential election, adding that the former governor would deploy his administrative acumen to take the country to enviable heights ever known in history.\n\nOyetola said: \u201cYour emergence at the just concluded Presidential Primary of our great party is indeed a reward of your tireless efforts and selfless services to Nigeria and Nigerians and of course, humanity as a whole.\n\n\u201cYou are not just a leader of leaders but a finest politician who had used his God-given wisdom and wealth to build humanity and advance the socioeconomic fortunes of our dear country.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that your phenomenal leadership and enigmatic fortress had in no measure contributed significantly to the growth and development of Lagos State where you served as a two-term Governor and of course Nigeria as it is evident in your influence across the nooks and crannies of the country.\n\n\u201cWith your antecedents coupled with your outstanding credentials in both private and public sectors, I have no doubt in my mind that your emergence will deliver victory for our party in all elections as this will further justify the quest to elect a candidate with unimaginable qualities that cut across spheres of life.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the Osun governor thanked his colleague governors from Ekiti, Ogun, Lagos and Ondo states for their support towards the victory of Tinubu in the primary.\n\nHe also lauded leaders from the South-West, especially Chief Bisi Akande and Chief Segun Osoba for their guidance and critical interventions which he said, ensured that an aspirant from the region emerged as the presidential candidate of the APC.\n\n\u2026.Ohanaeze lampoons Tinubu\n\nIn its reaction, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide applauded Southeast aspirants in the contest for the APC presidential ticket for standing for justice and defence of Igbo, while berating Tinubu the winner, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu for opposing power shift to the region.\n\nSecretary-General Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, in a statement Wednesday said, Tinubu was chosen as the APC flag bearer in a corrupt process, adding that the former Lagos governor\u2019s emergence as APC presidential candidate \u201cis a national catastrophe and calamity, considering the enormity of the baggage he is burdened with.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a heroic outing for South-east presidential aspirants like Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, Sen. Ken Nnamani, Sen. Rochas Okorocha, Governor Dave Umahi and the boycott of Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, whose absence was heroic. APC\u2019s survival at the polls remains doubtful and the Southeast presidency denial will come with consequences and will continue to strengthen the Biafra agitation.\n\n\u201cAfter due reflections and considerations, considering the just concluded presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Ohanaeze Ndigbo is convinced that the emergence of Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the party\u2019s flag bearer is a national catastrophe and calamity.\n\n\u201cApart from his integrity issues and his long-running battle with EFCC over allegations of corruption, especially his alleged siphoning of Lagos state funds through phony companies such as Beta Sigma, long after leaving office as Governor. Again, during the 2019 Elections, bullion vans bearing raw cash were sighted in his Bourdillon, Ikoyi, Lagos residence, ostensibly for financial inducement and corruption of the electoral process.\n\n\u201cAgain, his identity, age, and academic records are shrouded in controversy. To worsen an already terrible situation, Tinubu is sick. Even during the APC primary, he needed the support of nearby security personnel so as not to fall flat while trying to stand up and his hands were shaking terribly.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo salutes Igbo presidential aspirants in both the APC and the PDP for standing firm to the end, in the face of utter betrayal by both parties. Indeed, the usually calm Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu appropriately captured the mood of Ndigbo, especially the South East when he asked a very pertinent question while speaking at the APC primary, \u201cwhere is the justice?\u201d\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo salutes the Southern and Middle Belt Alliance (SAMBA) for insisting that it is the turn of the South-East, come 2023. Elder statesmen like Afenifere leader Pa Ayo Adebanjo, Niger Delta leader, Pa Edwin Clark, former President Olusegun Obasanjo, Middle Belt leader, Dr. Bitrus Pogu, etc. for rising above ethnic sentiments to be true heroes of Nigerian democracy.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the 2023 presidential election shall make or mar Nigeria, if Nigerians fail to rise above ethno-religious sentiments to \u2018take back Nigeria\u2019 from the vicious grip of the kleptomaniac politicians,\u201d the Ohanaeze scribe said.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has lambasted the 2023 presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu insisting he is no match for its candidate, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday by its national publicity secretary, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, the party said the former Lagos state governor clinched the APC ticket at a very great price.\n\nPDP also sympathised with Tinubu for embarking on a journey to nowhere, adding \u201che is no match for PDP\u2019s more popular, more competent and more prepared Presidential Candidate, His Excellency, Atiku Abubakar the unifier and the people\u2019s choice, who defeated President Buhari fair and square in the 2019 Presidential election.\n\nThe statement partly read \u201cAsiwaju will soon realize that Nigeria is not one of his acquired estates or fiefdoms and that the Nigerian people are not his political string-puppets and retinue of lackies, from whom he bought the APC Presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju will also soon realize that Nigerians hold him responsible for his self-confessed role in installing the failed Buhari-led administration that subjugated the people, brought excruciating economic hardship, acute poverty, bloodletting, terrorism, mass killings, promoted disunity, tribalism and nepotism, lawlessness, massive treasury looting and unpardonable life-discounting experiences to our country.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed reprehensible that Asiwaju, after being handed an APC flag that refused to unfold in recognition of the gloomy times of the APC, did not demonstrate any form of remorse for the injuries he engineered and caused our nation in the last seven years.\n\n\u201cHis failure to express empathy for the victims of violence, kidnapping, mass killings and acts of terrorism, especially the recent gruesome attack in a sacred place of worship, St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo in Ondo State serves as a foretaste of the big cover up and harrowing experience that Nigerians will face, God forbid, should Asiwaju emerge as President in 2023.\n\n\u201cHis acceptance speech further exposed his manifest lack of capacity, presence of mind, resourcefulness and selflessness to manage the affairs of a nation as complex as Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFrom Asiwaju\u2019s egotistic outbursts before and after the APC manipulative National Convention, it is crystal clear that his life-long dream of clinching the APC Presidential ticket is not for the wellbeing of Nigerians but out of desperation to lay hands on the keys to the nation\u2019s treasury.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju has insulted the sensibilities of Nigerians enough and this APC National Convention will be his final political outing. This is because Nigerians have had enough and are now, more than ever before, ready and out on the platform of the PDP to defend our nation and reject Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu in 2023 Presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian politics is far more complex and beyond the Lagos politics where Asiwaju operates with brawl and deployment of violence rather than brain\u201d.\n\nPDP said what Nigerians needed \u201cnow is a unifier in the face of the pain and discomfort inflicted by APC.\n\nThe party also charged Nigerians to continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with its presidential candidate.\n\nGovs meet on Atiku\u2019s running mate\n\nMeanwhile, ahead of next year\u2019s election, Sokoto state Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal has disclosed that the issue of running mate was part of the governors\u2019 discussion with the party\u2019s presidential candidate, former Vice President Abubakar.\n\nThe Waziri Adamawa had Wednesday held a closed door meeting with the PDP governors in Abuja.\n\nBlueprint gathered that the meeting mostly centered on the issue of running mate for Atiku.\n\nBriefing journalists shortly after the meeting, Governor Tambuwal, who also doubles as chairman of PDP Governors\u2019 Forum, revealed that the governors were being consulted on running mate option.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn behalf of my colleagues, the governors, let me commend the leadership of the party and members of our party for a very successful national convention.\n\n\u201cThe National Chairman along with the candidate came to thank the governors for their roles at the convention.\n\n\u201cWe talked about cooperation and collaboration in prosecuting a very successful electioneering campaign that will result into victories for the PDP at various elections from the state house of assembly, national election, governorship and the presidential election come February, 2023.\n\n\u201cIt is more of a consultative meeting on matters concerning the way forward.\u201d\n\nAsked if the issue of running mate came up at the meeting, Tambuwal said, \u201cit is part of the consultation, it\u2019s ongoing and governors are also being consulted on that.\u201d\n\nAt the meeting were the PDP national chairman, Sen. Iyorchia Ayu; Governors Nyesom Wike of Rivers, Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta, Samuel Ortom of Benue, Udom Emmanuel of Akwa-Ibom, Bala Mohammed of Bauchi and Seyi Makinde of Oyo States.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

This was followed by Other Investment with 29.28 per cent (US$460.59 million) and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) accounted for 9.85 per cent ($154.97 million) of total capital imported in Q1 2022.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, Dr Abdulrazaq Garba, has said that there has been an influx of investors because of the quality of geoscience data the agency had generated.\n\nGarba made this known yesterday during an interactive session with newsmen in the agency\u2019s headquarters in Abuja.\n\nHe stated that it was only the right type of data that could attract appropriate investors noting that the the agency has improved from generating surface maps.\n\n\u201cBefore what we do is surface maps but we have improved, we also achieved this using the appropriate tools to produce geodata. We have published the first set of data on geochronology recently, which has to do with ages of minerals,\u201d he said.\n\nExplaining capacity development of the NGSA, the Director General pointed out that the agency was the bridge between the academia and the industry.\n\nHe also said that sustainability was the key to driving the mining sector into greater heights as he solicited for more funding to ensure continued growth and development of the economy.\n\nHe further stated that the success stories of the Nigeria Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, could be seen in the increased revenue generation of sister agency such as The Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, MCO, and Mines Inspectorate.\n\nSpeaking on the NIMEP Project, he said that it was a means to an end adding that there was no end to data generation as Nigeria was still at the upstream where data generation is very important.\n\nHe explained that the project was a success story as it has been able to produce Three Hundred and Thirty Three (333) maps albums presenting the 36 States and resources found in them.\n\n\u201cWhat we had when I came on board was the Interactive maps, currently we have produced Lithostructural maps that has Tetonic information about Nigeria,\u201d he added\n\nHe said Nigeria has high grade hard rock lithium mineral where pockets of occurrences has been discovered stating that its lithium occurrences were of grade and that investors were currently eager to pay large amount for some of the dataset generated\n\nNigerian Pilot reports that lithium is an element valuable for the production of glass, aluminum products, batteries that recharge mobile phones, laptops, digital cameras and electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cNigeria lithium is hot cake now, the mineral was discovered in several parts of the country in the course of the National Integrated Mineral Exploration Project, NIMEP, during exploration and we did investigation and came up with analysis and discovered that Nigeria lithium is of high grade.\n\n\u201cHigh grade in the sense that the standard worldwide for even exploration and mining starts from 0.4 per cent lithium oxide but when we started exploration and mining, we saw one per cent up to 13 per cent lithium oxide content.\n\n\u201cAnother advantage of Nigeria lithium is hard rock lithium found and that is what investors are looking out for worldwide.\n\n\u201cWe even heard discussion with some private companies with mining licences in Nigeria and they conducted test on the lithium and we also collaborated with Canada on that too,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that all data received from NIMEP were quite exciting and would boost the economy.\n\nNIMEP is a hallmark project that provides reliable geo-sciences information needed by investors to make the right mining investment decisions in Nigeria.\n\nHe said that a track of mineralisation almost two to 10 km was discovered close to Abuja, adding that resource evaluation was conducted on the area and anomolous gold, lead and silver were discovered with Tungsten.\n\n\u201cGold mineralisation found there has high content of tungsten which is used as an additive in the production of steel, therefore, any company mining there will be mining gold associated with lead, silver and tungsten.\n\nGarba said that many companies both local and international investors are interested in the data set generated.\n\nHe said that pronouncement would be made soon on companies that had shown interest on those data saying that \u201cwhat we want to do is we are projecting to we concession the areas that are free through the Nigeria Mining Cadastre Office, NMCO, so interested investors can get licence and data and take it to the next level.\n\n\u201cThese are the things we are looking at and working on to ensure that the data we generate are useful to investors.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile in his presentation at the just concluded Nigeria- Africa Natural Resources and Energy Investment Summit, NAFNIS, the NGSA boss disclosed that government had identified seven strategic minerals based on the information available on them.\n\n\u201cThe seven minerals are Coal, Iron Ore, Bitumen, Gold, Limestone, Lead/Zinc and Barite,\u201d he listed.\n\nGarba said that the government had invested funds in generating Geoscience data for those minerals to enable investors have adequate knowledge about them.\n\n\u201cBasically, you will agree with me that the business of mining is not meant for government to do investigation on minerals, but in this our particular climate, we need to take this information up to a particular level whereby the minerals will be attractive to investors.\n\nThe NGSA has over a hundred years been the sole generator and validator of geo data and geological information.",

What I put out during my address on the broadcast to the State was wrong and we must accept it.\n\n\u201cThe figure I have now shows that 127 persons were involved and that the number of death now is 40. On admission receiving treatment, we have 61. Twenty-six have been discharged. Those are the figures we have now from the Commissioner for Health. So, the government is not hiding anything.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Owo Church Attack: Police Recover Three Unexploded IEDs\n\nAccording to the Ondo leader, the new figure followed the harmonization of reports from the various hospitals including the private ones, urging people to disregard earlier figures.\n\nThis is as he maintained that there are no right words to describe the attack but assured his government is making plans for the burial of the victims.\n\n\u201cThat is why one is moved. We will have a Memorial Park here where those who died in the attack will be buried. My Bishop sir, we will find a good place as a Memorial Park,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\u201cIt will also be my suggestion that even if there are people who have retrieved their family or members of their family, we must still have a symbolic grave there for them. And it will be there forever, it is not something we can forget and we should never forget it.\u201d\n\nHe also disclosed that the government is accepting donations from individuals and groups who want to help the families of the victims. Governor Akeredolu explained that the move became important following a series of calls from several quarters.\n\nAkeredolu said an account has been set up for such donations and assured that all monies received will be used judiciously.",

Godswill Akpabio; Dr. Kayode Fayemi; and Barr.(Mrs.) Uju Kennedy] who chose to step down their personal ambitions for the good of the party and the unity of our purpose.\n\nThe competition is now over.\n\nThose who did not support me, you have nothing to fear. I hold no grudges or grievances.\n\nLet us each agree to join hands in defeating the PDP and beating back our common foes of poverty, terror and violence. We now have a date with destiny in February 2023. Let us win so Nigeria can become the nation it is intended to be.\n\nTo my campaign team and close advisors. Your dedication, long hours, and sound advice have brought me to this point.\n\nI thank my beautiful wife, Oluremi, for her patience and wise counsel. Thank you for standing by my side. I am indeed a fortunate man.\n\nNow, permit me to address the nation.\n\nYes, we face serious problems. But I believe that we have it within us to reach our finest destiny. With help from God, we shall make this nation better for the generations to come.\n\nPresident Muhamamdu Buhari has already laid a solid foundation in security, economy, and anti-corruption. We will build upon this for the salvation of our people.\n\nSo, I ask you:\n\nDo we dare reform our national economy such that prosperity grows as poverty vanishes?\n\nYes, we dare.\n\nDo we dare provide meaningful education and jobs for our youths so that they may strive for a better future?\n\nYes, we dare. Our teeming youth population is our nation\u2019s greatest asset. We will create jobs for our youth from the Zamfara and Osun gold deposits to the vast agricultural lands across the country. We will create new ooportunities in the FINTECH sector, the creative and entertainment industries, digital skills and other areas.\n\nDo we dare feed our nation and provide the farmer a solid income for his toil?\n\nYes, we dare.\n\nDo we dare construct a society where the vulnerable, the weak, the disadvantaged and the elderly are attended to and loved?\n\nYes, for we must care for those who cannot care for themselves.\n\nDo we dare muster our collective strength to conquer terrorism, kidnapping, and violent evil of any form?\n\nYes, we dare.\n\nAfter the PDP convention, I commended Abubakar Atiku. The ensuing contest between our party and his will be one of competing visions.\n\nOur vision is of progress and the future that can be. We must defeat the PDP\u2019s reactionary ideals.\n\nOur better, more progressive vision of Nigeria shall secure a better society for all Nigerians.\n\nMay this be our task arising from this convention. Let nothing stand in the way of our achieving a more just society and a greater Nigeria.https://www.tvcnews.tv/2022/06/ganduje-congratulates-asiwaju-as-apc-flagbearer-commends-other-aspirants-for-sportsmanship/\n\nGod bless the APC.\n\nGod bless Nigeria.",

          "text": "A student who survived the Uvalde school shooting by covering herself in a classmate\u2019s blood has told the US Congress of the moment her teacher was killed during the massacre.\n\nHer graphic testimony left some representatives in tears.\n\n\u201cHe told her goodnight, and shot her in the head,\u201d Miah Cerillo, 11, said.\n\nThe Texas primary school shooting claimed the lives of 21 people, including 19 young children, and has renewed the US debate over gun laws.\n\nPast efforts to advance national gun-control regulations have often stalled.\n\nMiah\u2019s pre-recorded testimony before the congressional panel was part of a number of emotional appeals for Congress to act on gun violence.\n\nThe 11-year-old recalled her experience, which for her began when a teacher told students to hide after seeing the gunman.\n\nThe 18-year-old attacker shot her teacher as children took cover behind her desk and their book bags.\n\nMiah was wounded by fragments in her shoulders and head. She pretended to be dead before using her teacher\u2019s phone to call 911 and ask for police.\n\n\u201cI thought he was going to come back to the room, so I grabbed the [her classmate\u2019s] blood and put it all over me,\u201d she said. \u201cI just stayed quiet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it to happen again,\u201d she said.\n\nMiah\u2019s father, Miguel Cerrillo, said his daughter is traumatised.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not the same little girl I used to play with,\u201d he said tearfully. \u201cSchools are not safe anymore. Something really needs to change.\u201d\n\nLawmakers also heard from the parents of Lexi Rubio, one of the students killed in the Uvalde shooting.\n\n\u201cSomewhere out there, a mom is hearing our testimony and thinking to herself, \u2018I can\u2019t imagine the pain\u2019,\u201d Kimberly Mata-Rubio said. \u201cOur reality will one day be hers, unless we act now.\u201d\n\nUvalde paediatrician Dr Roy Guerrero also spoke to the committee to describe the fatal injuries he witnessed.\n\n\u201cTwo children, whose bodies had been pulverised by bullets fired at them, decapitated, whose flesh had been ripped apart. That the only clue as to their identities were the blood-spattered cartoon clothes still clinging to them,\u201d he recalled.\n\nHe added that lawmakers are like \u201cdoctors and our country is the patient\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are lying on the operating table, riddled with bullets like the children of Robb Elementary and so many other schools,\u201d he told lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWe are bleeding out, and you are not there.\u201d\n\nThe testimonies came on the same day that the Department of Justice announced it would review the much-criticised police response to the shooting.\n\nIn Uvalde, the parents of two of Lexi\u2019s schoolmates \u2013 Annabell Rodriguez and Xavier Lopez \u2013 said on Wednesday the two would be buried next to each other at a local cemetery. The 10-year-olds had become sweethearts and were photographed together outside Robb Elementary just hours before the shooting.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, the House of Representatives voted largely along party lines to raise the minimum age to buy semi-automatic rifles from 18 to 21 and ban high-capacity ammunition magazines.\n\nBut the proposal is unlikely to pass the divided Senate.\n\nOnly a handful of the 50 Republican senators appear open to new gun legislation, with Democrats seeking narrower measures as a compromise. Senators are expected to reach a final agreement by the end of the week.\n\nProposals with the greatest public support include a \u201cred flag\u201d law that would prevent individuals with mental illness or a criminal history from purchasing firearms, and expanded background checks on gun purchasers that would include private gun sales.\n\nRepublicans in the hearing argued that better school security \u2013 not gun control \u2013 was the answer.\n\nGeorgia Congressman and gun store owner Andrew Clyde said his military service taught him that \u201cthe harder the target you are, the less likely you will be engaged by the enemy\u201d. He also called for the creation of \u201ca volunteer force of well-trained and armed staff\u201d to assist the armed officers already stationed in schools.\n\nSpeaking at a rally in Washington DC, Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, a gun control advocacy organisation, told the BBC that the testimony of survivors and widespread public calls for change can be a \u201cpowerful\u201d call to action.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s focus on the issue,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a national shooting tragedy, we finally see more people in America decide they are going to get off the sidelines.\u201d\n\nBBC",

The people didn\u2019t get to hear what this man represents in society and that\u2019s what we need to understand,\u201d she said on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHe deserves the maximum penalty possible,\u201d said Ms Martin, who accuses Garc\u00eda of abusing her over the course of 17 years.\n\nBut Attorney General Rob Bonta said Friday\u2019s conviction sent \u201ca clear message that sexual exploitation is never acceptable in California\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs the leader of La Luz del Mundo, Naas\u00f3n Joaqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda used his power to take advantage of children. He relied on those around him to groom congregants for the purposes of sexual assault. Today\u2019s conviction can never undo the harm, but it will help protect future generations,\u201d a statement by Mr Bonta said.\n\nThe two followers who were arrested with him in 2019 have also pleaded guilty.\n\nSusana Medina Oaxaca, 27, admitted assault likely to cause great bodily injury. She had been Garc\u00eda\u2019s assistant before their arrest.\n\nThe other, Alondra Ocampo, had already pleaded guilty in 2020 to four counts involving the sexual abuse of minors. She had been expected to testify against Garc\u00eda.\n\nHis church has not yet reacted to the guilty plea. In May, it published a statement on its Instagram account saying that its members \u201ctrusted that the moment would come in which the innocence and honour of the Apostle of Jesus Christ #Naas\u00f3nJoaqu\u00ednGarc\u00eda would be proven\u201d.",

          "text": "Without disregard for other political parties and their candidates, the 2023 presidential election is going to be a straight fight between former Lagos Governor Bola Tinubu of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nThis followed their emergence as the standard bearers of their respective parties two weeks apart.\n\nA total number of 2,322 were initially scheduled to vote for the presidential candidate of the APC, but 2,032 were accredited and voted for the aspirants.\n\nThe ruling party had 23 presidential aspirants, while nine aspirants stepped down for their choice co-contestants, some withdrew from the race before the commencement of the primary election.\n\nThose that stepped down for Tinubu were the immediate past Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio; former Governor of Ogun state, Senator Ibikunle Amosun; Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Dimeji Bankole; Governor of Jigawa State, Abubakar Badaru; senator representing Ondo North Senatorial District, Prof. Ajayi Boroffice and Uju Ohanenye.\n\nBut the youngest presidential aspirant, Nicolas Felix, stepped down for the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nIn all, however, 14 presidential aspirants contested the presidential primary election of the APC.\n\nAt the end of the voting exercise, the Co-chair of the Election Management Committee, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, declared Tinubu as the winner of the election.\n\nTinubu scored a total of 1,271 votes to defeat his closest rival, former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, who scored 316 votes, while Osinbajo scored 235 votes. Senator Rochas Okorocha scored zero votes; Governor Yahaya Bello scored 47 votes, and Mr. Tein Jack-Rich scored zero votes.\n\nAlso, a former Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, scored one vote; Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, scored 152 votes; Cross Rivers State Governor, Prof Ben Ayade, scored 37 votes; Chief Ikobasi Mokelu had zero vote; former Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajuiba scored one vote; Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, scored 38 votes; Pastor Tunde Bakare, scored zero vote, while Sani Yerima, scored four votes. A total of 13 votes were voided.\n\nThe presidential candidate, however, told the Senate President, Lawan, that he was a little upset that he competed against him, but added that he could easily lick his wound now.\n\nThis was as prominent Nigerians, including Osinbajo, National Chairman of APC, Abdulahi Adamu; Atiku, Afenifere and governors of the party, among others, had started congratulating the former Lagos governor.\n\nHowever, the leadership of the PDP has mocked Tinubu and his party, saying the person the APC settled for was no match for their candidate, Atiku.\n\nDelivering his speech, Tinubu described the victory as historic and also thanked God for being able to witness it, even as he promised to build an unbreakable team that would move Nigeria forward.\n\nTinubu said: \u201cToday is another historic day and it is thanks to God almighty that you are living healthy to witness it, to be part of it, to be your calling, to be your arrangement. We all, not only as a party, it has gone beyond partisan idea now.\n\n\u201cIt is yours as the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. You put it together and you have even been gracious and humble from the beginning. We are very grateful to you.\n\n\u201cThe vice-president, a very good and supportive pillar, a good assistant to the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, we thank you for this steady and good support to our president.\n\n\u201cTo you, the legislature, the Senate President, Senator Ahmad Lawan, I would have been a little upset, because you competed with me, but that is over now since you can easily lick your wounds. It doesn\u2019t take away from thanking you from the past cooperation and cool-headedness to build our country.\n\n\u201cYou have helped in steering the ship of the nation and with your colleagues in the Senate, history is written and will be kind to you.\n\n\u201cAnd to my brother, Hakeem Gbajabiamila, the sparkling speaker, I credit you. The Gbajabiamilas of Lagos have been part of the history of this country and you will not be forgotten.\n\n\u201cTo the chairman of our party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, it appeared some weeks back that some newspapers and many people were ready to write the obituary of this party. We put together and pulled ourselves as a cat with nine lives. We thatched the roof, steady the pillars and became master builders. You came on and worked hard with the collaboration of others and here we are.\n\n\u201cShame on those who were already building the coffin of APC. Shame on them. Our party is alive. They said we won\u2019t be able to do the convention, but here we are.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe will tell Poverty Development Party, they call themselves PDP, 16 years of failures of wastefulness. We say step aside, be buried and leave the way for us. We will repair our country. We are progressives, we are nation builders. We are not destroyers. We are confident that this nation is back on track.\u201d\n\nTinubu, who also spoke about the growing wave of killings in the country, said, \u201cWe are not the barbaric, blind human beings they think we are. They are setting us against one another. When you were born, you didn\u2019t hear from the womb whether you would be a male or female, Christian or Muslim. You were born to your parents and adopted their religions and you continued.\n\n\u201cThe Bible taught us to love your neighbour as you love yourself. It did not say kill your neighbour. It is in the two holy books. Goodness for goodness. Learn to accept mistakes, not from gunshots or the destruction of lives and property, because the life you take you cannot bring back, the hate you spill cannot cure your hunger. We must build a new society and learn to think a new way of life.\u201d\n\nHe commended the delegates for the confidence they reposed in him, saying he would prove that their choice was a wise one, adding that they had moved the party and country towards its best future.\n\n\u201cI commend my fellow aspirants. It is a difficult thing to run for president. The stiff and bold competition you offered made our party stronger and made me better. I must say a special word of thanks to the seven aspirants: Badaru Abubakar, Ibikunle Amosun, Ajayi Borrofice, Dimeji Bankole, Godswill Akpabio, Kayode Fayemi, and Uju Kennedy, who chose to step down their personal ambitions for the good of the party and the unity of our purpose,\u201d he said.\n\nThe presidential candidate said now that the competition was now over, he bore no grudges or grievances to those who did not support him, saying, \u201chave nothing to fear.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cLet us each agree to join hands in defeating the PDP and beating back our common foes of poverty, terror and violence. We now have a date with destiny in February 2023. Let us win so Nigeria can become the nation it is intended to be.\n\n\u201cNow, permit me to address the nation. Yes, we face serious problems. But I believe that we have it within us to reach our finest destiny. With help from God, we shall make this nation better for the generations to come.\u201d\n\nBuhari Congratulates Tinubu, Assures Him of Unwavering Support\n\nThe president, in a statement by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, described the former Lagos State governor as the right candidate for Nigeria\u2019s aspiration to move to greater heights.\n\nHe was also quick to ask the leadership and members of the APC to unite behind Tinubu who he said would safeguard and improve on the current democratic achievement and legacy.\n\nThe statement added: \u201cHaving emerged victorious he has our full and unwavering support.\n\n\u201cNow our party must unite behind our candidate to achieve victory at the 2023 elections so that our government will continue to secure our communities, grow our economy and continue the fight against corruption.\n\n\u201cDuring the primaries, there were factions and disagreements amongst the contestants and now that the process has ended we must build a united front in our party.\n\n\u201cIn this way, the APC will remain the party that can best deliver on the priorities of the Nigerian people. Now it is time to put the process behind us.\n\n\u201cBecause what we can all agree is that the APC remains the party that can best deliver on the priorities of the Nigerian people. But the way to demonstrate that we can get on with this job is to unite.\n\n\u201cThe movement we created in 2013 is beyond individuals. Together, we made history by becoming the first party in our country\u2019s history to unseat a party in power and propel our candidate into the Presidency through a peaceful democratic transfer of power.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that Bola Ahmed Tinubu will safeguard and improve on this democratic achievement and legacy. He is the right candidate for Nigeria\u2019s aspiration because he is the APC\u2019s candidate and under the continued stewardship of our party. Nigeria can achieve greatness and fulfill its destiny in Africa and the world.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo Campaign Organisation Congratulate Tinubu\n\nThe Spokesman of Prof Yemi Osinbajo Campaign Organisation, Mr. Richard Akinnola, has congratulated Tinubu.\n\nAkinnola in his Facebook page, congratulated Tinubu saying there must be a winner in any contest\n\n\u201cCongratulations, Asiwaju Tinubu, the presumed winner of the primaries. In any contest, there must be a winner. However, I\u2019m very proud of my choice of support in the person of Prof. Yemi Osinbajo.\n\n\u201cI have no iota of regret over my support for him. It was a privilege to play a pivotal role for him during the process. I would gladly do it over and over again. It\u2019s a matter of conviction.\n\n\u201cAnd for all our supporters and other volunteers who worked assiduously, day and night on the PYO project, God bless you all. I\u2019m so proud of all of you.\n\n\u201cAs l often say, God rules in the affairs of men and He has a purpose for what just happened.\n\n\u201cUnderstandably, many of you are dispirited and downcast but do not let your heart be troubled. There must be a reason God allowed this. It may not be manifest to us now but later as He is all knowing.\u201d\n\nAdamu Eats Humble Pie, Congratulates Tinubu\n\nThe National Chairman of the APC, Senator Abdulahi Adamu has congratulated Tinubu.\n\nAdamu recently vowed to punish Tinubu for disrespecting Buhari.\n\nBut in a congratulatory letter dated June 08, 2022, he said Tinubu\u2019s victory vindicated the ruling party\u2019s nationalistic outlook and patriotic posture.\n\nHe said: \u201cI present to Your Excellency, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, my compliments and those of the members of the National Working Committee of the All Progressives Congress, in the best of traditions.\n\n\u201cI write on behalf of the entire membership of the All Progressives Congress to congratulate Your Excellency on the sterling victory that you recorded at the just concluded Special National Convention to emerge as the Presidential Candidate of our great Party.\n\n\u201cYour victory has vindicated our party\u2019s nationalistic outlook and patriotic posture as the Party of choice for every Nigerian. I am pleased that the party spoke with one voice when the delegates voted overwhelmingly to nominate you as our presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nTinubu Has Capacity to Lead Nigeria, Says Fayemi\n\nFayemi, has congratulated Tinubu over his emergence as APC presidential candidate.\n\nFayemi also congratulated the party leadership and the convention planning committee for the successful conduct of the special convention and presidential primary, as well as President Muhammadu Buhari for superintending over a free, fair, and credible process as national leader of the party. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Yinka Oyebode, Fayemi said Tinubu\u2019s emergence represented the collective wish of the vast majority of members of the APC, adding that the former Lagos State Governor had proven his dedication and competence to lead the country at such an important time in history.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is a great moment for our party. I congratulate Asiwaju Tinubu for the well deserved victory and the leadership of the party as well as the convention committee members for a great job.\n\n\u201cCollectively, we shall move from this convention venue with greater determination to strengthen the party and work assiduously for the success of the party in the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nLawan, Omo-Agege Congratulate Tinubu\n\nLawan and the Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege have congratulated Tinubu on his election as presidential standard bearer of the APC.\n\nLawan, who ran against Tinubu in the presidential primary, in a congratulatory letter personally signed by him, said the emergence of Tinubu reassured his party of winning the 2023 presidential poll.\n\nAccording to him, the outcome of the election process had shown that Tinubu was the popular choice of his party.\n\n\u201cI am elated and proud that the Presidential primary was manifestly free and fair, and conducted within our APC Family under a most convivial atmosphere.\n\n\u201cThe success of the event again demonstrates the capacity of our great party to run its internal affairs smoothly and devoid of rancor,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his part, Senator Omo-Agege, the standard bearer of APC in the 2023 governorship election in Delta State, expressed optimism that Tinubu would emerge victorious in next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nHe particularly lauded Buhari and the governing APC for giving all aspirants a level-playing field.\n\nIn a statement by his campaign Director, Communications and Media Strategy, Ima Niboro, Omo-Agege, commended the 2022 APC Special Convention Committee for successfully conducting the primary, even as he showered glowing tributes on APC Northern Governors for setting the pace by zoning the Presidency to the South.\n\nWhile calling on Tinubu to be magnanimous in victory, Omo-Agege stressed the need for all presidential aspirants to join hands with the APC Presidential candidate and the party in ensuring victory.\n\n\u201cNot everyone gave APC a chance to conduct a free, fair, credible presidential primary. With the undercurrents in the buildup, some had predicted that our great party would go into extinction after this convention.\n\n\u201cBut with the transparent process that saw the emergence of Asiwaju Tinubu as our party standard bearer, I am confident more than ever before that this is the beginning of even greater tidings for our party,\u201d he said.\n\nGbajabiamila, Wase Congratulate Tinubu\n\nGbajabiamila and his Deputy Ahmed Wase have also congratulated Tinubu.\n\nThe Speaker in his statement said he was elated that his political mentor won the APC ticket, saying that it was a well-deserved one considering Tinubu\u2019s years of working for the entrenchment and strengthening of democracy in Nigeria.\n\nWhile describing Tinubu as a dogged fighter who stood his ground to compete in the presidential primary in a democratic manner, he said with the victory, APC has a good chance of retaining power in 2023,\n\nHe equally urged other aspirants at the just concluded primary to join hands and support the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cI commend the Asiwaju\u2019s doggedness, determination, resilience and tenacity in pursuing his ambition without indulging in any activity that would affect other aspirants and the image of the party.\n\n\u201cThis is a victory for APC, a victory for its members and indeed a victory for Nigeria and its democracy,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his part, Wase described the process that led to the emergence of Tinubu as one of the most transparent in the country.\n\nThe Deputy Speaker expressed optimism that the outcome of the primaries would be one that would inspire hope, harness the potential and lead to prosperity.\n\nHe said, \u201cYour emergence in a transparent process is a testament to the fact that the APC is now more united and stronger and has sent a strong message about our resolve to bring about the desired national transformation needed to turn around the fortunes of our beloved country Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAtiku Congratulates Tinubu\n\nLike Tinubu did when he emerged as the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku yesterday congratulated the APC presidential candidate.\n\nIn his verified Twitter handle. Atiku wrote: \u201cCongratulations, @officialABAT, on your emergence as your party\u2019s presidential candidate. It has been a hard-fought contest, but that you prevailed confirms your tenacity.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu Congratulates Tinubu, Lauds Buhari, APC Leaders\n\nThe Chairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ondo State, Mr. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has hailed the outcome of the special convention for presidential primary of the APC.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu, particularly lauded the emergence of Tinubu as the standard bearer of the party for the 2023 general election.\n\nIn a statement yesterday by his Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, the governor said: \u201cI congratulate our great party on the conduct of a successful primary election. I am particularly happy that our party displayed total commitment to the ethos of democracy and embraced the path of fairness and equity.\n\n\u201cThe contest was a brotherly scramble. The aspirants, and leaders of our great party must now leverage on our political strength to build the party and reposition it for even greater victory.\u201d\n\nAbiodun Hails Tinubu\u2019s Emergence as Presidential Candidate\n\nOgun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has congratulated Ahmed Tinubu, on clinching the presidential ticket of the party.\n\nAbiodun, in a statement, issued by him in Abeokuta, said the emergence of Tinubu was a good omen for the party and the country as a whole.\n\nAccording to him, the victory showed that Tinubu was widely beloved and accepted within the country\u2019s entire political spectrum and showed his level of deep interactions and acceptance not only within the ruling APC but across Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis victory indicates that Tinubu as a candidate is good for Nigeria, as it will foster unity, love and understanding amongst Nigerians.\n\n\u201cHis electoral victory cut across all the six geopolitical zones; he had an impact in all the zones. He is the candidate to beat in the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nGanduje Congratulates Tinubu, Hails Buhari\n\nAlso, Kano State Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has congratulated Tinubu over his victory at the APC presidential primary election.\n\nIn a congratulatory message he personally signed and made available to THISDAY in Kano, he said the emergence of Tinubu as standard bearer would be a victory for the Nigeria project.\n\nHe said Tinubu has the capacity to provide the needed leadership that would consolidate and continue to ensure the country\u2019s democratic gains.\n\nGanduje commended Buhari for providing the enabling environment that produced the standard flagbearer, the National Working Committee, the delegates and all other organ and structure of the party across the federation for the collective efforts in ensuring the success of the convention.\n\nThe governor also hailed other aspirants for their remarkable sportsmanship which they displayed throughout the painstaking consultation period up to the convention and particularly Osinbajo, who submitted themselves to transparent democratic exercise.\n\nAmosun Salutes Tinubu\n\nFormer Governor of Ogun State and Senator representing Ogun Central in the Senate, Senator Ibikunle Amosun has congratulated winner of the presidential primaries of the APC.\n\nIn a statement released in Abuja, Amosun described Tinubu as a tested democrat who would bring his experience to bear on the governance of the country.\n\nHe expressed the conviction that with his (Tinubu) sterling record as governor of Lagos State, he was convinced that he would offer a leadership that would not only consolidate democracy gains in the country but that which would also offer better life to Nigerians.\n\nAmaechi Congratulates Tinubu\n\nThe Amaechi Presidential Media has congratulated Ahmed Tinubu on his victory and emergence as the presidential candidate of the Party.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge that his victory follows a highly charged contest, which as expected, could only produce one winner.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, our hope that following the emergence of Bola Ahmed Tinubu as our party\u2019s presidential candidate, all aspirants will now close ranks and work hard to ensure our party\u2019s victory at the 2023 presidential election,\u201d a statement by its chairman, Kingsley Wenenda Wali added.\n\nAfenifere: Picking Southerner as Presidential Candidate is Delightful\n\nThe pan Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, yesterday said the choice of a southerner as the presidential candidate of the APC was delightful.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of the group, Jare Ajayi, in a statement issued in Ibadan, said it was a known fact that the Southern and Middle Belt Leadership Forum, of which Afenifere is a key member had been in the forefront of those advocating that power must shift to the Southern part of Nigeria come 2023.\n\nHe said for power to move to the south there must be southern candidate or candidates, noting that, that was why the forum was strident in its calls on the political parties to field southern candidates in the forthcoming presidential election.\n\nHe maintained that by electing Tinubu to fly its flag, the APC met the minimum condition of fielding a southern candidate.\n\nHe however added that a return to true federalism through the restructuring of the country had been an article of faith for the group for a long time.\n\nTinubu, a Dogged Fighter, Says Daniel\n\nA former Governor of Ogun State and Senatorial Candidate of the APC in the Ogun East Senatorial District, Mr. Gbenga Daniel has described Tinubu as a dogged fighter who knows his onions and would go to lengths to achieving his strategic objectives.\n\nDaniel stated this in his congratulatory message to the APC standard bearer.\n\nHe said \u201cThe Bola Tinubu that I know is a strategic thinker, a great planner and a well organised personality, which are the attributes that have worked for him not only in politics but also in his business and social relationships.\n\n\u201cIn the last two decades Bola Tinubu\u2019s political trajectory has shown that the the sky may be the starting point for him, and this he has clearly demonstrated with the energy he puts behind his campaign and the eventual victory as the Presidential candidate of the All Progressive Congress which has proven Bookmakers wrong in all ramifications.\u201d",
          "summary": "Tinubu scored a total of 1,271 votes to defeat his closest rival, former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, who scored 316 votes, while Osinbajo scored 235 votes.\nThe presidential candidate, however, told the Senate President, Lawan, that he was a little upset that he competed against him, but added that he could easily lick his wound now.\n\u201cThis is a victory for APC, a victory for its members and indeed a victory for Nigeria and its democracy,\u201d he added.\nAmaechi Congratulates TinubuThe Amaechi Presidential Media has congratulated Ahmed Tinubu on his victory and emergence as the presidential candidate of the Party.\nAfenifere: Picking Southerner as Presidential Candidate is DelightfulThe pan Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, yesterday said the choice of a southerner as the presidential candidate of the APC was delightful.",

          "title": "Nigeria: How North Kept It\u2019s Word, Pulled Off a Coup During APC Presidential Contest",
          "text": "The tension that characterised the lead up to the APC presidential primary and the eventual denouement, have made it difficult to gloss over certain takeaways from the event.\n\nFor starters, nothing was certain till the time the show started proper and the fluidity of events ushering in the exercise, had created apprehension across the board with everyone on tenterhooks. This was understandable since APC is the ruling party.\n\nThus, while the fear that the north was not ready to relinquish power was palpable and creating avoidable backlash, the seeming unpredictability of President Muhammadu Buhari, had further compounded the situation, as much as the perceived hypocrisy of the APC National Chairman, Abdulahi Adamu, became a worry to contend with.\n\nBut the north proved it was credible after all, and closed the deal on its honour. This, ironically, was contrary to assumptions about alleged northern predilection for ethnic politics within the context of national growth and development.\n\nIn 1993, when the late MKO Abiola, ran against a prominent northern son, Bashir Tofa, the north recognised the contributions of Abiola to their growth as a people and that of the nation in general and promised to go with him. They did not disappoint Abiola and voted for him en mass. They kept to their words.\n\nSadly, the military junta of President Ibrahim Babangida stopped Hope \u201993, Abiola\u2019s dream, a development that created chaos in the country for about five years. But, when the opportunity to make up came, the north did and conceded to south what they thought was south\u2019s.\n\nA few years after, there was a situation in the country, when a sitting president, Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, died in office. But before he died, his long period of sickness had crated power vacuum, which almost set the country on fire. Again, although with constitutional compulsion, the north cooperated and supported Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s deputy, Goodluck Jonathan to step in.\n\nIn the election that followed in 2011, when they thought their turn in power had been unduly cut short and insisted another northerner must run to replace Yar\u2019Adua, they later shared the understanding of some prominent Nigerians, pandering to the mood of the nation and allowed Jonathan, a minority from Ijaw, in South-south zone, to run and he did win with staggering votes.\n\nThe apparent logjam at the Tuesday APC presidential primary was again, about north and south as well as their right and turn in power. The south insisted there was an understanding that power would come to it after President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s eight years, when they consummated the merger in 2013.\n\nYet, there were fears that the north was reluctant to letting go. This heightened tension, and compounded the road to reconciliation until the north showed up with its dignity intact by taking a position that supported the idea that power must shift back to the south.\n\nTherefore, contrary to what might have become a widely held belief that the north is rigid, when it comes to politics and largely ethnicised considerations, instances such as these are sincere reminder that such postulations are unfounded, but concocted about the north to suit certain narrow narratives.",

          "title": "Tinubu\u2019s Search for VP Candidate Begins; See the Likely Contenders",
          "text": "The emergence, on Wednesday, of a former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), was the first and most important leg in the journey to next year\u2019s presidential bout.\n\nThat, of course, ushers in the second leg and sets a new challenge for the ruling party, which is the search for a suitable running mate, whose combination could help the party to victory in the 2023 elections.\n\nAnd, since the choice of a running mate is as critical as the candidate itself, to the outcome of a presidential election, it is expected that certain factors would be put into consideration, too, in settling for anyone at all.\n\nHowever, to guide the APC in the choice of its running mate to Tinubu are a few factors, including capacity, education, experience, exposure, political networth, ethnicity and religion. While the APC is certain to go to the north for its pick, the part of the north it chooses to pull the lucky one from is equally germane to several other considerations as much as religion, which is a chief factor in the north.\n\nIronically, Tinubu, a Muslim southerner, is surrounded majorly by more Muslim northerners than their Christian brothers. In other words, the APC ticket appears to lean more to a Muslim-Muslim pairing than a Muslim-Christian blend. Yet, none of the options is cast in stone, as it were.\n\nThus, given the importance of this choice and how it could impact the election, what are the options before the APC? There are many of them, but a few readily come to mind.\n\nThey are the Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu; Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai; Kano State Governor, Abdulahi Ganduje; Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong; Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Gida Mustapha and Malam Kashim Ibrahim-Imam.\n\nAtiku Bagudu\n\nThe Kebbi State governor is the Chairman of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum and has been in the thick of events in the party, helping to moderate situations and proffering solutions to even the most difficult situations. From the North West zone, Bagudu is a loyal ally of the president, who is urbane and well-spoken. He is also popular amongst his peers, having chaired their elite group well for some time. He is a strong contender to the office, although a Muslim like Tinubu.\n\nNasir El-Rufai\n\nControversial, but principled and outspoken governor of Kaduna State, was about the first northern governor to speak in support of power shift to south and he sustained his position to the very end. Interestingly, Kaduna is a very crucial north central state, whose votes could help put the party in good stead. With an El-rufai, another Muslim on the ticket, it could as much strengthen the place of the party and at the same time stand in its way.\n\nAbdulahi Ganduje\n\nGovernor of the North West Kano State, Ganduje, has always been in contention, indeed, advantaged by his state, which churns out very good votes, enough to determine any election. Ganduje, a Muslim, becomes more important in the equation, because aside giving some good votes, he could also help to neutralise the Kwankwasiyya influence in the state. Kwankwasiyya is a political movement led by a former governor of the state, Rabiu Kwankwaso influence, who is also contesting the presidential election on the platform of New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP).\n\nSimon Lalong\n\nA strong ally of former Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi, the Plateau State governor, could be a compensation for the Amaechi group, given their influence as evident in Amaechi\u2019s emergence as the first runner up at the election. Besides, as the Chairman, Northern APC governors, Lalong has been critical to practically all that went down before and at the convention, which culminated in Tinubu\u2019s emergence. He is, however, a Christian, which provides a good balance to the ticket, especially, coming also from North Central. But will the north accept him?\n\nBoss Mustapha\n\nSecretary to the Government of the Federation, Mustapha, is today about the most visible functionary in the presidency, working closely with the president and helping to navigate practically all the sensitive and not-so-sensitive assignments. With capacity and deep knowledge about the workings of the government of the day, particularly the presidency, no one sits better as a choice for running mate than Mustapha. What more, the cerebral and cosmopolitan Mustapha, is a Christian from Adamawa State, North East, the same place as the First Lady, Aisha Buhari, and which he has since held down for the party as a promising strong hold.\n\nKashim Ibrahim-Imam\n\nA former PDP governorship candidate in 2003 and 2007 in Borno State, Ibrahim-Imam, is a noted confidant of the APC presidential candidate, and one believed to have held different positions in trust for him, with a relationship spanning over 40 years. A devout Muslim from Boko Haram-ravaged Borno, Ibrahim-Imam, could easily reap from the quiet effort, albeit on all sides, to give the North East some sense of belonging by putting them on the presidential ticket. A retired banker, accounting and finance expert, Ibrahim-Imam is a consummate politician, former President of Kings College Old Boys Association, KCOBA, who is grounded in pension funds management. Although urbane, cosmopolitan and well liked by friends and associates, he too remains a product of Muslim-Muslim combination, which raises concerns for the ticket.\n\nBut if Tinubu is looking for someone he can trust, then of course, Kashim fits the bill.\n\nAbubakar Badaru\n\nCurrent Governor of Jigawa State, Badaru, is another force among the governors with promising political career. Urbane, reserved and sound, he has both the academic and political aptitudes for the job, seen largely by his colleagues as a thinker and worthy ally to network with. He, like Bagudu of Kebbi, has been involved in the affairs of the party at the highest level and had done so much to help stabilise it at the highest level. His joining the presidential race was not an accident, likewise his withdrawal and standing down for Tinubu, was allegedly strategic on his part. Yet another Muslim from the North West, he fits the bill, no doubt, save for the same reservation that applies to the others.\n\nBabagana Zulum\n\nThe Borno State Governor is one state chief executive, who had been marked early in the race for presidency as suitable for running mate. The debate about his choice became so debated that he issued a statement, dismissing the idea. Instead, Zulum stated he he would rather return to Borno and finish off what he started. Curiously, his name wouldn\u2019t stop popping up, because of his stellar performance in his state and also because he has also become sellable over the years. A candidate of the academia, who is neck-deep in practical politics of development, Zulum is arguably an asset to the ticket, even though he is a Muslim. He is young and seen as a breath of fresh air in the murky waters of politics.",
