          "text": "Suspected terrorists in the early hours of Saturday have attacked the house of the Plateau State Commissioner for Environment, Usman Bamaiyi, located in the Gindiri community, Mangu Local Government Area of the state.\n\nSources said that Bamaiyi, who is also seeking to represent the people of Mangu/Bokkos federal constituency at the National Assembly in 2023, was not around when the gunmen stormed his house at about 2am.\n\nHowever, it was gathered that during the attack, the gunmen in large numbers broke into his apartment and abducted his wife and daughter.\n\nA resident of Gindiri who confirmed the attack to The PUNCH in Jos said, \u201cSome heavily armed men came to Gindiri last night around 2am. They went straight to the house of the State Commissioner for Environment. The sound of gunshots fired by the gunmen was too much. When they eventually left, we discovered that they took the commissioner\u2019s wife away alongside his daughter.\u201d\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer in the State, Ubah Ogaba, also confirmed the abduction of the commissioner\u2019s wife and daughter.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhen we got the information around 2:30 am, we quickly mobilised our tactical team to the area. At the moment our men are working to rescue the victims and arrest the perpetrators.\u201d\n\nSome gunmen had in December last year abducted the paramount ruler of Gindiri, His Royal Highness Charles Mato, after they attacked his palace.\n\nThe monarch was, however, released by his abductors after they allegedly demanded and collected a ransom.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

When I say congratulations to you, I also say commiserations. You have offered to serve Anambra, and you must provide service.\n\n\u201cThe challenges are enormous, and that is why you have also offered to serve.

If I were you, I will like to write down how will I like to be remembered after serving as commissioner.\u201d\n\nSoludo also apologized ahead of time to the commissioners and other appointees, saying he will be very demanding, and would task them hugely for result.\n\nHe also told the commissioners that they were selected because they were fit for their office, and their appointments are away from the normal procedure of sending names to the legislature for screening, after which ministries are apportioned.\n\n\u201cAs your chief servant, I have to tell you that I will be very demanding. I have to apologise ahead of time because I will be very demanding and once we fix a meeting for nine, you must all be seated before nine, and that is the culture we want to maintain.\n\n\u201cThe Soludo solution which was our slogan during campaign is not just a promise, but you must all work to make it a reality, to create and build that livable Anambra State which we promised.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that you went to your screening knowing fully which ministry you are going to head.\n\n\u201cIn the past, you go for screening without knowing which ministry you will lead, and later, they start thinking of which ministry to send you to, whether to send you to lucrative ministry or to send you to another.

          "text": "As Nigeria\u2019s political parties announce the dates of their primaries for the 2023 general elections, the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has fingered some presidential aspirants who must be avoided by delegates of their political parties.\n\nMURIC laid particular emphasis on Governors Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti and his predecessor, Ayodele Fayose.\n\nIt claimed that Wike would demolish mosques, while Fayemi and Fayose would marginalize Muslims in the country.\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement made available to journalists on Saturday by the director and founder of the human rights organisation, Professor Ishaq Akintola.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cWe have it on good authority that some Muslim-haters and persecutors of innocent and law abiding Muslims are among those who have indicated their intention to vie for the highest office in the land. They have every right to contest or show interest, but Nigerian Muslims reserve the right to reject those who have demonstrated pathological hatred towards them while in power.\n\n\u201cOur targeted audience for this press release are the organisers and delegates of the coming primaries for the 2023 general elections for state assemblies, gubernatorial, house of representatives, senate and presidential elections in all political parties in Nigeria. They are advised to avoid presenting candidates who have had face-off with Muslims under them while in power.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be generous with examples so that leaders of these political parties, the organisers of their primaries as well as their delegates will know that they have been warned. Our caveat is non-partisan. Our only interest is to avoid the molestation of Muslims by well-known Muslim haters and to protect their Allah-given fundamental human rights from repeated abuse.\n\n\u201cWike is a wicked market as far as Muslims are concerned. They will not touch him with a long pole. Or was it not Nyesome Wike who, contrary to Section 10 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, repeatedly declared Rivers State a Christian State? He said and we quote, \u201cRivers State is a Christian State and I have no apologies for saying that\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was on 23rd June 2019. In spite of the outcry against the illegal, unlawful, illegitimate and unconstitutional declaration, he repeated it again on 18th November 2019. With reckless impunity, Wike defied all decorum, all protocol, all norms. No responsible political party will consider such a man for the post of president.\n\n\u201cWike did not stop at mere declaration of Rivers State as a Christian State. He actually showed Nigerian Muslims that he is numero uno Muslim hater when he dispatched bulldozers, thugs and mobile policemen to demolish the Trans Amadi Central Mosque on Tuesday, 20th August, 2019. This was a mosque that had an approved survey plan (AI/RV2009/D13) and an approved building plan (RTP/09/617). Both were approved by the state government in 2009 (before Wike became governor).\n\n\u201cWike is a wicked market. He has no electoral value except in the deployment of Weapons of Mosque Destruction (WMD). Make him the president of Nigeria in May 2023 and all mosques in the country will be in ruins by December, 2023. Wike does not give stomach advice. He is pugnacious, irrational, erratic and highly unpredictable. Make no mistake about it, Wike is an irredeemable electoral liability.\n\n\u201cDitto for Ayodele Fayose and Kayode Fayemi. These are Christian political leaders who are notorious for marginalising Muslims and persecuting them. Fayose ran an all-Christian administration with no single Muslim in his 14-member cabinet, all 12 permanent secretaries, all eight board chairmen except the Muslim pilgrims\u2019 board where he had no choice.\u201d",

          "text": "Following reports that the Governor Samuel Ortom Committee had recommended that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) should not zone the presidency in 2023, the presidential gladiators in the party have shifted lobby to the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) and the Board of Trustees (BoT).\n\nThe two bodies are the highest organs of the party, and whatever they decide on the issue of zoning is final.\n\nThe organs are likely to meet any moment from now to consider the report of the Ortom committee.\n\nSources told The Nation that the three camps that have emerged among the presidential aspirants are piling pressure on members of the NEC and BOT to decide in their favour.\n\nWhile the pro-consensus advocates comprising ex-Senate President Bukola Saraki, Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed, Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal and Alhaji Mohammed Hayatuden are asking that the consensus option should be recommended to avoid friction, the pro-open contest promoters symbolised by former Vice President Atiku Abubakar want the recommendation of the Ortom committee affirmed.\n\nThe third group led by Wike and many other Southern governors of the party are lobbying the two organs to zone the presidency to the South since the North has produced the national chairman in the person of Dr. Iyorchia Ayu from Benue State.\n\n\u201cThe aspirants and their field men are in Abuja reaching out to anybody that matters in the PDP on this issue,\u201d a source told our reporter last night.\n\n\u201cThe arguments of the campaigners range from the need to present a marketable candidate that can lead the party to victory to avoid another four years in political wilderness, to the need for fairness, equity, justice and inclusiveness. It\u2019s going to be a tough one for the party,\u201d the source said.\n\nAtiku, who has not been a party to the several meetings called by the pro-consensus forces over the last few weeks, is understood to have made up his mind to test his popularity at the PDP presidential primary election next month.\n\nAn Atiku ally and governorship aspirant in one of the South West states said the camp of the former vice president would back him all the way in the agitation for the party to conduct a primary election to pick its presidential flag bearer.\n\n\u201cWe are undeterred. We have resolved to wait for the party\u2019s decision,\u201d the source said.\n\nEmerging from one of the recent meetings by Saraki, Tambuwal and Bala Mohammed in Bauchi, the former governor of Kwara State said the three of them had resolved to pick a consensus aspirant among them.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe came here and had a meeting for about two hours. All the three of us that have shown interest in leading this country, our concern is for the hardship our people are going through, the high cost of living and also looking ahead towards 2023.\n\n\u201cIn doing so, we met and discussed that with 2023 ahead of us and in trying to rescue this country, the unity, stability and growth of the country are more important than individual ambitions.\n\n\u201cWe believe that if the three of us are working together honestly, committed and with a lot of zeal for this country, there will be great hope for this country going forward.\u201d\n\nWhile emphasising that the three of them could not do the work alone because of its enormity, Saraki said it was for that reason that they had decided to carry all stakeholders in the party along.\n\n\u201cTo do that, we must also carry along key stakeholders of the party,\u201d he said.\n\nA close ally of Atiku said associates of the ex-vice president had warned him to beware of the consensus arrangement.\n\nHis words: \u201cAs politicians, we are wary of the arrangement and the motives behind it. Yes, we have had to discuss the development and our position is that it is not something we will want our principal to be a part of.\n\n\u201cHave you seen us talk about it anywhere? No. I am not even supposed to talk about it with you. This is because Atiku will not be party to any plan to exclude anyone from the presidential race. Moreover, all serious aspirants have already obtained the nomination form.\n\n\u201cEfforts have been made to drag us into the discussion about consensus candidate from the north and we have not hidden the fact that we would rather contest in an open race.\n\n\u201cWe must not do anything that will further fragment the party with the confusion occasioned by the zoning arguments. If the talk is about consensus generally and not northern consensus, maybe.\u201d\n\nNo fewer than three meetings have been held by the pro-consensus aspirants in the north to discuss the possibility and modality of producing a consensus northern candidate.\n\nIt was also gathered that some northern PDP governors who are not interested in the presidential race have been drafted into the consensus plot to convince Atiku and other aspirants to be part of the arrangement.\n\n\u201cBut not much has been achieved by the governors too. Aside the people who mooted the idea, other presidential aspirants from the north are not comfortable with the arrangement,\u201d a party source claimed.\n\nPerhaps to defray the fears of some of the aspirants, especially Atiku, Saraki had said the consensus move was not designed to exclude Atiku or any other aspirant from the race.\n\nHe said: \u201cThose making such insinuations are mischievous people who never see any good out of anything. We are not shutting anybody out. As we said, we are going to see him (Atiku).\n\n\u201cWe are going to see other aspirants. There are other aspirants in the party. This is not about shutting anybody out. It is about uniting everybody with the interests of this country. And you will see when we begin to move around. But we are not limited to anybody.\u2019\u2019\n\nSpeaking on the zoning debate within the PDP, allies of the former Vice President said they are waiting for the party to make specific statement on the issue.\n\n\u201dWe are waiting for the party. We are acting based on directives by the party. Our principal obtained the form because the party made it possible for all aspirants to do that.\n\n\u201cSo, we are not against any zone of the country. Atiku wants to be the President of the whole of Nigeria and not just a northern or southern President,\u201d a source told our correspondent on Thursday.",

I do not support the idea of everybody carrying arms. And if you check the situation we are in now, it is so bad that we should do whatever we can to control arms carrying and to ensure that we do not allow it to escalate.\n\n\u201cWe need to do all we can to ensure that we minimize the circulation of firearms in this country. We should restrict this to people who are supposed to carry arms, people who are trained to use them, and people who have license to use them. If you make it for the use of everyone, it will worsen the situation.\n\n\u201cWe need intelligence to guide our operations and officers. That is why we are having drones to assist in our intelligence. We also need the support of the general public. We are improving in our intelligence. This development is of serious concern to us and every Nigerian. People are just counting the civilian casualties, they are not counting the casualties that are coming out from security agencies which are usually also enormous.\n\n\u201cBy the time you kill one or two policemen, you do not know how many morals you have dampened. It is very important we try to ensure that we protect the lives of our men who are on duty at several locations across the country. It is only the police that are everywhere in this country. They are in every village in this country and that is why we are having casualties everywhere.\n\n\u201cWe are showing the highest level of concern to ensure that these things are brought to the barest minimum and this we are doing through the improvement of operation equipment. If you are well kitted and you are well armed you will stand a better chance of surviving any attack.\u201d",

          "title": "APC, PDP: Pertinent lessons from Awo",
          "text": "WHATEVER may be their shortcomings and failings, the two dominant parties, All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), are impressive political constructs that took considerable organizational effort to actualize. Rather than seek to discard them, every effort should be continuously made to strengthen their organizational structures, improve their internal democratic processes, deepen their philosophical and ideological underpinnings as well as sharpen their efficacy, first and foremost, as developmental agencies. Parties compete to win electoral victories and form governments primarily to implement policies within the framework of their manifestoes designed, presumably, to steer their societies on the path of ever increasing progress and development. Transcending her current abysmal underdevelopment is Nigeria\u2019s greatest need of the hour. The country\u2019s current existentially-threatening challenges with power supply, a dysfunctional petroleum sector, huge infrastructure deficit, insecurity, humongous corruption, mass unemployment, collapsed social services, de-industrialization, pervasive poverty etc are manifestations of underdevelopment.\n\nBoth the APC and PDP, in their combined 23 years in power at the centre since 1999, have no doubt recorded a number of achievements in diverse sectors if we are to be intellectually honest. Overall, however, democracy in this dispensation has not been the handmaiden of development it was envisaged to be as most Nigerians are far worse off today than they were before 1999. Ours is a case of severe regression in diverse sectors rather than progress. If we are to begin to realize Nigeria\u2019s immense but still latent potentials, the two dominant parties must be reorganized, refocused and repositioned to produce and guide governments elected on their platforms to chart a concrete, accelerated developmental course for the country. This is, of course, in addition to the urgent need for a third nationwide party structure capable of competing effectively against the dominant parties and keeping them on their toes. But this cannot be achieved through idle talk and grandstanding or sterile social media activism but can only be the product of hard, back breaking work to organize people and build structures across the country the way the APC and PDP did.\n\nIf the APC and PDP are to be positively transformed in this way to become potent instruments of development, they have a lot of pertinent lessons to learn from Chief Obafemi Awolowo, who was a consummate party organizer, a fact largely responsible for his still unrivaled transformational performance as Premier of Western Nigeria in the First Republic. His parties, the Action Group (AG) in the First Republic and Unity Partycof Nigeria (UPN) in the Second Republic, provided the ideological and philosophical framework to guide those elected on its platform as well as detailed policy plans to be implemented by its governments. Both the AG and UPN had very strong intellectual orientation, support and backing. The then University of Ife, now Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), was the intellectual bedrock of both parties. Awolowo was not only a sound and rigorous mind himself, he respected intellect and incorporated sound scholars of a progressive orientation in the running of his political parties and the formulation of party and governmental policies.\n\nIn an interview with the late academic philosopher, Professor Akin Makinde, on Saturday, 4th April, 1987, Awolowo said of Professor Sam Aluko, his close confidant and adviser: \u201cThe professor is a very good friend of mine and I have a great respect for him as an economist and a great intellectual, just as I respect philosophers like you. My respect for intellectuals lies in their ability to see things differently and objectively, and comprehend salient details, apart from their research capability. That is why I always have a romance with the intellectuals\u201d.\n\nAccording to Professor Sam Aluko himself in his contribution to a collection of essays in commemoration of the Obafemi Awolowo Centennial, \u201cIt was the need to articulate the four cardinal programmes of the Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) that brought the supporters in the universities into closer relationship with Chief Awolowo. He commissioned us to write the party platform on each of the four cardinal programmes which were to be implemented at all levels of government to be controlled by the party. I was the chairman of the programmes committee of the University of Ife\u201d. Professor Aluko noted further that \u201cThe ease with which Awo related to us from the universities and the respect that he had for intellect was amply demonstrated during the Action Group era but also much more during the era of the UPN in 1979-1983. Those of us from the universities, who were members of the National Executive Committee of the party, were the envy of many of the other leaders of the party, because Chief Awolowo would not close a debate on any major policy issue of the party unless and until he had obtained an input from us, and, in many cases, he almost always leaned towards our views\u201d.\n\nIntellectuals, men of knowledge, ideas and superior insight, not the President or governors, must be the bedrock particularly of a viable, progressive political party. An accomplished scholar himself, Dr Iyorchia Ayu as National Chairman of the PDP is well placed to help deepen the intellectual depth and orientation of the party if contrary political forces allow him to. The new National Chairman of the APC, Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu, says his focus is to carry out the \u201cmarching orders\u201d given him by President Muhammadu Buhari to lead the party to victory in the 2023 elections. This is incredible. Why does Adamu need \u201cmarching orders\u201d from anybody to do anything? I suppose the APC is a political party, a democratic entity, and not a military garrison.\n\nAgain, Chief Awolowo was not obsessed with numbers as the PDP and APC seem fixated on. In its 16 years in power, the PDP boastfully proclaimed itself as the largest party in Africa. And Yobe State governor, Mallam Mala Buni, reckons as one of the achievements of the defunct caretaker committee under his leadership, the increase in the APC membership to 41 million. But what does presumed large party membership mean in concrete terms? What really distinguishes either APC or PDP members either from each other or from non-party carrying members of the populace in terms of philosophical outlook, ideological orientation or moral values? Indeed, how are we sure that a number of people are not card carrying members of both parties so that they can brandish either party card for private benefit as the opportunity may arise?\n\nAt the inception of the AG in 1950, Awolowo relates in his autobiography, he was disappointed that less than ten persons attended initial meetings to which he had always invited between 60 and 100 persons. In his words, \u201cAs a result of the very poor responses, I had a feeling that our people were not ready for the new organization. In the circumstances, I saw no point in continuing with it. I made my feeling known to the meeting and said that it would be advisable to wind up the Action Group. Mr E. A. Babalola, who attended the meeting for the first time, supported by Chief Sowole and Mr Ajasin, opposed my suggestion. They argued that it did not need a large number of people to get a great movement started. In fact, the fewer men the better for the smooth functioning of such a movement. All the other seven members concurred in this view and I had no alternative but to agree that we should carry on\u201d. It is not the size of party membership but the quality that matters. Qualitative membership will drive qualitative and productive governance, which will in turn enhance a party\u2019s electoral acceptability.\n\nBeyond competing in elections simply for the purpose of winning power, Awolowo was more concerned about developing detailed, well researched policies to be religiously implemented by governments elected on the party\u2019s platform. According to him, \u201cIn the regional elections of 1951, the Action Group was the only party that published policy papers as well as a manifesto. Dr Azikiwe himself condemned this innovation, and regarded it as an attempt on our part wantonly to deceive the voters. He was confidently of the opinion that policy papers were unnecessary and should never be published for the purpose of elections. It was when a party had won an election, he argued, that it should essay to declare and publish the details of the policy it would pursue in office\u201d.\n\nAwolowo continued, \u201cAt every election since 1952, we had adopted the same method of publishing both policy papers and manifesto. Our persistent efforts yielded dividend only during the federal elections of December 1959, when both the NCNC and the NPC for the first time emulated the Action Group and published their own policy papers alongside their manifestoes. As a result, the last federal elections smacked much less of personal abuse and gutter electioneering tactics than was the case in previous years. Each political party strove more than ever before to win votes on the basis of the relative merits of its policies and programmes\u201d.\n\nIn his enthralling biography, \u2018Memoirs of a Public Man\u2019, the Commissioner for transportation in Alhaji Lateef Jakande\u2019s administration in the Second Republic, the late Oba Olatunji Hamzat, recalls that before he was formally sworn into office, he had held extensive consultations with experts in transport geography at the University of Lagos to come up with a policy plan for his ministry. On the day he was sworn in, however, the governor handed over to him a detailed policy plan on transportation prepared by the party to be implemented by his ministry. It was the same for every other ministry and not just in Lagos but also every other state controlled by the UPN. Is it any wonder then that the UPN governors performed superlatively in that dispensation even within the context of a suffocating emergent unitarism and relative resource scarcity?",

          "text": "By Eric Ikhilae, Abuja, Chris Njoku, Owerri, Emma Elekwa, Onitsha and Sunny Nwankwo, Umuahia\n\nReduces charges to seven from 15\n\nSit-at-home protest grounds Imo, Abia, Ebonyi\n\nGunmen attack soldiers in Abia; shoot 30 cows in Anambra\n\nSeparatist group threatens to expose those behind S/East killings\n\nSocial and economic activities were yesterday paralysed in much of Imo, Abia and Ebonyi states as residents complied with the sit-at-home order of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in solidarity with its leader, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nKanu\u2019s trial for terrorism related charges resumed yesterday in Abuja with Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court striking out eight of the 15 count charge preferred against the IPOB leader by the federal government.\n\nThe court also cleared the Federal Government of allegation of forcibly abducting Kanu from Kenya to stand trial at home.\n\nIt is expected to rule on bail for the accused on May 18 while commencement of his trial was fixed for May 26.\n\nA few hours before yesterday\u2019s sitting of the court, gunmen ambushed and attacked an army patrol team in the commercial city of Aba, Abia State.\n\nAnother gang invaded Igboukwu Market in Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State, turning their guns on cows and goats. About 30 of the animals were killed.\n\nMarkets, shops, schools, banks and filling stations in the three states were shut and the roads deserted. Local government secretariats and motor parks were not exempted from the shutdown.\n\nWorkers on essential duties had to walk long distances to go to their offices.\n\nThe few okada riders who summoned the courage to operate hiked their fares.\n\nArmed police personnel were deployed at public buildings.\n\nCourt to proceed with seven count charge against Kanu\n\nJustice Binta Nyako, ruling yesterday on Kanu\u2019s preliminary objection to his trial, held that the order proscribing IPOB subsisted despite an appeal against the proscription order.\n\n\u201cThis issue is still on appeal. The order proscribing the organisation is still subsisting until it is vacated,\u201d she said.\n\nA former Chief Judge of the court, Justice Adamu Kafarati (now late) had in a September 2017 ruling granted an ex-parte application by the Federal Government declaring IPOB an unlawful organisation.\n\nJustice Kafarati, in another ruling in January 2018, rejected an application by IPOB seeking the vacation of the proscription order.\n\nBesides, Justice Nyako yesterday faulted claim by lawyer to Kanu, Mike Ozekhome (SAN) that the IPOB leader was unlawfully brought in from Kenya.\n\nOzekhome had argued that Kanu was abducted and forcefully brought to Nigeria in violation of known human rights provisions.\n\nSimilar argument formed the subject of a N50billion suit filed for Kanu on Thursday by Ozekhome before the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nNyako said Kanu remained a fugitive on the strength of the bench warrant against him.\n\nShe added: \u201cRendition for the purpose of criminal investigation is allowed. In the instant case, there is a bench warrant on the defendant. Suffice it to say he is a fugitive before the court.\n\nThe judge further held that contrary to the argument of the defence, her court was clothed with the requisite jurisdiction to try Kanu for the offence he allegedly committed outside the court.\n\nShe struck out eight of the 15 count charges preferred against Kanu because, as she said, the dropped counts did not disclose any offence against Kanu.\n\nShe said: \u201cIn this instant preliminary objection application, I have read the counts and come to the conclusion that counts 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 14 have not disclosed any offence against the defendant.\n\n\u201cCounts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 15 show some allegations which the defendant has to answer.\n\n\u201cThe court shall proceed to try the defendant on those counts.\u201d\n\nThe full charges against him now are as follows:\n\nCOUNT ONE \u201cThat you Nnamdi Kanu, Male, Adult, of Afaraukwu Ibeku, Umuahia North Local Government Area of Abia State, sometimes in 2021, being a member and the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, a proscribed organisation, did commit an act in furtherance of an act of terrorism against the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the People of Nigeria by making a broadcast received and heard in Nigeria within the jurisdiction of this honourable Court, with intent to intimidate the population, and you threatened that people will die, the whole world will stand still and you thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 1(2)(b) of the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act, 2013.\n\nCOUNT TWO \u201cThat you Nnamdi Kanu, Male, Adult, of Afaraukwu Ibeku, Umuahia North Local Government Area of Abia State, sometimes in 2021 did commit an act in furtherance of an act of terrorism against the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the People of Nigeria made a broadcast received and heard in Nigeria within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, with intent to intimidate the population, you issued a deadly threat that anyone who flouted your sit-at-home order should \u201cwrite his/her Will\u201d as a result, banks, schools, markets, shopping malls, fuel stations domiciled in the Eastern states of Nigeria were not opened for businesses, citizens and vehicular movements in the Eastern states of Nigeria were grounded within the jurisdiction of this honourable court and you thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 1(2)(b) of the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act. 2013.\n\nCOUNT THREE \u201cThat you Nnamdi Kanu, Male, Adult, of Afaraukwu Ibeku, Umuahia North Local Government Area of Abia State on diverse dates between 2018 and 2021 within the jurisdiction of this honourable court professed yourself to be a member and leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, a proscribed organisation in Nigeria and that you thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 16 of the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act 2013.\n\nCOUNT FOUR \u201cThat you Nnamdi Kanu, Male, Adult, of Afaraukwu Ibeku, Umuahia North Local Government Area of Abia State on diverse dates between 2018 and 2021, made a broadcast received and heard in Nigeria within the jurisdiction of this court, in furtherance of an act of terrorism against the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the people of Nigeria in which you incite members of the public in Nigeria to hunt and kill Nigerian security personnel and that you thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 1 (2) (h) of the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act, 2013.\n\nCOUNT FIVE \u201cThat you Nnamdi Kanu, male, adult, of Afaraukwu Ibeku, Umuahia North Local Government Area of Abia State on diverse dates between 2018 and 2021, made a broadcast received and heard in Nigeria within the jurisdiction of this court, in furtherance of an act of terrorism against the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the people of Nigeria in which you incite members of the public in Nigeria to hunt and kill families of Nigerian security personnel and that you thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 1 (2) (h) of the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act, 2013.\n\nCOUNT EIGHT That you Nnamdi Kanu, male, adult, of Afaraukwu Ibeku, Umuahia North Local Government Area of Abia State on diverse dates between 2018 and 2021, made a broadcast received and heard in Nigeria within the jurisdiction of this court, in furtherance of an act of terrorism against the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the People of Nigeria in which you directed members of the Indigenous People of Biafra IPOB, a proscribed organisation to manufacture bombs and you thereby committed an offence punishable under section 1 (2) (f) of the terrorism (Prevention) (Amendment) Act 2013.\n\nCOUNT FIFTEEN \u201cThat you Nnamdi Kanu, male, adult, of Afaraukwu Ibeku, Umuahia North Local Government Area of Abia State on diverse dates between the month of March and April 2015, imported into Nigeria and kept in Ubulisiuzor in Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State within the jurisdiction of this court, a radio transmitter known as Tram 50L concealed in a container of used household items which you declared as used household items, and you thereby committed an offence contrary to section 47 (2) (a) of Criminal Code Act, Cap, C45 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004.\n\nThe judge then entertained argument on the bail application filed by Kanu\u2019s lawyer, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), who prayed the court to admit his client to bail and release him to his custody.\n\nBut prosecuting lawyer, Magaji Labaran, objected, saying that the IPOB leader had violated the terms of an earlier bail granted him.\n\nLabaran said: \u201cMy lord granted him bail in 2017 on health ground, but since then till date, no medical record was submitted to the court until he jumped bail.\n\n\u201cWhat we should be saying is contempt of court because he has flagrantly violated the orders of the court.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that the court should be guided by its discretion, particularly the circumstances of the case.\n\nLabaran added that in the alternative, the court should order accelerated hearing in the case so that the defendant could know his fate one way or the other.\n\nJustice Nyako adjourned till May 18 for ruling on bail and May 26 for commencement of trial.\n\nGunmen ambush, attack soldiers in Abia\n\nEarlier in the day, yet to be identified gunmen waylaid and attacked an army patrol team in the commercial city of Aba, Abia State.\n\nThe incident occurred at the popular Tonimas junction on the Enugu-Aba-Port Harcourt Expressway.\n\nThe patrol vehicles were burnt to ashes by the gunmen.\n\nIt was not immediately known whether anyone died during the clash which a military source said occurred at about 3am.\n\nSpokesman of the 14 Brigade Headquarters, Ohafia, Omale Innocent, said that he was yet to be briefed on the incident.\n\nHowever, a source within the 14 Brigade Army Headquarters who craved anonymity confirmed the incident.\n\nAccording to the source, no soldier died in the gun duel.\n\nThe source added that contrary to reports that the gunmen carted away the arms of the soldiers, no soldier lost his weapon.\n\n30 cows, goats killed as gunmen invade Anambra market\n\nAnother gang stormed the Igboukwu cattle market in Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State on Thursday night, shooting no fewer than 30 cows and goats dead.\n\nThe gunmen had earlier burnt down the Aguata Local Government Secretariat and vehicles at Ekwulobia. Aguata is Governor Chukwuma Soludo\u2019s LGA of origin.\n\nA source at the market said the animals belonged to an Igbo man.\n\nConfirming the incident, Police spokesperson, Tochukwu Ikenga described it as cruelty to animal.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat happened was that some elements, while riding on motorbikes yesterday evening and shooting sporadically into the air, got to the cattle market, and while shooting, some cattle were shot too.\n\n\u201cWe have extended our surveillance to that area and our men are already working. This is cruelty to animal and very condemnable. The cattle in question were owned by people of the area.\u201d\n\nSoludo: Attacks are mindless criminality perpetrated by outsiders\n\nGovernor Soludo, during an assessment tour of the Aguata Local Government Area Secretariat yesterday described the recent attacks in the state as acts of \u201cmindless criminality\u201d by fleeing criminals who had been sacked from their operational camp by joint operations of Nigerian security forces.\n\nHe said military operations around the borders of Aguluezechukwu and Ogborji communities in the council had led to the dislodging of the arsonists who had operated for about two years.\n\nHe said that information from those arrested revealed that they were not from Anambra while worrisome exhibits were discovered from them.\n\nAccording to Soludo, yesterday, combined forces got to a criminal camp between Agulezechukwu and Ogborji, and that is from where they have operated unhindered for over two years.\n\n\u201cThey attacked, kidnapped, maimed and burnt places,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey were smoked out, the camp destroyed and as they were fleeing cowardly, they decided to set the Local Government Secretariat ablaze, but thank God, the police came on time and smoked them out.\n\n\u201cFrom the statistics so far, 85 per cent of people arrested come from one of the states in the South East and the remaining 15 per cent from another state in the Southeast.\n\n\u201cIt is really our people doing this to themselves. From the items recovered from them, they are common criminals. There is a register of those kidnapped, how much they paid, balance remaining, date of kidnap and how, shrines, arms and food items.\u201d\n\nSoludo asked all genuine agitators to embrace the olive branch extended to them by coming out of the forests and dropping their guns for rehabilitation.\n\nHe warned that anybody in the bush with guns would be regarded as a criminal and treated as one.\n\nHe said there was no hiding place for criminals in Anambra as the people of the state were determined to recover their space and enthrone peace for livable, conducive and prosperous economic activities.\n\nUzodimma vows to flush out bandits, says \u2018we can\u2019t leave Imo for you\u2019\n\nSoludo\u2019s counterpart in Imo State, Hope Uzodimma, vowed that he would never surrender the state to the bandits disturbing the peace of the people.\n\nInaugurating the State Council of Traditional Rulers at the Government House, Owerri yesterday, Uzodimma charged the traditional rulers to partner with the state government to flush out every criminal in their communities.\n\nHe alleged that some politicians in the state were backing the hoodlums in carrying out the destructions and burning of police stations in the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe cannot leave the state for anybody. Rather, we would chase away the criminals. We know the politicians that are behind these problems. We shall defeat them.\u201d\n\nResponding on behalf of the council, its chairman, Eze Emmanuel Okeke, thanked the governor for his effort in developing the state and promised a robust partnership with the state government to surmount the insecurity challenges facing the state.\n\nIPOB vows to unmask suspected killers of six women in Imo\n\nProscribed IPOB, responding yesterday to allegations that it was the brains behind the violence in the South East, vowed to expose the sponsors of the killings and other security challenges in the geo-political zone.\n\nMedia and Publicity Secretary of the group, Emma Powerful, particularly condemned the recent killing of six women in Imo State while sharing rice.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe wish to reiterate once again to Biafrans, friends of Biafra and lovers of freedom, that IPOB has no hands in the criminality and insecurity being perpetrated in Biafra territory by imported hoodlums, dissidents and wicked politicians. Those behind this barbarity are not IPOB members or ESN operatives.\n\n\u201cThese atrocities are witnessed more in the region where politicians are fighting themselves for selfish reasons. We totally condemn the killing of six innocent women in Imo State by hired hoodlums as they shared rice.\n\n\u201cWe condemn those who were behind the murder of those women and we must fish out the perpetrators of this heinous crime against our mothers.\n\n\u201cOur mothers were raped by these vampires created and sponsored by politicians in Imo State to terrorise our people and implicate IPOB and ESN members.\n\n\u201cAnybody who is involved in such heinous act must regret his or her wicked action. The perpetrators of this barbarity should be ready to reap the fruit of their labour.\n\n\u201cThe recent killing of our six mothers and women from Owerriebeiri Community in Orlu LGA of Imo State will mark the end of those behind this wickedness. Their days are numbered. The spirit and land of Biafra will hunt them down.\n\n\u201cWe advise our people to be circumspect this political season as enemies of Biafra have schemed different ways of causing havoc in our land and blaming it on IPOB and Biafra agitators to further demonise us.\n\n\u201cEverybody should be wise and vigilant.

Anybody staging attack anywhere has nothing to do with IPOB.\n\n\u201cIPOB has been pursuing the freedom for the people of former Eastern region and Midwestern regions since nine years without involving in any act of criminality, but some people in their desperation to blackmail IPOB and Nnamdi KANU, these dissidents and unfortunate people claiming they are working for Mazi Nnamdi Kanu emerged with their evil agenda, and the emergence of these criminals has turned our region into a very dangerous situation because some unscrupulous politicians are behind and sponsoring them.\n\n\u201cWe also condemn the numerous abductions, car snatching, raping and attacks on so many institutions in our land. We strongly condemn the recent attacks on Nnewi South LGA, the burning of the country home of Ohaneze Ndigbo President, Professor George Obiozor in Awommamma, Imo State and the attack on the palace of HRH Igwe Anayo Obika of Ezinfite, Nnewi South.\n\n\u201cThose behind these devilish acts will regret their actions.

          "text": "From Noah Ebije, Kaduna\n\nThe trending video on social media in which attackers of Abuja-Kaduna bound train of March 28, 2022, threatened to kill all the hostages in their custody if the federal government refuses to meet their demands, has sent shivers into the hearts and minds of their relatives and sympathizers.\n\nThis comes as efforts are being made to raise money to pay the terrorists even if it is not the whole amount being asked for. This will be done by relatives acting as ransom-bearers and who are courageous enough to follow the abductors far into the forests.\n\nWhen Saturday Sun contacted some of the embattled relatives, they avoided him like a leper. \u201cPlease save us the additional trouble. Do you want these guys to come after us? Whatever we say here can be misquoted by them and they may kill the people we are struggling to free.\u201d\n\nThough they refused to speak on record, they would, however, want the Federal Government to meet the demands of the terrorists in order to save the lives of their loved ones who have been in captivity for almost two weeks.\n\nWhen the reporter spoke with other concerned individuals and organisations, they lent their voices to the call by the relatives of the hostages on the Federal Government to do everything within its power to get them freed.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nSpokesman of Southern Kaduna People\u2019s Union (SOKAPU), Mr. Luka Binniyat told Saturday Sun, that, \u201cgovernment should come out in plain terms and explain its relationship with the outlaws.\u201d\n\nSOKAPU, he added, was of the belief that \u201cpowerful people in government are in bed with these bandits and terrorists. We believe that what has been said over the years that these cruel people were imported into the country in 2015 to make Nigeria ungovernable should then President Jonathan Goodluck continue in office is true.\u201d\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

If government or people in power are not the owners of the bandits, the solution is very simple: they should train the hundreds of thousands of idle young persons in all affected states, give them basic discipline, arm them and let them loose on the bandits and let\u2019s see if they can last a week.\u201d\n\nFormer Secretary General of Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Mr Anthony Sani, asked the bandits not to carry out their threat. He said: \u201cThe terrorists who go by the name kidnappers should not dare it. Those of them who threaten to kill all the abductees are those who are ignorant of the conversations going on now as to whether the Air Force should bomb all hideouts of the terrorists in all the forests or to tread softly to avoid collateral damages that will come by way of killing innocent people whom the terrorists use as human shields. So, the terrorists should not behave as if the government and the security agencies have no option. The government has other options of dealing with them but for the heavy collateral damage.\u201d\n\nIn his own view, a Kaduna-based conflicts resolution manager, Mr Patrick Lawson, urged the President to enter re-negotiation with the bandits \u201cbecause their statement that has gone viral on Facebook suggested that there was a discussion or agreement which appeared to have been breached by government. Whatever government can do to ensure total return of peace and peaceful coexistence in the country is what Nigerians are after now.\u201d",

          "title": "Sheik Khalid: I was sacked by Abuja Mosque Committee to please people in high places",
          "text": "The Mosque Steering Committee of Apo Legislative Quarters Mosque, Abuja, last week, sacked the Imam of the Mosque, Sheik Muhammed Nuru Khalid, popularly known as Digital Imam, accusing him of preaching an inciting sermon. The Imam in the sermon accused the Federal Government of playing with the lives of the people through their actions, hence the need to reawaken the consciousness of the government to their constitutional responsibilities.\n\nIman Khalid advised his followers to avoid the polling centres if the level of killings being experienced in the country does not stop.\n\nIn an Interview with FRED EZEH, Sheikh Khalid, maintained that he would neither back down nor compromise his position despite the fact that he was relieved of his job by the management of Apo Legislative Quarters Mosque.\n\nYou\u2019ve been on the lips of Nigerians in past few days due to your recent sermon about the insecurity in Nigeria. What was your reason for the strong sermon?\n\nThe outburst was simply because we can\u2019t continue the way we are going. Insecurity is fast consuming all of us. No one is safe anymore. Neither roads nor train, or air travels is safe. We have to do something about it. The country is in a serious problem and people who are supposed to speak loudly have kept quiet. People, including security personnel are being killed on daily basis by bandits who are fast overrunning some states in the North-West and North-Central. We can\u2019t continue like this, hence we have to speak the truth to the government. I was doing my God given responsibilities to speak the truth to the people in government, reminding them about their responsibilities and the oath they swore to before entering office. Regrettably, many people are not comfortable with my choice of words and position regarding what should be done by the government to protect the lives of the people of Nigeria that voted for them.\n\nAt what point did your relationship with the Mosque committee degenerate to the point of termination of engagement?\n\nI think they had bottled-up anger, and were waiting for the right opportunity to express it. The sermon of last week provided that opportunity. They capitalised on the recent sermon that highlighted the issues of insecurity across the country which generated lots of conversation both on social and in the conventional media.\n\nUnfortunately, the sermon led to your disengagement by the Mosque Committee..\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nYes! It did, but I was happy I spoke my mind and my conscience is happy for that. I was disengaged some days ago by the Mosque Committee. But shortly after my formal disengagement, an intervention from the Supreme Being came through someone who provided a brand new mosque for me to handle. I heard that someone else is even building a new mosque for me at the centre of Abuja which will be handed over to me soon. We appreciate God for that timely intervention.\n\nWhat would you have done if such intervention didn\u2019t come?\n\nFirst or all, I wasn\u2019t expecting the new mosque but God did it. Besides, without the mosque, I will still be doing my thing effectively and efficiently. I have already established a platform through which I pass my messages across to my large followers, online and offline. I engage the women and children in the morning hours and men in the evening hours, especially during this Ramadan period.\n\nBefore the sack, did you have any form of meeting with the mosque committee to iron out grey areas?\n\nYes! We met once and discussed issues they raised. They called it an advisory meeting. They asked me to tone down my criticism of the government and not to be harsh to them. But I know the members of the mosque committee. They are all politicians who approach government for one need or the other. They might have approached the government for a contract or something else, and want to show the government that they are doing something about my kind of preaching. But I consider the masses more than them, and that is their problem with me. I consider Nigeria more than any other person. I consider the unity and security of Nigeria more than any person. And that\u2019s my problem.\n\nDo you suspect that the Federal Government might have acted through the Mosque Committee?\n\nI don\u2019t have any evidence to prove that. But one of the Mosque Committee members told me that they acted because of pressure from people in high places which he didn\u2019t mention to me. But to me, they have their own agenda and interest to protect. I know the government is not happy with me, so, anything can happen through anybody.\n\nThe Committee said in your suspension letter that you didn\u2019t show any remorse. Why was that?\n\nWhy should I be remorseful when I know I am doing the right thing and pleasing my conscience? Do they want me to apologise and make a promise that I will support killings and other misgovernance going on? I can\u2019t do that for whatever reason.\n\nDo you have any regret for your action?\n\nNo! I have no regret for the outburst. How will I regret my action that was meant to protect the interest of the people? Many widows and orphans are being produced on daily basis in Nigeria as a result of the unending killings. How will I regret speaking for them, standing for the truth? How will I regret that I am the only Imam that is speaking and calling for peace and unity of Nigeria? I will never regret that. Besides, people are happy with me for speaking their minds. My conscience is clear and I have peace of mind.\n\nDon\u2019t you think the government is overwhelmed by this insecurity?\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nWhatever may be the case, the government knows more than we do, and they have the necessary things needed to tackle these people who have made life unbearable for the people. Government have more credible intelligence and information than what we could access. They should utilise that. We really need to remind the government of their constitutional responsibilities of security and welfare of Nigerians. Our lives are important, hence they should sit up and tackle the issue of insecurity. The security of the nation is our concern too because this is the only country that we have.\n\nWhat are the responsibilities of the citizens regarding this insecurity?\n\nAs masses of this country, we owe the country prayers and doing other right things to assist the government. But the government has to rise to the challenges because people are being slaughtered like chicken everyday and little or nothing is being done about it. Any successful attack on individuals or soldiers is an indication that someone failed in his or her duties. So, such person should answer questions. Our only request is for the government to be proactive instead of being reactive.\n\nBut many people believe you always look for opportunities to verbally attack the government because you never liked the administration. Is it true?\n\nThat perception is totally wrong. I have realised that some people are particularly concerned about my strong criticism of the Buhari administration. I have nothing personal or hatred against the President or any of the cabinet members. I am only concerned about the fate of this country which is fast going the wrong way. At this point, the country is evidently on the brink of collapse, and we should work to rescue it.\n\nSome say you\u2019ve never shown open support for the Buhari administration\n\nThat statement is not also true. It depends on how you view the issue and your definition of support. I must not go about with posters or placards in the name of support for Buhari\u2019s administration. I have supported this administration in different ways but they seem to be getting it wrong on all fronts. Cost of living has skyrocketed beyond the reach of the average man. Power supply, health care system, education, and other indices have read negative compare to what we had in 2015 before the coming of the administration.\n\nIn what way have you supported the government openly?\n\nBeing a renowned Islamic cleric, the only platform I have is the mosque which I use effectively to promote national unity, peace, tolerance and societal morals. At various occasions during the sermon in my mosque, I have taken it upon myself to appeal to the people to be patient with the government. I have led prayers several times for peace, unity and development of Nigeria, and for the government to succeed in its quest to better the lives of the people. I have asked and championed attitudinal change from the people. That\u2019s huge support for the government as far as I am concerned. I mustn\u2019t be shouting Buhari everywhere to be a supporter of the government.\n\nYou have been accused of being biased in your judgements and that you show it through your sermons\n\nMany people know and believe in my philosophy. You can see the massive support that I got this period. I am the only Imam that Christians celebrate, and that\u2019s because I am not biased in my judgement of political affairs in Nigeria. I want a good Nigeria that is united, peaceful and give justice to all, irrespective of political status, religious beliefs or other differences.\n\nWhat\u2019s your general assessment of Buhari\u2019s administration?\n\nMy assessment of this administration is the people\u2019s assessment. You and I know the people\u2019s assessment of the Buhari administration. Evidently, the country is at the brink of collapse but we won\u2019t allow it. That\u2019s why we would continue to talk loudly to hold the government to account. The masses of Nigeria are suffering severely in midst of plenty of God\u2019s blessing. This is more than before. Hardship and poverty have overwhelmed the people, inflation has weakened the currency, among several others poor records. Most worrisome is the level of killings in Nigeria. The President still has the opportunity to make amends before the end of his tenure. It\u2019s for his own good because the reality would dawn on him few minutes after he leaves office next year. All those hypocrites that surrounded him would abandon him for the new government. But for us, we love Nigeria more than any other President because Presidents come and go but Nigeria remains.\n\nSeveral promises were made by this administration before 2015. Can you compare the past government and what we have now?\n\nYes, I can do that comfortably. For instance, I came close to the former FCT Minister, Bala Mohammed, because I criticised him heavily. He tried to bring me closer to him because I was criticizing and pointing out his lapses so he could make amends.\n\nWhen I met with him, he encouraged me to always speak the truth to people in government, including himself. He only appealed that I shouldn\u2019t be too harsh and uncivil in my words. We became more friendly because he accept criticisms and doesn\u2019t see it the other way round. That character was what I expected from the current administration. They need to understand that criticism is part of people and society.\n\nConstructive criticism is very important if we are to talk about democracy.\n\nIf you are summoned for a meeting with the President, what will you tell him?\n\nI will honour the invitation because the President is the father of the nation and our leader. I will listen to him and share my experiences and suggestion with him on how to move the country forward.",

          "title": "Search for Consensus Presidential Candidate in PDP Falters, Atiku Insists on Primary Election",
          "text": "\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nThe quest by some presidential aspirants of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for a consensus flagbearer for the party ahead of their Presidential primaries is looking more like a fruitless mission, with former vice president Atiku Abubakar and two others (Dele Momodu and Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa) insisting that all aspirants must face the party\u2019s delegates in \u201cdemocratic primary election.\n\n\u201dThe four aspirants in the forefront of the campaign for consensus \u2013 former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki; Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State; Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State and the former Managing Director of FSB International Bank, Mohammed Hayatudeen \u2013 have been crisscrossing the country in the last few weeks, promoting the consensus flagbearer idea. Only last Wednesday, the pro-consensus aspirants led by Saraki met with Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, where the issue of consensus flagbearer topped the agenda and strategies for actualising the mission mapped out.\n\nWike, while speaking after the meeting, said their interest was to ensure the consolidation of unity in the party.He said they were developing a formidable strategy that would enable the PDP coast to victory in the 2023 presidential election. Atiku was, however, absent from the meeting. The pro-consensus presidential aspirants had earlier met with Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State and Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State on the issue.\n\nA source close to the former vice president told THISDAY last night that Atiku would never be part of any consensus arrangement for the presidential ticket of the PDP. The source said some of the pro-consensus presidential aspirants, led by Saraki, met with Atiku in his house in Abuja last week and that the former vice president told them bluntly that what they were pushing for was undemocratic, can\u2019t work and that he would never be part of it.\n\nAtiku was said to have advised that all aspirants should go and face the party\u2019s delegates at the National Convention. Another source close to the former vice president told THISDAY: \u201cThe push for consensus is by people aiming to shut out a particular aspirant. Are they saying the 13 aspirants that took forms would sit down and pick one of them as the consensus flagbearer? Does this make sense? Who will step down for who? The aspirants should be meeting and selling their ideas to delegates; not meeting over consensus candidate. That is the position of Atiku.\n\n\u201dNewspaper publisher and another presidential aspirant, Dele Momodu told THISDAY last night that the move for consensus PDP flagbearer was dead on arrival.Momodu stated: \u201cI see a very dangerous kind of desperation in our career politicians in Nigeria as our country prepares for the 2023 Presidential election. It is unfortunate that some of our leaders are toying with the hard-fought democracy most of them were never part of.\n\n\u201cAt a time our country is at its worst state in decades, career politicians are only interested in hijacking power for themselves and are totally disinterested in engaging the electorates on how they plan to rescue our country and its long-suffering people from the brink of total collapse.\n\n\u201cThe concept of consensus as practised in Nigeria is anathema to democracy because it is based on everything that democracy is not. It denies merit, enshrines illegality and enthrones mediocrity. Moreover, it embraces corruption, bullying and other unseen ills and threats.\n\nHow are the proponents of consensus different from President Muhammadu Buhari who has virtually taken over the control of APC as the Alpha & Omega? \u201cHow will they enforce their consensus on someone like me when I have bought my nomination form and I\u2019m ready to contest all the way? They should please conserve and preserve their energies and let the people make their choices in a free and fair contest. That is the essence of democracy.\n\nWe need to save hapless Nigerians from this unnecessary distraction.\u201dAnother PDP Presidential aspirant, Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa questioned the principles that would govern the choice of a consensus presidential candidate being promoted.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen I see Bukola Saraki moving round the country canvassing for a PDP consensus Presidential candidate, he reminds me of his father many years ago, moving round the country saying it was the turn of the North to present a Presidential candidate.\u201cHowever, what are the principles governing the choice of a consensus Presidential candidate? It is worth consideration when consensus is anchored on the principle of equity, justice and fair play, not the brow beaten saga, which APC was compelled to submit to by Mr. President recently.\n\nConsensus should not approximate to an arm twisting scenario or drama.\u201cWhy is the talk of consensus at this time when the clamour for a Nigerian President of Southeast extraction has gained critical mass at the national level? Someone brought the idea of this consensus to my attention, to buy into it. When 10 people are contesting or vying for a position, you don\u2019t exclude nine to the advantage of one person. Consensus must be a collective decision of all those involved in this game. Period.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeeting with Makinde, Okowa\n\nAt the PDP pro-consensus presidential aspirants meeting with Makinde, the governor said the party would work to ensure the success of a consensus presidential candidate arrangement for the PDP. \u201dWe have discussed behind closed doors the issue of the consensus arrangements we are trying to put together. We did it at the last convention of our party, and that was the first time the PDP was able to achieve bringing in a national chairman for the party through a consensus arrangement,\u201d Makinde said.\n\nAt the meeting with Makinde, Saraki declared: \u201cOf course, we all have our individual interests to become the president, but we have decided in our meetings that we are ready to subject ourselves to a consensus arrangement. It is not just for one part of the country, but for the PDP as a party.\u201dAt another meeting with Okowa, Saraki also made a case for consensus candidate: \u201cThis is important because we believe that the country needs unity.\n\nWe are all eminently qualified to lead this country but we believe that only one person will lead and that person needs everybody to make Nigeria better and to fix this country.\u201dThe former governor of Kwara stated that the interest of the aspirants was second to that of the country, adding, \u201cThis also goes to show that this consensus arrangement is not just about the issue of the North but about Nigeria.\n\n\u201dSaraki said any of them is qualified to lead the country and that they had agreed to a consensus arrangement to elect the party\u2019s presidential flagbearer.Also, Saraki, during a consultative visit to Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State last month, said some of the PDP presidential aspirants from the north were ready for a consensus candidate.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the end of the day, it is only one person that will lead this country in 2023; and we also resolved that we are going to work closely to ensure that we come out with a way that consensus arrangement would come among the three of us on how to go forward into leading this country.\u201dThe aspirants that have purchased the PDP presidential forms are Atiku, Saraki, Wike, Anyim Pius Anyim, Governor Mohammed, Governor Tambuwal, Hayatudeen and Dele Momodu.\n\nOthers are a United States based medical doctor, Nwachukwu Anakwenze; former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi; Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel; a pharmacist, Sam Ohuabunwa and an unknown politician from Imo State, Mrs. Oliver Tareila Diana.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Meanwhile, the court has fixed May 18 to deliver ruling in Kanu\u2019s application for bail.The court fixed the date after listening to arguments for and against granting the application.\n\nKanu\u2019s lead counsel, Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, in moving the bail application said: \u201cUntil a person is tried and convicted, he should be allowed to walk free.\u201dHe reminded the court that a defendant ought to enjoy the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.\n\n\u201cI humbly urge my lord to use your discretion to grant him bail subject to my lord\u2019s condition,\u201d he said.\u201cYou can limit him to stay in my house and I will not allow him to move around,\u201d the lawyer added jokingly.Responding, prosecution counsel, Mr. Shuaibu Labaran, prayed the court to refuse the application, adding that Kanu had allegedly violated the earlier bail granted him.\n\n\u201cMy lord granted him bail in 2017 on health grounds, but since then until date, no medical record was submitted to the court until he jumped bail,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat we should be saying is contempt of court because he has flagrantly violated the orders of the court.\u201dHe urged the judge to be guided by her discretion vis-a-vis the circumstances of the case \u201cand in the alternative, order accelerated hearing on this matter so that the defendant can know his fate one way or the other.\n\n\u201dIn a short ruling, the judge announced May 18 to deliver the ruling on the bail application.The IPOB leader was arraigned last year on an amended criminal charge, shortly after he was arrested and repatriated to Nigeria.He had fled the country in 2017 after soldiers invaded his family house in Abia State and was reported to have committed most of the alleged offences from his hideout somewhere in the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter he was repatriated and arraigned, he pleaded not guilty to the 15-count amended charges bordering on alleged treasonable felony and asked the court to quash the charges for being defective and baseless, adding that the court lacked the jurisdiction to try him based on those charges.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Emefiele: InfraCo to Unlock N8 trillion Pension Funds\u2019 Assets for Deployment to Bankable Infrastructure Projects Across Nigeria",
          "text": "\n\n*Signs terms sheet with four asset managers\n\nNume Ekeghe\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Mr. Godwin Emefiele yesterday announced that the Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria (InfraCo) would unlock N8 trillion of pension funds\u2019 assets to be deployed into bankable infrastructure projects across Nigeria. Emefiele also announced the appointment of Mr. Lazarus Angbazo as Chief Executive Officer of InfraCo and signed terms agreement with four Infrastructure Asset Managers \u2013 the AAA Consortium, Chapel Hill Denham, Africa Infrastructure Investment Managers and Sanlam Infra works.\n\nInfracorp is being promoted by the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) and the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority, with KPMG as transaction advisers. Also, with their Legal Advisers \u2013 Kenna Partners, Olaniwun Ajayi, and Ukiri and Lijadu \u2013 they are to deliver InfraCo as a catalyst to accelerate public-private solutions for infrastructure in Nigeria, with initial capital raising of N15 trillion. At a press briefing in Lagos yesterday, Emefiele said:\n\n\u201cWe have done our scoping, we believe that a substantial portion of the N15 trillion is available locally. There is a lot of liquidity today not just in the banking industry; there is a lot of liquidity that is currently held by our pension funds managers. I understand from the last count that the size of Nigeria pension fund is over N13 trillion. I am told that in another three to five years, Nigerian pension assets would rise to almost N20 trillion to N25 trillion.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of local capital and liquidity in Nigeria and what we would like to say is that we would begin by talking to people, the institutions that have this liquidity to come in and take up this kind of debt and that is why I am trying to say that out of the N14 trillion that will be debt, we imagine that on looking at it on a straight line, we should be looking at N8- N9 trillion available say within the Nigerian banking industry and the pension fund administrators.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, naturally the rest will be raised through foreign debt like Eurobond and the rest of them. So, yes, there will be Eurobond, but because we are moving very quickly, very fast, we will be looking at more in Nigeria.\u201cSo, let\u2019s not forget these are projects from viability stand points and that they will be generating Naira revenue. Most of the roads will be carrying the traffic cam, they will be tolled but we will try as much as possible to ensure that the tolls are not too high and become so burdensome on the road users.\n\n\u201cThe important thing I think is we must begin to come to a realisation that for us to have good infrastructure, for us to have good roads, we will need to make them commercially viable and that means we have to really pay for them.\u201dFurther speaking on how InfraCo would be financed, Emefiele said the first phase of this financing is to raise N14 trillion debt plus N1 trillion equity which is being contributed by the CBN, AFC and NSIA. He added: \u201cUpon signing the terms sheet today, we will go straight into execution mode because Nigeria very badly needs to develop its infrastructure.\n\nThere is infrastructure deficit in the public sector, there is infrastructure deficit in the private sector and we would like to see that we played our part at this time to support the efforts of not just the government but also the private sector in doing whatever can be done to develop infrastructure in Nigeria. \u201cWe are determined to do this because we all travel to different parts of the world and we see state of the development of their infrastructure and indeed most of the developing countries that we like to compare ourselves with also have some sort of our type of InfraCo and that is why they have moved very aggressively in developing infrastructure in those countries.\n\nWe are determined to see to it that from today InfraCo is open for business.\u201cFrom today we are unveiling InfraCo to Nigeria and because we are sure, we are confident that the funding of N15 trillion is available.\u201cIn other countries where infrastructure corporations have worked, pension funds have been used to develop the infrastructure of those countries.\n\n\u201cEmerging market economies have used private sector funds coming from either pension fund managers or the banking industry to set an example that we here in Nigeria stand ready to support infrastructure development, to support the government in the development of Nigeria infrastructure, and that is our solemn pledge today that we will.\n\nI am so sure that with the gap in the Nigerian infrastructure, this is the first tranche and I believe it will soon very quickly be used up and we can now go to a phase two and phase three.\u201cNigeria as the biggest economy in Africa and a country with the largest population in Africa truly deserves that at this time. Its infrastructure must be top notch so as to continue to encourage investors both locally and foreign to have confidence to come and do business in Nigeria.\u201dOn his part, Angbazo said:\n\n\u201cThe specific mission of InfraCo is to harness opportunities for infrastructure development in Nigeria by originating, structuring, executing and managing end-to-end bankable projects. These projects would be managed privately by asset managers that are private entities and they would do this in partnership with public and private sector participants to provide long and attractive investment returns required not just in terms of financial returns but also in terms of social impact.\u201d\u201cInfraCo is a dedicated vehicle to unlock and enable development of infrastructure.\n\nIt is a catalyst to unlock private capital by leveraging local and international pools of capital and finally it is an enabler for economic growth and development by driving local capacity building, inclusive growth and development with impact.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

In the latest revelation from the banks\u2019 full year 2021 financial report, First City Monument Bank (FCMB), Fidelity Bank Plc. and Wema Bank were fined a total of N514 million crypto infractions.\n\nThe FCMB was fined N400 million over its failure to close four accounts of customers said to be involved in cryptocurrency trading.Fidelity Bank Plc. received a sanction of N14.28 million for cryptocurrency infractions, the bank said in its 2021 audited financial statement.Wema Bank got a penalty of N100 million for contravening the CBN circular on cryptocurrency.\n\nIt also emerged earlier in the week that a N800 million penalty was imposed by the CBN on three banks \u2013 Access Bank Plc., Stanbic IBTC, and the United Bank for Africa Plc. \u2013 also for violating regulations barring customers from transacting in cryptocurrencies.The UBA was fined N100 million for a customer\u2019s digital-currency transactions. Access Bank Plc. was fined N500 million for failing to shut down customers\u2019 crypto accounts, according to a filing with the Nigerian Exchange Limited.\n\nStanbic IBTC Bank was fined N200 million for two accounts allegedly used for crypto transactions.The total penalties imposed so far for contravening the CBN circular on cryptocurrency is a massive N1.315 billion for the six banks.The apex bank issued a circular on February 5, 2021, warning and reminding local financial institutions against conducting crypto transactions or enabling payments for crypto exchanges.It directed financial institutions to close the accounts of anyone participating in or operating cryptocurrency exchanges immediately.\n\nThe CBN has ignored pushback against its crypto regulation and has advised Nigerians to adopt its CBDC, the eNaira. The penalties are part of efforts by the apex bank to ensure that banks implement an order to block trading in cryptocurrencies due to the threat they pose to Nigeria\u2019s financial system. Despite these regulations, Nigeria accounts for the largest volume of cryptocurrency transactions outside the United States., according to Paxful, a Bitcoin marketplace.\n\nThe country also has the largest proportion of retail users conducting crypto transactions under $10,000, Chainalysis says. The Chief Executive Officer, Stanbic IBTC, Wole Adeniyi, during an investor conference call in Lagos last Tuesday confirmed that his bank was fined N200 million for two accounts alleged to have been used for crypto transactions.\n\nAdeniyi said that while Stanbic IBTC followed the apex bank\u2019s directive, the transactions it was sanctioned for might have passed through its system undetected. He noted that the CBN was able to detect the relevant transactions using an \u201cadvanced capability\u201d that Nigerian banks don\u2019t have access to, and they\u2019ve asked the apex bank to share the technology. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem that they are going to entertain a refund, but they are now sharing intelligence with us to be able to kind of deter clients,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Can Hytch succeed where GoMyWay failed?",
          "text": "At the end of October 2018, the Nigerian ride-sharing platform GoMyWay ceased to exist after operating for about 4 years. According to a statement by the company\u2019s CEO Damilola Teidi, this was due to a lack of follow-on funding, as its investors had decided not to continue backing the company.\n\nIt was a surprising event, owing to the promise of the business at launch. Within its first month of launch, it announced that it would quickly expand into Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa. A pan-African expansion within launch month is unusual, but the calibre of investors\u2014Konga founder and CEO Sim Shagaya, and Co-Creation Hub (CcHub) and former Amazon and Naspers executive Bill Paladino\u2014on the startup\u2019s capital table somewhat made the possibility considerable. Though the expansion didn\u2019t eventually happen, the prospect of it happening, however, was an indication that the business was meeting its projection.\n\nIt\u2019s now 4 years since anybody last used GoMyWay, and another startup is ready to take up the challenge of scaling digital vehicle-pooling in Nigeria. Founded by Laolu Onifade, Hytch Africa was launched to the public last month\u2014after months of public building and teasing its internet community with product videos and pictures\u2014to help people share rides and move faster and cheaper.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLike GoMyWay, Hytch has also begun to ramp up users. The company announced, on its social media platforms, that it had acquired 600 users in just 3 days, with zero spend on marketing. Its CEO also tweeted that they are looking to get 2,000 users by the end of the second quarter.\n\nGoMyWay, before it went into oblivion, had said it had over 12,000 users and had completed 106,630 rides across 16 states in Nigeria. But how the 2 startups acquired users is different. While the defunct company ran free services, accompanied by giveaways, like offering car owners one month\u2019s supply of fuel, Onifade told TechCabal that Hytch hasn\u2019t spent a kobo on user acquisition.\n\nBusiness model is king\n\nGoMyWay had traction but wasn\u2019t making money. According to Teidi\u2019s statement, the plan by its shareholders and investors was to run a free service for a year or 2, then focus on growing the user base. So, there was traction with zero revenue and no way to monetise the business.\n\nFor Hytch, the opposite is the case as they want to make money as they go, and are already doing so. \u201cWe are already making money. We charge 15% on every ride and, since launch, we\u2019ve recorded an average of 25 rides daily,\u201d Onifade told TechCabal.\n\nLaolu Onifade, founder and CEO at Hytch\n\nHytch operates a cashless payment method and it provides an inbuilt wallet for both drivers and riders, and riders are automatically debited at the end of every trip they take.\n\nGoMyWay and others\u2014like Jekalo and Ridebliss, 2 other local carpooling services that\u2019ve since failed\u2014are great learning references for Hytch. Hytch, in a bid to capture the vehicle-pooling market, allows not just carpooling, but bus-pooling; buses can pick up people going their way. This means that public bus owners can also use the platform to get riders daily.\n\n\u201cHytch is not just for private car owners; there is a bus-pooling option as well,\u201d Onifade said.\n\nRide-sharing is essential\n\nVehicle-pooling is not new to people: globally, it\u2019s one common way for people to move from one place to another, hitching rides with an unknown driver at random locations or bus stops. What if this same experience can be digitised?\n\nThis is the question companies like Hytch are answering.\n\nDifferent ride-hailing companies are currently trying to incorporate ride-sharing into their product. Last year, Uber in Kenya was reported to be testing Pool Chance, a feature that lets riders heading in the same direction share the cost of the journey. They have plans to roll out the service to Ghana and Nigeria. The company first introduced the service to its San Francisco market, and it was reported to be a success until the pandemic forced its pause.\n\nAnother disturbing factor is that the ride-hailing sector\u2014even though it\u2019s not the most-funded tech sector\u2014requires a lot of capital to scale. At least that\u2019s what the top companies have done and made the world believe is best practice: burn heavy cash to acquire users. Bolt recently raised $607 million in a Series F round; Uber raised a total of $25.2 billion over 33 rounds before it IPOed in 2019; and even French BlaBlaCar, which is primarily doing the same thing as Hytch, has raised more than $443 million in venture capital since its founding in 2006 (its recent funding of $115 million came in April last year).\n\nFor now, it looks like the company has learnt a great deal from the defunct startups in the sector and may be well on its way to success. But it\u2019s too early to say.\n\nOnifade believes that his company has the skill and drive to build the product and a business model that works but do they have the money needed to fully build? Per investment, the CEO said they have raised a family-and-friends\u2019 round and are currently raising pre-seed.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "\u2018I have never been scared of Alex Ferguson, but I was scared to disappoint him\u2019",
          "text": "PATRICE EVRA, referred to by Alex Ferguson as one of the best left-backs in the world, has played across Europe in Italy, Nice and Monaco before joining Manchester United in January 2006. Making 379 appearances in almost nine seasons at the club, he won 14 major honours, including five Premier League titles and the Champions league in 2008. Recently in Nigeria, he had an exclusive interview with KEMI AJUMOBI, Associate Editor, BusinessDay on his reason for coming to Africa, his passion for mental health awareness, amongst others. Excerpts:\n\nWhy are you in Nigeria?\n\nI am here because I want to spend more time in the African continent. It is my first time ever in Nigeria, I have never been here. I have been connected to Nigeria by love. The love I received when I arrived at the airport was overwhelming. They know me, they know exactly what I am doing. I had an interview when I came and I was shocked they knew everything about my life. I almost asked if they were working for the FBI. I am in Nigeria because I want to project a different image of Africa. There are different narratives about Africa, but the truth is that it is the richest continent in the world. I am also here to inspire the younger generation, for them to understand that hour dreams do not necessarily have to be fulfilled in America or in Europe, it can also be fulfilled here in Africa. My mission generally, be it in Dakar, Senegal, Ivory Coast and every other place in Africa that I would visit, is also to end the violence against children. Their mental health is important. This is my fight. I am here to see the creativity of the young ones and to let the world know what we have in Africa. This is the first time I am in Nigeria and it will not be the last.\n\nWhat was the nature of your Childhood?\n\nI had a very tough childhood. I grew up on the street. Growing up on the street is about survival. When you have been sexually abused like I had been when I was 13, it is traumatic but with all of that, I am stronger than ever. I also went through emotional issues and as I grew older, it became the norm as men to show you are strong, not to show our emotions. It was tough, that is why in my autobiography, I was very transparent and honest because kids only see the result, but I explained especially in the chapters that it is a long journey and that bad things can happen, but you must never give up but believe in yourself.\n\nWhy the passion for football and share on the Manchester United connect\n\nWhen I was 5 years old, I was playing football and I broke the glass of the window. My dad asked who did it and my brothers said I was the one but my father did not believe that I could have done that. My brothers insisted that I was the one, but my father concluded to punish all of them so they begged and asked that I go to my father to confess that I was the one, which I did. He took me by the hand and said because they all lied on the youngest one (me), he was going to punish them twice. He just didn\u2019t believe it was me. For me, when it comes to football, it\u2019s the passion, it\u2019s the love. Anytime I see football, I am happy. To be honest, I had no idea that playing football was a job. When I was in school, everyone was saying what they wanted to become.\n\nSome said Lawyer, others doctors, others entrepreneur and so on but I said I wanted to be a football player and the teacher said being a football player was not a job. Both the teacher and classmates laughed at me. She asked if I thought I could be picked and I boldly said Yes! and they laughed at me but today, I can boldly say I lived my dreams. I am not taking jabs at her, I just don\u2019t want children to believe they cannot achieve what they set their mind to achieve, and that is why today, when I meet children, I say to them that they can be whatever they choose to be. I encourage them to go for what they want and also let them know there are sacrifices to be made. Money has never been my motivation. I am passionate about what I do and believe in. That is why I say, when you are good at something, money will come. Don\u2019t chase the money, money will come.\n\nIs there a connection between living your passion and making money from it?\n\nMost African parents think that allowing their children get involved in sports is a distraction. They emphasize on the need to study. However, now, they realize that football can make you rich. They are now changing the narrative. This is also a major problem. Luckily enough, my parents never forced me to play football or be in it because I want to amass money. Because of my background, I had always wanted to buy my mother a house, and as soon as I signed my first contract, I bought her a house in Senegal, and that felt to me like my biggest achievement.\n\nRead also: African footballers need to maximise their talents to become top professionals \u2013 CEO Nao Sports\n\nAs nice as this sounds, money shouldn\u2019t be our motivation. Parents see me and think their children must do as I have done, which is to play football. But I always tell them to allow passion reign over money. Leave them to do what they want to do. Do not force your child to do something because you feel it will make him rich, let him decide. If he wants to study, let him study, if he wants to be a player, musician, dancer, whatever, let him enjoy it. That is the most important thing.\n\nShare on being Captain for Manchester United and France International\n\nThey were big responsibilities. Leadership is important. Communication is very important. I speak seven different languages namely French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, English, Wolof and a bit of Danish. I am also trying to learn Korean language. I want to be able to communicate with the world. The next step will be to speak Mandarin and Arabic. I say all these because I believe it is a sign of respect to understand the language of others. I am not a genius, it is a gift and I love doing that.\n\nOn leadership skills, aside from the skill of communication, a real leader is not the one who shouts at his team mates, you need to live by example. This is my philosophy in life. I also want to create other leaders around me so that one day when I won\u2019t be around anymore, my legacy will abide. For example, for the French national team, Paul Pogba says he remembers my speech. He said whenever he speaks, he can hear my voice in his head. This is my legacy, that is my goal. You must not be selfish with your gifts. That is why when I am playing, I believe in team work. I always want my team to win, I want them to play a good game. I know my job, I know my role and that is why I was given the honour in the two teams you mentioned because they know I did not take being captain to show off or to be proud because my responsibility is beyond that.\n\nYou were regarded as one of the best left backs in the world by Alex Ferguson\u00b8 how does that make you feel?\n\nSir Alex Ferguson is the great coach in history. I share a special relationship with him, he is a father figure. I always say I have never been scared of Alex Ferguson, but I was scared to disappoint him. That is the kind of relationship I have got with him. We talk often, we are connected, I go to see him in Manchester and we spend a lot of time together. I remember when I joined Man-U, he said Patrice, I just want you to be yourself, do it for yourself, for the badge, for the fan and for me too. I am glad about the bond we share because it is a strong connection.\n\nHow did you receive the news of being signed to Manchester United?\n\nI was a bit arrogant when I was to be signed to Man-U. When my manager informed me we had gotten Man-U, I was already playing for Monaco, I won awards four years in a row, I went to the final champion\u2019s league, I played with the French national team, I was named the best youngest French player for a defender, I was big at that time so I was ready and so I signed for Manchester united, and I remember, the first game, I looked around, and it was like 75,000 people meanwhile, when I played for Monaco, I used to play in front of 7000 people or a crowd of 30,000, not more than that, and I understood that Manchester United was big, so I learnt their history because where ever I go, I love to learn the history of the place, so I buy dvds, read books and so on, so that even when I have their shirt on, I know I am carrying the history because that is really important. This is where the new generation are lagging behind, they don\u2019t do that anymore. You need to understand the value of the club, what they have done in the past and Manchester United has a massive history.\n\nWhat were the high and low points in your career?\n\nMy highest point in football was when I was 17 years old and I signed my first professional contract. I arrived at the hotel and was given a tracksuit; I was served food and all the paraphernalia of being on the team. Because I came from the street, it was new for me. I called my mum and told her I had made it. She was crying on the phone. I told her how we were being served food, how we were all dressed the same way, I felt happy because coming from nothing, that little boy had made it.\n\nMy mother is my hero and my idol. This was my highest point. Another one is the trophy. The trophy I am most proud of is the champion\u2019s league because this is the biggest achievement of football, some people even believe it is bigger than being in the world cup. On low moments, I don\u2019t have because I don\u2019t regret anything because everything happens for a reason. I live in the present because if you think about the past, you will live in regret, if you live in the future you will live in anxiety and stress and that is not who I am. I am living in the present, having a nice interview with you and enjoying myself. That is who I am.\n\nDo you miss playing professional football?\n\nNo I don\u2019t. I remember when I was playing, people were wondering what I was going to do to myself when I retire because when you play at that level, you live in a little bubble and you don\u2019t know about the real life but actually, I had so much fun and I learnt a lot even businesswise. There are different things I do, charity and all, but now, I feel like a normal human being. I do not miss football but when you ask me to play, when I do it, I enjoy it. That is the difference.\n\nWhat are your business interests?\n\nI am opened to everything. I have a very good team around me. Myself, my manager and partner, we make investment decisions. I am also learning on investment because that is a new world. I love to invest in people too. For example, in Africa, I will spend more time because the continent is creative, there are innovations here. I was in Dakar Senegal, most kids with nothing from the streets, they are very talented and creative. I think it is time to show to the world what Africa is about. There are so many geniuses. Here in Nigeria, I have been to where you call Chess In Slums Africa, under the bridge in Oshodi, Lagos and playing with them was fun.\n\nThey are young but have been training for so many years, so they win people even older than them. I want to promote that because I am from the streets and it is really important to do so. I need to visit different African countries. I will also like to go to Kenya, I have never been there, South Africa, Ghana and several African countries. I am excited about this because that is what I love to do. The excitement, the energy and the realisation of the fact that nothing is impossible if you believe, is what I live for. So, to answer your question, I am opened to several investments, even in Africa.\n\nDid you have retirement plans?\n\nEven as we get the money as professionals, the money finishes quickly. A career in football is very short. For me, now, I am coming into the new world and that is what happens to most athletes, they forget about investments. Money goes very fast but I think what is most important, again, it is not about money, it is about what you can do, what you are passionate about, what project can you do and be happy with? I feel happy traveling around the world and learning. My retirement has been a blessing and I feel grateful because every time I wake up, I am happy.\n\nWhen you choose to retire, you know the next day if you made the right decision or not. When I did and woke up the next day, I was happy. I don\u2019t miss football but football needs me. I have finished my coaching license, Manchester United offered for me to go back to the club to tutor the defense team but I want to go a different way. As a human being, I can give more and that is why I have been named captain in several teams because the coaches see that I have a good brain and I am able to drive people however, I do not close the door to football because it will be selfish. I need to share my knowledge and that is very important but right now, I am in a different position.\n\nWhy is mental health on your front burner?\n\nMental health should be the number one topic in the world. See what happened during the lockdown because of covid, people were separated from their families, there were pockets of violence reported in different parts of the world. When you are confined to a space, it is really difficult. As a sports person, you aren\u2019t able to show your vulnerability, you always need to show them that you are strong, you aren\u2019t expected to show your feelings or emotions.\n\nMy dad actually believes that crying as a man is a sign of weakness and it is wrong. It is important that you reeducate yourself to understand. That is why I always say women are very important. My mother is my best friend. Even in relationships, you need that communication. Women are like 10 years ahead compared to men. It is the truth but we should never compare and that is why I embrace equality.\n\nI am not better than you and you are not better than me, we respect each other, though women are intuitive and have foresight. With this quality, there has to be a synergy, it should be a team rather than comparing and fighting. Lack of mental health can come as depression. Like I said earlier, if as a sports person, you say you are depressed, or cry because of something, they will say you are weak.\n\nThis has to be changed. Sports people must be allowed to speak out so we can inspire others. For instance, they are now saying the World Cup needs to be played every two years and to me, this shouldn\u2019t be because, they go through deep mental health issues. Take for instance, playing for a big team like the French national team, when you lose the tournament, you need like three months to recover because the media and the fans are not happy, then you go back to your club, you have to perform there, then before you know it, another two years will come and you have to perform there again. It can\u2019t work. We are human beings and sometimes, people forget that. That is why some people get abused online, they don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat advice do you have for any young man out there who wants to be a professional football player?\n\nWhen kids come to me and they say they want to succeed, they want to be someone great, first and foremost, I encourage them to be proud of themselves and believe in their quality. Some people will try to put you down, they will tell you how you can\u2019t do what you want to do because they want to project their fears on you, do not allow that. Furthermore, it is important that you respect your mother and secondly, work hard. Your work ethic is very important. When others are asleep, it is time to get to work and training. But in life, to be successful, you need to be passionate, determined and resilient. Success is a big word, just like saying you want to be happy about what you are doing, you want to perform, you have to have passion and then success will come. It is easy to reach the top of the pyramid, but to stay at the top, you need sacrifice, take care of your body, eat healthy and use your brain not merely your physical strength.\n\nYour autobiography, I Love This Game, tell us more about it\n\nI Love This Game, the autobiography is a heartfelt insight into the trials and tribulations that made the positive and motivational public figure I am today. From growing up with 24 siblings, to being told I would not be chosen to play for teams because of the stigma attached to my gritty upbringing, to racism. My story is a tale of determination and passion in the face of adversity, which displays an inspirational journey on how to win in life, not just football.\n\nThe book reveals an astonishing story of triumph over the darkest adversity, and provides a fascinating insight into my life and career.\n\nI want this book to inspire the next generation to chase their dreams and their goals, pushing their limits but also to make sacrifices. I\u2019ve been really successful in my career, but I think the most important thing is that I have won the biggest prize and that is life and being happy, no matter the circumstance.",

We are actually trying to make it public so that Nigerians can know that we can encourage other exporters to say that the era when you export and expect your rebate and it never comes in two, three, years is gone. We are determined to make sure it succeeds. With the kind of numbers we hear from the banks we are very excited that this is working very well,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\nHe explained that the idea of the RT200 was that the country cannot continue to rely on revenues coming from crude to fund the import obligation in the country.\n\nEmefiele noted that there are four sources through which foreign currency can be raised to fund import obligations of the country. These include revenue from crude, export proceeds, Diaspora remittances and maybe foreign and direct portfolio investments into the country.\n\n\u201cWe are saying that we have relied enough on earnings from crude, which has taken too much bashing and we begin to give respite to earnings from crude and think about earnings from exports.\n\n\u201cThat is why we are saying we would encourage companies to export, encourage the banks themselves to set up aggressive export development officers and export development desk where the officers will be looking for companies that want to go into export of any items. When you export them the dollar comes in and it is sold into the new window and you earn N65 as rebate,\u201d he said.\n\nResponding to questions during the official signing of the term sheet between Infracorp and the four asset managers, Emefiele said, \u201cYou recall that we effectively started the RT200 in March but I have said that after the end of the quarter in this case March 31 2022, after around latest 14th we will issue checks, we will make payments to all those who have exported their proceeds and sold them into the new window for the good of other people that want to use it to import goods and services into the country.\u201d",

          "title": "Dr. Wiebe Boer- from Calvin alumni to president, the full circle appointment",
          "text": "The Calvin University Board of Trustees has accepted the presidential search committee\u2019s unanimous recommendation and appointed Dr. Wiebe Boer as the institution\u2019s 11th president. He currently serves as CEO of Shell All On, a renewable energy investment company in Lagos, Nigeria. \u201cWiebe personally embodies Calvin\u2019s mission with his unique life story,\u201d said Mary Tuuk Kuras, vice-chair of the board of trustees and chair of the search committee. His academic grounding, a strong sense of social justice, and depth of experience in the private and social sectors position him well to lead Calvin\u2019s next chapter with creativity, drive, and humility. His understanding of Calvin\u2019s past propels his innovative optimism for Calvin\u2019s bright future, and he is prepared to roll up his sleeves and work collaboratively with all stakeholders of our Calvin community on that journey.\u201d\n\nNotable Nigerian Calvin alumni include rapper and TASCK CEO Jude M.I Abaga, Danladi Verheijen, CEO of Verod Capital, J. R. Kanu, CEO of Reach Africa, Rire Nakpodia of Aeropostale, and Academy Award winner Rose Ibiama. Dr. Wiebe Boer sat down with editor Lehle Balde for an exclusive interview on this historical appointment, making him the third Nigerian-born president of an American university. He candidly talked about what he will miss most about Nigeria and the impact he hopes to achieve in his new role.\n\nLehle Balde:\n\nCongratulations to you, Mr. President. From CEO of All On to the president of Calvin University, your undergraduate alma mater. This is very exciting. We\u2019re happy for you. How do you feel about this move?\n\nDr. Wiebe Boer\n\nI am very excited by this new opportunity to help shape young people. The most challenging part is that I have to leave Nigeria for now. It\u2019s well known that I was born and raised here. I\u2019ve spent over 30 years of my life in Nigeria and the last 12 years here in Lagos. Nigeria is home for my family and me. And so, even though I have a U.S. passport, going to the U.S. feels like going abroad as an expatriate. But at the same time, the opportunity is such an honour. I think I will be the third Nigerian-born president of an American university; one is already in place and another one was interestingly recently announced. Nigerians are taking over everything everywhere.\n\nSo people who only know me in All On think I\u2019m an electrical engineer and that I\u2019ve been doing power my whole life. They don\u2019t know that the day I started at All On, I didn\u2019t know what P.V. (photo voltaic) was. I didn\u2019t know what a mini-grid was. I didn\u2019t know what a Solar Home System was, but because of my consulting background, I\u2019m able to learn new sectors very quickly. Higher education is another completely new sector for me. So obviously, there is going to be a steep learning curve for me both for the sector in general and Calvin University in particular.\n\nRead also: Eko Atlantic: What US Consulate office construction means for Nigerian economy\n\nI did begin my career as an academic when I did my Ph.D. in history at Yale, but I did not stay in academia. So, I do know the kind of rigour that it takes to succeed in academia, but I haven\u2019t been an academic administrator. The reason why the university chose someone like me from outside academic administration at this time is that American higher education is going through a challenging period caused by a variety of factors, including the following three:\n\nOne, the demographics are changing; there are fewer and fewer American university-aged children attending university, especially in the northern part of the United States. We will have to double down on enrollment in our traditional target markets while also looking for new markets to draw students from\u2014both in the United States and internationally.\n\nThe second reason is that higher education is one of the only sectors of knowledge intermediation that hasn\u2019t been significantly disrupted by technology. Yet, it\u2019s pretty clear that that disruption will come in terms of how university education is delivered, and in what manner, and the pandemic showed everyone what could be done remotely. I think that sort of exacerbated that switch that\u2019s going to happen. So, universities like the one I\u2019m going to will have to prepare for and get ahead of that inevitability.\n\nThe third reason is that this generation of students in the United States and elsewhere have a very different view of their place in society. They are more interested in impact than income. They\u2019re not here to wait for change to happen. They are here to make change happen now. Many from this generation question the value of sitting somewhere for four years and paying university fees. Rather, their view is: what can I get in six months to start my own business and make things start happening?\n\nOne of the considerations in Calvin University selecting someone with a non-traditional background for a university vice-chancellor is because there\u2019s a need for a leader who has a global view, a sort of an outsider who can see things in a different way \u2013 to see how we can build on what we have, innovate, and move forward.\n\nLehle Balde\n\nWhat are the things you\u2019ll miss the most about living here in Nigeria?\n\nDr. Wiebe Boer\n\nOn the personal front, what I will miss most is being home, where I belong, where I fit. This is where I know; there\u2019s no other country that I know this deeply. I was raised here, and now my wife Joanna and I have raised our four sons here. We will all miss it.\n\nSecond, the deep friendships I have. Many of the friends I have here date back to very early childhood and those are friendships that you can never replace. Thankfully, in today\u2019s connected world, it\u2019s obviously a lot easier to stay in touch. But at the end of the day, many of my closest friends from childhood live in Lagos, Jos, and Abuja, and I can see them often. But with the move, that will be different with the distance.\n\nThird, I will miss the energy and the hustle, especially in Lagos, and I think that\u2019s something I won\u2019t forget any time soon. And then obviously, I\u2019m going to miss the food, the music, the entrepreneurial energy.\n\nOn the professional front, while running All On for the past five years, I\u2019ve been blessed with the most fantastic team and worked with the most amazing boss. My boss is Osegie Okunbor, the Country Chair of Shell in Nigeria, and he\u2019s just a fantastic, wise, and inspirational boss. And then, the mission that we have at All On is about addressing the Energy Access gap, which, as you know, has become even more acute over the last few weeks. With grid failures and diesel prices going up, it\u2019s getting worse. It\u2019s an incredibly emotive issue and I would say, one of the fundamental development challenges in Nigeria that needs to be addressed. The work that we did and that All On will continue to do is something that I could feel the impact immediately on a daily basis: the impact on the end-users, but also the ability to invest in primarily young, primarily Nigerian entrepreneurs who have great ideas and who want to solve this problem from within. Witnessing that spirit is so incredibly fulfilling, and I will deeply miss that part. There\u2019s a firm commitment from Shell and All On to continue to do what it\u2019s been doing, and I still plan to stay in touch very closely and continue to provide whatever advice and guidance I can from a distance.\n\nI have been with All On for the last five years, and it is always good for a person to periodically change and move to different kinds of leadership roles, and even every organization needs a shift from time to time. I think the same thing happened with the Tony Elumelu Foundation. I was there for about four years and then moved on. We built a solid foundation, and it is growing beautifully. It\u2019s bigger and better than it was when I was there. So that\u2019s my hope for All On.\n\nLehle Balde\n\nSpeaking of impact, I purchased an inverter from one of the All On investee companies, Salpha Energy. Sandra the CEO is fantastic!\n\nDr. Wiebe Boer\n\nSandra is an example of an entrepreneur that I\u2019m so excited about supporting. She\u2019s in her mid-20s. She\u2019s building a great homegrown Solar Home System company that is beating all the international companies. My work here at All On is to equip Nigerian entrepreneurs to become the best in this space in the Nigerian market and then go after the market elsewhere. So that\u2019s good. She\u2019s built a great company. So, thanks for that very direct support.\n\nLehle Balde: What impact do you hope to have at Calvin?\n\nDr. Wiebe Boer\n\nIt\u2019s about successfully addressing those critical issues that every university is facing mentioned above and setting the university on a path to growth and market leadership. The other big one is diversity and inclusion. It\u2019s a 150-year-old school founded by Dutch immigrants to North America and is working towards embracing the diversity that makes the United States such a great country.\n\nLehle Balde: We at BusinessDay are surely all going to miss you.\n\nDr. Wiebe Boer\n\nThank you to you and to Frank Aigbogun, the BusinessDay publisher, as well as Isaac Anyaogu, and the energy team for all the support to All On and the entire renewable energy sector in Nigeria. I\u2019m going to miss all of you, but thankfully the publisher has invited me to remain on the Editorial Advisory Board which will make it easy to stay in touch.\n\nA note to all Nigerian parents looking for a great university to send their kids where they will be looked after: Calvin University is a great option. They\u2019ll feel welcome. Come to Calvin, the university president will be waiting for the children at the airport. There\u2019s a long tradition of Nigerian students going to Calvin University for the last 60 years, so there\u2019s a strong connection there that I look forward to building on.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nRecently, the Edo State Deputy Governor, Rt. Hon. Comrade Phillip Shaibu flagged-off Lassa fever eradication campaign at Auchi. He called for total neatness and cleanliness within our environments and complete adherence to all preventive measures.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are here again to deal with the disease which is a major concern to government at the moment. Today, we decided to flag off Lassa fever eradication campaign. In 2018, we did a similar thing when Auchi was almost becoming an epidemic centre. With the cooperation of all major stakeholders at all levels, we were able to reduce the impact to a single digit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis time, it is not to eliminate Lassa fever but to sustain the process to arrive at a zero digit. This time, we decided that our Royal father, the Otaru of Auchi should host us to quicken the message down to the various communities.\u201d\n\nLassa fever has caused Edo State more harm than any other diseases that has affected this state. Over twenty one persons have died of Lassa fever this year. This disease is preventable because it is transmitted to humans via rats even when it has ravaged our communities.\n\nLassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease. It was first discovered in Nigeria, when two missionary nurses became ill with the virus in 1969. Its name is derived from the village of Lassa, where it was first documented. Lassa fever is a viral infection carried by a type of rat that is common in West Africa. This is one of the most common rodents in equatorial Africa, found across much of sub-Saharan Africa. Lassa fever mainly occurs in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and Nigeria. However, the Mastomys rat is common in neighboring countries, so these areas are also at risk.\n\nOnce a Mastomys rat is infected with the virus, it can excrete the virus in its faeces and urine, potentially for the rest of its life. As a result, the virus can spread easily, especially as the rats breed rapidly and can inhabit human homes. The most common method of transmission is by consuming or inhaling rat urine or faeces. It can also be spread through cuts and open sores.\n\nThe rats live in and around human habitation, and they often come into contact with foodstuffs. Sometimes people eat the rats, and the disease can be spread during their preparation. Person-to-person contact is possible via blood, tissue, secretions or excretions, but not through touch. Sharing needles may spread the virus, and there are some reports of sexual transmission. Lassa fever can also be passed between patients and staff at poorly equipped hospitals where sterilization and protective clothing is not standard.\n\nSymptoms include: Malaria, sore throat, bleeding in the gums, nose, eyes, or elsewhere, difficulty in breathing, a cough, vomiting and diarrhea, both with blood, difficulty swallowing, hepatitis, swollen face, pain in the chest, back, and abdomen, shock, hearing loss, which may be permanent, high or low blood pressure etc.\n\nDeath can occur within 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms due to multiple organ failure. However, health organizations hope that current work on vaccine development will be successful. Rehydration and treatment of symptoms can improve the chances of survival if there is an early diagnosis.\n\nThe main focus of prevention is \u201ccommunity hygiene,\u201d to control the rat population. These include: regular hand-washing, storing foods in rodent-proof containers, keeping garbage away from the home, keeping pet cats, avoiding blood and other bodily fluids when caring for sick relatives, following safe burial procedures, using protective equipment in a healthcare setting, including masks and eyewear. There is a test centre at Irrua Specialist Hospital, Irrua, Edo State University, Uzarue and the Edo State Government is presently planning a healthy to establish a centre at Auchi Central Hospital. .\n\nThe Mastomys rat is so widespread that it cannot realistically be eradicated. As a result, the main aim is to avoid these rodents and prevent them from sharing human habitation.\n\nComrade Shaibu said: \u201cIf we have a clean environment, then we are sure of having a healthy living.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "Service of Songs: Amaechi, Dr. Otti, Dele Momodu, others pay tribute to Prince Emeka Obasi",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nIt was a time to thank God and offer worship to Him for the life of late Prince Emeka Obasi, a public relations expert and publisher of Business Hallmark Newspaper who passed away on Tuesday March 15, when family, friends and well-wishers gathered on Friday evening at the Trinity House, Trinity Avenue, Victoria Island, Lagos for his Service of Songs, the first in a series of events leading to his final journey home in Umuahia, Abia State on April 14.\n\nThe well attended event which witnessed worship songs and prayers, also offered many of the late publisher\u2019s friends, brothers and former colleagues an opportunity to reminisce about the wonderful life he lived in his 58-year sojourn on mother earth.\n\nOn the occasion, notable personalities like Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation and former governor Rivers State; Dr. Alex Otti, former bank CEO and governorship candidate; Dele Momodu, publisher of Ovation magazine and presidential hopeful, among others, took turns to pay tribute to the departed.\n\nEmeka was a brilliant journalist \u2013 Amaechi\n\nIn his remarks at the event, Amaechi, the transport minister, who said he had been friends with Prince Obasi from a very young age, described as a brilliant journalist who was exceptional in his calling.\n\nAmaechi said Obasi\u2019s passing came to him as a surprise, as he didn\u2019t expect him to die so soon.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to speak when somebody who is close to you just died. I used to have this believe that when you are 50 to 60 years, life is just starting, but Emeka\u2019s death got me really frightened because he was just a year older than me. And honestly, I didn\u2019t expect that he would die so soon. We thought he would do whatever it took to stay alive, but his death has taught me a lesson, that not even money can\u2019t buy you health when the time comes,\u201d Amaechi said.\n\nAccording to the minister, he had spoken with another friend of the late publisher, and they were ready to assist in any form to ensure that whatever is necessary is done to ensure that he survived, but unfortunately he passed on.\n\n\u201cWe were actually ready to do everything it took to make sure he survived, but I\u2019m really disappointed that he had to die. However, you and I know that it is beyond us. It is God that decides. But we take solace in the fact that Emeka lived a wonderful life. He was such a good journalist,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI met him at a very young age; we were quite young at the time and we remained close as friends. We told jokes to each other and when he made me realize that he was ill, I discussed with another close friend of ours, and we decided that we were going to do whatever it took to help him. So, when that friend called me to say that Emeka was dead, it was shocking to me.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy for me to be here, but I had to come to honour him, and I hope that all of us who are his friends will stand by the family when the need arises.\u201d\n\nEmeka was a merchant of hope, refused to prepare us for his death- Dr. Otti\n\nDr. Alex Otti, public intellectual and former bank chief, described the late publisher, who is a close friend of his, as merchant of hope who was almost optimistic about life and had refused to prepare them, his friends, for his passing.\n\nOtti who said Prince Obasi\u2019s death is still like a dream to him, even though it\u2019s true.\n\n\u201cIt is still like a dream, but it\u2019s true. On that Monday morning when I had the privilege of driving Emeka to the hospital in Ikeja, little did I know that it was the last time I was going to see him. As I said in my tribute, Emeka was a merchant of hope and he refused to prepare us for what we are doing today,\u201d he said.\n\nHe had so much energy and radiated so much courage. Of course, we should have known that he was down with a very rare auto immune disease, which gives you a maximum of two years, since 2014, but because of the energy in him and the optimism he radiated, we never thought that this day would come so soon. And of course, he battled it for eight years.\n\n\u201cHe had assured me that he was OK. And each time you come to him, even though he struggled to breathe without the oxygen, his smiles never disappeared. In fact, he would be the one encouraging you and it was a bit funny because you were the one trying to sympathize with him. He would ask you to have hope, but more importantly, he accepted Jesus Christ wholeheartedly. I\u2019m left in no doubt about where he is headed.\u201d\n\nDr. Otti also paid tribute to the wife of the diseased, Dr. Betty, describing her as a wonderful woman who took very good care of her husband throughout the period of her illness.\n\n\u201cDr. Betty, his wife, is a wonderful woman. Betty is a medical doctor but she put everything about her life on hold since 2014, to care for Emeka and the family. She is a caregiver, a nurse and a wife; she is everything,\u201d Otti said.\n\nEmeka personified bravery, courage, elegance \u2013 Momodu\n\nPaying tribute to the late Prince Obasi at the event, Dele Momodu, presidential hopeful and media mogul, described him as bright star who made great impact in his lifetime.\n\nMomodu who went down memory lane to 1990 when he first met Prince Obasi at Classique Magazine, then published by May Ellen Ezekial, said he stood out at the time as a very courageous journalist.\n\n\u201cI meet Prince Emeka, as we called him, at Classique Magazine in 1990. He was very brave, very colorful and very regal. His confidence stood him out. Classique was a lifestyle magazine and Emeka was a personification of that elegance. The way he dressed and the way he spoke, he exuded elegance and we all loved him,\u201d Momodu said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was sick as such because he would always call me and in the course of our conversations, he would only say he is just down. And the last time we spoke, he was asking me to speak to a president they wanted to give an award. He was still asking for the usual things. That was Emeka for you.\n\n\u201cEven though we mourn him, I congratulate his family because it is not how long you live, it is how well, and Emeka lived a good life. He touched many lives positively and that something to be grateful for.\u201d\n\nHe had a brilliant career \u2013 Bisi Olatilo\n\nAlso paying tribute to the late Obasi, popular TV host and founder of Biscon TV, Chief Bisi Olatilo, said he had a great career and made huge impact even though he didn\u2019t live long.\n\nOlatilo said the late publisher treated him like his elder brother, and he had so much love and admiration for him.\n\n\u201cEmeka treated me like his elder brother. He showed me so much respect and I loved him,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe succeeded early in life and we his close friends -those you could consider his elder brothers \u2013 were worried that he wasn\u2019t married. So, we constituted ourselves into a committee that now focused on making sure that he got a wife, and when the whole issue got sorted out, he thanked me specially for the role I played.\n\n\u201cI cannot say much more than what has been said. We were all saddened by the death that cut short his brilliant career, but we take solace in the fact that he lived a good life. Emeka did so many things and he succeeded in almost everything he did. I\u2019m proud to have known Emeka, and I thank those who interceded when he needed prayers.\u201d\n\nKnowing him was the greatest thing that happened to my life \u2013 Uche Chris\n\nEqually paying tribute to the late Prince Obasi, Mr. Uche Chris, the managing editor of Business Hallmark, which he published, said coming across him was the best event that happened in his life.\n\n\u201cKnowing Publisher, as well called him, was the greatest thing that happened in my life. It was in 2006 and I was in Port Harcourt, but my family was here in Lagos. I wanted to return to Lagos, but I needed to have something doing in the state. So, I saw an advert he placed that cost N360, 000 and I was the only person that applied for the job. He used to say that it was good value for him to have gotten me through that advert. And since then, we have been working together,\u201d Mr. Chris said.\n\n\u201cThe first time I met him; the day I came for an interview, the first question he asked me was, \u2018What book are you reading now?\u2019 That\u2019s the question he never failed to ask any applicant and woe betide you if you say you were not reading any book. He loved excellence and valued hard work.\n\n\u201cI had applied for the role of editor, but he said I would give me deputy editor since he didn\u2019t know much about me. But within one month, he made me the editor and subsequently promoted three times within a short period of time.\u201d\n\nI lost a great mentor and friend \u2013 Ramon Nasir\n\nMr. Ramon Nasir, head of corporate communications at the United Bank for Africa (UBA), noted in his own remarks, that the late Obasi was a mentor who took him by the hand and guided him through life.\n\nHe also paid tribute to the courage displayed by the deceased even on his sickbed.\n\n\u201cI lost a great man. I saw him few days before he died, I used to go to his house and like somebody said, he was a merchant of hope. I\u2019m quite an emotional person and anytime I go to see him, he would see the cry in me, but he would quickly say to me, \u201cRamon, please, God is in control.\u201d He would be the person consoling me,\u201d Mr. Nasir said.\n\n\u201cFew days before his death, he couldn\u2019t talk. So, he signalled me to be saying something, and as I was talking he was just nodding his head. But at some point, I couldn\u2019t control myself any more, so I had to go outside.\u201d\n\nMr. Nasir said he got to know Obasi more than a decade and a half ago as rookie media relations officer, and he played a very instrumental role in his growth in the profession.\n\n\u201cI got to know Prince about 16 years ago, as a rookie media relations officer and he was so instrumental to my development. I called him my mentor. He practically held my hands and showed me the way in the profession and I will be ever grateful. He was a good man, and in Dr. Betty, his wife, I saw a very wonderful wife. She left everything else to carter to her husband, and I pray that God gives her the strength.\u201d\n\nEmeka was a great philanthropist who helped many \u2013 Okezie Obasi\n\nHon. Okezie Obasi, a house of assembly hopeful and younger brother of the late publisher, in his own tribute, said his late brother was a philanthropist who assisted so many people.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult to believe that my brother is gone. We were very close and spoke three times every day. He taught me almost everything I know about life. He was a compassionate person; very charitable, and had style and elegance. He was a man of courage. He was brutally honest when he is passionate about any issue,\u201d Obasi said.\n\n\u201cHe was a philanthropist who helped the under privileged. In Umuahia, I have list of widows that he gives money on a monthly basis. In February, shortly before his death, he started building a health centre in our village. There is a widow he is currently building a three-bedroom house for, which is at the point of completion. He cared about others and often asked after people.\n\n\u201cLately, he often said to me that things are very difficult and would ask me how people are coping. Then he would send me money to give to certain people and say, \u2018Go there personally and give them, don\u2019t send anybody.\u2019\n\n\u201cOne thing I find remarkable about him is that he has a very strong memory. He remembers things that happened 30 to 40 years ago, even before I was born. Our grandmother worshipped at Church of Christ, and he decided that because she worshipped there, he must sink a borehole for the church. He did that two months ago. The month that he died, he gave me N1 million to give to an Anglican Church where my mother worshipped.\u201d\n\nEmeka was a great intellectual \u2013 Tony Chiejina\n\nAlso paying tribute to the late Obasi, Anthony Chiejina, head of corporate communications at the Dangote Group, said he was a great intellectual who read voraciously.\n\n\u2018I liken Emeka to Winston Churchill, he was a very committed man; very bright and highly talented. He succeeded in almost everything he did. He was such a gifted man and was very courageous. Emeka was somebody who would stand and tell you the truth at any point,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe was always there for me. In my difficult years, he kept advising me, even when he took ill, it was the same.\n\n\u201cHe was a restless man who read a lot. I also read a lot so, each time we were together, we were always exchanging ideas. Meeting Emeka was always a sort intellectual boxing contest. And throughout the period of his illness, he displayed the same courage, the same fighting spirit; the same zeal and the same love God and humanity.\n\n\u201cI learned a lot of from him.

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nHis Royal Highness, Loowa of Ife, Adekola Adeyeye, on Thursday reacted to the spate of criticisms against their son Senator Iyiola Omisore following his emergence as APC national secretary, saying they are being done in bad faith.\n\nThe Ife Kingmaker who described Omisore as a man of profound moral scruples and a highly resourceful son of Ile-Ife, berated what he described as the ill-fated people who choose not to recognised Omisore\u2019s immense contributions to the cradle of the Yoruba.\n\nIn a chat with some selected journalists at his palace along Ifewara Road Ile Ife, the Loowa said he expected some influential Yoruba leaders to condemn the uncomplimentary remarks on Omisore, crude propaganda and other desperate moves of the Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka.\n\n\u201cWith absolute certainty, I can always, conveniently and openly vouch for the integrity, appropriateness and decency of Otunba (Senator) Iyiola Omisore, one of the highly resourceful sons of Ile-Ife, who today by the grace of God is the National Secretary of All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cAlthough, I still have tremendous respect for Prof. Wole Soyinka and the honor he brought to our country through his literary prowess, however, his recent diatribe and misleading assertions as contained in a statement credited to him at the weekend that the endorsement of Omisore as APC National Secretary by President Muhammadu Buhari would tamper with judicial inquiries into Ige\u2019s death because Omisore is a prime suspect in the murder case, I will say with all modesty that is most unfortunate and very embarrassing.\u201d Loowa stated\n\nThe monarch stressed further, \u201cI was grossly disgusted by these cruel and vile allegations about a profoundly gentleman and I am equally constrained to stand up and speak out for this political icon and an illustrious son of Ife at a time like this. Premeditated lies coupled with a heavy dosage of libel and slander against our fellow human beings, particularly when they are our compatriots, diminish us all, to say the least. It is my expectation that some influential Yoruba leaders will come out boldly to condemn the uncomplimentary remarks on Omisore, crude propaganda and other desperate moves of the Nobel laureate.\u201d\n\n\u201cProf. Soyinka shouldn\u2019t have dragged himself into a controversial conversation like this which many of us found very distasteful, particularly as it involves the death of former Attorney-General of the Federation, Chief Bola Ige and linking it to a man pronouncedv innocent by a court of competent juridiction , especially at this sensitive moment when the country is heading towards another general elections is utterly unthinkable. Prof Soyinka and others who think like him should know that Nigeria can no longer be driven by this type of unnecessary and dangerous narrative\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAs an elderstateman, and an octogenarian, I expected the literary icon to know better that such unhealthy development would not do the Yoruba nation proud. There is a moral obligation on the part of the state to solve every murder case, much less the one concerning a sitting Attorney General of the Federation in the case of Chief Bola Ige and that has nothing to do with Omisore whose records over the years are clean and without blemishes.\u201d\n\nMaking reference to history, Loowa stressed that, Yoruba must not allow itself to be used against itself under any guise as previously witnessed in the past.\n\n\u201cYorubas really need to be careful, especially our elders, they should eschew the politics of hate, bitterness and division and renounce those that seek to destroy the names and hard- earned reputations of others simply because they see them as an obstacle to achieving their political aspirations. History has repeated itself in this similar instance, and some of the sad examples are that of late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo and also the acclaimed winner of 1993 Presidential election, Bashorun MKO Abiola, they were both known to be victims of Yoruba\u2019s war against Yorubas, this must not be allowed to repeat itself anymore, Yoruba must \u201cRonu\u201d and do serious self introspection so that we will not be victims of circumstances all of the time.\u201d\n\nChief Adekola also used the occasion to appeal to the Nobel Laureate to retrace his step, adding that it is God that has elevated Omisore to where he is today.\n\n\u201cHowever in the spirit of decency, balance and godliness, I honestly urge Prof. Soyinka and others like him to desist from vicious and callous smear campaign against our son Otunba Iyiola Omisore and try and come to terms with the fact that it does not serve them well to attempt to disgrace or destroy one of the brightest stars in the South-West and indeed Nigeria and I assure them that God has elevated Omisore, no one can bring him down no matter how highly placed.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed my sincere prayer that God will help us all and protect us from evil, wicked, mindless and destructive individuals who are prepared to do anything to achieve power at the detriment of others. In the light of this, I once again stand with Otunba (Senator) Iyiola Omisore and nothing can change that, and every gang ups against him will never stand. May God bless Yorubaland and accordingly bless Nigeria.\u201d Oba Adekola concluded",

They only accredited three Local Governments out of 20 on the day of election and they went in to start voting. How do you know who is from where?\n\n\u2018\u2019The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) wrote a report that they accredited only three local governments out of 20 . INEC confirmed that after the voting they counted only three ballot boxes, the thirty four other boxes were left uncounted, no sorting that as far as their processes are concerned the election is inconclusive. Governor Diri went ahead to announce some jokers as winners. \u2019\u2019\n\nHarping on the vexed issues of zoning , Chief George warned the party against leaving its 2023 presidential ticket open for all members to contest, saying PDP must make a definitive statement that it is zoning the presidency to the south in line with the constitution of the party . They must come out categorically to say it . I am saying this for posterity sake. Zoning is the political spinal cord of the party it is like that of human beings if something affects it you are done for life.\u2018\u2019\n\nAccording to him, it was in a bid to ensure that a section of the country is ruling , while others are onlookers necessitating the issue of zoning.\n\n\u2018\u2019 That is why it is rotated in such a way that whatever has been in the North after eight years must come to the South; whatever has been in the South for the last eight years must go to the North. It guarantees that commitment, it guarantees that oneness, it guarantees that you have a sense of belonging to this country called Nigeria,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

And we also think that equity and justice are important pillars that will ultimately stabilise our politics towards our journey in rescuing Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is our position and that is why we have met today.\n\n\u201cWe think what this country is lacking today is our ability to dispense equity and justice.

What is it that if we do it today we serve with the fairness of equity and justice. It is to zone Presidency to the South.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was attended by the Governor of Oyo State Seyi Makinde, that of Rivers State Nyesom Wike, Akwa Ibom State Udom Emmanuel, Bayelsa state Douye Diri and governor of Enugu State Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi.",

The European Commission has been asked to coordinate the delivery of fuel, seeds, fertilisers and agricultural machines to the country.\n\nFor his part, Putin warned on Tuesday that, against the backdrop of global food shortages, Russia would \u201chave to be prudent with supplies abroad and carefully monitor such exports to countries that are clearly hostile towards us\u201d.\n\nFAO chief Qu Dongyu called Friday on countries not to restrict food exports, which would only worsen the situation for countries dependent imports.\n\n\u201cAbove all, we must not shut down our global trade system, and exports should not be restricted or taxed,\u201d he said.\n\nThe FAO also called for aid to vulnerable nations to boost planting.\n\n\u201cOne and a half billion dollars would be sufficient for immediate agricultural assistance that would save the lives of some 50 million people by allowing the growing of food where the need is most keen,\u201d said Rein Paulsen, head of the agency\u2019s emergencies office, in a letter to AFP.\n\nThe conflict has also sent oil and gas prices through the roof, causing inflation to rise further across the world and raising concerns that it could derail global economic growth.\n\nAFP",

Like I love mine,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cevery single penny she earns in the UK she pays UK taxes on\u201d.\n\nA person\u2019s domicile is usually the country which their father considered his permanent home when the person was born, although this can change if the person plans to permanently live in Britain.\n\nMurty is legally entitled to claim the status, but she had ultimately declaring that the UK \u2014 the country in which her husband holds the second-most important political office \u2014 is not her permanent home.\n\nAnd contradicting Sunak, tax lawyers had noted that Murty could still pay taxes in Britain on her global income without renouncing her Indian citizenship.\n\nAllies of the finance minister told the Daily Telegraph newspaper that they believed Johnson\u2019s office was behind damaging recent leaks.\n\nThey said the prime minister believed Sunak had not backed him strongly enough during an ongoing scandal into Downing Street lockdown parties.\n\nJohnson denied knowledge of any briefing operation against Sunak, and told reporters that his chancellor was doing an \u201cabsolutely outstanding job\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think people\u2019s families should be dragged into things,\u201d he said.\n\nA recent YouGov poll showed Sunak\u2019s rating falling by 24 percentage points over the past two weeks, following a budget statement that was criticised for ignoring the plight of struggling Britons.",

(Anthony Hopkins, who won for his role in \u201cThe Father\u201d last year, handed the best actress statuette to \u201cThe Eyes of Tammy Faye\u201d star Jessica Chastain this year.)\n\nIn recent weeks, Smith, who won a best actor Oscar for \u201cKing Richard\u201d after he hit Rock, faced intense scrutiny over his behavior at the Dolby Theatre on March 27.\n\nIn a tearful acceptance speech, Smith apologized to the academy. He apologized to Rock in a statement the next day.\n\nIn the open letter, signed by academy president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson, the organization thanked Rock for keeping his cool immediately after he was slapped.\n\n\u201cWe want to express our deep gratitude to Mr. Rock for maintaining his composure under extraordinary circumstances,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe also want to thank our hosts, nominees, presenters and winners for their poise and grace during our telecast.\u201d\n\nThe academy apologized for not taking steps to \u201cadequately address the situation in the room\u201d after the incident.\n\n\u201cFor this, we are sorry. This was an opportunity for us to set an example for our guests, viewers and our Academy family around the world, and we fell short \u2014 unprepared for the unprecedented,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe academy\u2019s standards of conduct rules are not tied to awards eligibility, a spokesperson for the group said, meaning that Smith could conceivably be nominated for his work in a film over the next decade and beyond. He next stars in the slavery-themed drama \u201cEmancipation,\u201d which Apple TV+ has said it plans to release sometime this year.\n\nIn \u201cKing Richard,\u201d Smith portrays Richard Williams, the ambitious father of tennis superstars Venus and Serena Williams. He was also one of the producers of the film.",

          "text": "The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) on Friday told President Muhammadu Buhari that the financiers of terrorism in the country could be traced and checked through the application of the principles of forensic accounting.\n\nThe ICAN leadership, during a courtesy visit on Friday to the President at the State House, Abuja, told him that the Institute was ready to avail the country of its technical competences in forensic audit and work with security agencies to expose the perpetrators of the illegal business.\n\nICAN President, Mrs Comfort Olu Eyitayo, who spoke on behalf of the Institute, emphasised that Forensic Accounting, working with security outfits, could be used to reduce the security challenges facing the country by tracking all monies used in committing crimes, and payments.\n\nShe said, \u201cWe are worried with the nefarious activities of some bad elements in the society who engage in the dastardly acts of terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, killings for ritual purposes, among many others.\n\n\u201cFighting terrorism is a big challenge across the world and we commend the efforts being made to stem this tide in our country.\n\n\u201cAs Chattered Accountants, we acknowledge our role in combating terrorism by the application of the principles of forensic accounting and following the money to fish out the perpetrators of these illegal activities.\n\n\u201cSir, we would continue to avail the country of our technical competences in forensic audit, working with other security agencies to expose these enemies of progress.\u201d\n\nThe ICAN boss also disclosed that the Institute has signed a Memorandum of Understanding, (MoU) with the Nigerian Police Academy on forensic investigations and auditing aimed at contributing to the national desire for a prosperous economy.\n\nEyitayo said the Institute had established seven faculties to train accountants in specialised fields, which include forensic accounting, adding that \u201cit is noteworthy that the Institute had signed an MoU with the Nigerian Police Academy on forensic investigations and auditing.\u201d\n\nShe appreciated President Buhari and his administration for adhering to best accounting principles and practices to secure and revive the economy, particularly by reverting to the January to December budget calendar.\n\nEyitayo, however, said ICAN was taken aback by a memo that emanated from the Head of Civil Service of the Federation, stating that professional certificates would no longer be used as qualification for entry level into the nation\u2019s civil service.\n\nAccording to her: \u201cThis, to say the least, is a most unfortunate development, because encouraging professionalism across all levels of government would give traction to the quality of service delivered by our civil servants.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to you (Buhari) sir to use your esteemed office to analyse the merits and demerits of this decision and direct that it should be retraced.\u201d\n\nWelcoming the delegation, President Buhari declared that professionals in various fields, especially accounting, provide the strength and framework for thriving economies, assuring that his administration will continue to engage experts to gain measurable and reliable results.\n\nThe President noted the contributions of the Institute in ensuring probity, accountability and transparency, urging more diligence and professionalism.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cHaving served as a military Head of State, and returned to politics to serve as a President, after losing three elections, I have seen the system of accountability in the country, and the mess to be cleaned up.\u201d\n\nDescribing ICAN as a \u201csocial stabiliser\u201d of the economy, the President said he would go through the reports and recommendations of the Institute on inclusivity and strengthening of the nation\u2019s accounting system for growth.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "text": "It emerged on Friday that six banks were fined N1.315 billion by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in the 2021 financial year for failing to comply with regulations prohibiting their customers from trading in cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn the latest revelation from the banks\u2019 full year 2021 financial report, First City Monument Bank (FCMB), Fidelity Bank Plc. and Wema Bank were fined a total of N514 million crypto infractions.\n\nThe FCMB was fined N400 million over its failure to close four accounts of customers said to be involved in cryptocurrency trading.\n\nFidelity Bank Plc. received a sanction of N14.28 million for cryptocurrency infractions, the bank said in its 2021 audited financial statement.\n\nWema Bank got a penalty of N100 million for contravening the CBN circular on cryptocurrency.\n\nIt also emerged earlier in the week that a N800 million penalty was imposed by the CBN on three banks \u2013 Access Bank Plc., Stanbic IBTC, and the United Bank for Africa Plc. \u2013 also for violating regulations barring customers from transacting in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe UBA was fined N100 million for a customer\u2019s digital-currency transactions. Access Bank Plc. was fined N500 million for failing to shut down customers\u2019 crypto accounts, according to a filing with the Nigerian Exchange Limited.\n\nStanbic IBTC Bank was fined N200 million for two accounts allegedly used for crypto transactions.\n\nThe total penalties imposed so far for contravening the CBN circular on cryptocurrency is a massive N1.315 billion for the six banks.\n\nThe apex bank issued a circular on February 5, 2021, warning and reminding local financial institutions against conducting crypto transactions or enabling payments for crypto exchanges.\n\nIt directed financial institutions to close the accounts of anyone participating in or operating cryptocurrency exchanges immediately.\n\nThe CBN has ignored pushback against its crypto regulation and has advised Nigerians to adopt its CBDC, the eNaira.\n\nThe penalties are part of efforts by the apex bank to ensure that banks implement an order to block trading in cryptocurrencies due to the threat they pose to Nigeria\u2019s financial system.\n\nDespite these regulations, Nigeria accounts for the largest volume of cryptocurrency transactions outside the United States., according to Paxful, a Bitcoin marketplace.\n\nThe country also has the largest proportion of retail users conducting crypto transactions under $10,000, Chainalysis says.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Stanbic IBTC, Wole Adeniyi, during an investor conference call in Lagos last Tuesday confirmed that his bank was fined N200 million for two accounts alleged to have been used for crypto transactions.\n\nAdeniyi said that while Stanbic IBTC followed the apex bank\u2019s directive, the transactions it was sanctioned for might have passed through its system undetected.\n\nHe noted that the CBN was able to detect the relevant transactions using an \u201cadvanced capability\u201d that\n\nNigerian banks don\u2019t have access to, and they\u2019ve asked the apex bank to share the technology.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem that they are going to entertain a refund, but they are now sharing intelligence with us to be able to kind of deter clients,\u201d he added.\n\nBennett Oghifo",
