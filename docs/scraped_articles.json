          "title": "TOKUNBO: You can now identify junk vehicles",
          "text": "\u2026as MotoChekit/CARFAX berths in Nigeria with VHR\n\nBy Kennedy Mbele\n\nAn Automobile Information Service Provider, MotoChekit, has berthed in Nigeria to help individuals and firms desirous of importing used vehicles (popularly called Tokunbo) make the right purchase decisions.\n\nPromoters of the company, Segun Abiodun and Ayo Tifase said at its inauguration in Lagos last week, that they were also out to help the Federal Government curb the unbridled importation of salvaged or junk vehicles.\n\nThey explained they were providing Nigerians with Vehicle History Reports (VHRs) at a reduced cost compared to what is obtainable in the Global VHR market.\n\nAyo Tifase said: \u201cA large percentage of the Tokunbo vehicles imported into Nigeria are defective as most of them are Accidented and Refurbished\u201d. Consequently, a lot of these vehicles develop copious problems when the buyers start using them. He added that, prospective buyers in Nigeria can save themselves some of these headaches if they avail themselves of Vehicle History Reports provided by MotoChekit.\n\nThese reports provide pointers to some of these issues. He also added that VHRs have always been available in developed countries where Tokunbo Vehicles are sourced from, but that the reports are expensive when sourced directly, a situation that MotoChekit is here to change.\n\nAsked why payment for VHRs should be made when they are readily available online, Segun Abiodun replied: \u201cInformation about vehicles cannot just be gotten by googling it. Free information on the internet comprises just basic information, it is not comprehensive enough to aid decision-making on whether to buy a vehicle or not. \u201c\n\n\u201cMotoChekit reports powered by CARFAX covers a wide range of areas that are key for decision-making. They consist of Accident Data, which includes Accident History, Damage Severity (Severe/Minor), Damage Location/ Point of Impact, Records of Damage Repair, Airbag Deployment, Structural Damage, etcetera.\n\nThey also comprise Service History, which includes oil changes, tire rotations, open recalls, brake rotor replacement, transmission replacement, safety inspections and so on.\n\n\u201cThere is also what is called type of Use Information. This information tells you if the vehicle was personal, Rental, Taxi, lease, commercial or even used by security agents. MotoChekit reports also indicates the ownership history of the vehicle from the time it rolled of out the showroom as brand new to the most recent owner. It also includes the state(s) or province(s) it had been used, the length of ownership by its user(s), last reported mileage, odometer rollback, flood or lemon tile, etc.\n\n\u201cSuch detailed information are not available on Google.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what the federal government can do to curb the influx of junk vehicles into the country, Ayo Tifase suggested that the Federal Government can curb the excessive importation of salvaged / junk vehicles by improving the transport infrastructure in the country and an unambiguous policy on standard of imported vehicles.\n\nHe said: \u201cPeople import cars for a variety of reasons. Principal of the reasons being the need to move from point A to Point B. Unbridled importation will continue if there are no alternatives to move goods and services to the length and breadth of the country.\n\n\u201cIt therefore goes without saying, that government has a critical role to play in improving the transportation infrastructure in the country. This will reduce the need for everybody to own a car as is the case in developed countries.\n\n\u201cAnother way to curb this pattern of used vehicle importation is for the government to set a standard for the vehicles that can be imported. The checklist could include Age of Vehicle and the availability of a clean report from the MotoChekit platform.\u201d",

          "text": "The Governor of Abia State, Okezie Ikpeazu, has called on the media to rise to the occasion as governments at all levels search for an end to the myriads of security challenges threatening the unity and peaceful coexistence of Nigeria.\n\nIkpeazu also called on the media once again to be circumspect and install effective internal professional checks and balances in crime reportage.\n\nThe Abia Governor made the call in his keynote speech delivered at the National Conference of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) held in Port Harcourt, Rivers State on Monday.\n\nHe reminded the media that it has a responsibility to save the country by de-escalating the reportage of the activities of criminal elements.\n\nInsecurity: Government, security agencies charged to be proactive in policing Osun\n\nAccording to Ikpeazu, \u201cOur newspapers and other media stories are dominated by narratives from those benefiting from this crisis who seek an escalation of hostilities for their nefarious objectives.\n\n\u201cThe Media has a duty not to amplify those voices and not to undertake their task for them. If someone says the sky is brown, it is not for the media to report verbatim that A said the sky is brown.\n\n\u201cThe Media also have a role to fact-check and see for themselves the actual colour of the sky; if not, you are helping propagate falsehood and division.\n\nIf you are fighting insecurity and criminal elements, the oxygen with which they thrive is propaganda and reportage of their activities so the Nigerian Media needs to decide to what extent they want to continue being the propagators of the actions of criminal elements.\n\nBoko Haram elements have taken over Niger State \u2013 Gov Bello cries out\n\n\u201cThe media has a responsibility to save this country by de-escalating the reportage of the activities of criminal elements. I am not advocating for a media blackout on criminality. Far from it, I am only saying that the Media should help us by not offering exposure and propaganda outlets to criminal elements. The way we are going, I am afraid that we are playing into the hands of those who are profiting from the crisis situation in the country\u201d.\n\nContinuing, Ikpeazu stated, \u201cthe Media has also unwittingly promoted label-culture and stereotyping such that people from certain groups are labeled collectively as a result of the actions of a few and there is a haste to ascribe crimes to them because the public has been led to believe that they are the ones who commit certain types of crimes.\n\n\u201cThis is an ill-wind that will note bode well for us in our quest for national unity. Security agencies must be given the chance to conduct investigations and come out with official reports before we ascribe crimes to their perpetrators.\n\n\u201cThe practice of reporting crime and criminal activities with assumed suspected perpetrators will only cause further division among us and perhaps, exonerate the real culprits. I call on the media once again to be circumspect and install effective internal professional checks and balances in crime reportage,\u201d Governor Ikpeazu concluded.\n\nNCC to balance competition with disruptive technologies for sustainable telecoms\u2019 growth \u2013 Prof Danbatta",

          "title": "Govt negligence, herdsmen, climate change crippling farming in Anambra",
          "text": "Farming in Anambra State has come under the heavy blows of climate change, herdsmen attacks, government negligence and others, writes EMMA ELEKWA\n\nFor Monica Igbokwe, farming has never been as frustrating as it has been in recent times. As one with over thirty years\u2019 experience, farming had always been more of a passion than business as a result of apparent benefits derivable from it.\n\nAside from taking care of her family responsibilities, including paying children school fees, house rents and other bills, there is this fun and fulfilment associated with farming, not only at harvest time but even amidst the inherent labour and stress.\n\nBut all the euphoria of joy and satisfaction had suddenly evaporated and are being replaced with frustrations, agony and misery. No thanks to Nigeria\u2019s choking economy and its attendant consequences on the business of farming.\n\n\u201cTo worsen the matter is the total neglect and abandonment farmers suffer in the hands of government and its officials. Before now, we hardly beg for farm inputs like seedlings, fertilisers and other inputs. All these were more or less our entitlements.\n\n\u201cAs if those were not enough, the incessant farmer-herder clash has further aggravated the situation, making farming a nightmare,\u201d Igbokwe observed.\n\nThese were the lamentations of Igbokwe, a member of Small Scale Women Farmers Organisation of Nigeria (SWOFON) and Coordinator, Nnewi South in Anambra State, who said she farms cassava, yam, cocoyam and other crops.\n\nShe said she would have long called it quits with the farm business, like several of her colleagues, if not for the love and passion she has for the profession. She alleged that the assistance from the government was being diverted to those she described as political farmers.\n\nAgriculture has remained the main source of livelihood for many Nigerians. Approximately 70% of the people directly rely on agriculture as means of living. According to Gender Policy in Agriculture, women, who constitute 49% of the nation\u2019s population, carry out about 80% of agricultural production, 60% of agricultural processing activities and 50% of animal husbandry and related activities.\n\nDespite the enormous benefits derivable from agriculture, those engaged in it in Nigeria, particularly the farmers have continued to suffer untold neglect and abandonment by the government at all levels.\n\nThe worst hit are the women farmers who are said to constitute over 70 per cent of the entire agricultural workforce. These categories of farmers have not only been starved of essential materials for their businesses but also have become endangered species as a result of their vulnerability.\n\nAmong these disadvantaged women are the smallholder farmers who constitute about 60% of the agricultural labour force. This set of women farmers, under the Small Scale Women Farmers Organisation of Nigeria (SWOFON), have continued to decry total abandonment despite efforts, including developing a form of a charter of demands expected to address their numerous challenges.\n\nIn Anambra State, total capital expenditure in 2015 was N110.979 billion. It declined to N52.696 billion in 2016. In 2017, the total capital expenditure rose to N63.282 billion and saw a further rise in 2018 to N106.432 billion. It however suffered a downward trend in 2019 to N91.835 billion.\n\nHowever, the state budgeted N1.384billion for smallholder farmers in 2015, N706 million in 2016, N546.06 million budgeted in 2017, N3.17 billion in 2018, and N1.58billion in 2019. These figures cover provisions made by eight Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to assist smallholder farmers in the area. The MDAs are Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Economic Planning, Budget and Development Partners, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Social Welfare, Children and Women Affairs, Ministry of Trade, Commerce, Markets and Wealth Creation, Agricultural Development Project, Fisheries and Aquaculture Development Commission, and Office of the Governor.\n\nUnder the Ministry of Agriculture, provisions were for Produce Storage and Fumigation Scheme, Credit Facilitated Comprehensive Irrigation, Drainage & Swamp Development, Seed Multiplication and Horticultural Development Project, Anambra State Rice Project, Agricultural Extension Information Services and Fertiliser Procurement and Distribution, procurement of agro-inputs, as well as Veterinary Field Services.\n\nThe Agricultural Development Programme, ADP made provisions such as IDA support to National FADAMA Development Project (NFDP \u2013III), Cassava Mosaic Distribution. (CMD), Sustainability of Multi-St. Agricultural Development Programme (MSADP-I) and IFAD/FGN Support for Value Chain Development Programme (VCDP). The provisions under the Ministry of Social Welfare, Children and Women Affairs were for the purchase of equipment for Women Cooperative Societies (WCS), Poverty Eradication Programme, Loan Grant to Women Co-operatives as well as Micro-credit Loan for Women Co-operatives.\n\nFrom the Office of the Governor, provisions were for Special Mandate Projects (Faith-based Micro Credit Scheme) and Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs) Project, while the Ministry of Economic Planning, Budget and Development Partners budgeted for State Programme on Food and Nutrition. The provision by the Ministry of Trade, Commerce, Markets and Wealth Creation was only for Cooperative Credit Scheme.\n\nMeanwhile, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) disclosed that the state government accessed N2 billion and N1.5 billion under its Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme (CACS) and Accelerated Agricultural Development Scheme (AADS) respectively in 2020.\n\nThe funds, according to the Branch Controller of the apex bank in Awka, Mr Benedict Maduagwu, would stimulate the agricultural value chain, which incidentally remains one of the core pillars of the governor Willie Obiano led administration.\n\nAmidst all these provisions still, the women farmers in the state have continued to experience crippling farming episodes. Those who spoke to The Nation in their farms located at various communities across the state virtually had similar sorry tales, particularly with regards to accessing loans, financial aid or grants, either from the federal or state governments, including the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP).\n\nThey lamented the lack of necessary inputs such as fertiliser, agrochemicals, improved seeds and seedlings, among others. Those who said they were privileged to get some quantities, complained about delays in accessing such incentives. They said most of the incentives got to them long after they were done with planting. The absence of machines and equipment, including tractors, tillers, planters, harvesters and other gender-friendly equipment, according to them, also constituted hindrances to their work.\n\nAside from these obvious lapses largely occasioned by government negligence, the farmers also decried incessant cases of herdsmen attacks, which had greatly affected food production in the area. While some complained of destruction of their crops by the cattle which regularly graze on their farms, others alleged cases of attack by the herdsmen while farming.\n\nAs regards infrastructure, the women said most of the roads leading to their farms were in deplorable conditions, thereby making it difficult for them to move their produce to sell points. While some acknowledged construction of new markets by the government in their locations, others regretted that most of the existing ones have remained dilapidated.\n\nPerhaps, one major thing the majority of the farmers acknowledged receiving as assistance from the government is training, which they described as an exercise in futility, especially when not backed up with necessary equipment for implementation.\n\nA farmer, Mrs Ngozi Obiajulu, whose farm is located in Ekwusigo, said they were yet to receive any intervention from the government despite several promises.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe\u2019ve finished clearing the bush and waiting for the rain to fall so we can commence cultivation. We started ending of last year. Presently, we\u2019ve cultivated some areas at the back of Okija.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve not gotten any assistance from the government. They promised us some inputs and money but we don\u2019t know what is keeping it. They should help us with fertiliser, cassava, okro and other inputs. She however said they would not fold their hands and keep waiting for the government considering the importance of their business to the society.\u201d\n\nAt Atani in Ogbaru Local Government Area of the state, Mrs Eunice Nduka said their farming was greatly affected by climate change, which she said compelled them to engage the services of water tankers for irrigation.\n\nShe said: \u201cIn the past, we commence clearing of farms for planting as early as February/March. But because of the delay in rainfall, we\u2019re not doing anything tangible because we started very late. This has compelled us to engage the services of water tankers to irrigate our farms. Otherwise, our crops could have dried up and died. The ugly situation has led to a hike in foodstuffs. For example, a cup of garri now is N200, while 12cups go for as high as N1,000.\u201d\n\nAt Achina-Onneh in Aguata local government area, another farmer, Mrs. Eucharia Chinwendu, identified incessant attacks by herdsmen, including the destruction of their farms by their cows as their major predicament.\n\n\u201cAs you see this road, which was initially a pathway, you\u2019ll think that vehicles created it. Not at all, no car enters here. It is the cows of these Fulani that widened the road. Sometimes they enter our farms, damage and uproot our crops. Some of us who have been attacked by the herdsmen no longer go to the farm for fear of being attacked the second time,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also lamented the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business, especially in the area of finance, which hindered the engagement of manpower. She, however, noted that they were not deterred by such frustrations, expressing hope for a brighter future.\n\nMrs. Obiageli Onuma in Nnewi North Local government Area of the state alleged diversion of inputs belonging to them to pensioners, an allegation the Programme Manager, Agricultural Development Programme (ADP), Ministry of Agriculture, Jude Nwankwo, dismissed as untrue, saying they might have bought the inputs from the farmers who got them free from the ministry.\n\nOnuma urged those responsible for the distribution of the input to reach them at the hinterlands where the genuine farmers could be located.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not less than 50 in our group who are into cassava, tomatoes, melon and akidi. We have 25 hectares of land. If you look at this site, you\u2019ll notice that it didn\u2019t yield much because of the rain that stopped suddenly. Besides, we are compelled to turn the burnt weeds to manure owing to a lack of fertilisers. All these will affect our harvest greatly.\n\n\u201cWe need tractors and manpower to clear the bushes and cultivate. We can engage the women to help us in weeding. We also need chemicals to spray in the farm so weeds won\u2019t grow,\u201d she added.\n\nA male farmer, Emma Okeke, attributed the food scarcity challenges in the Southeast to herdsmen attack.\n\nHe said: \u201cEveryone cultivated enough farmlands. So many cooperatives have their various farms. But these herdsmen will carry their cows and enter the farms, uproot the cassava, and use it to feed their cows. If you dare come near them, they will harass you.\u201d\n\nHe alleged that some of the traditional rulers had been compromised by the herdsmen.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nReacting to the alleged negligence of women farmers in the state, the ADP boss refuted the claims, insisting that women remained the most beneficiaries of government inputs and other facilities.\n\nHe revealed that the Ministry was among those with the largest chunk of the budget despite the dwindling economy, but regretted what he described as scepticism among farmers over certain government programmes which, he said, contributed largely to their inability to access the government\u2019s assistance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware of the SWOFON, but I believe all the women in the state, whether members of SWOFON or not, are our farmers as long as you\u2019re into agriculture. We don\u2019t discriminate. Ask them if they know about ADP, extension services and the officers in charge of their areas. You don\u2019t sit at home waiting for manna to fall. Gone were the days manna fell from heaven. Most of these things are free and some subsidised.\n\n\u201cMind you, you don\u2019t expect everyone to be singing praises of the government. But it\u2019ll be foolhardy to see the good things the government is doing and still be criticising.\u201d",
          "summary": "The worst hit are the women farmers who are said to constitute over 70 per cent of the entire agricultural workforce.\nThis set of women farmers, under the Small Scale Women Farmers Organisation of Nigeria (SWOFON), have continued to decry total abandonment despite efforts, including developing a form of a charter of demands expected to address their numerous challenges.\nThe Agricultural Development Programme, ADP made provisions such as IDA support to National FADAMA Development Project (NFDP \u2013III), Cassava Mosaic Distribution.\nAgricultural Development Programme (MSADP-I) and IFAD/FGN Support for Value Chain Development Programme (VCDP).\nAmidst all these provisions still, the women farmers in the state have continued to experience crippling farming episodes.",

          "title": "Nigeria: Mayhem and post-modern realities",
          "text": "By Felix Oladeji\n\nSIR: Gone are the days when Nigeria was a citadel of peace in all ramifications as people used to sleep without knowing the actual time that the cock crows. Insecurity in Nigeria has negatively affected many things in the sense that there is no place that can be considered safe anymore.\n\nIn the context of the present state of affairs in Nigeria, the closest metaphor for the country is the Hobbesian syndrome, where life for the average citizen is becoming uncertain, possibly brutish and short. This is courtesy of the ambience of the widely acknowledged spate of misgovernance under the Buhari administration and attendant lawlessness which now reigns in the country.\n\nIn the country today, hardly a day passes without the public space from Lagos to Maiduguri and Sokoto to Calabar, being inundated with horrendous tales of multiple deaths at the hands of gun-wielding killers, who operate without let or hindrance. With the unprecedented spate of heinous crimes, it is becoming a matter of every citizen standing in the line of fire of the assassin\u2019s bullet, or close to the clutch of the kidnappers, with both scenarios mirroring the proverbial, hanging \u2018Sword of Damocles\u2019.\n\nPublic figures from the national to local government levels hardly appear in public without \u2018adequate security which in ordinary parlance refers to the accompaniment by armed men or women who are ever ready for a \u2018kill and go mission\u2019. Private citizens with even the most pedestrian pretensions to affluence and visibility, imitate public officials to parade the same craving for \u2018adequate security\u2019, and carry often concealed weapons, just in case any contingency come up. Generally, the macabre sway of the rule of the gun has become so defining that with any instance of multiple deaths in the country, the first suspect is gun-fire, before consideration shifts to vehicular accident or building collapse, or any other contingency, as had been the case until recently.\n\nA rather ominous aspect of this dispensation is the concern that even the government seems to have adopted hook, line and sinker, the subscription to gun law, instead of dialogue as a first-line response to sundry challenges of dissent over its style of governance. An instance was the recent threat by President Muhammadu Buhari to visit mayhem on disenchanted members of \u2018Project Nigeria\u2019, which testifies eloquently to an unveiled show of impatience and trigger-happy disposition by the government. While receiving the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC) Professor Mahmoud Yaqoub recently, Buhari used the occasion to warn all secessionists seeking to leave the Nigerian federation, to expect mayhem from the government.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWorrisome as the situation is, history still teaches that hardly can the present state of affairs lead the country to any pretensions of greatness just as none of the great nations of the world was built on the basis of unbridled acrimony, belligerence and centrifugal tendencies among the citizenry or between them and their governments. Even when wars were fought by nations to bring their constituent parts together, the final charter of their collaboration was fashioned through dialogue and consensus built on mutual appreciation of their peculiarities. Yet this is a tendency that is seen as averse to contemporary Nigerian political power calculus.\n\nThat is why the present administration of President Muhammadu Buhari needs to appreciate the need to vitiate the widening and deepening sway of gun law across the country. Otherwise, it is merely superintending over the irreversible break-up of the Nigerian nation and may have no one else to blame as the threat to its tenure and even the country\u2019s unity. Against the rash of flashpoints of crises across the country, any tendency by the administration that does not point towards a pacification of the aggrieved sections of the country qualifies as the unwise and wasteful act of throwing away with the shovel, what the country had gathered over time, with the rake.\n\nFelix Oladeji,\n\nAkwa Ibom,",

          "title": "My trip to Europe is about America rallying the world\u2019s democracies",
          "text": "By Joe Biden\n\nOn Wednesday, I depart for Europe on the first foreign travel of my presidency. It is a trip stacked with meetings with many of our closest democratic partners \u2014 including the Group of Seven nations, our NATO allies and the leadership of the European Union \u2014 before concluding by meeting with Vladimir Putin. In this moment of global uncertainty, as the world still grapples with a once-in-a-century pandemic, this trip is about realizing America\u2019s renewed commitment to our allies and partners, and demonstrating the capacity of democracies to both meet the challenges and deter the threats of this new age.\n\nWhether it is ending the covid-19 pandemic everywhere, meeting the demands of an accelerating climate crisis, or confronting the harmful activities of the governments of China and Russia, the United States must lead the world from a position of strength. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan and our domestic vaccination strategy, our economy is now growing faster than at any time in almost 40 years. We have created more jobs in the first four months of our administration than under any other president. Wages are increasing for American workers. And, as America\u2019s economic recovery helps to propel the global economy, we will be stronger and more capable when we are flanked by nations that share our values and our vision for the future \u2014 by other democracies.\n\nThat\u2019s the agenda I will advance at every stop. In the United Kingdom, after meeting with Prime Minister Boris Johnson to affirm the special relationship between our nations, I will participate in the G-7 summit. This group of leading democracies and economies has not met in person in two years due to the coronavirus. Ending this pandemic, improving health security for all nations and driving a robust, inclusive global economic recovery will be our top priorities.\n\nAlready, the G-7 finance ministers have made an unprecedented commitment to build momentum for a global minimum tax rate of at least 15 percent to end the race-to-the-bottom on corporate taxation. And with the United States back in the chair on the issue of climate change, we have an opportunity to deliver ambitious progress that curbs the climate crisis and creates jobs by driving a global clean-energy transition.\n\nJust as it does at home, honing the ability of democracies to compete and protecting our people against unforeseen threats requires us to invest in infrastructure. The world\u2019s major democracies will be offering a high-standard alternative to China for upgrading physical, digital and health infrastructure that is more resilient and supports global development.\n\nAs new technologies reshape our world in fundamental ways, exposing vulnerabilities like ransomware attacks and creating threats such as invasive AI-driven surveillance, the democracies of the world must together ensure that our values govern the use and development of these innovations \u2014 not the interests of autocrats.\n\nThose shared democratic values are the foundation of the most successful alliance in world history. In Brussels, at the NATO summit, I will affirm the United States\u2019 unwavering commitment to Article 5 and to ensuring our alliance is strong in the face of every challenge, including threats like cyberattacks on our critical infrastructure.\n\nWhile in Brussels, I\u2019ll meet with the president of the European Commission and the president of the European Council to discuss how the United States and Europe can work in close coordination on global challenges. We will focus on ensuring that market democracies, not China or anyone else, write the 21st-century rules around trade and technology. And we will continue to pursue the goal of a Europe whole, free and at peace.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo, when I meet with Vladimir Putin in Geneva, it will be after high-level discussions with friends, partners and allies who see the world through the same lens as the United States, and with whom we have renewed our connections and shared purpose. We are standing united to address Russia\u2019s challenges to European security, starting with its aggression in Ukraine, and there will be no doubt about the resolve of the United States to defend our democratic values, which we cannot separate from our interests.\n\nIn my phone calls with President Putin, I have been clear and direct. The United States does not seek conflict. We want a stable and predictable relationship where we can work with Russia on issues like strategic stability and arms control. That\u2019s why I acted immediately to extend the New START treaty for five years and bolster the security of the American people and the world.\n\nAt the same time, I have also imposed meaningful consequences for behaviors that violate U.S. sovereignty, including interference in our democratic elections. And President Putin knows that I will not hesitate to respond to future harmful activities. When we meet, I will again underscore the commitment of the United States, Europe and like-minded democracies to stand up for human rights and dignity.\n\nThis is a defining question of our time: Can democracies come together to deliver real results for our people in a rapidly changing world? Will the democratic alliances and institutions that shaped so much of the last century prove their capacity against modern-day threats and adversaries? I believe the answer is yes. And this week in Europe, we have the chance to prove it.",

          "title": "If the Wuhan lab-leak hypothesis is true, expect a political earthquake",
          "text": "By Thomas Frank\n\nThere was a time when the Covid pandemic seemed to confirm so many of our assumptions. It cast down the people we regarded as villains. It raised up those we thought were heroes. It prospered people who could shift easily to working from home even as it problematized the lives of those Trump voters living in the old economy.\n\nLike all plagues, Covid often felt like the hand of God on earth, scourging the people for their sins against higher learning and visibly sorting the righteous from the unmasked wicked. \u201cRespect science,\u201d admonished our yard signs. And lo!, Covid came and forced us to do so, elevating our scientists to the highest seats of social authority, from where they banned assembly, commerce, and all the rest.\n\nWe cast blame so innocently in those days. We scolded at will. We knew who was right and we shook our heads to behold those in the wrong playing in their swimming pools and on the beach. It made perfect sense to us that Donald Trump, a politician we despised, could not grasp the situation, that he suggested people inject bleach, and that he was personally responsible for more than one super-spreading event. Reality itself punished leaders like him who refused to bow to expertise. The prestige news media even figured out a way to blame the worst death tolls on a system of organized ignorance they called \u201cpopulism.\u201d\n\nBut these days the consensus doesn\u2019t consense quite as well as it used to. Now the media is filled with disturbing stories suggesting that Covid might have come \u2014 not from \u201cpopulism\u201d at all, but from a laboratory screw-up in Wuhan, China. You can feel the moral convulsions beginning as the question sets in: What if science itself is in some way culpable for all this?\n\nI am no expert on epidemics. Like everyone else I know, I spent the pandemic doing as I was told. A few months ago I even tried to talk a Fox News viewer out of believing in the lab-leak theory of Covid\u2019s origins. The reason I did that is because the newspapers I read and the TV shows I watched had assured me on many occasions that the lab-leak theory wasn\u2019t true, that it was a racist conspiracy theory, that only deluded Trumpists believed it, that it got infinite pants-on-fire ratings from the fact-checkers, and because (despite all my cynicism) I am the sort who has always trusted the mainstream news media.\n\nMy own complacency on the matter was dynamited by the lab-leak essay that ran in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists earlier this month; a few weeks later everyone from Doctor Fauci to President Biden is acknowledging that the lab-accident hypothesis might have some merit. We don\u2019t know the real answer yet, and we probably will never know, but this is the moment to anticipate what such a finding might ultimately mean. What if this crazy story turns out to be true?\n\nThe answer is that this is the kind of thing that could obliterate the faith of millions. The last global disaster, the financial crisis of 2008, smashed people\u2019s trust in the institutions of capitalism, in the myths of free trade and the New Economy, and eventually in the elites who ran both American political parties.\n\nIn the years since (and for complicated reasons), liberal leaders have labored to remake themselves into defenders of professional rectitude and established legitimacy in nearly every field. In reaction to the fool Trump, liberalism made a sort of cult out of science, expertise, the university system, executive-branch \u201cnorms,\u201d the \u201cintelligence community,\u201d the State Department, NGOs, the legacy news media, and the hierarchy of credentialed achievement in general.\n\nNow here we are in the waning days of Disastrous Global Crisis #2. Covid is of course worse by many orders of magnitude than the mortgage meltdown \u2014 it has killed millions and ruined lives and disrupted the world economy far more extensively. Should it turn out that scientists and experts and NGOs, etc. are villains rather than heroes of this story, we may very well see the expert-worshiping values of modern liberalism go up in a fireball of public anger.\n\nConsider the details of the story as we have learned them in the last few weeks:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLab leaks happen. They aren\u2019t the result of conspiracies: \u201ca lab accident is an accident,\u201d as Nathan Robinson points out; they happen all the time, in this country and in others, and people die from them.\n\nThere is evidence that the lab in question, which studies bat coronaviruses, may have been conducting what is called \u201cgain of function\u201d research, a dangerous innovation in which diseases are deliberately made more virulent. By the way, right-wingers didn\u2019t dream up \u201cgain of function\u201d: all the cool virologists have been doing it (in this country and in others) even as the squares have been warning against it for years.\n\nThere are strong hints that some of the bat-virus research at the Wuhan lab was funded in part by the American national-medical establishment \u2014 which is to say, the lab-leak hypothesis doesn\u2019t implicate China alone.\n\nThere seem to have been astonishing conflicts of interest among the people assigned to get to the bottom of it all, and (as we know from Enron and the housing bubble) conflicts of interest are always what trip up the well-credentialed professionals whom liberals insist we must all heed, honor, and obey.\n\nThe news media, in its zealous policing of the boundaries of the permissible, insisted that Russiagate was ever so true but that the If the Wuhan lab-leak hypothesis is true, expect a political earthquake\n\nlab-leak hypothesis was false false false, and woe unto anyone who dared disagree. Reporters gulped down whatever line was most flattering to the experts they were quoting and then insisted that it was 100% right and absolutely incontrovertible \u2014 that anything else was only unhinged Trumpist folly, that democracy dies when unbelievers get to speak, and so on.\n\nThe social media monopolies actually censored posts about the lab-leak hypothesis. Of course they did! Because we\u2019re at war with misinformation, you know, and people need to be brought back to the true and correct faith \u2014 as agreed upon by experts.\n\n\u201cLet us pray, now, for science,\u201d intoned a New York Times columnist back at the beginning of the Covid pandemic. The title of his article laid down the foundational faith of Trump-era liberalism: \u201cCoronavirus is What You Get When You Ignore Science.\u201d\n\nTen months later, at the end of a scary article about the history of \u201cgain of function\u201d research and its possible role in the still ongoing Covid pandemic, Nicholson Baker wrote as follows: \u201cThis may be the great scientific meta-experiment of the 21st century. Could a world full of scientists do all kinds of reckless recombinant things with viral diseases for many years and successfully avoid a serious outbreak? The hypothesis was that, yes, it was doable. The risk was worth taking. There would be no pandemic.\u201d\n\nExcept there was. If it does indeed turn out that the lab-leak hypothesis is the right explanation for how it began \u2014 that the common people of the world have been forced into a real-life lab experiment, at tremendous cost \u2014 there is a moral earthquake on the way.\n\nBecause if the hypothesis is right, it will soon start to dawn on people that our mistake was not insufficient reverence for scientists, or inadequate respect for expertise, or not enough censorship on Facebook. It was a failure to think critically about all of the above, to understand that there is no such thing as absolute expertise. Think of all the disasters of recent years: economic neoliberalism, destructive trade policies, the Iraq War, the housing bubble, banks that are \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d mortgage-backed securities, the Hillary Clinton campaign of 2016 \u2014 all of these disasters brought to you by the total, self-assured unanimity of the highly educated people who are supposed to know what they\u2019re doing, plus the total complacency of the highly educated people who are supposed to be supervising them.\n\nThen again, maybe I am wrong to roll out all this speculation. Maybe the lab-leak hypothesis will be convincingly disproven. I certainly hope it is.\n\nBut even if it inches closer to being confirmed, we can guess what the next turn of the narrative will be. It was a \u201cperfect storm,\u201d the experts will say. Who coulda known? And besides (they will say), the origins of the pandemic don\u2019t matter anymore. Go back to sleep.",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nBarely 24 hours after herdsmen invaded Igangan in Ibarapa zone of Oyo State, killed many residents and burnt multi-million naira property including the palace of the traditional ruler, attackers were reported to have stormed Idere, another community in Ibarapa.\n\nThe are seven principal towns in Ibarapaland, namely Ayete, Tapa and Idere in Ibarapa North Local Government, and Igboora and Idere in Ibarapa Central Local Government and Eruwa and Lanlate in Ibarapa East Local Government.\n\nDaily Sun learnt that the attackers that invaded Idere were repelled by vigilance groups.\n\n\u201cVigilance groups in Idere were at alert and prevented the bandits from wreaking havoc in the community the way they did in Igangan a day earlier,\u201d an eyewitness said.\n\nDaily Sun learnt that local hunters and other security operatives have embarked on the defence of the seven Ibarapa towns and their villages. It was also gathered that the local security operatives have started combing forests in the area in search of the criminal herdsmen.\n\nThe local security operatives, it was learnt, said they took the stance to resort to self-help in spite of increased deployment of policemen and operatives of a joint-security outfit of the state, Operation Burst, comprising soldiers and men of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCSC).\n\nA resident of Idere, who gave his name as Adeleke Akangbe said: \u201cIn Idere, we have been mounting security 24 hours on daily basis. On Sunday night, about 24 hours after criminal Fulani invaded Igangan, the same invaders showed up in Idere. But we did not allow them to enter the town. We stopped them right in the forest.\n\n\u201cNow, we are combing the forest and trailing the criminals to the borders of Nigeria with Benin Republic in Kajola suburb of Ayete, and boundary of Oyo State with Ogun State in Igboora. We are at alert. We are ready for the criminal herdsmen. We will never be caught unawares again.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some parents stormed schools in Ayete, Igangan and Tapa, yesterday, to withdraw their children from schools when news of another attack filtered into the communities.\n\nIt was learnt that the parents who withdrew their children from schools vowed they would not allow them return until threats of attacks in the communities is effectively curtailed.\n\nElenpe of Tapa, Oba Titiloye Oyekanmi, said: \u201cPeople have been running helter-skelter to ensure they withdraw their children from schools. We couldn\u2019t sleep till this morning. We just heard that those Fulani people are restrategising to attack us again, but they didn\u2019t tell us the precise time. There is no presence of security agencies here. We need government now.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some residents of Ibarapa yesterday, alleged that they saw an helicopter drop firearms for bandits that attacked the community. One of the resident who spoke on condition of anonymity told Daily Sun that he had video evidence to support his claim.\n\n\u201cI have the video evidence. The helicopter dropped ammunition for the bandits behind the house of Iskilu Wakili in Kajola area of Ayete some days ago. We raised the alarm then and nobody listened to us.\u201d\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer for the state, Mr. Adewale Osifeso, confirmed the attack on June 5 in Igangan community saying 11 persons including some of the assailants died while a number of vehicles and buildings, including the Palace of the Asigangan of Igangan town and a filling station were razed down.",

Ejike Mbaka, as he has been summoned to Abuja for interrogation by operatives of the Department of State Services.\n\nThe operatives who arrived at the ground on Sunday to deliver the letter of invitation did not meet the fiery priest at the church premises. It was also learnt that security guards at the premises refused to accept the letter requesting that the operatives should return on Monday to deliver it to the priest in person.\n\nJust last week, Mbaka returned from a 30-day compulsory prayer retreat imposed on him by the Catholic Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Most Rev. Callistus Onaga over his recent prophesies.\n\nThis was followed by a letter from the Bishop which stripped Mbaka of total control of the adoration ministry as it was converted to a Chaplaincy. Though Mbaka remained the Chaplain in charge, the Bishop reserved the right to appoint a new Chaplain or his assistants under the new arrangement. Onaga also announced that political statements and prophesies had been banned at the adoration ground.\n\nMbaka\u2019s troubles started recently when he prophesied against the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. The cleric had said that God had rejected the President over his inability to provide jobs for youths noting that it was reason for widespread insecurity in the nation.\n\nHe went further to urge the President to resign or be impeached by the national assembly.\n\nReacting to the latest development in his Sunday message, Mbaka queried the rationale behind his invitation, insisting that as a prophet, he will not be cowed into silence. He warned that anyone who was contemplating closing down the ministry would regret such move.\n\n\u201cI got a call on Thursday that the DSS people from Abuja came here (Enugu) with a letter of invitation to Abuja. Over what? What I cannot understand is that the mother church in Nigeria should be \u201ccowed down\u201d to lilliputian.\n\n\u201cThe mother church is both a lamb and lion. The bible says if the foundation is destroyed, what can the just man do.\n\n\u201cAll these are efforts to dumbfound a prophet. All priest can be dumbfounded but no prophet should. We must protect the sheep. In this time, when killings are all over, when there is hunger everywhere, people do not have hope again. The only hope I have is God. Anybody who will stop people from worshipping here will regret it.\n\n\u201cI am the servant here. They don\u2019t understand history. I spoke against Abacha. I went to Minna to tell Babangida what was wrong in his time. I spoke to Obasanjo face to face. I perform under the anointing of the Holy Spirit. I ministered to the late President Yar\u2019adua. I am being used by a supernatural spirit called the Holy Spirit.\n\n\u201cIf they are attacking me here and there, even from those that should save me, no wahala (no problem). The Bible says if God is for us, who can be against us? Only God can be God. I heard the security people did not accept the letter. They asked them to come on Monday to give me the letter. If they know the anointing here is too hot for them, let them change. I will not keep quiet.\n\n\u201cLook at the millions of youths moving about unemployed and you call us Father. Should a father be comfortable in a situation like this? What kind of father is that?\u201d",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nBlood flowed freely in Igangan, one of the seven principal towns of Ibarapaland in Oyo State, on Saturday night, as gunmen dispatched over 45 persons to their early graves in the town.\n\nBesides, the five-hour invasion also led to burning of more than 60 houses, while over 160 vehicles were also destroyed, apart from a petrol filling station and the palace of Ashigangan of Igangan, Oba Lasisi Adeoye, that were also razed.\n\nIt was in the same Igangan that angry youths razed the village and vehicles of the Sarkin Fulani of Oyo State, Alhaji Abdulkadir Salihu, in February, this year, after the popular Yoruba activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, fondly called Sunday Igboho, held a town hall meeting in the town. Salihu was evicted from the town based on allegations of aiding and abeitting killings, kidnapping and destruction of farmland in the area.\n\nImpeccable sources said the invaders stormed Igangan at about 11pm, on Saturday, and operated till 4am, yesterday, before leaving the town in Ibarapa North Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe bandits, according to sources, were about 50 and they invaded the town on more than 20 motorcycles.\n\nCommunity leaders speak on bloodbath\n\nThe Secretary of Farmers Union in Igangan, Mr Taiwo Adeagbo, said many lives were lost during the invasion, adding that the invaders shot many residents dead, while security agents also neutralised some of the attackers.\n\nThe convener of Igangan Development Advocate, Oladiran Oladokun, said: \u201cOn numerous occasions, Ibrahim, Seriki Saliu\u2019s son kept threatening that Igangan would be razed down to ashes. He had the audacity to proclaim this on social media as well as on radio shows; perhaps, his words were taken as mere groans, but local vigilantes at Igangan kept receiving the news of impending danger.\n\n\u201cThe state, I believe, thought it\u2019s just another hype, for we notified the state of our fears on the 14th of April, when covert information reached us of a meeting of the Fulani, towards fulfilling their oath of allegiance towards reprisals.\n\n\u201cIf we had not made a little cover, perhaps, as Ibarahim, son of Seriki threatened, Igangan would have become a dunghill of ashes; or, perhaps, this is just their beginning.\u201d\n\nA former caretaker chairman of Ibarapa North, where Igangan is located, Tunji Omolewu, stated: \u201dPeople had barely retired to bed when they said they sighted motorcycles entering the town. Before our people could know what was going on, they had started killing people. I got the call around 11pm. We were on our way from Ekiti, where we had gone to do the Yoruba nation rally. I got to Ibadan around 12am, and when the calls did not stop coming, I decided to come home. The palace of our monarch was torched. Adolak filling station, too, was burnt. We are assembled here.\u201d\n\nPolice confirm incident, begin investigation\n\nThe Oyo State Police Command has confirmed the invasion of Igangan in Ibarapa zone of the state by unknown assailants during which many lives and property were destroyed.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer for the command, Mr. Adewale Osifeso, who made the confirmation, yesterday, said the incident began at about 11:10pm, on Saturday.\n\nAsked to comment on the figure of people that were killed during the invasion, Osifeso stated: \u201cCasualty figure would be premised upon the completion of the ongoing comprehensive investigations, please.\u201d\n\nOyo Assembly Speaker, Allaafin condemn attack\n\nMeanwhile, the Speaker, Oyo State House of Assembly, Debo Ogundoyin, who hails from Eruwa, one of the seven principal towns of Ibarapa, has condemned the fresh attack on Igangan, by bandits and suspected criminal herders overnight.\n\nAlso, the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III, condemned the and call on residents of Igangan and the entire state to be calm.\n\nGovernor Makinde calls for calm\n\nGovernor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has appealed to residents of the state to remain calm as security operatives have taken control of the situation in Igangan, where people suspected to be criminal herdsmen killed about 20 persons in the early hours of yesterday.",

          "text": "By Michael Olugbode\n\nThe Federal Government has said it is in talks with Twitter over the suspension of the micro-blogging site in Nigeria.\n\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama disclosed this Monday at press conference after his meeting with representatives of five foreign missions in Nigeria over their comments on the Twitter ban.\n\nThe Minister however said that Twitter remains suspended and there was still no date for the lifting of the suspension.\n\nHe said Twitter operations in Nigeria would be restored only if the platform could be used \u201cresponsibly.\u201d\n\nHe further said that the federal government never said Twitter was threatening the country, but said\n\nthe suspension of the platform was a measure taken to stop it from being used to destabilize the country.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWe are not saying that Twitter is threatening the country or any such thing.\n\n\u201cWhy we have taken this measure is to stop them from being used as platform for destabilization and facilitation of criminality or encouragement of criminalities.\u201d\n\nHis remarks were however at variance with the statement by the Ministry of Information last Friday wherein the Federal Government announced the indefinite suspension of the operations of the micro-blogging and social networking service site in Nigeria, citing the persistent use of the Twitter platform for activities that were capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\n\nThe Federal Government had on Monday summoned ambassadors of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland and the European Union in Nigeria over their comments on the suspension of Twitter.\n\nCommenting on the meeting with the five envoys, Onyeama said: \u201cThey had useful discussion with the countries that are considered to be close friends and partners of Nigeria. We sat down and reviewed the whole situation and we stated the security concern of Mr. president and the whole Nigerians and the very strong steps we\u2019ve taken to address the security challenges of the country.\u201d\n\nOnyeama said government presented the first hand information about the security challenges of the country and also the role of the social media.\n\nHe admitted that the social media was good for dissemination of information, but just like anything else it can be used for bad purposes, insisting that such could have dire consequences on human lives and property.\n\nHe said that it was important to keep the unity of the country, and to achieve all these a decision had to be taken and measures put in place to ensure the social platforms were used responsibly.\n\nHe admitted that as a democracy, the issues of fundamental human rights was expected to be respected, especially freedom of speech, but added that this should not be allowed to bring the country down.\n\nWhile admitting that the five missions and their countries had been supporting Nigeria in the areas of security and development challenges, he said Nigerian government was also asking that they should support the need to control the use of social media.\n\nHe said the major task before President Buhari was security of lives and property of everyone in the country, insisting that without security everything would turn up-side-down in the country and foreign investments would even be at risk.\n\nResponding to questions from the media, the United States Ambassador, to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard, who spoke on behalf of the other envoys, said the security situation of Nigeria was understood and the need to do something urgently to address the drift was equally important.\n\nShe insisted that the issues of fundamental human rights was inalienable and needed to be respected by the government.\n\nShe said that judicial process should be allowed to take effect in some of the disputed areas.\n\nThe Twitter ban was announced by the Information Minister, Lai Mohammed, Friday, two days after Twitter deleted President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet posted wherein he threatened to deal with secessionists \u201cin the language they understand\u201d.\n\nThe social media networking site had said the tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\n\nThe ban has attracted widespread condemnations as Nigerians described it as violation of rights of citizens and a prelude to dictatorship.\n\nMore than 39 million Nigerians have a Twitter account, according to NOI polls, a public opinion and research organization based in Nigeria.\n\nNigerian telecoms operators complied with the government directive on the ban Friday but Nigerians are navigating around the ban using VPN\n\nThe U.S. and the European Union had on Saturday expressed concern over Nigeria\u2019s decision to ban Twitter.\n\n\u201cBanning systems of expression is not the answer,\u201d the diplomatic missions of the EU, U.S., Britain, Canada and Ireland had said in a joint statement Saturday condemning the ban.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u201cEvery person shall be entitled to freedom of expression, including freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference\u201d \u2013Section 39 (1) CFRN\n\nDavidson Iriekpen, Nseobong Okon-Ekong, Gboyega Akinsanmi in Lagos, Chuks Okocha, Alex Enumah, Adedayo Akinwale, Udora Orizu in Abuja and George Okoh in Makurdi\n\nThe federal government has continued to face searing criticisms of its decision to suspend the operation of the American microblogging social network, Twitter, in Nigeria as some Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs) yesterday told THISDAY that the action contravened Section 39 (1) of the 1999 Constitution as altered.\n\nThey also dismissed the directive of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, to the Federal Director of Public Prosecution, to arrest and prosecute any user of Twitter in defiance of the suspension order, as offensive to Section 36 (12) of the Constitution as altered.\n\nSection 39 (1) stipulates: \u201cEvery person shall be entitled to freedom of expression, including the freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference.\u201d\n\nThe senior lawyers argued that the suspension amounted to a hindrance of the citizens\u2019 right to receive information.\n\nThey further argued that the threat of prosecution by the AGF has no basis in law as it clearly violates Section 36 (12), which states: \u201cSubject as otherwise provided by this Constitution, a person shall not be convicted of a criminal offence unless that the offence is defined and the penalty, therefore, is prescribed in a written law, and in this subsection, a written law refers to an Act of the National Assembly or a law of a state, any subsidiary legislation or instrument under the provisions of law.\u201d\n\nMalami, had in a statement by his media aide, Dr. Umar Gwandu, had directed the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation to work with the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy to ensure speedy prosecution of alleged violators.\n\nBut Benue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, also described the suspension of Twitter as an ill-advised diversion from the core issues of insecurity and injustice plaguing the nation.\n\nJoining the fray, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House of Representatives threatened to sue the federal government over the suspension of Twitter operations.\n\nThe lawyers, in separate interviews with THISDAY yesterday, described the action of the government as illegal, null and void and unenforceable.\n\nThey said the suspension in the first place was illegal because it infringed on the fundamental human rights of the citizens.\n\nThe lawyers, citing portions of the law, stated that the government cannot prosecute anyone under a non-existent law.\n\nHuman Rights activists and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Chief Mike Ozekhome, citing decisions from the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, said: \u201cNo citizen of Nigeria can be tried or punished for an alleged offence not created by law.\u201d\n\nOzekhome, who faulted the directive of Malami, warned that the government should \u201cbe ready to build thousands of prisons across all the nooks and crannies of Nigeria so as to accommodate the deluge of \u2018erring\u2019 Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, there must be a statutory provision creating an offence before any person can be convicted for the said offence.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe punishment too must be specifically named in a legislation. The apex court emphatically stated that it is rudimentary and elementary for anybody or persons having something to do with dispensation of justice in this country to know that no citizen can be made to face any criminal trial for an act that is not qualified as an offence not defined or stated (codified) in any law and the punishment thereof prescribed.\n\n\u201cAll the above judicial authorities are crystal clear that neither Malami nor the DPP, nor this government, can prosecute any Twitter user. Using Twitter is not a known crime or written offence.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that the National Assembly has not enacted any law banning the use of social media, including Twitter, Ozekhome said the mere verbal pronouncement, declaration, directives or threats by Malami could not amount to a law validly passed by the National Assembly.\n\nChief Godwin Obla (SAN) described the suspension of Twitter as senseless and not legally justiciable because there is no order proscribing Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nObla, who noted that what the federal government did in the first place was to stop telecommunication companies from allowing Twitter to use their platform to operate in Nigeria, said that no Nigerian could be punished for merely using Twitter which according to him is an online means of disseminating information.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is nowhere and I have not seen the order by the Attorney-General proscribing Twitter because there must be an order. Can the federal government on its own have breached the citizens\u2019 right to disseminate and to hold and manage information? The answer is no.\n\n\u201cSo, if a Nigerian citizen is using another IT platform, say, the United States platform, he can disseminate information; it\u2019s a piece of online information, it\u2019s not physical. If my Twitter account is a US Twitter account, I can tweet from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe ban does not make sense. It is not legally justiciable. I do not see how it can be enforced, and I don\u2019t see how any citizen can be found guilty of such an offence.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Prof. Konyinsola Ajayi (SAN), wondered when a pronouncement by a mi\n\nnister becomes a law on which citizens could be prosecuted.\n\nHe said for anyone to be arrested and arraigned before a court of law, there must be an offence, adding that in this instance, there is no known law for which a person has disobeyed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any law that says if there is a pronouncement by a minister, it becomes an offence,\u201d he said, explaining: \u201cTo arrest someone there must be an offence, a written offence. There must be a law; you must refer to a law that says anybody that disobeys an order or a statement by the minister is an offence but there is nothing like that, there is definitely no law like that.\u201d\n\nAnother senior lawyer, Chief Tayo Oyetibo (SAN), also stated that there is no known law on which Nigerians could be prosecuted for using Twitter and added that the power to make criminal laws rests with the National Assembly and not the president.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am not aware of any law that has been enacted by the National Assembly. The president cannot enact criminal law, only the National Assembly can do so.\n\n\u201cCriminal laws are not enacted in secrecy; it has to be published before it can be effective.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, a former President of the Nigerian Bar Association, Chief Joseph Daudu (SAN), said, President Muhammadu Buhari lacked the power to use state institutions to fight personal battles.\n\nDaudu also clarified that the decision of Twitter to suspend Buhari\u2019s personal account \u201cis not a matter between Nigeria and the social networking service.\u201d\n\nHe made this clarification in his response to THISDAY\u2019s inquiries on the constitutionality of the federal government\u2019s decision to suspend Twitter\u2019s operation in Nigeria.\n\nDaudu said every Nigerian operating a Twitter account \u201cdoes so in his own name, even if the underlying objective is to promote the objectives and aspirations of his constituency, business outfit or even office.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, said Buhari, though a very eminent personality \u201cis an individual customer of Twitter with no greater rights than the other millions of persons who have also subscribed to Twitter and agreed to their rules and conditions of membership.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwitter perceived that Buhari broke its rules and applying one of the sanctions open to it removed the offending tweet. Whether the account was blocked or suspended is really not the issue at this point in time,\u201d he added.\n\nHe, therefore, said the president lacked the power to use state apparatus and institutions \u201cto hit or get back at Twitter, which is what he has done in retaliation by banning them from Nigeria using state institutions such as the NBC and the NCC to deprive all Nigerians of their access to Twitter.\u201d\n\nMr. Dayo Akinlaja (SAN) also stated that before anyone could be punished for any offence in Nigeria, the offence must be defined and the punishment thereof must be prescribed in a written law.\n\n\u201cThis is what is stipulated by Section 36(12) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that except there is an existing law that proscribes the usage of the Twitter account, \u201cit is unconstitutional to arrest let alone prosecute anyone for using Twitter\u2019s services in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHouse of Representatives spokesman, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, also told THISDAY that the parliament is currently looking into the recent suspension of Twitter by the federal government, with a view of getting a critical analysis before taking a position on the trending issue.\n\nKalu said: \u201dThe House is busy looking into the trending Twitter issue as expected for any federal parliament. It is time for an in-depth critical analysis of the entire picture not yet time for press releases on the issue. But be rest assured, it won\u2019t be long before we make our position known in line with our laws and democratic principles.\u201d\n\nHuman rights lawyer and former National Secretary of the Labour Party, Dr. Kayode Ajulo, condemned the attempt to prosecute violators of the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nAjulo opposed Malami\u2019s position, saying: \u201cWithout prejudice to the rationale for the ban of the blogging site in Nigeria, it is imperative to note that the provisions of Section 36 (12) of the 1999 Constitution are clear to the effect no one shall be prosecuted for an offence not known to law.\n\n\u201cI have carefully stated the contents of our various penal laws and nowhere is a citizen of the country prohibited from receiving or disseminating information, which is a right guaranteed under Section 39 of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nOrtom described the suspension of Twitter operations in the country as an ill-advised diversion from the core issues of insecurity and injustice plaguing the nation.\n\nThe governor said the Twitter suspension offered no solution to any of the problems facing the country, as the move was only capable of heightening tensions and fuelling suspicions among Nigerians over the real motives of the federal government.\n\nOrtom, in a statement by his Press Secretary, Mr. Terver Akase, said that suspending Twitter amounted to suppressing freedom of expression, gagging social media and undermining fundamental human rights of Nigerians, a development contravening Chapter four of the 1999 Constitution as altered.\n\nOrtom emphasised the need for the federal government to listen to the views and yearnings of the people to enable it to address the challenges confronting the nation.\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP caucus in the House of Representatives has threatened to sue the federal government in court over the suspension of Twitter operations in the country.\n\nIt described the decision as an act of desperation of a non-performing and failed government to intimidate and cow the citizens to consolidate its hold on power by brute force.\n\nThe Leader of the caucus, Hon. Kingsley Chinda, in a statement yesterday, said Twitter had become an integral component of the citizens\u2019 ability to keep the government in check and to provide real-time feedback on the impact of the government\u2019s activities on the citizenry.\n\nPDP: APC behind Twitter Suspension, Moves to Suppress Nigerians\n\nThe PDP has accused the National Caucus of the All Progressives Congress (APC) of being behind the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe PDP said facts available to it showed how APC leaders at one of their party\u2019s national caucus meetings recommended the regulation of social media in Nigeria and how they have been plotting to obliterate internet-based interaction platforms such as Twitter.\n\nThe PDP in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said the APC Caucus had been pushing bills in the National Assembly, particularly in November 2020, seeking to enforce a draconian regulation of social media so as to gag Nigerians from exposing its atrocities, including human right abuses, treasury looting, nepotism and sectional marginalisation by the APC administration.\n\nThe PDP said: \u201cNigerians can also recall how the APC administration in carrying out the agenda of its party has been using the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, to suffocate the media space with humongous fines and threats of suspension of operating licences of broadcast stations.\u201d\n\nBuhari: We Are Taking the Lead in Cyber Policing\n\nProtocols:\n\n1. It is with great pleasure that I address you today on this occasion of the 2019 Annual Investment Meeting here in Dubai.\n\n2. I wish to thank His Royal Highness, Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of the United Arab Emirates, for inviting me to speak at this event.\n\n3. This is the ninth edition of such a gathering. At this point, I want to congratulate His Highness, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum for his vision to support such a platform where world leaders in both the public and private sectors exchange ideas on how to make this world a better place.\n\n4. This morning, my brief remarks will be on digital globalisation, which we all agree is transforming the world as we know it. Almost every day, innovations and transformative ideas are rolled out. This trend is here to stay.\n\n5. Today, we have a cyber world that is intangible but real. This borderless world is powerful, and it impacts the lives of billions of people, no matter how remote their physical locations are.\n\n6. People work in it. People socialise in it. And people invest in it. This presents enormous opportunities. But it also remains a constant threat if left unregulated.\n\n7. On the one hand, it has made the human race more productive and more efficient. Today, we have digital banking, virtual currencies and many social platforms that connect people and cultures.\n\n8. On the other hand, we have seen platforms hijacked and manipulated as evidenced by the steady rise in fake news and cybercrimes.\n\n9. More recently, we are also witnessing the use of the cyber space to manipulate elections, subvert the democratic rights of citizens as well as propagate violence.\n\n10. In effect, the digital world has become the new frontier for both good and evil. Therefore, the challenge for world leaders must be to ensure that this space is inclusive, accessible and safe.\n\n11. In Nigeria, our mobile phone penetration exceeds eighty per cent. This means majority of Nigeria\u2019s one hundred and ninety million citizens are fully connected to this new digital world; especially our youth.\n\n12. Sixty five percent or one hundred and seventeen million Nigerians are under the age of 25 years. These bright minds are the drivers of this emerging digital sector.\n\n13. Today, Nigeria has close to ninety technology hubs and every day, new ones are coming up and they are all developing solutions for Nigerian, and indeed global problems.\n\n14. Already, these young entrepreneurs have attracted investments of over one hundred million dollars. A sizeable amount from overseas including Silicon Valley.\n\n15. As many of you from this region are aware, Nigerian start-ups always have a very impressive outing at the Gulf Information Technology Exhibition (GITEX). Many have won prizes.\n\n16. As leaders, it is therefore our responsibility to create the enabling environment for these minds to flourish and reach their full potential.\n\n17. When we came in 2015, we immediately agreed that any future economic growth must be inclusive.\n\n18. As the Nigerian youth population are fully digitalised, it is clear that the idea of having an inclusive economy cannot be achieved without digital inclusion.\n\n19. We therefore leveraged and supported digital platforms in our numerous socio-economic programs: from training extension workers in agriculture, health and education sectors; to enabling micro-credits to increase financial inclusion.\n\n20. However, whilst this digital globalisation has occurred rapidly in the private sector, many governments and regulators have not kept pace.\n\n21. New waves of cybercrime and terrorism continue to threaten the positive strides being made.\n\n22. On cyber security, Nigeria has taken the lead in cyber policing in West Africa. In this, we are working with our regional and global partners.\n\n23. Furthermore, our public sector reform programs focus on digitising key operations. From procurement to payroll to revenue collections, we are using digital platforms to reinforce our objectives of improving efficiency, accountability and transparency in governance.\n\n24. We are also working on creating the largest digital database in Africa. Already, our digital identity system has captured over thirty million Nigerians and legal residents.\n\n25. As earlier observed, the digital world is borderless. In many instances, the criminals in this world are faceless and without physical addresses. This is why we must all come together to protect the good while eliminating the bad.\n\n26. Emerging threats are difficult to prevent or manage unilaterally. It has to be a collective effort, led by both public and private sector leaders \u2013 many of whom are here today.\n\n27. A certain level of regulation is needed to preserve the integrity of the digital economy.\n\n28. I therefore would ask all of us here present, over the coming days, to put our heads together and come up with proposals on how we create a digital world that is accessible, inclusive and safe.\n\n29. I thank you for listening and wish you very successful deliberations.\n\n\u2022Being the text of keynote speech delivered by President Muhammadu Buhari, at the Annual Investment Meeting in Dubai, UAE, on April 8, 2019\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Stakeholders demand legal backing for proscription\n\nAdibe Emenyonu in Benin City, James Sowole in Akure, Bassey Inyang in Calabar, David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka, Sylvester Idowu in Warri, Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan, Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti and Amby Uneze in Owerri\n\nDespite the ban on open grazing of cattle by Southern governors, the practice has continued to flourish in the 17 states of the region with stakeholders asking for legal backing for the proscription order.\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s investigations at the weekend showed that the delay by the governors in enacting laws in their states to legalise the ban has heightened concerns among residents, particularly in the farming communities of the states.\n\nWith the absence of the law, according to THISDAY\u2019s investigations, herders have continued to openly graze their cattle, leading in some cases to frequent clashes between them and farmers whose farmlands suffer devastation due to the movement of the animals.\n\nThe governors, under the aegis of the Southern Nigeria Governors Forum (SNGF), rising from a meeting in Asaba, the Delta State capital, on May 11, had, among others announced a ban on open grazing to check the escalating conflict between farmers and herders.\n\nHowever, their decision had riled the federal government with President Muhammadu Buhari querying the legality of the ban.\n\nIn Ondo State, THISDAY gathered that the Bill against Open Grazing and other Matters Related has passed through the second reading but the lawmakers couldn\u2019t go further in the legislative process due to the ongoing strike by parliamentary workers.\n\nBut open grazing by herders has reduced drastically in the state, particularly in places close to urban areas.\n\nInvestigation revealed that the herders still move their cows in many villages like Osi, Ogbese, Ala, Igbatoro, Eleyowo and other villages in Akure North Local Government Area.\n\nAlso, sources told THISDAY that the practice is still going on in villages in Ondo North but not with the impunity earlier displayed by herders.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, the Commander of the Ondo State Security Network, Amotekun, Chief Adetunji Adeleye, said open grazing had reduced in the state as the security agency no longer give them chances to continue the illegal practice.\n\nHe said: \u201cHowever, thinking that we would not have some herders still engaging in open grazing in view of the ban and the operation of Amotekun is like saying why do we still have crime when there are policemen working?\n\n\u201cOndo State Government through Amotekun is not relenting. The herders know they are doing the wrong thing. Once they see us, they run away. They know they are doing the wrong thing destroying some people\u2019s means of livelihood for yours to thrive, we see it as being unfair.\n\n\u201cThe position of government is very clear about it. No open grazing is no open grazing, and anybody that is engaging in it is doing illegal thing and anybody that is caught, will face the full wrath of the law.\u201d\n\nIn Cross River State, the herders were still practising open grazing as usual in some communities in Odukpani, Obanliku, Yala, Yakurr, and Obubra Local Government Areas.\n\nHowever, THISDAY gathered that there have been no clashes between the herders and any of the communities since the cows are restricted to the areas where they have been grazing for decades.\n\n\u201cThe owners of the cows pay rent to the community for the space the cows are taken to feed in the bush along Calabar-Itu highway. That is how we have been operating with them for years, and there is no problem; we have never heard problems,\u201d a community leader from Okoyong confided in THISDAY.\n\nHowever, the state government is insisting that it will not go it alone, but would wait for the southern governors to work out modalities on the way forward.\n\nPress Secretary to the Cross River State Governor, Mr. Christian Ita, said grazing in restricted area was not strange to the state having established the first cattle ranch in Nigeria; the Obudu Cattle Ranch Resort.\n\n\u201cAs I said, I am sure modalities would be worked out at the Southern governors\u2019 level, and then we proceed from there,\u201d he added.\n\nIn Anambra State, despite the ban on open grazing, herdsmen still graze cattle in communities in the state, even within the state capital territory, in open fields and on farms belonging to farmers.\n\nMr. Fredrick Okoye, a farmer in Umuokpu community, Awka South Local Government Area, told THISDAY that despite the ban on open grazing, Fulani herdsmen still graze their cattle on their farms, damaging their crops daily.\n\n\u201cThere is a law which states that if Fulani people destroy your crop, they will pay you for it, and if farmers kill cattle, the farmer will pay for it. But to tell you the truth, that arrangement has not been working. If they (herders) destroy your farm, they don\u2019t pay. If you kill their cattle, they also do not even report for payment, rather, they think of a reprisal.\n\n\u201cThat is the major reason we are afraid. They graze on our fields everyday, even today. If you come to Umuokpu today and wait until afternoon, you will see them,\u201d Okoye said.\n\nWhen THISDAY visited Okpuno and Mgbakwu communities, all around the state capital, cattle were seen in the area, grazing in open fields.\n\nThere have been cases of clashes between herdsmen and farmers in Anaku, Omor and even in riverrine parts of Anambra State.\n\nAnambra State Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr. C. Don Adinuba, said the anti-open grazing law was unnecessary as the proclamation of the ban by the governors was enough for the herders to comply.\n\nThe Speaker, Edo State House of Assembly, Hon. Marcus Onobu, also told THISDAY that the persistent open grazing of cattle in the state was due to the inability of the state government to come up with legislation against it.\n\nOnobus said Governor Godwin Obaseki was yet to come up with a bill to legalise open grazing.\n\nHe added that though a private bill against open grazing exists, the legislature was yet to debate it because it requires public hearing.\n\n\u201cBut I think the major problem is the strike action by legislative workers because already, we have a private bill before us.\n\n\u201cEven if we want to rely on the private bill without waiting for the governor, we are still going to have a public hearing, and we cannot do that since the legislative workers\u2019 strike has not been called off,\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to him, without a legislation, it will be difficult to enforce the ban on open grazing as verbal pronouncement is not enough because aggrieved persons can go to court to seek redress.\n\nIn Delta State, open grazing persists in the forest, particularly in Ughelli, Abraka, Oghara in Delta South and Central Senatorial zones.\n\nHowever, security arrangement and agitations by the people have reduced open grazing.\n\nMr. Olisa Ifeajika, Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to Delta State Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, confirmed to THISDAY that there has been a reduction in open grazing in the state.\n\nIfeajika said the state was yet to enact a law against open grazing due to the ongoing strike by parliamentary workers.\n\nDespite the anti-open grazing law in Oyo State, herders are still openly grazing their cattle in most areas of the state.\n\nAreas where open grazing is still going on in the state include Ibarapaland, Oyo/Ogbomoso expressway, Oke Ogun and some parts of Ibadan, the state capital.\n\nThe state House of Assembly in October 2019 passed a bill titled, \u2018Oyo State Open Rearing and Grazing Regulation Law\u2019, which was signed into law by Governor Seyi Makinde.\n\nHowever, Makinde has expressed the determination of his administration to enforce the law, stating that the state government will within the next eight weeks launch a task force to enforce the ban on open grazing.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn Oyo State, open grazing is against the law. The implementation plan will come out within the next six to eight weeks and the task force will cut across Oyo State. So, whoever goes against the law in this state will face the wrath of law and that is just it.\u201d\n\nMakinde\u2019s Chief Press Secretary (CPS), Mr. Taiwo Adisa, while speaking on the challenges facing the implementation of the law, identified the major one as the lack of commitment of the police and other security agencies to enforce the law.\n\nFarmers operating in Ekiti State have also raised the alarm that open grazing of cattle and other ruminant animals are still happening in all the three senatorial districts of the state.\n\nSome farmers told THISDAY in Oke Ako, Irele and Ipao in Ikole Local Government Areas and Ijan and Aisegba in Gbonyin Local Government area as well as Aaye Oja, Igogo and Osan in Moba Council Area that the practice was still effective in their areas.\n\nTHISDAY observed that the practice was even common in Ado Ekiti, the capital city, especially along Ado-Ijan-Ikare, Ado-Iworoko-Ifaki and Ado-Ikere-Akure roads.\n\nHowever, the State Commander of Ekiti State Security Network codenamed Amotekun Corps, Brig. Gen. Joe Komolafe (rtd), said the law was being vigorously enforced by the security outfit.\n\nHe said the outfit had been zealous in the enforcement of ban on open grazing of cattle, adding that some herders and cattle had been arrested with owners already in court facing charges while their cows were confiscated.\n\nAkomolafe added that his officers had engaged in shootout with some herders around 2:00am on more than four occasions around Ikole axis, which he said attested to the proactiveness of Amotekun to enforce the law.\n\n\u201cIt is part of our statutory duties to enforce the law and we are doing it. We have arrested scores of cattle owners who are in court facing charges but their cases got stalled by JUSUN\u2019s strike. Some are still being detained by the police.\n\n\u201cWe know that some herders are still disobeying this law, but we are extending our dragnets against them. Even most of them who are returning to the North due to the advent of rain used to take permission from us and we took pain to escort them to the border in Kwara or Kogi to ensure that no destruction takes place,\u201d he added..\n\nThe ban on open cattle grazing was yet to be enforced in Imo State.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the Imo State Government has so far not send any anti-open grazing bill to the House of Assembly.\n\nAt the moment, herdsmen are still seen in the bushes and by the road sides grazing their cattle without anybody or security personnel challenging them.\n\nEven in the Owerri, the capital city, as well as in other various villages and communities, open grazing still goes on unchecked.\n\nAreas where the herdsmen usually go for grazing include Irette, Avu, Obinze, in Owerri West LGA; Emekuku, Agbala, Amakohia/Akwakuma in Owerri North LGA.\n\nOther areas are Obowo, Okigwe, Mbaise, and other Local government areas.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The management of Kaduna State University (KASU) has dismissed claims in some quarters that it shut down the institution\u2019s gates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NAN, some students of the institution staged a protest on Monday over the alleged shutting down of the gates leading to the varsity.\n\nNAN reported that earlier in the day, all gates into the university were shut with only staff and medical students were allowed entrance.\n\nIt added that some of the students had come to submit their final projects while others were in the school to defend their final year projects, but were all denied access.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe development had led to the barricade of the Tafawa Balewa Way by the students before they were later dispersed by heavily armed policemen, led by Samuel Ibrahim, an assistant superintendent.\n\nThe students were, however, said to have reconvened at the back gate through Marafa Estate and continued their protest by barricading all access roads leading to the university\u2019s main entrance.\n\nKhalil Adam, welfare director of the national association of arts students, said there was no official communication from the school management to explain why they were denied access to the university.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe heard a rumour yesterday that the school has been shut down only for us to come to the institute this morning to find the gates closed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe security officers at the gate told us that they were asked to close the gate, and that only staff will be granted access.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, a final-year student of pharmaceutical science said she had come to defend her final project but was denied access to the school.\n\n\u201cWe came to school this morning to defend our final project only to find the school gate shut and all efforts to convince the security official to grant us access failed. As it stands now, we don\u2019t know our fate,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in his reaction in a statement, Adamu Bargo, the varsity\u2019s public relations officer, said it was not true that the institution shut down its gates.\n\n\u201cThe Management of Kaduna State University wishes to inform staff, students and the general public to ignore the news being spread in the social media space regarding shutting down of the university,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cIt is fake news in its entirety as well as the handiwork of mischief-makers, academic activities are in progress.\n\n\u201cManagement urges everyone to carry on with their legitimate activities as it is partnering with security agencies in the state to ensure the safety of all and sundry.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn his part, Abubakar Abdullahi, a member of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) at the institution, said that it was within the rights of the students to protest the increase in fees.\n\nThe varsity has been in the news since the state government increased the tuition fees of students from the range of N24,000 and N26,000 to N150,000 in April.\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

So, it\u2019s continuity from where my immediate predecessor stopped. It (the crisis) is not yet over. The government has the opportunity to ensure that the crises are over. It is just to implement those things,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the government has already defaulted in meeting the deadlines given by the union to address some of its demands, adding that the narrative must change to avoid another strike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou know we were on strike till late last year. We reached an agreement on how to implement the outstanding issue with the government. We will expect the government to implement those issues with timelines,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThey have reneged on a number of them in line with the timelines. But, we believe that it is not late; they can still resolve those issues for the peace and development of our universities.\n\n\u201cThey cut your salary today, they pay those who they want to pay today, they withdraw those next week; they expect those people to come to Abuja to come and beg them or look for other things for them. So, these cannot continue in a university system.\n\n\u201cAs a union, we don\u2019t love strike because we have our children here.

          "text": "Seyi Law and Ruggedman, Nigerian entertainers, have tackled Adamu Garba, former presidential candidate, for backing the federal government\u2019s suspension of Twitter in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe government had announced the indefinite suspension of the social media service on Friday due to \u201cthe persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe development has continued to spark widespread outrage, with many Nigerians, including celebrities, condemning the move.\n\nBut Garba, who had on numerous occasions called out Twitter, had backed the suspension of the microblogging site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an Instagram live session hosted by PepperRoom, a reality TV, the former presidential aspirant joined Ruggedman and Seyi Law to discuss the government\u2019s Twitter ban.\n\nDuring the session, Garba described Twitter as an \u201cinsurrectionist tool\u201d for fuelling unrest in Nigeria rather than being a platform for freedom of expression.\n\nHe also maintained his earlier stance that the suspension of the US-based social media service was a welcome development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTwitter is not a social media app, Twitter is an insurrectionist tool that is aiding and abetting Nnamdi Kanu and his terrorist IPOB commanders to be able to destroy the Nigerian space. Twitter has long ceased to be a social media platform of freedom of expression,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that there\u2019s a need to regulate the use of the social media service in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is to make them regularise it. Ask them to come and regularise, register in Nigeria, have an office in Nigeria, have an address, and pay Nigerian tax.\u201d\n\nBut reacting, Ruggedman, whose real name is Michael Ugochukwu, faulted Garba\u2019s position, noting that the suspension has left many people unemployed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rapper also said that the suspension has made it difficult for the citizens who depend on the platform to share experiences about irregularities in the society.\n\n\u201cNow we have thousands of young innocent Nigerians who did not do anything wrong but because of what happened in the street are in the police custody,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have thousands of young innocent men and women in cells being extorted and can\u2019t do anything about it. Did anybody think about it? Now we have thousands of Nigerians who on a normal day have accidents and things that happen on the streets and the fastest way they can get help is through Twitter.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Seyi Law argued that the suspension of Twitter was a violation of the constitution, adding that Lai Mohammed, minister of information, lacked the power to announce such a directive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe minister of information had no authority to make law in this country constitutionally. And secondly, even if there was going to be a ban, or probably should have been an executive order which it wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nThe comedian said it is unfortunate that the government was more interested in banning Twitter rather than address major issues facing the country.\n\nHe alleged that Adamu\u2019s support for Twitter\u2019s suspension was to get more users for Crowwe, his instant messaging and financial transaction app, in the country.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t act as if you don\u2019t know, because the ban will favour your own app, that\u2019s the most selfish way to go. We can\u2019t monopolise your app in this nation,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe know what monopoly has caused in other nations\u2026if you want to market your app, do that and ensure it\u2019s working. We must allow fair dealings. We should not sit down and be justifying wrongs with another wrong.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable. All rights reserved.

          "text": "I arrived at Moyosola\u2019s home a few minutes after 9 am last Thursday. Our conversation took place over two plates of half English breakfast, two cups of coffee, and homemade fruit smoothies.\n\nMoyosola Kara is the director of marketing and communications at Eze Wholesale \u2013 a YC-backed startup on a mission to simplify the wholesale electronics trade market. She\u2019s an ambitious straight-shooter who is serious about taking breaks and carving out time to reconnect with herself and the people in her life.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Moyosola to Centre Stage because she\u2019s had an unconventional but rewarding career as a marketing and communications specialist. Her experience working with businesses across multiple industries has equipped her with valuable skills that are needed in today\u2019s digital economy.\n\nTell me the last good book you read\n\nI just finished Untamed by Glennon Doyle. I also read a really good book by Elaine Welteroth. She was the youngest editor in Conde Nast\u2019s history and the second African American person to be made editor-in-chief at Teen Vogue.\n\nYou have described yourself as a homebody who enjoys the occasional getaway. How are you able to marry your introverted personality with your role as a communications executive?\n\nBeing able to switch into extroverted comms mode provides a nice balance. If I had a job in a quiet little cubicle, I would probably be miserable. I get my fix from my job. I get my fix when I interact and engage with my team, and with customers. Human interaction is very important, especially because we are still recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nTell me about school. What did you study? Where did you go?\n\nI did not study marketing or communications (surprise surprise). I have a Bachelor of Commerce in Law (BCom Law) and it\u2019s a program that is only offered in South Africa. I started off with studying economics, but after my first year and learning more about what economists did for a living, I realized that I didn\u2019t want to go down that career path.\n\nSo, you changed your degree?\n\nYes, I did \u2013 at the start of my second year. Here\u2019s the truth: initially, I thought I was going to enjoy the law aspect of the program. I mean I enjoyed speaking, had gone through Toastmasters, and being a lawyer seemed like a viable career option. I was wrong. In the end, I realized that I didn\u2019t want to be a lawyer.\n\nWow. How were you able to figure out your career path?\n\nI didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do or what kind of career I wanted to pursue. It wasn\u2019t until my time at Elizabeth Arden that I figured out my passion: talking to customers and connecting them to their favourite brands or businesses. When I was in South Africa, Elizabeth Arden was typecast as a beauty brand that catered exclusively to white South African women. Black South African women bought their perfumes, but make-up and skincare? No chance. When Elizabeth Arden was ready to change that image, I became fully immersed in trying to figure out our campaigns and how to speak to this new target audience.\n\nSo you kind of fell into marketing and communications?\n\nBasically. I didn\u2019t realize until years later that what I was doing at Elizabeth Arden was marketing. And I loved it.\n\nHow are you able to wear both hats? Especially because marketing and communications (comms) are two different departments?\n\nMy career in Nigeria started in PR. Then I worked in digital marketing, media, marketing, before finally settling down in a communications role at 54gene. My learnings have prepared me for where I am right now and given me the skills I need to wear both hats effectively well.\n\nHow do you find alignment between the two?\n\nI\u2019ll admit that although they are significantly different, there are parts of marketing and communication that are interwoven. For me, it\u2019s about finding synergy in those interwoven parts. My job is to set key goals and metrics for each department and ensure that we are all working towards achieving them with maximum efficiency. Sometimes, it gets tricky.\n\nHow so?\n\nWell, comms is heavy on messaging and storytelling. While marketing is more tactical and strategic with a lot more moving parts. And obviously, because we are in a fast-paced social media and technology age, digital marketing is hot right now and isn\u2019t what it used to be three years ago.\n\nHow are you able to keep up with the changes?\n\nSocial media is my new learning ground. You\u2019ll be surprised by how much you learn on Twitter, Youtube, and Medium. On the marketing side, I follow themarketingtopic on Twitter and I\u2019m also subscribed to Marketing Brew. I also enjoyed reading Clueless To Designer \u2013 it\u2019s a beginner\u2019s guide to product design written by Mitchelle Chibundu. Mark Manson also writes a newsletter that I\u2019m subscribed to and enjoy reading every now and then.\n\nHow are you applying what you are learning on the job?\n\nMy role at Eze is vastly different from my role at 54gene. With Eze, I\u2019m dealing with markets outside of Africa which means I have to learn how to speak the marketing language for those markets. I have to draw inspiration from marketing leaders who understand what Eze is trying to do in the wholesale ecosystem.\n\nWhat would you say to aspiring and working communications and marketing professionals?\n\nFirstly, prioritize storytelling. Eat, breathe, and live storytelling. Explore how different brands are telling stories and motivating their customers to buy a product or engage with their posts on social media.\n\nSecondly, study consumer behaviour. What is driving people to spend money? What are your customers\u2019 pain points? Who are you selling to?\n\nLastly, invite empathy into your work. Tactics are important but if you don\u2019t know how to connect with your audience on a deeper level, you will lose them to a competitor. A growing number of young buyers are paying attention to businesses that care about promoting social change and impact.\n\nMoyosola\u2019s tip: Empathy and storytelling go hand-in-hand.\n\nWhat does good leadership look like to you?\n\nI believe that leadership is about paying attention to your people. It\u2019s important to be kind, empathetic, and supportive. I think not enough is said about managers who support their team members. You need to move away from just doling out tasks to going over and beyond to arm your team with the tools and resources they need to succeed. I\u2019m dedicated to ensuring that my team members are developing their skill sets and getting access to the training they need.",

          "text": "South African Mobility startup WhereIsMyTransport has raised a $14.5 million Series A extension round to continue its expansion across emerging markets.\n\nThe round was led by Naspers Foundry, Cathay AfricInvest Innovation Fund and Japan\u2019s SBI Investment. This investment comes a year after the company raised a $7.5 million Series A round from investors including Google and Toyota Tsusho. This brings the total raised by the company during its Series A funding to $22 million.\n\nFormed in 2016, WhereIsMyTransport is a big data platform that provides sustainable mobility solutions in emerging markets. It maps formal and informal public transport networks. The company then uses data obtained to improve the public transport experience, making commutes safe and accessible.\n\nIts products are used by cities to coordinate and monitor services, operators to integrate their systems, and passengers, who access the platform through apps and endpoints connected to the WhereIsMyTransport platform. WhereIsMyTransport has been used to enrich Google Maps in Mexico and has helped the World Bank examine access to job opportunities via public transport in 12 African cities.\n\nWith this new investment, WhereIsMyTransport plans to continue its expansion across emerging markets, with a launch in Peru planned for later this year. It has already mapped 34 African cities and has over 100,000 users in Mexico.\n\n\u201cWhereIsMyTransport started in South Africa, focused on becoming a central source of accurate and reliable public transport data for high-growth markets. We\u2019re thrilled to welcome Naspers as an investor as our journey continues in megacities across the majority of the world,\u201d said CEO Devin de Vries.\n\nFabian Whate, head of Naspers Foundry, said WhereIsMyTransport had a strong track record of developing the best-in-class technology for improving the daily commutes of people across the world.\n\n\u201cThe mobility technology company is a great addition to the Naspers Foundry investment portfolio and we look forward to working with the WhereIsMyTransport team as they take their business to the next level,\u201d he said.\n\nMobility in emerging markets via public transportation is often a hassle \u2013 it\u2019s inefficient and time-consuming. The successful expansion of WhereIsMyTransport would reduce friction in the movement of people and goods across Africa and other emerging markets.",

          "title": "Club Swan Creates Services To Address Challenges Faced By Nigerian Entrepreneurs",
          "text": "Abiodun Ajayi \u2013 Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Strategist\n\nClub Swan, a global lifestyle club designed for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, has launched new services to address challenges faced by Nigerian cryptocurrency entrepreneurs.\n\n\n\nInnovation in payments first came with the advent of paper money to replace bartering. The second wave of innovation continued with the issuance of credit and debit cards. Now, through technology, we are on the third wave of payment innovation: the blockchain and digital currencies.\n\nTo provide recent historical context, in the late 1990s, many believed mobile phones were too expensive for a large majority of people in Africa. Lack of infrastructure meant that it was unthinkable to just set up a mobile telecommunications market. However, in 1998, Mo Ibrahim saw an opportunity and developed a business model to meet the needs of Africans. This triggered development across the continent and created thousands of jobs. The telecoms industry in Africa is now worth over $200 billion.\n\nToday, cryptocurrency has initiated an entrepreneurial boom in Nigeria. A report by Chain Analysis showed that in 2020, Nigeria ranked first among African countries in peer-to-peer payments. Up to $139 million was traded in peer-to-peer payments in 2020 according to the report.\n\nCryptocurrency activity in Africa.\n\nThe basis of this adoption is the need for viable alternatives to challenges we face in global payments.\n\nNigeria has become a hotbed for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and has unleashed a vibrant crypto and blockchain community alongside a teeming population of digitally native youth who are unabashedly united to participate in the third wave of payment innovation.\n\nTo a large extent, the situations we see in Nigeria are indicative of the trends occurring generally in sub-Saharan Africa. Simply put, there is a wave of enlightenment and Nigerians are willing to test and figure out new ways of doing things facilitated by technology.\n\nWhen oil revenue plunged in 2020, a dollar shortage ensued which devalued the Naira. As of March 2021, the inflation rate in Nigeria hovered around 18%. Aspiring business leaders are now dealing with the fact that current financial options available simply can\u2019t keep up with inflation. Hence, many entrepreneurs have turned to crypto as a viable option.\n\nChallenges faced by Nigerian entrepreneurs\n\nParticipating in Global eCommerce International Settlements\n\nParticipating in Global eCommerce\n\nCryptocurrency allows entrepreneurs to transfer and receive money from anywhere worldwide. However, some face undue obstacles when payment firms place limits on Nigerians.\n\nCrypto has enabled Tola Fadugbagbe, a businessman who moved to Lagos 10 years ago to grow his business. Today, he sources his mobile phones from east Asia and he finds it easier to make payments to his east Asian partners in bitcoin.\n\nCrypto has created a paradigm shift in the way people start to think about emerging markets and creating new business opportunities. The success of cryptocurrency can be attributed to the fact that business owners need alternative ways to conduct trade in a seamless fashion.\n\nInternational Settlements\n\nCryptocurrency and blockchain technology have made it possible for individuals to conduct business virtually without any intermediaries, thereby enabling companies worldwide to reach out to customers across international borders. In the past few years, merchants have leveraged for cross-border payments. According to Lagos vendor Abolaji Odunjo, \u201cmaking payments with Bitcoin makes transactions easier and reduces costs.\u201d\n\nCrypto advantages for Nigerian Entrepreneurs\n\nExpanded payments opportunities\n\nSince the dawn of civilization, payment for goods and services has been ever present. However, it has gone through innovation over the years. From the earliest exchange of goods by barter to the advent of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWith crypto, there are expanded payment opportunities. This makes transactions easier and more efficient.\n\nTrusted transactions\n\nCryptocurrency transactions are based on blockchain which is publicly accessible and transparent. The transactions are relatively secure and fast.\n\nWe Nigerians know, the quickest way to build trust is to give customers the quickest response time as we prefer quick service delivery. The entrepreneur or business owner that can provide the shortest time between when the customer makes payment and when the customer receives value ultimately wins the heart of the customer.\n\nDisadvantages of crypto for Nigerian Entrepreneurs\n\nNo reliable methods to off-ramp large amounts of crypto to fiat\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to large funds of $2000 and above, only one reliable service is available to Nigerians.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

In addition, the body further prohibits media platforms from using User Generated Content (UGC) as sources in their reportage.\n\nThe statement calls for strict compliance citing lines from the NBC Act and The Broadcasting Code that point to media companies having an obligation to adhere to national laws and be mindful of content capable of inciting violence or public unrest.\n\nAlthough not outrightly stated, defaulters could be penalised based on the federation\u2019s Attorney General, Abubakar Malami\u2019s order to prosecute any Nigerian still using the microblogging platform.\n\nThe latest order resulting from the ongoing Twitter suspension in the country since Friday, June 4, 2021, is a way of disincentivising individuals and corporate bodies from patronising Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, this proves to be a challenging period for businesses strongly dependent on the social media platform.\n\nWhile the statement does not clearly state what media platforms are affected by the directive, the NBC Act defines broadcasting stations as entities \u2014 like radio, sound, television, cable, or satellite stations \u2014 that have received a broadcasting licence after satisfying the regulator\u2019s requirements. From the definition, it is not clear if new media companies are also caught in this web.\n\nThis is not the first time the NBC is clamping down on broadcasters in the country.\n\nRecall, during the October 2020 #EndSARS protest, NBC suspended three media companies on the claims of using UGC as their sources while accusing them of misinformation and releasing content that could incite unrest.\n\nIn a previous article, we established the role that UGC has played in the past in Nigeria while questioning why it should be forbidden because of the October 20, 2020 Lekki Tollgate Massacre.\n\nFollowing the Twitter suspension order, some digital platforms have disengaged themselves from receiving customer complaints via their Twitter handles, advising users to reach out through other channels; others have put up disclaimer posts about where they are tweeting from.\n\nFor one, recent events have pointed to the intensified drive of the federal government to inhibit free speech, one of the many signs that the country may gradually be borrowing China\u2019s cards.\n\nAs Twitter users in Nigeria find alternatives to access the platform either through VPN and other channels, it remains to be seen how this would ultimately impact journalism, freedom of speech, and timely dissemination of information in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, Nigeria has finally joined the list of countries losing millions of dollars to government-led Internet crackdowns annually.

          "title": "#TwitterBan: Exploring the legal intricacies of Nigeria\u2019s decision",
          "text": "It is no longer news that the Nigerian government has indefinitely banned Twitter\u2019s operations in the country.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, on Friday, June 4, 2021. He also revealed the government\u2019s directive to the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to begin the process of licensing over-the-top (OTT) and social media platforms.\n\nSince then, we\u2019ve seen the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) instruct telcos to suspend access to Twitter.\n\nIn another statement released on Saturday, June 5, 2021, Garba Shehu, the President\u2019s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, cited the platform\u2019s role in disseminating false information and fake news as the rationale behind the ban.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also advised disregarding the notion that the ban is a knee-jerk reaction to the deletion of a tweet made by the Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe tweet in question, which referred to the Nigerian Civil War, was removed by Twitter for violating its policy on referencing mass murders, violent events, or specific means of violence where protected groups have been the targets or victims.\n\nThis is not the first time the government has attempted Internet censorship. It had gone the expected legislative route in 2019 with the \u201csocial media bill\u201d, which was outrightly rejected by Nigerians.\n\nThe bill is officially titled \u201cProtection from Internet Falsehoods and Manipulations and Other Related Matters Bill 2019\u201d and prescribes a \u20a6300,000 ($730) fine or a jail term of up to three years for persons spreading false information or that which could affect the nation\u2019s security and relationship with other countries.\n\nBecause it was perceived to be a gag on citizen\u2019s right to freedom of expression as enshrined in the Constitution, it received a lot of backlash from the Nigerian public. As of press time, the bill has not progressed further than the second reading stage.\n\nSo far, discussions on Techpoint Africa have focused on the economic impact, a possible Internet firewall, and security issues arising from the use of VPN. However, this discourse will analyse the legal issues surrounding the government\u2019s decision.\n\nOur chat with three lawyers \u2014 Co-founder, Tech-Hive Advisory, Ridwan Oloyede; Lead Advisor, Lawrathon, Enyioma Madubuike; and Tech Lawyer and Policy Consultant, Timi Olagunju, \u2014 is detailed below.\n\nIs the ban legal?\n\nAll three lawyers agree that the ban is illegal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Oloyede, the ban is \u201can attack and suppression of the freedom of expression guaranteed under the Constitution and other international human right norms that Nigeria is a party to.\u201d\n\nThis right to freedom of expression as contained in Section 39 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) provides for freedom to hold an opinion and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference.\n\nA 2016 United Nations (UN) resolution on the promotion, protection, and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet guarantees the protection of human rights \u2014 particularly, freedom of expression \u2014 offline and online. A resolution confirmed by Oloyede to have been supported by Nigeria.\n\nOther international treaties which expressly provide for this right include the African Declaration on Internet Rights and Freedom, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, all of which Nigeria is a party to.\n\nTo put all of this in context, the Constitution is regarded as the \u201cgrundnorm\u201d of all laws in Nigeria. The law from which all other laws, policies, regulations, and guidelines draw their legality. If any of these in any way deviate from the spirit of the Constitution, it cannot stand.\n\nAs Olagunju puts it, these international treaties/conventions are meant to promote rather than restrict this right. The only condition for restriction is where it is expressly provided for by law or as a matter of national security, public order, or the reputation of others. This is also contained in Section 45 of the Constitution.\n\nAccording to Oloyede, the conditions for derogating from human rights under the constitution were not met.\n\n\u201cAn executive decision cannot be considered a law reasonably justified in a democratic society. As we speak, there is no legislation from the National Assembly prohibiting the use.\u201d\n\nAs Madubuike puts it, \u201cThere are processes provided for actions that would impact citizens\u2019 rights; this unilateral action has been done without any due process. None.\u201d\n\nOther aspects to consider under this heading involve the declaration made by the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, which effectively orders the prosecution of anyone found using Twitter.\n\nNigerian law clearly states that no one can be prosecuted for a crime that is unknown to law.\n\nAccording to Madubuike, \u201cTweeting is not a crime. The fact that a minister says otherwise does not make it so. Crimes are created by specific laws made by lawmakers, not by declaration of a Minister. We are still a constitutional democracy despite all appearances otherwise.\u201d\n\nNBC, Ministry of Information and Culture, and its powers\n\nThe NBC, by virtue of its establishing Act, has regulatory powers in respect of broadcasting. This means that its purview is in relation to television and radio companies. This places the Commission under the aegis of the Ministry of Information and Culture, headed by Mohammed.\n\nTherefore, in the context of Mohammed\u2019s proclamation, it seems he may have overstepped his bounds\n\nOlagunju attributes the powers exercised by the MInister as likely being under the umbrella of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) as an agency with an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) framework under the purview of the Ministry for Communication and Digital Economy.\n\nHe also says that the directive regarding OTT and social media licences might be a back door to enacting the social media bill, which must be looked at in light of the National Assembly\u2019s oversight powers in that regard.\n\nOther legal issues which have been raised include the use of videos and pictures gotten from Twitter as evidence in court. Both Oloyede and Olagunju agree that the Evidence Act of Nigeria is more concerned with the relevance of the evidence rather than its source.\n\nThus, a defense of a Twitter ban in such a scenario would not suffice.\n\nWhat we may have to worry about is the Judiciary\u2019s role and independence. Ordinarily, Nigeria practises the doctrine of separation of powers which, as Oloyede explains, means the Executive, Judiciary, and Legislature are independent bodies.\n\nSeveral organisations such as the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) have made known their intentions to contend the legality of the ban in court.\n\nWhile we know the ban is illegal, it is now up to the courts to give a decision.",

          "title": "#TwitterBan: Should Nigerians be worried about VPNs?",
          "text": "Following the announcement of the indefinite suspension of Twitter in Nigeria on Friday, June 4, 2021, Twitter users in the country have opted for Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to bypass the ban.\n\nA VPN allows individuals to protect sensitive information by securing a public connection to a private network. Any data that passes through a VPN is converted into a code to prevent unauthorised access. This protects users against probable hacking attacks or theft of crucial data.\n\nWhile the government and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can monitor daily online activities and restrict the websites or apps that Internet subscribers can visit or access, a VPN can provide security solutions that restore online privacy and liberty.\n\nWith a VPN, you can easily browse the Internet without worrying about restrictions, monitoring, or tracking done by the ISPs, government, or even third parties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, while the adoption of VPNs might be a quick solution for users to bypass the Twitter ban, some of these free VPNs are not safe enough to protect or keep users\u2019 data private because they compromise their security.\n\nResearch by the ICSI Networking and Security Group found that 38% of the 283 Android VPNs studied contained malware.\n\nAccording to Fortinet \u2014 an American cybersecurity company \u2014 this malware could be used by cybercriminals to steal users\u2019 data, gain unauthorised access to their data or machine, or launch a cyberattack.\n\nIn 2020, according to research by Nord VPN, seven free VPN providers \u2014 UFO VPN, FAST VPN, Super VPN, Free VPN, Flash VPN, Secure VPN, and Rabbit VPN \u2014 in Hong-Kong exposed 1.2 terabytes of data collected from millions of users who trusted them with their logs even though they claimed to offer no-log policies.\n\nUsers\u2019 data containing sensitive and personally identifiable information (PII) such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, emails, home addresses, and passwords were unprotected and publicly made available.\n\nLike the ISPs and the government, some free VPNs track their users\u2019 online activities. The ICSI research discovered that 72% of the free VPN services analysed embedded third-party tracking tools in their software.\n\nThis permits these VPNs to sell the information they collect to third parties and allows advertisers to target users.\n\nSome free VPNs conceal information about sharing or selling user data, but others disclose it in their privacy policies. But how many people read privacy policies before accepting them?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFree VPNs are not free because they money rise their operations in other ways. To make revenue, they either sell users\u2019 data to third parties or flood you with ads without your permission.\n\nThe adage then comes to mind, if you are not paying for the product, you are the product.\n\nWhile paid VPNs have ad-blocking tools, malware protection features, and unlimited bandwidth that secure users\u2019 data, free VPNs have a smaller infrastructure, leading to slower Internet speeds.\n\nIn times like the Twitter ban, VPN services might be a solution. However, users must carefully choose what country they connect with because VPNs are illegal in some countries.\n\nTherefore, do your research to ensure your connection is not established in countries like Russia, Uganda, Turkey, and China, amongst others.\n\nUsing a paid VPN will cost you more money than your data subscription. Still, there are affordable paid VPNs that you can access individually or as a family.\n\nComparitech advises that before choosing a paid VPN, look for a provider that actively prevents IP address disclosures. Also, ensure it does not collect log data that users share on it.\n\nLook for a provider that has a VPN kill switch feature.

          "text": "Some 18 million uninsured adult Nigerians have indicated interest in microinsurance products, according to the result from EFInA\u2019s 2020 survey on Access to Financial Services in Nigeria released on Thursday.\n\nThis opens a huge opportunity for insurers in the country who are struggling to grow their customer base.\n\nCurrently, nine out of 10 Nigerians do not have any insurance subscription. Top among reasons for this are lack of tailor-made insurance products and low disposable income on account of the sluggish economic growth that has remained fragile since 2015.\n\nThe unwillingness by many Nigerians to take up insurance products has kept the insurance penetration rate in Africa\u2019s largest economy at less than 1 percent in the last decade.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that most insurance products that we have currently do not address the needs that we have in Nigeria,\u201d said Ayokunle Olubunmi, head, Financial Institutions, Agusto & Co.\n\nAs the country is evolving, Olubunmi believes \u201cthere is a need\u201d for insurance companies \u201cto adjust products to meet demand\u201d.\n\nRead Also: How riot, insecurity insurance is becoming a big deal in Nigeria\n\nGoing by EFInA\u2019s data that put Nigeria\u2019s adult population at 106 million (18 years and above), 103 million are outside the insurance scheme as only 2 percent or 2 million adults were insured as of 2020.\n\n\u201cOnly 2 percent of Nigerian adults are insured, but 18 million uninsured adults say they would be interested in microinsurance,\u201d Ashley Immanuel, CEO of EFInA, said.\n\nInsurance as a percentage of the adult population that is covered by a regulated insurance policy in Nigeria has remained stagnant at 2 percent since 2016 when it moved from the 1 percent reported in 2014, as analyzed from the data by EFInA.\n\nOut of the 40 percent insurance inclusion target set by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for 2020, only 2 percent was achieved as the target fell short by 38 percent.\n\nExplaining why many Nigerians don\u2019t consider an insurance cover as a priority, Jim Ovia, founder/chairman of Zenith Bank Plc, said in a statement that the major problem \u201cwe see in the Nigerian market is that per capita income of the people is very low and people tend not to take insurance as a priority against other things related to them\u201d.\n\nThat explains why the 18 million Nigerian adults who told EFInA of their interest to take up insurance said they wanted micro products.\n\nThe high cost of living in Nigeria which is not matched by the country\u2019s per capita income as the fragile economic growth has remained lower than the population growth rate since 2015 means that more Nigerians are becoming poorer, the reason why the country\u2019s \u2018sachet economy\u2019 has continued to expand.\n\nIncreasingly more Nigerians are only able to buy less of their usual consumption basket as a result of shrinking purchasing power.\n\nWith the unemployment rate at a record high of 33.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020, and a population growth rate at an average of 3 percent per annum, Nigeria\u2019s 2021 first-quarter GDP growth by a paltry 0.51 percent is anything but undesirable.\n\nInflation rate which measures the rate at which the prices of goods and service increase in Nigeria eased to18.12 percent in April down slightly from a four year high of 18.17 percent in March.\n\nBefore Covid-19, about 80 million of Nigeria\u2019s 200m people lived on less than the equivalent of $1.90 a day. The pandemic and population growth could see that figure rise to almost 100m by 2023, says the World Bank.\n\nWhile the impact of COVID-19 is easily blamed for the recent economic woes in Nigeria, an evaluation of the country\u2019s macro-economic indicators before the pandemic shows Nigeria was grappling with low growth before the pandemic triggered a recession and created large financing gaps, including dollar shortages and inflation.\n\nEconomic growth in Africa\u2019s most populous nation averaged 1.2 percent between 2015 and 2020. The problem with that is the population grew two times faster at an average of 2.6 percent per year.\n\nDespite the low opportunity for many Nigerians to improve their income level, insurance, according to analysts is an important financial services product that should be in their consumption basket as it could help to mitigate losses, increase financial stability and promote trade and commerce activities that can result in sustainable economic growth and development.\n\nAccess to basic financial services like a savings account, credit and insurance means that a country is financially included. Nigeria recorded 64.1 percent financial inclusion rate in 2020, meaning 35.9 percent or 38.1 million adults, an increase from the 36.6 million in 2018 were excluded in 2020. A higher exclusion rate in Nigeria could lead to a poorer population as lack of access to credit and insurance puts them at an economic disadvantage.\n\nAccording to analysts, the challenge of insurance companies to deliver on the funds they will raise to meet the required capital base will birth innovative products that will consequently help to deepen Nigeria\u2019s less than 1 percent insurance penetration rate.\n\nThe National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) said it has been working to increase the capital base of insurance companies in the past few years to enable industry players to take on more risk and create innovative products.\n\nEven though NAICOM has suspended the recapitalisation exercise for insurers and reinsurers, following a court order issued 10 days before the deadline of the first tranche of the exercise which was to take effect on 31 December, 2020 analysts believe raising the capital base of the industry players will be a catalyst to deepening Nigeria\u2019s insurance penetration rate that has not recorded significant improvement in the last decade.",

In addition to all the receipts, they incurred debt of more than N10 billion; I want to find out what happened.\n\n\u201cWe are operating a system that is not working anymore and we all must agree to change it because we are all involved. We can only deliver services to our people only if we agree moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe must clean up the local government system knowing that elections will soon take us back to the people who will ask us about our electoral promises. The clean-up is necessary to enable us to deliver services to our people.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how well we perform in the state, the local government is closest to the people. If the local government does not work, it will be difficult for us to show what we have achieved. What happens at the local government level affects the people.\n\n\u201cWhen the term of the past local government administration started, we knew that we had to undertake some changes. We sought people with integrity and experience to take charge of the local government. We know what happened during the political season.\u201d\n\nHinting on his government\u2019s backing for local government autonomy, the governor noted: \u201cI have come to realise that there are structural problems in the local government. We don\u2019t take money or touch the local government\u2019s money. We are transparent and open as we don\u2019t interfere in the local government\u2019s finances.\n\n\u201cIf you want me to publish the amount that accrues to local governments monthly, I will do that to ensure transparency in the incoming administration. Moving forward, I will hold local government leaders responsible for any mismanagement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to fulfilling our promises to the people of the state. We must fix the engine of government, make it work more effectively and ensure development in the local government areas,\u201d he reassured.\n\nThe governor further charged local governments not to rely on monthly federal allocation but to be innovative and come up with better means of improving their revenue.\n\nObaseki stated: \u201cThe money is not there again as it used to be. The dependence of money from Abuja is not possible anymore, that is why I am insisting and emphasising local government reforms.\n\n\u201c70 to 80 percent of finance for local governments comes from Abuja and there will be problems if the money stops coming. We will not and can\u2019t continue like this. You will help me to stop people from collecting revenue and putting it in their private pockets. We have enough resources to keep us going.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must bring the leadership together and agree on the way forward as this is the only way to solve the problem faced by the State,\u201d he said.\n\nA leader of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Igueben Local Government Area, Chief Felix Omi Imoisili said, \u201cWe will collaborate with you in the reforms you are embarking on at the local government level.

          "title": "CBN gas policy holds out promise for domestic market",
          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThere is high optimism among Oil and gas experts and economic analysts that the target of expanding gas consumption in Nigeria would be substantially achieved with appropriate deployment of the N250bn gas intervention fund set aside by the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nThe use of cooking gas in Nigeria increased to one million metric tonnes in 2020 from about 400MT consumption level recorded four years ago. But operators attribute the increase to the removal of the subsidy on kerosene, noting that Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) penetration was still far from the national target of five million metric tonnes set for next year.\n\nIt is no longer debatable that Nigeria is endowed with enormous natural gas resource. However, how to use this resource to develop and transform the nation\u2019s economy and add significant value to the lives of its citizens remains a major issue for decades.\n\nAccording to the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) \u2013the regulator of activities in the Nigerian oil and gas industry, as at January 2020, Nigeria\u2019s proven gas reserves stood at 203.16trillion cubic feet. The nation\u2019s unproven gas reserve is still at about 600trillion cubic feet. These numbers no doubt put Nigeria as a major player in the world gas market, ranking as the ninth largest gas producer globally and the number one on the African continent.\n\nFor long, there have been conversations around how Nigeria can leverage the vast opportunities in its gas resource to open up the country for investments, which will in turn lead to massive job creation, enhanced energy efficiency, increased productivity as well as increased revenue to both government and businesses.\n\nAlthough, Nigeria prides itself as a major exporter of LNG to the world via the Nigeria LNG Limited, making gas available for domestic use through business-friendly government policies and actions will help a great deal in driving economic diversification and competition.\n\nPlayers in the country\u2019s gas sector are of the view that there is no better time to optimise the potential of the gas resources than now that the whole world is struggling to survive the impact of coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTo them, the pandemic and its attendant economic turmoil has presented an opportunity for the country to look inward by prioritising in-country utilisation of the abundant gas resources. They believe there should be increased attention to the development of gas infrastructure in Nigeria and the deepening of domestic consumption and utilisation of the commodity in order to boost the country\u2019s economic development.\n\nHowever, despite the abundant gas potential, Nigeria still struggles to develop and grow its economy, a situation that makes jest of the country at the international front.\n\n\u201cNigeria does represent quite an interesting paradox. We are major resource holders, major exporter of gas, at the same time we struggle on the domestic front with de-industrialization, with unmet domestic gas demand and insufficiency in gas supply to the power sector for power generation,\u201d President of the Nigerian Gas Association (NGA), Mrs Audrey Joe-Ezigbo, once said.\n\nCBN to the rescue\n\nIn order to make Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) the fuel of choice for transportation and LPG the fuel of choice for domestic cooking, captive power and small industrial complexes, the federal government introduced the National Gas Expansion Programme (NGEP). Under the NGEP, the CBN is providing N250 billion loan to help stimulate investment in the gas value chain as part of its efforts to stimulate finance to critical sectors of the economy.\n\nIn a guideline titled \u2018Framework for the implementation of intervention facility for the national gas expansion programme\u2019, CBN set N10bn as the maximum loan an obligor can access under its N250bn intervention fund for the gas sector.\n\nPart of the term loan conditions for manufacturers, processors, wholesale distributors, was that the term loan, \u201cShall be determined based on the activity and shall not exceed N10bn per obligor. Working capital is maximum of N500m per obligor.\u201d\n\nIt said the objectives of the facility included improved access to finance for private sector investments in the domestic gas value chain; and also to stimulate investments in the development of infrastructure to optimise the domestic gas resources for economic development.\n\nThe facility, the apex bank said, also aimed to fast-track the adoption of CNG as the fuel of choice for transportation and power generation, as well as LPG as the fuel of choice for domestic cooking, transportation and captive power.\n\nIt would also fast-track the development of gas-based industries particularly petrochemical (fertilizer, methanol, etc) to support large industries, such as agriculture, textile, and related industries; provide leverage for additional private sector investments in the domestic gas market; and boost employment across the country.\n\nEligible activities under the intervention include establishment of gas processing plants and small-scale petrochemical plants; establishment of gas cylinder manufacturing plants; establishment of L-CNG regasification modular systems; and establishment of auto gas conversion kits or components manufacturing plants.\n\nOthers are establishment of CNG primary and secondary compression stations; establishment and manufacturing of LPG retail skid tanks and refilling equipment; development/enhancement of auto gas transportation systems, conversion and distribution infrastructure; and enhancement of domestic cylinder production and distribution by cylinder manufacturing plants and LPG wholesale outlets.\n\nIt also involves the establishment/expansion of micro distribution outlets and service centres for LPG sales, domestic cylinder injection and exchange; and any other mid to downstream gas value chain related activity recommended by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources.\n\n\u201cThe intervention fund by CBN is a welcome development because it will not only support in deepening the consumption of gas but will help ameliorate sicknesses caused by the use of firewood,\u201d an economic analyst with interest in public health, Mr. Bath Onwuachu, told our correspondent.\n\nHe urged operators in the gas industry to take advantage of the fund to further expand the sector and increase the penetration of gas consumption. According to Onwuachu, deepening of gas usage would reduce the rate of deforestation, a development that would impact positively on the environment.\n\nMr. Lambert Ojo, a gas processing and evaporative cooling specialist, believes the intervention for local investors in the gas sector would stimulate the economy. He, however, called for a transparent and seamless process when obtaining the facility from the apex bank in order to encourage industry players.\n\n\u201cWe have enough to do in the domestic gas space. What is happening internationally in the near future should not affect us because there\u2019s a lot we can do with our resource,\u201d he said.\n\nRecently, the Executive Secretary, Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF), Ahmed Bobboi, stated that PEF was aligning with the CBN and the federal government to further deepen the consumption of gas in Nigeria. He said to achieve this, the agency was planning to equalise gas price so as to ensure that more citizens had access to gas.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are trying to introduce the bridging scheme to gas because government has declared this year till 2030 as a decade of gas.\n\n\u201cAnd we say if this (petrol price equalisation) is working for the economy for over 45 years now effectively, if we can extend the practice to gas we believe that it will add value to the economy in so many ways in the value chain.\u201d",

          "text": "Two persons were reportedly shot and injured on Saturday after residents of a community, recently attacked by bandits, blocked the convoy of Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State while protesting against insecurity in the state.\n\nThe protest followed the killing of 88 persons by bandits in Danko-Wasagu Local Government Area of the state on Thursday.\n\nResidents said a vehicle attached to the governor\u2019s convoy was burnt by the protesters after shots fired by security agents to disperse the crowd hit two persons. The two men were said to be receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital in the state, Premium Times reported.\n\nMr Bagudu was in the council area on Saturday to condole with the people over the killings. However, some residents burnt used tyres on the streets, booed the governor and attacked his convoy over his alleged poor handling of security challenges in the areas.\n\nThe Emir of Zuru, Muhammadu Sani-Sami, who confirmed the incident in an interview with BBC Hausa Service, said the governor was in the area to sympathise with the residents, following the bandits\u2019 attack, when the incident happened.\n\nThe governor usually visits and sympathise with residents whenever such things happened and promised to bring an end to such attacks but they keep on reoccurring, the emir said.\n\n\u201cBut the youth this time came out en masse and showed their grievances, maybe because they did not see any change, despite the repeated promise to stop the attacks,\u201d the traditional ruler said.\n\nMr Sani-Sami, however, said the governments was doing its best to forestall the attacks but noted that security agents in the area do not have the numbers to stop the bandits.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday when he paid a condolence visit to the affected communities, the governor regretted the nefarious acts of banditry in the area.\n\n\u201cIt is really unfortunate that these obnoxious and deadly attacks occurred after the area had been quiet and peaceful.\n\n\u201cWe should not allow this vicious cycle to continue, as such, all hands must be on deck to provide plausible solutions to the problem,\u201d Mr Sarki quoted his governor saying in the statement.\n\nThe governor also admonished the people to regard the tragic incident as an act of the Almighty Allah and urged the residents to pray for God\u2019s intervention.\n\nThe governor also urged vigilante groups in the area to collaborate with the security agencies, traditional rulers and the various communities, to ensure the success of their activities.\n\nIn his remark, the village head of Gaya, one of the attacked communities, Ahmad Ubandoma, narrated how the attacks happened and urged the governor to facilitate the deployment of more security personnel in the area.\n\nDanko-Wasagu, like Sakaba LGA where bandits killed nine police officers in April, shares boundary with Zamfara and Niger states.\n\nAt least 88 people were killed by bandits in attacks on some communities in Danko-Wasagu Local Government Area.\n\nSome of the affected communities are Koro, Kimpi, Gaya, Dimi, Zutu, Rafin Gora and Iguenge, all of which are described as difficult to access from Kebbi State.\n\nThe governor, following the incidents, urged residents to be optimistic about the security situation in their area. He said passing blame will not solve the problems and pledged to take more pungent measures against the bandits.\n\n\u201cWe should note that passing blame will not solve the problem. What is required (is) mutual trust and respect for all,\u201d the governor\u2019s spokesperson, Yahaya Sarki, said in a statement.\n\nMr Sarki was, however, silent on the violent protest in the affected areas.\n\nCredit: Premium Times",

Is it the owners of Twitter that are posting such tweets? Is it foreigners using the platform for such activities? Or is it all Nigerians who are on Twitter or some of those Nigerians who use Twitter? The Government needs to be specific on this\u201d, he said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf some Nigerians on Twitter are using it in a manner that displeases the Government, how is banning Twitter for all Nigerians, in contravention of international norms an appropriate response? And if the government is convinced that people should not be allowed to post whatever they like on Twitter, no matter how divisive, hateful or inciting, why was the Government itself so angry when Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari, which it adjudged to be in violation of this same principle?\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Arogundade said: \u201cOn the surface the government claims it is fighting Twitter but in reality what it is doing is waging war against its own citizens by infringing on their fundamental and socio-economic rights despite their being constitutionally guaranteed. If anything, the threat by the Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), to prosecute anyone that disobeys the ban is indicative of the fact that if this government has its way all social media platforms would be shut down because they have become veritable avenues for citizens to express their disaffection with its acts of mis-governance\u201d.\n\nHe added that, \u201cthe ban does not show that the government is serious about the welfare or economic well-being of the citizens otherwise it would have given due consideration to how the decision would disrupt businesses that are transacted by many individuals and corporate bodies on Twitter and affect investor confidence in the Nigerian economy before rushing to make the announcement.\u201d",

It is about TB Joshua. During the time I was in prison, first and the second arrests was traumatic for me. I understood that lots of pastors were mobilised to speak to their fellow man of God, Ibiyeomie.\n\n\u2018\u2019Four years ago, June 5th 2017 I was released from Port Harcourt prison, that was after my first arrest.\n\n\u2018\u2019I was arrested three times and accused of defaming David Ibiyeomie.\n\n\u2018\u2019At the end of it you can see clearly, I was released from prison. I had meetings with him (Ibiyeomie) and testified in his church and everybody knows I did not write anything about Ibiyeomie. I simply receive an AP letter a fake one and was trying to verify it that was when the Police arrested me,\u2019\u2019 Olunloyo said.\n\nShe said during her detention in prison, she suffered a lot of losses, and her business, Aging African media platform was lost.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI became sick with PTS, with other things, and still have a PTS 50 per cent recovery till today.\n\n\u201cWhen my mother went to church, some people made fun of her, saying \u2018your child is in prison\u2019 and a lot of that.\n\n\u2018\u2019I know what is going on and went to the Catholic church at the University of Ibadan, one of the fathers there made an initiative to help speak with Ibiyeomie. It was TB Joshua that made that move to find out what did this woman do and what happened?\n\n\u2018\u2019I was told by my mother that TB Joshua called Pastor Ibiyeomie, I don\u2019t know whether they have called and met TB Joshua, I never met him before, I just watched his crusade on television, and when I finally talked with T.B Joshua he told me \u2018don\u2019t worry about it, that I don\u2019t need to announce it\u2019. So, today is a great day to announce it.

          "text": "By Tom Okpe\n\n(APC-LAC) has stated that with more roads and rail lines being built, completed in the country, the All Progressives Congress, (APC) is building infratsructure that will drive Nigerias\u2019 growth and prosperity.\n\nThe group in a statement in Abuja on Monday, through its coordinators, Barr Ismail Ahmed and Lanre Issa-Onilu said since 2015 that President Muhammadu Buhari assumed office as President, more physical infrastructure has been seen commpleted, than in the sixteen years between 1999 and 2015.\n\n\u201cFrom the start, President Buhari promised to complete as many abandoned projects as possible, and he has worked hard to fulfil this promise.\n\n\u201cHis administration has committed more resources to Infrastructure than any other administration since 1999. It is no coincidence that the last time Nigeria saw an infrastructure revolution on this scale was during the period, in the late 1990s, when the President ran the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF).\u201d\n\nBeyond the focus on completing inherited and abandoned projects, the Buhari administration has creatively unlocked public and private sector financing for infrastructure in Nigeria, through such initiatives as the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF), the Infrastructure Company (InfraCo), the Highway Development Management Initiative (HDMI), the Sovereign Sukuk Bonds (that have collectively raised close to a billion dollars), and the Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme.\n\nREAD ALSO: BREAKING: Pastor Adeboye Decries Twitter Ban, Says Action Covered Against Universal Declaration On Human Rights\n\n\u201cThese initiatives cover thousands of kilometres of critical roads and will mobilize several billions of dollars in public and private financing.\n\n\u201cThis week, the President will commission the 156km Lagos-Ibadan Standard Gauge Rail, the first double-track Standard Gauge Rail project in West Africa (and the first Standard Gauge Rail project in Nigeria to be started and completed by the same administration).\n\n\u201cThis landmark commissioning is taking place nine months after the President commissioned the 327km Itakpe-Warri Standard Gauge Rail, completed by his administration 33 years after construction began.\n\n\u201cThe 168km Abuja-Kaduna Rail project, and the 42.5km Abuja Light Rail project, both inherited from previous administrations, were completed in 2016 and 2018 respectively.\n\nThe second Niger Bridge, originally conceived decades ago, is now more than 50 percent completed, and scheduled for commissioning in 2022, as is the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, which has defied every administration since 1999.\u201d\n\nThe group indicated that other landmark projects being completed include the Bodo-Bonny Road in Rivers State, Apapa-Oshodi-Oworonshoki Expressway, Loko-Oweto Bridge connecting Benue and Nasarawa States across the River Benue, Port Harcourt-Enugu Expressway, East-West Road (across Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa-Ibom and Cross River States), the new Ikom Bridge in Cross River, Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Expressway, Keffi-Akwanga-Lafia-Makurdi Road, and many more.\n\n\u201cNew International Airport Terminals have also, been completed and commissioned in Abuja and Port Harcourt, while those in Lagos and Kano are being completed.\n\n\u201cIn addition, brand new Runways have been constructed in Abuja and Enugu, in 2017 and 2020 respectively.\n\n\u201cOff-grid solar and gas electrification programmes are being rolled out for homes, markets, educational institutions (Federal Universities, Unity Schools, Primary Healthcare Centers); and a National Mass Metering Programme launched in 2020 will deliver 6 million new electricity meters nationwide.\u201d\n\nThe statement further stated that the administration is also enabling and supporting private sector to invest in critical infrastructure.\n\n\u201cA brand new Deep Sea Port is being constructed, in Lagos, the first new Deep Sea Port in the country in more than four decades; while ground-breaking for a second private-sector-funded Deep Sea Port (in Bonny) took place in March 2021.\n\n\u201cWith a diverse mix of financing options in place, the Buhari Administration has broken Nigeria\u2019s decades-old infrastructure development jinx and set new standards for future administrations to build upon,\u201d the group emphasised.",

          "text": "By Abankula\n\nThe Northern Elders Forum spoke today on the agitations for secession by Igbo people and advised the authorities not to stand on their way.\n\n\u201cThe Forum has arrived at the difficult conclusion that if support for secession among the Igbo is as widespread as it is being made to look, and Igbo leadership appears to be in support of it, then the country should be advised not stand in its way\u201d, said the Forum in a statement signed by Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, its publicity secretary.\n\nBut the Forum also warned Igbo it will not be their best choice to leave a country \u201cwe have all toiled to build and a country we all have responsibility to fix\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt will not help a country already burdened with failures on its knees to fight another war to keep the Igbo in Nigeria\u201d, the statement added.\n\nThe Northern Elders Forum also noted the weakening of political and coercive authority in the country, such that the Buhari administration \u201cappears to have lost the capacity to halt the gradual descent of the country into anarchy\u201d.\n\nRead the Full statement\n\nNorthern Elders Forum has reviewed of events and tendencies which suggest that the country is headed for more crises. Nigerians live in fear of violence today, and in fear of uncertain future. The capacity of the Nigerian State to secure citizens, protect the country\u2019s territorial integrity and resist violent assaults on our unity is weakening to the levels of making threats that have no impact. Armed criminals of all types have increased their audacious stranglehold over our lives in all parts of the country. Irredentists are increasingly asserting their influence over in the South East and some part of the country, and in the manner that millions of Nigerians now live. Rhetorics from political leaders and ethnic champions who speak in threats and demands routinely suggest that the sentiments in support of irredentism are becoming more widespread.\n\nAll Nigerians are paying the price of failure of two sets of leaders. At the national level, the administration appears to have lost the capacity to halt the gradual descent of the country into anarchy. Political leaders in the South East appear to have submitted to violence and terror of IPOB and ESN. Muted voices of millions of Igbo cannot be heard so that fellow Nigerians could understand the degree to which secession by the Igbo represents the popular choice.\n\nAll Nigerians are paying the price of failure of two sets of leaders. At the national level, the administration appears to have lost the capacity to halt the gradual descent of the country into anarchy. Political leaders in the South East appear to have submitted to violence and terror of IPOB and ESN.\n\nThis nation has had to fight a terrible war to preserve the country. The North had paid its dues in that war, as indeed it did in many ways throughout the history of the country. Under our current circumstances, no Nigerian should welcome another war to keep the country together. The North in particular has more than enough challenges, and we recognize that violent secession by any part of Nigeria will compound the problems all Nigerians live with.\n\nThe Forum has arrived at the difficult conclusion that if support for secession among the Igbo is as widespread as it is being made to look, and Igbo leadership appears to be in support of it, then the country should be advised not stand in its way. It will not be the best choice for the Igbo or Nigerians to leave a country we have all toiled to build and a country we all have responsibility to fix, but it will not help a country already burdened with failures on its knees to fight another war to keep the Igbo in Nigeria.\n\nThe Forum insists that attacks and killings of Northerners and Federal Government employees and destruction of National assets must stop. Those who have been involved in it must be arrested and prosecuted. Until the Igbo decide whether it wants to secede or remain part of Nigeria, the law applies to it, and Federal and State Governors who have responsibility to enforce the law and protect citizens must enforce it. We support calls for Northerners who are exposed to harassment and violence to consider relocating to the North.\n\nUnlike the postures and complacency of the leaders of the South East, we advise that all Igbo and other ethnic groups from the South residing in the North should be accorded the usual hospitality and security.\n\nThe Forum believes that it is vital to address amendments to the constitution and achieve major changes in the structure and operations of our Federal system now. Members of the National Assembly elected by Nigerians have lost touch with the people they are supposed to represent. This explains the major distances which exist between the people and the vital national institution which should play a major role mitigating national crises. The National Assembly should explore additional avenues for tapping into opinions that can help redress serious limitations to the Federal system before the 2023 elections. The North is willing to discuss all matters related to constitutional amendments/ restructuring with the leadership of the country and other groups who see their presence in the future of Nigeria.\n\nDr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed\n\nDirector, Publicity and Advocacy,\n\nNorthern Elders Forum,\n\nAbuja.",

          "title": "Who offended Buhari? Twitter or Nigerians?",
          "text": "By Fredrick Nwabufo\n\nGovernment is a relationship \u2013 between the leadership and the governed. A democratic government, in particular, should not operate in vacancy of citizens\u2019 imprimatur. A government needs the trust, support and goodwill of its citizens. Legitimacy is the reward for good governance. Any government, which by intransigence severs the funiculus that links it with the citizens, is taking the highroad to oblivion.\n\nReally, most people will not remember the infrastructure and extraordinary projects executed by an administration. But they will remember how secure they felt and the freedom they enjoyed under that government. General Abacha is reputed to have executed some of the sterling infrastructure projects in Nigeria. In fact, some of the roads his regime through PTF built are still sturdy to date. But how is he remembered today? He is remembered as a murderer and a violator of human rights.\n\nOur leaders should learn from the ruins of others before them. Power is situational. What we do with it when we possess it will live with us, and even with our relics and generations to come. At this point, what I believe should be elemental for President Buhari is his legacy. He should not let \u2018\u2019power hawks\u2019\u2019 carnivorise what is left of his substance.\n\nThe suspension of Twitter by the Nigerian government is a jackboot experiment. It cannot be defended, rationalised or excused in anyway. Internet freedom is as basic as the right to life and the right to freedom of expression.\n\nNaturally, some notable Nigerians and organisations have condemned this insidious attempt at absolutism. The Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN) led by Kabiru Yusuf said lucidly \u2018\u2019the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operation by Nigeria is wrong and an overreaction\u2019\u2019. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos state, and member of the APC \u2013 the president\u2019s party \u2013 is of the opinion that the federal government should have managed the situation better.\n\n\u201cThe federal government can handle this a lot better \u2014 because of the number of ecommerce; the number of youths doing digital stuff on the internet, and we cannot throw that away and say it\u2019s not happening. I believe there could be a lot of restraint and better management from both sides,\u201d the governor said.\n\nNigeria is said to lose N2.18 billion per day owing to the Twitter shutdown \u2014 according to NetBlocks, a data-driven online service. We do not need an Okonjo-Iweala to divine for us the cost of this folly. Many youths and businesses rely on Twitter for oxygen. And the federal government just pulled the plug \u2014 in a country with 40 million unemployed people, blistering inflation and insecurity.\n\nToiling Nigerians lose more in this dogfight between the Nigerian government and Twitter. Twitter loses nothing in the short and in the long run. So, who offended Buhari and who should be writhing from the economic perils of his ban? Well, if the government is deploying this as a gambit to asphyxiate dissenting voices on social media it will be a futile performance. Only good governance can silence the noise on social media.\n\nCitizens from all strata have been giving the government a dressing down in the past few days. As expected, the US, the UK, Canada and EU did not equivocate in expressing disappointment at this punitive approach to an issue that could have been resolved through other channels. The condemnations are in order.\n\nWhat is very annoying is the threat by Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation, to arrest and prosecute anyone circumventing the ban to gain access to Twitter. This is farcical. Why is this man making a spectacle of Nigeria in the public square? I think we have enough comedians in the country already.\n\nHowever, there is the pesky issue of hate speech, fake news, misinformation and disinformation on social media \u2014 particularly on Twitter and Facebook? How do we address this problem? We cannot look away and pretend that this creeping monster does not portend enormous danger for Nigeria.\n\nSome countries like India, even the US and the UK, have set these tech leviathans to task regarding sanitising their social media space. We cannot suspend our hands and watch Nigeria burn.\n\nAs Kadaria Ahmed, top journalist, said while reacting to the \u2018\u2019decree\u2019\u2019 of the National Broadcasting Commission to broadcast stations to deactivate their Twitter accounts, \u2018\u2019the government (must) go back and engage with experts many of whom abound in the country on how to fight hate speech, misinformation and disinformation while respecting and upholding the rights that are fundamental in a democracy\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe Buhari government must redeem itself. Nigeria is still a democracy.\n\n*Fredrick \u2018Mr OneNigeria\u2019 Nwabufo is on Twitter @FredrickNwabufo\n\n#Keepiton",

          "text": "\n\nThe Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has said that the Igbo can secede from Nigeria if only it will prevent the breakout of another civil war in the country.\n\nAddressing selected journalists in Abuja Monday at the end of its meeting, NEF\u2019s Director, Publicity and Advocacy, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, said that South East political leaders are even afraid of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN) and hence cannot curb insecurity in the region.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cNorthern Elders Forum has reviewed of events and tendencies, which suggest that the country is headed for more crises. Nigerians live in fear of violence today and in fear of uncertain future. The capacity of the Nigerian State to secure citizens, protect the country\u2019s territorial integrity and resist violent assaults on our unity is weakening to the levels of making threats that have no impact.\n\n\u201cArmed criminals of all types have increased their audacious stranglehold over our lives in all parts of the country. Irredentists are increasingly asserting their influence over in the South East and some part of the country, and in the manner that millions of Nigerians now live. Rhetorics from political leaders and ethnic champions who speak in threats and demands routinely suggest that the sentiments in support of irredentism are becoming more widespread.\n\n\u201cAll Nigerians are paying the price of failure of two sets of leaders. At the national level, the administration appears to have lost the capacity to halt the gradual descent of the country into anarchy. Political leaders in the South East appear to have submitted to violence and terror of IPOB and ESN. Muted voices of millions of Igbo cannot be heard so that fellow Nigerians could understand the degree to which secession by the Igbo represents the popular choice.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis nation has had to fight a terrible war to preserve the country. The North had paid its dues in that war, as indeed it did in many ways throughout the history of the country. Under our current circumstances, no Nigerian should welcome another war to keep the country together. The North in particular has more than enough challenges, and we recognize that violent secession by any part of Nigeria will compound the problems all Nigerians live with.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cThe Forum has arrived at the difficult conclusion that if support for secession among the Igbo is as widespread as it is being made to look, and Igbo leadership appears to be in support of it, then the country should be advised not stand in its way. It will not be the best choice for the Igbo or Nigerians to leave a country we have all toiled to build and a country we all have responsibility to fix, but it will not help a country already burdened with failures on its knees to fight another war to keep the Igbo in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Forum insists that attacks and killings of Northerners and Federal Government employees and destruction of National assets must stop. Those who have been involved in it must be arrested and prosecuted. Until the Igbo decide whether it wants to secede or remain part of Nigeria, the law applies to it, and Federal and State Governors who have responsibility to enforce the law and protect citizens must enforce it.\n\n\u201cWe support calls for Northerners who are exposed to harassment and violence to consider relocating to the North. Unlike the postures and complacency of the leaders of the South East, we advise that all Igbo and other ethnic groups from the South residing in the North should be accorded the usual hospitality and security.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Forum believes that it is vital to address amendments to the constitution and achieve major changes in the structure and operations of our Federal system now. Members of the National Assembly elected by Nigerians have lost touch with the people they are supposed to represent. This explains the major distances which exist between the people and the vital national institution which should play a major role mitigating national crises.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly should explore additional avenues for tapping into opinions that can help redress serious limitations to the Federal system before the 2023 elections. The North is willing to discuss all matters related to constitutional amendments/ restructuring with the leadership of the country and other groups who see their presence in the future of Nigeria.\u201d",

The legacy I left when I was the leader of the main market supersede any influence APGA has in Anambra state.\n\nWhen asked what he would do differently if given opportunity, the governorship aspirant said: \u201cI am a catalyst throughout my life. I have always brought change to whatever I do. My records shows that every field of human endeavors I have always engaged myself I have brought changes not only inNigeria but across the world.\u201d\n\nOn how he will use agriculture and other initiatives to solve the problem of insecurityin the state, Nwankwo said: \u201cCan I be honest with you. There have been absolute peace in Anambra state. Until a good leader gets to power. There will be a drastic change towards that agitation. If you read my manifesto, I am going to single Anambra out to become the industrial hub of Africa. And, millions of teaming youths will not have time to demonstrate when they are employed.\n\n\u201cI have done businesses in 7 countries of the world. I have been to Israel about three times, I have been to Ethiopia with outstanding agricultural records. We are going to employ the best brains. In all my companies, I have always partner with the best companies in the world. Why people failed in agriculture is because they dont look for those with the pedigree. People with the records and experience to manage their entities. And that is why they failed.\u201d",

Lukman, the Director-General of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF) which will take place Friday, June I l , 2021.\n\nIn a statement issued by Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu on behalf of the Organising Committee, the book is a contribution to APC\u2019s quest to bolster its democratic credentials towards engendering political stability, best practice, and good governance in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Onilu, the book captures the distinctive progressive ethos and political worldview of APC as a bastion for national renaissance exemplified by patriotism and adherence to the rules of political engagements, and moral rectitude.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere is no better time to put this book together as APC grapples with the nitty-gritty of formative challenges. This is coming at a period when APC leaders availed members of the Nigerian progressive family the opportunity to relaunch the party more surefootedly as Nigeria\u2019s best vehicle to save Nigeria from the nagging socio-political uncertainties.\n\n\u201cThe book contains submissions that speak directly to the existential challenges the APC is facing; it illustrates the collective desire for enduring and firmly rooted democratic practices anchored on the overarching requirement for unity of all party leaders; it examines the hurdles that the APC is facing in its nascent democratic journey and cut open the underbelly of the numerous drawbacks in the leadership that it currently offer the nation through the political instruments it is deploying as a party.\n\n\u201cThis book is an essential intervention at this critical turn as APC leaders and members embark on the important task of putting in place new leadership structures at all levels and in underlying what the future bodes for the party in terms of laying a solid foundation for healthy contestations among varying interests and political players.\n\n\u201cAPC\u2019s Litmus Tests is therefore, more than just a book. It is more of a workbook, standing at the intersection between the difficult past and the promising future. Its main agenda is to assist APC leaders and, indeed, all stakeholders in negotiating the next bend.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR will be the Special Guest of Honour. The Vice President Prof. Yemi Osibanjo GCON will be the Chief Guest of Honour and Chairman of occasion.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency, Mai Mala Buni, APC Chairman, will be the host.

Her Excellency, Ambassador Fatima Balla will be the Mother of the day. Prof. Adebayo O. Olukoshi, Professor of Politics and Director for Africa and Asia will present the Keynote Address.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari is expected to commission the 156km Lagos-Ibadan Standard Gauge Rail later this week, an APC support group has stated.\n\nAccording to the group, the rail line is the first double-track Standard Gauge Rail project in West Africa, and the first Standard Gauge Rail project in Nigeria to be started and completed by the same administration.\n\nThe group, under the auspices of APC Legacy Awareness & Campaign, APC-LAC, emphasized that this landmark commissioning is taking place nine months after the president commissioned the 327km Itakpe-Warri Standard Gauge Rail , completed by his administration 33 years after construction began, adding that the 168km Abuja-Kaduna Rail project, and the 42.5km Abuja Light Rail project, both inherited from previous administrations, were completed in 2016 and 2018 respectively.\n\nIn a statement jointly signed by four notable APC chieftains, Barr. Ismail Ahmed, Mr. Lanre Issa-Onilu, Mr. Tolu Ogunlesi and Mr. Salihu Moh. Lukman, the support group maintained that the second Niger Bridge, originally conceived decades ago, is now more than 50 percent completed, and scheduled for commissioning in 2022, as is the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, which has defied every administration since 1999.\n\nAPC-LAC further stated that other landmark projects being completed include the Bodo-Bonny Road in Rivers State, Apapa-Oshodi-Oworonshoki Expressway, Loko-Oweto Bridge connecting Benue and Nasarawa States across the River Benue, Port Harcourt-Enugu Expressway, East-West Road (across Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa-Ibom and Cross River States), the new Ikom Bridge in Cross River, Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Expressway, Keffi-Akwanga-Lafia-Makurdi Road, and many more.\n\nThe group emphasized that President Buhari remained committed to building the infrastructure that will drive Nigeria\u2019s growth and prosperity.\n\nThey maintained that more road and rail infrastructures are being built and/or completed since President Buhari assumed office in 2015, than in the sixteen years between 1999 and 2015.\n\nThey also boasted that President Buhari has fulfilled his promised on delivery of good infrastructure for the opening up of the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cFrom the start, President Buhari promised to complete as many abandoned projects as possible, and he has worked hard to fulfil this promise. His administration has committed more resources to Infrastructure than any other administration since 1999. It is no coincidence that the last time Nigeria saw an infrastructure revolution on this scale was during the period, in the late 1990s, when the President ran the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF).\n\n\u201cBeyond the focus on completing inherited and abandoned projects, the Buhari Administration has creatively unlocked public and private sector financing for infrastructure in Nigeria, through such initiatives as the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF), the Infrastructure Company (InfraCo), the Highway Development Management Initiative (HDMI), the Sovereign Sukuk Bonds (that have collectively raised close to a billion dollars), and the Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme. Between them these initiatives cover thousands of kilometres of critical roads and will mobilize several billions of dollars in public and private financing.\n\n\u201cNew International Airport Terminals have been completed and commissioned in Abuja and Port Harcourt, while those in Lagos and Kano are being completed. In addition, brand new Runways have been constructed in Abuja and Enugu, in 2017 and 2020 respectively.\n\n\u201cOff-grid solar and gas electrification programmes are being rolled out for homes, markets, educational institutions (Federal Universities, Unity Schools, Primary Healthcare Centers); and a National Mass Metering Programme launched in 2020 will deliver 6 million new electricity meters nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe Administration is also enabling and supporting the private sector to invest in critical infrastructure. Finally, a brand new Deep Sea Port is being constructed, in Lagos, the first new Deep Sea Port in the country in more than four decades; while ground-breaking for a second private-sector-funded Deep Sea Port (in Bonny) took place in March 2021.\n\n\u201cWith a diverse mix of financing options in place, the Buhari Administration has broken Nigeria\u2019s decades-old infrastructure development jinx and set new standards for future administrations to build upon,\u201d the group stated.",

Those who have been involved in it must be arrested and prosecuted,\u201d the Forum noted.\n\n\u201cUntil the Igbo decide whether it wants to secede or remain part of Nigeria, the law applies to it, and Federal and State Governors who have a responsibility to enforce the law and protect citizens must enforce it. We support calls for Northerners who are exposed to harassment and violence to consider relocating to the North.\n\n\u201cUnlike the postures and complacency of the leaders of the South East, we advise that all Igbo and other ethnic groups from the South residing in the North should be accorded the usual hospitality and security.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

          "text": "Nigeria and Cameroon will once more battle it out at the Stadion Wiener Neustadt in the second of a two-match friendly programme in the Austrian capital, Vienna.\n\nFive \u2013time African champions Cameroon edged the first encounter 1-0 at the same venue on Friday, courtesy of a 36th minute strike by Andre Zambo Nguissa. The Super Eagles created chance after chance but failed to get the ball into the net.\n\nCoach Gernot Rohr spoke at length about having to use a rash of new players in the first session, but he is compelled to do even more of that in Tuesday\u2019s encounter following injuries to defenders William Ekong and Jamilu Collins, and the knock for pacy winger Moses Simon.\n\nSimon appeared to be getting better as of Monday morning, but the smart money is on him starting from the bench, just as Cyprus-based goalkeeper Francis Uzoho may start in goal against the Indomitable Lions. With the versatile Abdullahi Shehu heaved back to the rear from midfield for which he was initially pencilled down, and the couple of injuries from Friday\u2019s match, Rohr has had to extend invitation to Hungary \u2013based Vincent Onovo to fight for his first cap. Onovo arrived in the team hotel just after dinner on Sunday.\n\nA three-man defenceline is in the offing, with perhaps Chidozie Awaziem, who impressed in that unit on Friday, Abdullahi and Ozornwafor. Another late invitee, Anthony Izuchukwu, from Slovakia, is another possibility. A loaded midfield could include Onovo, with Wilfred Ndidi, Oghenekaro Etebo, Samson Tijani and Abraham Marcus also on the roll.\n\nHome \u2013based professional Anayo Iwuala could start, with Paul Onuachu, Peter Olayinka, Kelechi Iheanacho, Alex Iwobi, Moses Simon, Terem Moffi and Captain Ahmed Musa also to taste action.\n\nAfter Friday\u2019s game, Rohr told the media: \u201cWe missed seven key players due to injuries, so it was not our best team, but it was good to see other players. We are not happy to lose the game, but we saw some interesting new young players.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s defeat was Rohr\u2019s first loss to Cameroon in four matches. The Eagles pounded the Lions 4-0 in Uyo and were held 1-1 in Yaounde in 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches in September 2017, and then edged the Lions 3-2 in the Round of 16 at the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt two years ago.\n\nThough a friendly game, fierce rivals Cameroon were very happy to prevail over Nigeria for the first time since winning the Africa Cup of Nations final on penalty shoot-out in Lagos 21 years ago. \u201cWe took the game seriously because we played against a tough opponent, a big game against a big rival. It was important for us to show our preparations, and I\u2019m happy we won,\u201d said Cameroon\u2019s Germany-based striker Eric Choupo-Moting.\n\nA sense of purpose to win the second game reigns supreme in the Eagles\u2019 Hilton Garden Inn camp in Wiener Neustadt, 46 kilometres outside Vienna.\n\nAfter a one-hour training session in the light drizzle on Sunday morning, the three-time African champions will have their last training session at the match venue on Monday evening. Captain Ahmed Musa says defeat in Tuesday\u2019s game is not an option.\n\n\u201cWe are not happy to have created so many chances and fail to score. We will approach the game differently on Tuesday. Cameroon is a big rival and we are not happy to have lost the game on Friday.\u201d\n\nGoalkeeper Maduka Okoye told thenff.com: \u201cWe bave taken some positives from the first match against Cameroon. We had a good game and it was unfortunate that they scored with just that one shot on target. However, we have shown that we are ready for the AFCON with the strength of character we showed after conceding the goal. We are ready to go for it on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nNew-boy Abraham Marcus said it was a dream come true for him to join up with the Nigeria camp. \u201cWhen the coach introduced me into the game, all I had in mind was to help the team get the equalizer. I look forward to another opportunity on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nBoth teams have qualified for the finals of the 33rd Africa Cup of Nations, which Cameroon will host in January 2022. Nigeria finished top of their group winning four of six matches and drawing two, while Cameroon also topped theirs though they had already qualified as hosts.\n\nThe two teams are using both matches to look at their general shape, form and structure ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches starting in September.",
