          "text": "Britain\u2019s Karim Khan was sworn on Wednesday as the new prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, facing huge challenges, including investigations into the Palestinian territories, Afghanistan and the Philippines.\n\nKhan, 51, a former defence lawyer for the Hague-based tribunal, was elected by ICC member states in February to serve a nine-year tenure at the world\u2019s only permanent war crimes court.\n\nHe has been left with a bulging case file by his predecessor Fatou Bensouda, who extended the ICC\u2019s reach so dramatically that she was hit by US sanctions but also suffered a series of high-profile failures.\n\n\u201cThe ICC is in a crucial phase, it has faced criticism for not being as effective as states have wished,\u201d Carsten Stahn, an international criminal law professor at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, told AFP.\n\nBut Stahn said Khan could bring \u201cnew momentum\u201d and had a \u201cwindow of opportunity to amend the functioning\u201d of the court, which has also been criticised for the high salaries of its judges and its slow moving processes.\n\nKhan took a public oath of office in a ceremony at the ICC, making him just the court\u2019s third prosecutor since it was founded in 2002 to try people for the world\u2019s worst crimes.\n\n\u201cI solemnly undertake that I will perform my duties and exercise my powers as Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court honourably, faithfully, impartially and conscientiously,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Face of adversity\u2019 \u2013\n\nKhan previously led a special UN probe into crimes by the Islamic State extremist group and, more controversially, also represented late Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi\u2019s son Seif al-Islam at the ICC.\n\nBensouda has left him with a full in-tray, including a probe into the Philippines war on drugs that she announced on Monday, an investigation into alleged US war crimes in Afghanistan, and the Israel-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe ICC\u2019s investigation into the 2014 Israel-Palestinian conflict in Gaza promises to be the most contentious in the court\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cIt is a very politically charged issue,\u201d said Stahn.\n\nIn her farewell statement, Bensouda said that she had \u201cmade my decisions, with careful deliberation \u2014 but without fear or favour. Even in the face of adversity. Even at considerable personal cost\u201d.\n\nBensouda said she had intended to ask for a formal investigation into crimes by government forces in Venezuela, but was prevented at the last minute after Caracas asked judges to take control of the case. Their decision is awaited.\n\nShe had also aimed to open probes into Ukraine and Nigeria but was leaving those to Khan to complete, she said.\n\nThe British lawyer will meanwhile have to contend with the outright opposition of key countries that have refused to join the ICC, including the United States, Israel, China and Russia.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Under pressure\u2019 \u2013\n\nAmnesty International said Khan\u2019s appointment was a chance for \u201crevitalisation\u201d of the ICC, but that he would face challenges in the job.\n\n\u201cHe will be under pressure and we hope he will proceed as Fatou Bensouda in independence and without fear or favour,\u201d Matthew Cannock, head of Amnesty\u2019s Center for International Justice, told AFP.\n\nKhan may, however, benefit from a new and less confrontational US administration, compared to the government of former president Donald Trump which imposed sanctions on Bensouda.\n\nBensouda had a mixed record in her tenure since 2012 even as she expanded \u2014 some analysts say overextended \u2014 the court\u2019s reach.\n\nUnder her leadership, former Ivory Coast president Laurent Gbagbo was cleared of crimes against humanity, while former DR Congo vice-president Jean-Pierre Bemba was acquitted on appeal, and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta had charges against him dropped.\n\nBut Bensouda has recently secured high-profile convictions against Ugandan child soldier-turned-Lord\u2019s Resistance Army commander Dominic Ongwen and Congolese warlord Bosco \u201cTerminator\u201d Ntaganda.\n\nShe has also been credited with improving the prosecutor\u2019s office compared with her predecessor Luis Moreno-Ocampo, whose leadership was described as \u201cautocratic\u201d in a probe ordered by the ICC into the Kenyatta case.\n\n\u201cFatou\u2019s legacy will be viewed positively. She took very courageous decisions,\u201d said Amnesty\u2019s Cannock.\n\n(AFP)",

          "text": "By Moses Emorinken, Abuja\n\nThe Association of Public Health Physicians of Nigeria (APHPN) has urged the federal government to leverage on the opportunity created by the COVID-19 pandemic to create more resilient and transformative health systems.\n\nIt noted that COVID-19 did not only negatively impact the health of Nigerians, but exposed the already fragile and weak health systems in the country.\n\nIt further stated that there is an urgent need to ramp up efforts with regards to local capacities to produce vaccines, especially the COVID-19 vaccine, as the country can no longer rely on external sources.\n\nSpeaking during the 37th Annual General Meeting and Scientific Conference of the APHPN on Tuesday in Abuja, the Chairman of the occasion and Chief Executive Officer of APIN Public Health Initiatives, Dr Prosper Okonkwo, said: \u201cThe pandemic has exposed the true state of our health systems. Apart from impacting the health of citizens, the robust health system has been fully stretched and the ones that are fragile are on the brink of further collapse.\n\n\u201cHowever, it provides an opportunity for us to begin to build more transformative health systems that are well-positioned to face future emergencies.\n\n\u201cWe see that routine immunization for example has been affected. Also, some maternal health indicators have been affected. You see that we are not only talking about Covid-19 alone. So this is an opportunity for us to begin to put things together.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cParticularly from governance and leadership, equity considerations must be given a right of place. We have the opportunity to build resilient systems that can stand the shock of such epidemics when they come again.\n\n\u201cThere must be efforts at improving infrastructures like laboratories, particularly PCR laboratories, oxygen plants, and all the commodity logistics issues. In fact, we need to begin to consider vaccine production. We must consider all these even as the pandemic progresses.\n\n\u201cIn this era of vaccine nationalism and diplomacy, Nigeria thought we had a source from India and India said they have to sort themselves out first. These are lessons we should learn in the way we do business going forward.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the National Chairman of APHPN, Prof. Benjamin Uzochukwu, said: \u201cThis year\u2019s theme \u2013 Strategies for resilience and recovery from public health emergencies \u2013 is apt given the global novel coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 and other emergencies.\n\n\u201cThese emergencies have a significant impact on health through changes to political, environmental and other conditions which may influence determinants of health.\n\n\u201cBeyond their direct impact on health, emergencies also increase the population\u2019s susceptibility to diseases and poor health through their impact on health systems.

          "title": "UPDATED: INEC unveils new Polling Units, fixes dates for Ekiti, Osun guber polls",
          "text": "By Okodili Ndidi, Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Wednesday, announced the successful expansion of the existing Polling Units across the country from 119,974 to 176,846 full-fledged Polling Units.\n\nConsequently, 749 Polling Units were relocated from inappropriate locations to appropriate public facilities or open spaces in line with \u201cour policy to guarantee unencumbered access to Polling Units for all voters.\u201d\n\nOut of this figure, \u201c232 were removed from private properties, 145 royal palaces, 6 Mosques, 21 Churches and 9 Shrines.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the expansion, the Commission disclosed that, \u201cfor subsequent elections, beginning from the Anambra State Governorship election holding on 6th November 2021, there will be no Voting Points any more in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Commission also announced the dates for the Ekiti and Osun States governorship elections.\n\nThe two off-season elections are slated to hold on Saturday June 18, 2022 for Ekiti State, while the Osun State Governorship election will hold one month later on Saturday 16th July 2022\n\nIn his remarks at the unveiling ceremony, INEC Commissioner, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, said; \u201cthe history of creating and expanding Polling Units in Nigeria has been long and complex. Their adequacy and accessibility in terms of number and location across the country were some of the challenges that had to be addressed in the interest of credible elections.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to him, \u201cbefore 2010, the Commission operated on a round figure of approximately 120,000 Polling Units. However, a census undertaken by the Commission before the 2011 General Election arrived at the precise figure of 119,973 Polling Units. The Commission also made efforts to relocate many Polling Units from inappropriate places such as private residences and properties, palaces of traditional rulers and places of worship to public buildings accessible to voters, polling agents, observers and the media during elections.\u201d\n\nHe continued that, \u201cfollowing several unsuccessful attempts to create additional Polling Units despite the obvious pressure from increased number of registered voters, the Commission established Voting Points and Voting Point Settlements across the States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) as a pragmatic response to necessity. The voting points were tied to the existing Polling Units and Voting Point Settlements.\n\n\u201cThe number of registered voters in a Polling Unit and the Voting Point Settlement in the FCT was used to determine their Voting Points, based on the upper and lower thresholds of 500 and 750 voters respectively. These were also the limits used for the 2019 General Election. The number of new Polling Units in a State is the number of Voting Points aggregated from those Polling Units having Voting Points.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, it was discovered that one Polling Unit in Lagos State had been wrongly categorized as a Voting Point and the error was corrected. With this adjustment, the actual number of approved Polling Units came to 119,974. As a result, the Commission arrived at the exact figure of 56,563 Voting Points in addition to 309 Voting Point Settlements in the FCT, making a total of 56,872 Voting Points.\u201d\n\nHe added further that, \u201cafter wide ranging consultations with stakeholders and fieldwork by our officials, the 56,872 Voting Points and Voting Point Settlements were converted and added to the existing 119,974 Polling Units. Consequently, the Commission is glad to report that 25 years since the current Polling Units were created in 1996; the hard nut is finally and successfully cracked after several unsuccessful attempts. Nigeria now has 176,846 full-fledged Polling Units.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, after consultation with stakeholders, the Commission has successfully removed 749 Polling Units from inappropriate locations to appropriate public facilities or open spaces in line with our policy to guarantee unencumbered access to Polling Units for all voters. Of this figure, 232 were removed from private properties, 145 royal palaces, 6 Mosques, 21 Churches and 9 Shrines. The remaining 336 Polling Units were relocated for various reasons which include distance, difficult terrain, congestion, communal conflict, new settlements and general insecurity.\u201d\n\nThe INEC boss also noted that \u201cin view of the advanced preparations already made by the Commission, four pending bye-elections in Kaduna, Jigawa and Plateau States will be the last to be conducted using a combination of Polling Units and Voting Points. Two of these elections in Sabon Gari State Constituency in Kaduna State and Gwaram Federal Constituency in Jigawa State are holding this weekend while the Commission awaits the formal declaration of vacancies by the Honourable Speaker of the House of Representatives in respect of Lere Federal Constituency of Kaduna State and Jos North/Bassa Federal Constituency of Plateau State.\n\n\u201cThe Resident Electoral Commissioners and staff of the Commission nationwide spared no effort to ensure the success of the exercise. Above all, this historic accomplishment would not have been possible without the support and understanding of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the Independent National Electoral Commission, I would like to express our profound appreciation to the leadership of political parties, civil society organizations, the media, security agencies, religious leaders, socio-cultural associations, the labour unions, professional bodies, persons with disabilities, women and youth groups, students\u2019 unions, the Federal Executive Council (FEC), the State Governors under the auspices of the National Economic Council (NEC) and the National Assembly. We also acknowledge the invaluable support of the development partners for facilitating some of the stakeholder engagements and the publication of advocacy documents.\n\n\u201cLooking to the near future, the Commission is preparing to conduct the remaining off-season end of tenure elections ahead of the 2023 General Election. Already, activities listed in the timetable for the Anambra State Governorship election are being implemented. So are those of the FCT Area Council election holding on 12th February, 2022.\n\n\u201cIn the sequence of off-season elections, the Ekiti and Osun State Governorship elections are holding next year. In keeping with our policy of announcing the dates of elections in advance to enable early and effective preparations by all concerned, the Commission has approved that the Ekiti State Governorship election will hold on Saturday 18th June 2022 while the Osun State Governorship election will hold one month later on Saturday 16th July 2022. The detailed Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the two elections have been uploaded on the Commission\u2019s website and social media platforms. We implore political parties and aspirants to ensure rancour-free primaries and thereafter conduct peaceful electioneering campaigns.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Says reforms needed to reduce inflation, accelerate recovery\n\n\u2022Blames lack of economic opportunities for insecurity, criminality in Nigeria\n\n\u2022Moderation in food prices slows inflation to 17.93%\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe World Bank has stated that inflationary pressure in Nigeria has pushed about seven million Nigerians below the poverty line in 2020 alone.\n\nThe World Bank gave the data in its latest Nigeria Development Update (NDU), released yesterday, a few days after President Muhammadu Buhari in his Democracy Day broadcast claimed on Saturday that his administration had lifted 10.5 million Nigerians out of poverty in the past two years.\n\nThe bank\u2019s Country Director for Nigeria, Mr. Shubham Chaudhuri, while speaking on \u2018The Arise Xchange,\u2019 a programme of ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, also said lack of economic opportunities was contributing to the rising crime cases and insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nThe multilateral institution also reiterated the need for the federal government to set policy foundations for a strong recovery as well as to tame inflation.\n\nThe report was released on a day the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) announced that Nigeria\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures inflation dropped to 17.93 per cent (year-on-year) in May compared to 18.12 per cent in the preceding month.\n\nBesides, the World Bank also attributed the deteriorating security situation in Nigeria and rising criminality to a lack of economic opportunities in the country.\n\nThe NDU, titled: \u201cResilience through Reforms,\u201d stated that in 2020, the Nigerian economy experienced a shallower contraction of 1.8 per cent than had been projected at the beginning of the pandemic (3.2 per cent).\n\nIt said: \u201cAlthough the economy started to grow again, prices are increasing rapidly, severely impacting Nigerian households. As of April 2021, the inflation rate was the highest in four years. Food prices accounted for over 60 per cent of the total increase in inflation. Rising prices have pushed an estimated seven million Nigerians below the poverty line in 2020 alone.\u201d\n\nThe report acknowledged notable government\u2019s policy reforms aimed at mitigating the impact of the crisis and supporting the recovery, including steps taken towards reducing gasoline subsidies and adjusting electricity tariffs towards more cost-reflective levels, both aimed at expanding the fiscal space for pro-poor spending.\n\nIn addition, the report highlighted that both the federal and state governments cut non-essential spending and redirected resources towards the COVID-19 response.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, public-sector transparency has improved, in particular around the operations of the oil and gas sector,\u201d it added.\n\nThe report, however, said despite the more favourable external environment, with recovering oil prices and growth in advanced economies, a failure to sustain and deepen reforms would threaten both macroeconomic sustainability and policy credibility, thereby limiting the government\u2019s ability to address gaps in human and physical capital, which is needed to attract private investment.\n\n\u201cNigeria faces interlinked challenges in relation to inflation, limited job opportunities, and insecurity,\u201d Chaudhuri, said during the virtual presentation of the NDU.\n\n\u201dWhile the government has made efforts to reduce the effect of these by advancing long-delayed policy reforms, it is clear that these reforms will have to be sustained and deepened for Nigeria to realise its development potential,\u201d he added.\n\nThe latest Nigeria Development Update proposed a near-term policy option organised around three priority objectives: reduce inflation by implementing policies that support macroeconomic stability, inclusive growth, and job creation; protect poor households from the impacts of inflation, and facilitate access to financing for small and medium enterprises in key sectors to mitigate the effects of inflation and accelerate the recovery.\n\n\u201cGiven the urgency to reduce inflation amidst the pandemic, a policy consensus and expedite reform implementation on exchange-rate management, monetary policy, trade policy, fiscal policy and social protection would help save lives, protect livelihoods, and ensure a faster and sustained recovery,\u201d World Bank Lead Economist for Nigeria and co-author of the report, Marco Hernandez said.\n\nIn addition to assessing Nigeria\u2019s economic situation, the NDU discussed how the COVID-19 crisis has affected employment, how inflation is exacerbating poverty in Nigeria, how reforming the power sector can ignite economic growth and how Nigeria can mobilise revenues in a time of crisis.\n\nLack of Economic Opportunities Fuelling Insecurity, Criminality in Nigeria, Says W\u2019Bank\n\nWhile speaking on \u2018The Arise Xchange,\u2019 a programme of ARISE NEWS Channel, Chaudhuri said lack of economic opportunities was contributing to the rising crime cases and insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, due to the level of poverty, many people will try to find a way to getting by however they can, and if criminality offers an option, then they will embrace it.\n\nThis, he stated, in turn, makes it difficult for businesses to operate and has a multiplier effect on the country\u2019s economic growth potential.\n\nResponding to a question on at what point he thinks the country would begin to lift its citizens out of poverty, he said: \u201cThe simple and complicated answer to that question is as soon as Nigeria chooses to. It really is Nigeria\u2019s choice. The potential is there and the resources can be directed towards that effort.\n\n\u201cUltimately, it would be the private sector that would create the jobs by investing and it is the government that invests in the people by making sure that every Nigerian child has education and the right healthcare. So, these are the things that lead to sustained poverty reduction. In any way, these are simple things in terms of what needs to be done and what is often complicated is generating the consensus around them and actually implementing it.\n\n\u201cSo, we believe Nigeria has the potential to lift 100 million of its citizens out of poverty by 2030 as President Buhari has said. But that decision has to be Nigeria\u2019s choice right now.\u201d\n\nHe, however, commended Nigeria\u2019s fiscal and monetary authorities for undertaking \u201cbold reforms in the face of vocal opposition.\u201d\n\nHe cited the reforms to include the central bank\u2019s recent adoption of the NAFEX rate, which is the rate at the Investors and Exporters\u2019 Window.\n\n\u201cWe believe that would help to boost investor\u2019s confidence, boost the competitiveness of the economy and if combined with other measures, would add more flexibility on the rate. That I think would set the foundation for a strong economic recovery.\n\n\u201cIn collaboration with everything, the fiscal authorities are doing both in terms of mobilising domestic revenue and rationalising expenditure at a time when much-needed resources are needed to combat the pandemic, that coordination would be critical,\u201d he said.\n\nChaudhuri also stressed the need for establishing a more systematic coordination mechanism between fiscal and monetary policy managers, as is being done in a range of countries around the world.\n\nHe stated that in such coordination, communication would be critical.\n\n\u201cWe are in a situation that is unprecedented across the world and it would require support from all members of the society. That is why we believe that communication is essential in anything that the government does,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his contribution, World Bank Lead Economist for Nigeria and co-author of the NDU, Marco Hernandez said: \u201cTo achieve Nigeria\u2019s potential is not up to one government.\u201d\n\nThis, according to the economist, will require sustained action from subsequent governments.\n\n\u201cSo, it is important that the citizens take part so that they can monitor progress and make suggestion going forward,\u201d he added.\n\nModeration in Food Prices Slows Inflation to 17.93%\n\nMeanwhile, the CPI, which measures inflation, dropped to 17.93 per cent (year-on-year) in May compared to 18.12 per cent in the preceding month, according to the NBS.\n\nThe 0.19 per cent decline in the headline index, makes it the second consecutive month that the rate has sustained its downward trajectory after 18 months of inflationary pressures on the economy.\n\nAccording to the CPI figures for May, food inflation dropped to 22.28 per cent from 22.72 per cent in April.\n\nPrice moderation was recorded in bread, cereals, milk, cheese, eggs, fish, soft drinks, coffee, tea and cocoa, fruits, meat, oils and fats and vegetables.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, the food sub-index declined to 1.05 per cent in May from 0.99 per cent recorded in the preceding month.\n\nOn the other hand, core inflation, which excludes the prices of volatile agricultural produce rose to 13.15 per cent from 12.72 per cent in the review period.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, the core sub-index increased by 1.24 per cent, the NBS stated.\n\nThe highest increases were recorded in prices of pharmaceutical products, garments, shoes and other footwear, hairdressing salons and personal grooming establishments.\n\nOthers are furniture and furnishing, carpet and other floor covering, motor cars, hospital services, fuels and lubricants for personal transport equipment, cleaning, repair and hire of clothing, other services in respect of personal transport equipment, gas, household textile and non-durable household goods.\n\nThe NBS said core inflation was highest in Kogi with 25.13 per cent; Bauchi, 23.02 per cent and Sokoto 20.11 per cent. Katsina, with 15.69 per cent; Imo, 15.52 per cent and Delta, 14.85 per cent recorded the slowest rise in headline year-on-year inflation.\n\nSimilarly, food inflation was highest in Kogi 32.82 per cent, Kwara 26.02 per cent and Enugu 25.43 per cent. Akwa Ibom, at 20.06 per cent; Bauchi, 18.65 per cent and Abuja 16.91 per cent recorded the slowest rise in year-on-year inflation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "James Emejo\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday said efforts are ongoing to reduce the country\u2019s import bill by about 35 per cent.\n\nHe said President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s insistence about five years ago on the diversification of the country\u2019s economic base had already started to yield positive results.\n\nThe CBN governor, while receiving a delegation from the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG), led by its governor, Mr. Buah Saidy, on a two-day working visit to the country, stated that the country currently has the potential to export and earn foreign currency from the production of urea for local production of fertiliser as well as petroleum product as soon as the Dangote refineries goes into operation by the first quarter of next year.\n\nThis, he said would help to reduce importation by about 35 per cent.\n\nHe said a country with a population of over 200 million should have food security, pointing out that this was why the CBN was aggressively looking into the area of food and, \u201cwhere we can use our own available raw materials to produce what we need in our country\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd we believe with time Nigeria will really be a greater country than it is today. We don\u2019t think we are great yet because we have a high import dependence in the country and we are doing everything possible to reduce imports.\n\n\u201cBut like you know, when we are able to reduce imports, encourage exports and encourage consumption spending and investment, those are some of the parameters that will ultimately boost our economy so that we can continue to see rapid growth in our GDP and see prosperity for our people.\u201d\n\nHe also told the visiting team that the apex bank has vast experiences in IT and cybersecurity, adding that its infrastructure had been proven to be impregnable to hackers.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere were some protests sometime last year and when the protest was going on we saw that people were trying to hack into systems and they tried to hack into the CBN systems.\n\n\u201cI got a message that the CBN system had been hacked into and I said the CBN system cannot be hacked into. I called our director in charge of IT and she responded that we have enough firewall that prevented the hack into our system. So those are the kinds of experiences we can share with you though expensive but will share then with you and think of how to work together to collaborate with yours.\u201d\n\nHowever, Saidy, who also said the CBG was having a difficult time regulating the banks in the Gambia especially in the areas of meting out sanctions to erring financial institutions had further sought to know the magic which the CBN had adopted to sanction banks\u2019 executives without repercussions.\n\nResponding, however, Emefiele attributed the successes to the support which the apex bank had enjoyed from the National Assembly.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the issue of the CBN independence, I thank you for the kind words. But I think the point is that we thank our own parliament. Our parliament has been extremely supportive of the CBN.\n\n\u201cThey put in place a central bank Act that grants independence to the CBN and we have our Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act that also grants a lot of power and authority for the CBN to bite when we find people who want to take advantage of the system for their own personal benefit and we don\u2019t breed any nonsense about people who try to take advantage of our system for their personal benefits.\n\n\u201cEverything must be done keeping in mind the overall national goals and objectives and that is why the CBN will act very fast on any economic agent that tries to undermine our policies and that\u2019s why we are very firm on them.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWorking with your parliamentary I believe you can have laws that can give you the kind of independence that you need in any, practically most of the central banks in the world today have independence that gives them the power to be able to manage monetary policy in a way that is beneficial to their countries and economy.\u201d\n\nEmefiele also said the apex bank was doing everything possible, apart from looking at currency adjustment when necessary, to confront issues of supply management and ensure that economy grows.\n\nHe said the CBN had adopted demand management strategies that will help to curtail imports and ensure that some of those goods that can be produced locally are not imported.\n\nMeanwhile, there are strong indications that CBN may seal an agreement with the Central Bank of the Gambia (CBG) to undertake the printing of legal tender for the latter.\n\nThis followed a request by the CBG for a possible collaboration as it seeks to address acute currency shortages in the country.\n\nAlready, Emefiele, while receiving a delegation, assured that the CBN has extremely competitive advantage to manage the currency printing job for The Gambia.\n\nHe said the Nigerian Security Printing and Minting Plc which was established in the early 1960s had been printing currency for the country, adding that the facility has a lot of idle capacity to satisfy the demand of the CBG.\n\nAmong other considerations, Saidy had informed the CBN governor that it is currently costly and unsustainable for the Gambia to continue to rely on its printer \u2013 De La Rue of London \u2013 for its currency needs.\n\nHe added that the distance coupled with some logistics and resource constraints had partly led to a current situation whereby the country had witnessed acute shortage of currency with the attendant implications for the economy.\n\nEmefiele, nevertheless, said: \u201cI note your point on currency management. The Nigerian mint was set up in the early 1960s and we\u2019ve been producing our currency since the early 60s and we have a lot of idle capacity to ensure that instead of you going to Europe or other countries, you will be able to benefit from our ideas.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cOur colleagues will take you to the security printing facility. Our colleagues that came in from Liberia two months ago were fascinated by the kind of facilities, we have at our Nigerian security printing and minting facility and I am sure that you will also enjoy them.\n\n\u201cAnd I am sure they will follow you back to the Gambia to see how they can help you to structure your economic order quantities so we can also be of assistance in printing your currency.\n\n\u201cAnd I can assure you that we can be extremely competitive if only from the stand point of logistics and freight from Europe but it\u2019s just going to be a few hours from here to the Gambia and the rest of them.\u201d\n\nThe CBG governor had further explained that it costs the bank about \u00a370,000 to lift printed currencies from Sri Lanka to the Gambia.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe also need assistance in currency management. Right now we have a situation where we are running very low on currency and at some point I get scared because we cannot at the central bank run out of currency completely as that will be a disaster.\n\n\u201cSo we want to learn from your estimate. We have a model but we have not looked at it yet \u2013 given to us by our printers \u2013 De La Rue. How they estimate the currency need of the country on yearly basis.\n\n\u201cBut I think it has some defects otherwise, the acute shortage we have currently would not have happened.\u201d\n\nSaidy said: \u201cWe placed an order for three years of currency to be printed but again, the contract with De La Rue since independence they have been printing our currency.\n\n\u201cYesterday in my interaction with the Deputy Governor, Mr. Kingsley Obiora, we realise that you print your own currency and I asked about security and he assured me that you have top of the line security features.\n\n\u201cSo this is another area I would want us to exchange ideas and have discussions on how possibly if we decide to go with you we can collaborate with your assistance to be printing our currency.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cAgain, it is closer, De La Rue is in London but they do the printing in Malta and also Sri Lanka. The last one was done in Sri Lanka.\n\n\u201cLifting those things all the way to the Gambia is costly because we had to do some emergency order and that cost was going to be on CBG but with negotiations and assuming then that we will give them this contract of three years of printing our currency, they now paid for the flight \u2013 about \u00a370,000 to lift those currencies to the Gambia.\u201d\n\nHe also said the CBG was in the country to benefit from the CBN\u2019s vast experiences on how it had successfully regulated the financial system and sought assistance in the areas of information technology, modernisation, cybersecurity, forex shipping and management, among others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Army chief says synergy now better among service chiefs\n\nDeji Elumoye and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday called for unity among West African States and those in the Sahel to deal with security challenges in their respective nations.\n\nAlso, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya, has said service chiefs now work in synergy, debunking insinuation that they failed in curbing the worsening insecurity in the country due to inter-agency rivalry.\n\nBuhari, while receiving the new Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for West Africa and the Sahel, Mahamat Annadif, at the State House, Abuja, said the security challenges were enormous and, there, required concerted efforts to tackle them.\n\nThe president, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, said: \u201cYou are our neighbour. You have vast experience on matters affecting the Sahel, having served for five years in Mali. I hope you will get the countries to work together to confront the issues affecting them.\n\n\u201cI hope under the auspices of UNOWAS, you will help get the problems sorted out. Most of them have to do with the instability in Libya, and it affects all of us.\u201d\n\nWhile describing the security challenges as \u201cenormous,\u201d Buhari added that the Boko Haram insurgency has ravished the lives and resources of Nigerians and inhabitants of some neighbouring countries while large swathes of Mali remain occupied by militants.\n\nHe promised Nigeria\u2019s support to Annadif to aid his new assignment.\n\nIn his remarks, Annadif said he was visiting shortly after his appointment because he recognised Nigeria\u2019s crucial role in West Africa.\n\nHe said the problems of the Sahel region were not new to him, which is why more than ever, he would depend on the help of Nigeria to succeed.\n\nSynergy Now Better among Service Chiefs, Says COAS\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya, has debunked the insinuation that the service chiefs failed to curb the worsening insecurity in the country due to lack of synergy among them.\n\nYahaya, who spoke while fielding questions from members of the House of Representatives Committees on Defence and Army at his screening, said there was synergy among the service chiefs.\n\nBuhari had appointed Yahaya to replace former COAS, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, who died in a plane crash in Kaduna.\n\nThe president consequently wrote to both chambers of the National Assembly, urging them to confirm Yahaya\u2019s appointment.\n\nAddressing the lawmakers, Yahaya said the job of securing the country was not a one man\u2019s job, adding that the service chiefs have always operated together, hence the composition of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Police, DSS and Civil Defence.\n\nHe said: \u201dAs we know, internal security is intelligence-driven operation. So we need others, including communities, including traditional rulers and all others who can provide information. We work together. At the army headquarters level here, all the service chiefs now luckily we were all mates in the academy. So there\u2019s not much gap. The CDS (Chief of Defence Staff) is a member of 34 regular course; we met him there.\n\nSo, at one time or the other, all of us were members of that academy together. The chief of naval staff and I were one time members of battalion. So, the synergy cannot be anything better now that we\u2019re brought up together; we have trained together.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on his plans to curb the worsening insecurity, the COAS said he would use his experience in the field over the years to make Nigeria safer.\n\nHe added: \u201dI joined the military 36 years ago, so, I brought along with me 36 years of military experience. I\u2019m abreast with the security requirements. I was involved in several security operations. The challenges we are facing now, all are characterised by these areas I mentioned, where I have first-hand information and have commanded troops and I administered them in achieving what we\u2019ve done.\n\n\u201cI believe I have the requisite requirements by the grace of God to now provide my services in this office of the Chief of Army Staff, if confirmed. What I brought is a wealth of experience and commitment. So I\u2019m committed and determined to provide my best and also having known what\u2019s required to achieve results.\u201d\n\nHe also appealed to all citizens for their support, adding that with the support of the people, Nigeria will win the fight against insecurity.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman, House Committee on Defence, Hon. Babajimi Benson, had said the insecurity bedeviling the country had cost it a lot both financially and in terms of human lives.\n\nHe tasked the COAS to bring to strive to end it.\n\nBenson said: \u2018This exercise comes at a very challenging time in the history of our dear country, Nigeria.\n\nOur nation has been besieged by several security issues across all the geopolitical zones with banditry, militancy and self-secessionists stretching our military to the extreme. The worst is the lingering insurgency in the North-east. This war has cost the country a lot both financially and in terms of human lives. This must stop. The Armed Forces of Nigeria needs to adopt innovative measures to curb the killings and wanton destruction of property as a result of these cases of insecurity.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, hope that, if confirmed, the new chief of army staff will do everything possible, working with other service chiefs, to bring this to an end.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Why National Security Adviser, Monguno Is Threatening The Life Of EFCC Boss, Bawa",
          "text": "The National Security Adviser, Babagana Mungono has been fingered as one of the high profile Nigerians threatening the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abdulrasheed Bawa, a source told SaharaReporters.\n\nThe action might not be unconnected to the wider probe into the finances of the Office of the NSA by the EFCC.\n\nBawa had on Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television programme, on Tuesday claimed he had been receiving death threats since he became the chairman of the anti-corruption agency.\n\n\u201cLast week, I was in New York, as all Nigerians are aware of. A very senior citizen received a phone call from somebody that is not even under investigation. What the caller said to him on the phone is that; he is going to kill the EFCC chairman,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I am going to kill him. I am going to kill him\u2019. This is to tell you how bad it is. It is actually real. Corruption can fight back.\u201d See Also News Some People Want Me Dead Because I'm EFCC Boss\u2014Anti-Corruption Agency Boss, Bawa Says\n\nIn February 2021, the 40-year-old law enforcer was named as the new EFCC chairman to replace Ibrahim Magu, the former acting chairman of the anti-graft commission.\n\nA source in the EFCC however told SaharaReporters that Bawa was referring to Monguno.\n\n\u201cThe man he was referring to is Monguno, the current NSA. He is after Bawa\u2019s life because of the investigation of Brigadier-General Jafaru Mohammed, the former Director of Finance and Administration in the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), who oversaw the movement of money seized in Ikoyi and presently being investigated for looting,\u201d the source said.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how the anti-graft agency on March 11, 2021, obtained an interim forfeiture order from a Federal High Court in Abuja in respect of some properties allegedly belonging to Mungono but held in a proxy.\n\nIn her ruling, Justice Folashade Ogunbanjo granted an ex parte application for interim forfeiture of the assets and properties by the chairman of the EFCC, made on March 9.\n\nThe court ordered the publication of the interim forfeiture of the assets linked to a former Director of Finance in the Office of the NSA, Brigadier-General Jafaru Mohammed, and invited people \u201cwho may have interest in the assets and properties listed in the schedule to show cause, within 14 days of such publication, why a final order of forfeiture to the Federal Government of Nigeria of the said assets and properties should not be made.\u201d\n\nThe assets traced to the proxies and associates of the General include House on Plot 7, God's Own Estate, Road 1, Wamna District, Abuja; a fenced plot at No 1 Jubril Aminu Crescent, Katampe Extension, Abuja; plot at Kubwa Express, Directly opposite Abuja Model City Gate, Abuja; and a house on Block SD 22 House 2, Road 5, Kabusa Garden Estate, Abuja.\n\nOthers are No 15, 21 Crescent, 2nd Avenue, Gwarinpa Estate, Abuja; No 3 Liverpool Close, Sun City Estate, Abuja; No 52 Mainstreet, Sun City Estate, Abuja; and No 25 Osaka Street, Sun City Estate, Abuja.\n\nHowever, a security source had told SaharaReporters that Mohammed as the Director of Finance and Administration in the office of the NSA allegedly carried out many errands on behalf of Monguno.\n\n\u201cIt is not a secret that the NSA had a confidante in the Director of Finance, who used proxies on the instruction of his boss to acquire those properties. It was a very close-knitted deal in the sense that it would be difficult to trace any of these properties to them.\n\n\u201cBut with this move by the EFCC, it shows they might have some credible information at their disposal,\u201d the source had said.\n\nHe alleged that some top hierarchy in the Nigerian security architecture reported Monguno to President Buhari over the way he and Mohammed fleeced the coffers of the ONSA.\n\nThe source said, \u201cThe NSA is very skilled in presenting the holier-than-thou attitude in the public. But in truth, I think the rot in the ONSA under him is worse than that of Sambo Dasuki (ex-NSA boss). Monies were spirited out recklessly, and this prompted the military hierarchy then as it was to effect some changes in the ONSA.\n\n\u201cThis saw to the transfer of several officers including the Director of Finance, Brigadier-General Jafaru Mohammed; the Special Assistant to the NSA, Colonel AA Ibrahim and the Director Legal Intercept, SS Shehu by the army hierarchy sometime in 2020 as a means to bring sanity into the ONSA which was excessively abused.\"\n\nAnother top security source further corroborated this position when he stated that the NSA and his former Director of Finance and Administration indeed committed some infractions that went unnoticed by the EFCC under Ibrahim Magu.\n\n\u201cI am aware that this was one of the things that worked against the confirmation of Ibrahim Magu as the EFCC Chairman because the Department of State Services got wind of the dealings and subsequently made sweeping arrest that were at some point toned down because of the issues it would generate in the public,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cThis new development is therefore not surprising as most of us saw it coming with the way and manner the NSA and the director of finance and administration almost ran down the ONSA. I can assure you that those properties would be forfeited to the federal government as none of them would come forward to claim ownership.\n\n\u201cThe NSA was cut to size when he attempted to get approval for arms purchase from third party sources against the government directive of the country-to-country transaction in arms purchase. This deal was leaked by one of the former service chiefs who ensured that the president was briefed and the NSA was subsequently rebuked. Since then, there has been no love lost between them and the NSA, who uses any opportunity to launch scathing attacks on the tenure of the former service chiefs.\u201d\n\nAn EFCC source told SaharaReporters that preliminary investigations revealed that the properties were held in proxy for Monguno.\n\n\u201cThose properties were acquired by the former Director of Finance and Administration in the ONSA acting on instruction from Monguno. We were able to trace the deal and all those whose names were used on behalf of the NSA.\n\n\u201cThere is every likelihood that the court would eventually grant a final forfeiture to the federal government, which would indeed be a welcome development,\u201d the source said.",

          "text": "The National Security Adviser, Babagana Mungono has been fingered as one of the high profile Nigerians threatening the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abdulrasheed Bawa, a source told SaharaReporters.\n\nThe action might not be unconnected to the wider probe into the finances of the Office of the NSA by the EFCC.\n\nBawa had on Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television programme, on Tuesday claimed he had been receiving death threats since he became the chairman of the anti-corruption agency.\n\n\u201cLast week, I was in New York, as all Nigerians are aware of. A very senior citizen received a phone call from somebody that is not even under investigation. What the caller said to him on the phone is that; he is going to kill the EFCC chairman,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I am going to kill him. I am going to kill him\u2019. This is to tell you how bad it is. It is actually real. Corruption can fight back.\u201d See Also News Some People Want Me Dead Because I'm EFCC Boss\u2014Anti-Corruption Agency Boss, Bawa Says\n\nIn February 2021, the 40-year-old law enforcer was named as the new EFCC chairman to replace Ibrahim Magu, the former acting chairman of the anti-graft commission.\n\nA source in the EFCC however told SaharaReporters that Bawa was referring to Monguno.\n\n\u201cThe man he was referring to is Monguno, the current NSA. He is after Bawa\u2019s life because of the investigation of Brigadier-General Jafaru Mohammed, the former Director of Finance and Administration in the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), who oversaw the movement of money seized in Ikoyi and presently being investigated for looting,\u201d the source said.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how the anti-graft agency on March 11, 2021, obtained an interim forfeiture order from a Federal High Court in Abuja in respect of some properties allegedly belonging to Mungono but held in a proxy.\n\nIn her ruling, Justice Folashade Ogunbanjo granted an ex parte application for interim forfeiture of the assets and properties by the chairman of the EFCC, made on March 9.\n\nThe court ordered the publication of the interim forfeiture of the assets linked to a former Director of Finance in the Office of the NSA, Brigadier-General Jafaru Mohammed, and invited people \u201cwho may have interest in the assets and properties listed in the schedule to show cause, within 14 days of such publication, why a final order of forfeiture to the Federal Government of Nigeria of the said assets and properties should not be made.\u201d\n\nThe assets traced to the proxies and associates of the General include House on Plot 7, God's Own Estate, Road 1, Wamna District, Abuja; a fenced plot at No 1 Jubril Aminu Crescent, Katampe Extension, Abuja; plot at Kubwa Express, Directly opposite Abuja Model City Gate, Abuja; and a house on Block SD 22 House 2, Road 5, Kabusa Garden Estate, Abuja.\n\nOthers are No 15, 21 Crescent, 2nd Avenue, Gwarinpa Estate, Abuja; No 3 Liverpool Close, Sun City Estate, Abuja; No 52 Mainstreet, Sun City Estate, Abuja; and No 25 Osaka Street, Sun City Estate, Abuja.\n\nHowever, a security source had told SaharaReporters that Mohammed as the Director of Finance and Administration in the office of the NSA allegedly carried out many errands on behalf of Monguno.\n\n\u201cIt is not a secret that the NSA had a confidante in the Director of Finance, who used proxies on the instruction of his boss to acquire those properties. It was a very close-knitted deal in the sense that it would be difficult to trace any of these properties to them.\n\n\u201cBut with this move by the EFCC, it shows they might have some credible information at their disposal,\u201d the source had said.\n\nHe alleged that some top hierarchy in the Nigerian security architecture reported Monguno to President Buhari over the way he and Mohammed fleeced the coffers of the ONSA.\n\nThe source said, \u201cThe NSA is very skilled in presenting the holier-than-thou attitude in the public. But in truth, I think the rot in the ONSA under him is worse than that of Sambo Dasuki (ex-NSA boss). Monies were spirited out recklessly, and this prompted the military hierarchy then as it was to effect some changes in the ONSA.\n\n\u201cThis saw to the transfer of several officers including the Director of Finance, Brigadier-General Jafaru Mohammed; the Special Assistant to the NSA, Colonel AA Ibrahim and the Director Legal Intercept, SS Shehu by the army hierarchy sometime in 2020 as a means to bring sanity into the ONSA which was excessively abused.\"\n\nAnother top security source further corroborated this position when he stated that the NSA and his former Director of Finance and Administration indeed committed some infractions that went unnoticed by the EFCC under Ibrahim Magu.\n\n\u201cI am aware that this was one of the things that worked against the confirmation of Ibrahim Magu as the EFCC Chairman because the Department of State Services got wind of the dealings and subsequently made sweeping arrest that were at some point toned down because of the issues it would generate in the public,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cThis new development is therefore not surprising as most of us saw it coming with the way and manner the NSA and the director of finance and administration almost ran down the ONSA. I can assure you that those properties would be forfeited to the federal government as none of them would come forward to claim ownership.\n\n\u201cThe NSA was cut to size when he attempted to get approval for arms purchase from third party sources against the government directive of the country-to-country transaction in arms purchase. This deal was leaked by one of the former service chiefs who ensured that the president was briefed and the NSA was subsequently rebuked. Since then, there has been no love lost between them and the NSA, who uses any opportunity to launch scathing attacks on the tenure of the former service chiefs.\u201d\n\nAn EFCC source told SaharaReporters that preliminary investigations revealed that the properties were held in proxy for Monguno.\n\n\u201cThose properties were acquired by the former Director of Finance and Administration in the ONSA acting on instruction from Monguno. We were able to trace the deal and all those whose names were used on behalf of the NSA.\n\n\u201cThere is every likelihood that the court would eventually grant a final forfeiture to the federal government, which would indeed be a welcome development,\u201d the source said.",

          "text": "The early markers of autocratic leadership\n\nNigeria\u2019s full-throttle descent to autocracy was finally confirmed following events from last week that culminated in a ban on Twitter by the Federal Government. Twitter apparently crossed a national red line when they deleted President Buhari\u2019s tweet. The tweet in question contained an implied threat to unleash state-level genocidal violence on the instigators of violence in the South-East geopolitical zone following a mass outcry.\n\nTwitter\u2019s decision to take down the president\u2019s tweet set the social media company against some senior members of the Buhari regime and triggered the ban. Nigeria\u2019s minister of information, Lai Mohammed, has also made claims against Twitter for being anti-Nigeria \u2013 given how much leeway, in his opinion, Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, has enjoyed on the platform.\n\nLai also added that Twitter encouraged and supported the #EndSARS protests by donating bitcoin to frontline protesters.\n\nThe fight against opposition in democratic Nigeria\n\nOne of the important things to note about a country\u2019s slide to authoritarianism is in what it perceives as a threat to the state. Stable democracies see external acts of aggression as a national security concern. But in the wake of the growing importance which social media has taken on in recent times, campaigns of misinformation have also been classified by some people as subtle acts of aggression against a state.\n\nThe alleged Russian interference in the US election of 2016 and the reaction to its effect is an important example in this regard. For smaller, less stable countries, the major concern is civil liberties. Governments who are paranoid about such things as protests against police brutality, which lead them to clamp down with force that results in massacres, only exist to rule in a state of fear and thus see civil liberties such as free speech as threats to national security when the actual action is borne out of a perceived threat to regime security.\n\nThe first pointer Nigeria had started on this journey came less than a month after Buhari was elected in 2015. He vindictively banned private operator, African Independent Television (AIT), from covering government-related events after it had run the bulk of campaign ads against him during the election season. President Buhari failed to understand the concept of opposition; he was unable to realise that sanctions must follow due process without exemptions. Ultimately, the failure to understand the importance of opposition in a democracy has led to the birth of several dictatorial actions that have crippled the civic space in Nigeria.\n\nFirst the judges, now the internet\n\nThe DSS raid on judges in 2016 was a major affront on the judiciary which has now been paralysed by an eight-week-long strike by its workers agitating for judicial autonomy. The Gestapo style raid on some of the country\u2019s most senior judges was met with outcry but the Buhari regime doubled down by claiming that such a direct, violent, confrontational approach is important to fight corruption it claimed was rampant within that arm of government. As of today, none of the judges whose houses were raided has been convicted.\n\nAs a matter of fact, in late 2019 it was found that Buhari had violated at least 40 court orders since 2015, some of which were judgments ordering the Federal Government to release some members of the opposition as well as Ibrahim El Zakzakky, leader of Nigeria\u2019s persecuted Shi\u2019ite minority. If there was any question as to the path Nigeria is currently towing, the answers were glaring from the month after the APC won the 2015 General elections.\n\nNow, it is going after the internet.\n\nMost of the countries in Africa and around the world that have resorted to minimum or complete internet shutdowns in the past two years are countries with very questionable democratic ideals and equally poor human rights record. Chad, Mali, Russia amongst several others, are countries that rank among the lowest by every democratic ranking. Nigeria under Buhari has followed the same trajectory but unlike these other countries who shut down the internet for some reasons that range from political to national security risk, Buhari banned Twitter to massage his ego.\n\nThere is thus no question that a government that resorts to spur of the moment, reactionary decisions that reminds one of the dark days of Nigeria\u2019s dance with men in uniform, days in which Buhari cut his teeth, reverses its democratic ideals from a nascent stage to near zero. There is no question about the full-blown authoritarianism of the Buhari government.\n\nThe only saving grace for many Nigerians is that even though the government has not made pretences about its desire to transform the country into an authoritarian state, it lacks the competence (and the means) to do it like China has done. In the hours following the announcement of the ban on Twitter, it was reported by the FIJ that the government has reached out to China to build an internet firewall modelled after the Chinese example. The internet firewall is a way of having a separate network for the Nigerian Internet that will give the government control over social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. This is similar to the internet filtering system China operates, called the Great Firewall.\n\nAccording to the Council on Foreign Relation, \u201cthe Great Firewall is the centre of the government\u2019s online censorship and surveillance effort. Its methods include bandwidth throttling, keyword filtering, and blocking access to certain websites.\u201d\n\nThe cost of control and governmental force\n\nThe firewall essentially gives the government full control over the internet in its jurisdiction. Assumptions of whether the government can afford such large scale operations do not take into account the resolve of a paranoid government obsessed with control of everything from the currency, the internet, the media, and even down to the importation of milk or staple food like rice. Even if the implementation is poor, there\u2019s no gainsaying the fact that government procurement is a big business layered by high graft. This means that there are people who would get rich from such a transaction never mind how much of a waste of scarce resources such a venture actually is.\n\nThe speed with which telecommunications companies and internet service providers capitulated to government demands to restrict access to Twitter without a valid court order is emblematic of the depth of autocracy that has been entrenched, as even the economic space is not spared of that ill-fated decision.\n\nIf there are any doubts about the anti-democratic ideals of Nigeria\u2019s government, the fact that despite these many glaring infringements on people\u2019s rights by the president, impeachment is not even being discussed by parliament for fear of retribution is a sign that this house has collapsed and we\u2019re living our worst nightmares.\n\nCheta Nwanze is lead partner at SBM Intelligence\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Mazi Mobility, a mobility-as-a-service (Maas) startup founded by Jesse Forrester, recently launched its flagship electric motorcycle fleet in Nairobi, Kenya. Mazi Mobility is backed by global Venture Builder, Satgana.\n\nMazi uses motorcycles, locally known as \u2018bodas\u2019, to accelerate the transition to efficient, affordable and clean transport in the city. The startup also introduced battery swapping stations that provide on-demand energy, reducing transportation costs by 50%. The MK3 offers a choice between a single and dual battery, capable of up to 70km and 140km of range, respectively. Mazi is taking a multi-stakeholder approach to drive the e-mobility sector forward. They are working with boda operators, technical institutions and manufacturers to ensure the successful implementation of their service.\n\n\u201cMazi is not just an EV company, we are advocates for a sustainable mass mobility change,\u201d says Jesse Forrester, Co-Founder and CEO at Mazi Mobility.\n\n\u201cAt Mazi, we believe that Africans should be able to move efficiently, and affordably across cities at less than the price of personal vehicle ownership while reducing CO2 emissions. What industry is better to see this change than the boda one? Mazi is taking a long approach to mobility, we don\u2019t want to just have the same status quo but with electric vehicles. At Mazi we move people, data and things. Twende Kazi na Mazi!\u201d\n\nSupporting Mazi on their journey is Satgana, a global Venture Builder on a mission to launch and fund responsible startups aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nSatgana backs young entrepreneurs who are at the core of their problem solving approach. They advise their portfolio companies per year while also providing them with venture building and operational support.\n\nAs an e-mobility startup, Mazi Mobility fulfils one or more of the UN\u2019s SDGs including SDG#8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG#11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and SDG#13 (Climate Action).\n\nIn a conversation with Konstantin Behr, Venture Builder at Satgana, he shared with TechCabal what he looks out for in prospective founders:\n\n\u201cFrom the get-go, we analyse how impact-driven a founder is\u2013 that helps us determine if we\u2019re a right fit for them and vice versa.\n\nI am very passionate about Africa and I do a lot of sourcing for foreign investors who also have eyes on different regions on the continent. Mazi Mobility is our first venture in East Africa.\u201d\n\nWhile most Venture Builders hire founders to execute their ideas and strategic plans for a product or business, Satgana\u2019s approach is unique and colors outside the box.\n\nSatgana aims to build and invest into startups alongside purpose-driven entrepreneurs, wherever they are, by using innovation-led and market-based approaches to solve the greatest social and environmental challenges of our time. And alongside Mazi, they hope to write a new chapter in the history of e-mobility in Africa.\n\nFounder and CEO at Satgana, Romain Diaz, elaborated on the launch of their first portfolio venture saying,\n\n\u201cThe urgent need to decarbonise our economies places transportation at the cusp of a fundamental shift towards electric solutions and mobility in Africa is ripe for disruption. As such, Satgana is beyond excited to be involved in the launch of Mazi and truly believes in the founding team\u2019s ability to make it happen. Since day-1, we have been impressed by Jesse\u2019s vision and execution capability. As a Venture Builder, we are humbled to be able to support Mazi in its mission to make urban transportation sustainable while empowering low-income drivers.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN) are all the rage right now in Nigeria since the government banned Twitter. The rise in popularity of VPNs has brought up questions about how exactly they work.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about how VPNs work.\n\nOn the internet, different computers send and receive information between Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Think of it as sending items between two or more physical addresses. When we surf the internet with our IP address, different websites will know specific information about us such as our location, device type, browser and operating system.\n\nWhat does a VPN do?\n\nWith VPNs, our IP addresses change and online activities are hidden.\n\nBefore turning on my VPN, my device was in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nAfter turning on my VPN, my device is in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n\nThe images above show how my location changed from Nigeria to Dominican Republic after turning on my VPN.\n\nThink about it this way: The internet is like a highway that connects different cities across different countries. These highways are mostly public roads that many people use. If you drive on a public road anyone can follow you and track where you go, how long you spend at your destination, and when you return. They might even be able to spy inside your car and learn more about you.\n\nWith a VPN, you have your own private tunnel/road. A tunnel where no one can see what you\u2019re doing or where you\u2019re going.\n\nWhat can a VPN do for you?\n\nNo monitoring: As we mentioned earlier, your internet service provider (ISP) can see your internet traffic and probably log your browsing history. With a VPN, information about your activities online are scrambled in an encrypted tunnel so that external parties, your ISP included, can\u2019t read it.\n\nAccess any site: Every now and then, websites or services you want to use may be inaccessible from your location. VPN enables access to these sites or services from anywhere. If a website isn\u2019t available to devices located in Nigeria, VPNs can change your device location to a different country which has access to this website.\n\nProtection: Free public Wi-Fi might make you forget all your life\u2019s problems but it can also be the beginning of a new set of problems. Public Wi-Fi can easily be accessed by hackers on the same network, who can read your personal data. A VPN encrypts your entire internet connection to protect all your communications, even over unsecured networks.\n\nWhat is the difference between a VPN app, a VPN plugin, and a VPN browser?\n\nCurious about which you should use? VPN browsers or browser plugins only protect your web browser traffic. Note, however, that the rest of the network traffic from your device is still exposed to internet service providers and potential hackers. A VPN app encrypts and protects all network traffic from your device.\n\nIs it safe to use a VPN for online banking?\n\nYes\u2013 but ensure you are using a reputable VPN service. VPNs help protect your privacy while you perform online banking transactions. But remember, a VPN is a tunnel that encrypts your data. It cannot protect you from viruses or guarantee that you won\u2019t be hacked. Remember to create a strong password and adhere to online safety measures.\n\nWhat else should I know about VPNs?\n\nVPNs aren\u2019t without flaws. They have their fair share of practical drawbacks. Internet speed can be slower because VPNs have to reroute and encrypt your data while sending and receiving information between your device and a website.\n\nAlso, some sites and services look at VPN traffic as suspicious and won\u2019t let you connect. It becomes suspicious when a device is in different locations within a short time \u2014 in New York, Lagos and Tokyo within an hour. This could become a real problem, especially when it\u2019s your bank that blocks you.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "\n            In sacking First Bank\u2019s board, a bruised Emefiele enforces CBN tradition        ",
          "text": "Godwin Emefiele did not mince words. First Bank\u2019s leaders crossed the line and were made to pay, without hurting the bank\u2019s minority shareholders and 31 million customers. Too big to fail does not mean too big to be flogged.\n\nEmefiele delivered the hammer in twenty minutes. Not via tweet or a memo (those are for fintechs) but on live television.\n\nIn his role as Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Emefiele gets a lot of flak.\n\nHis off-the-cuff justifications of money printing give him away as a partisan bureaucrat leading a body that should be politically independent. He\u2019s been accused of turning the CBN into a distracted (and dictatorial) jack of all trades. What he said about cryptocurrency \u2013 \u201cit is created out of thin air\u201d \u2013 continues to confound.\n\nBut on Thursday Night Live, Emefiele earned his April salary with his scripted performance. He added another example to a developing tradition of CBN Governors taking the nuclear option against leadership at Nigerian banks, when foul play morphs into potentially explosive rots.\n\nOceanic, Intercontinental and the Class of 2009\n\nIf we go back only 12 years, there was the sack of MD/CEOs and executive directors of five banks on one August evening. Governor Sanusi Lamido Sanusi was the executioner.\n\nThe CEOs\u2019 offence? \u20a61.1 trillion in bad loans, at least.\n\nUnion Bank is the only surviving member of that infamous Class of 2009. Afribank, Finbank, Intercontinental Bank and Oceanic Bank are now footnotes in banking and finance textbooks.\n\nLike Emefiele, Governor Sanusi invited journalists for the momentous dethronement. While Emefiele reinstated the hastily-retired Adesola Adeduntan to the First Bank CEO-ship, Sanusi hired five new leaders to replace the CEOs he fired.\n\nSanusi was flanked at his Lagos press conference by his CBN deputies. Emefiele was a lone hitman in Abuja, perhaps due to COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nCan a CBN Governor really fire bank MDs? A court decided this in 2010 when an ousted Wema Bank boss (who tried to retake his office with the help of armed policemen) sued Chukwuma Soludo, the CBN Governor before Sanusi. Jeremiah Omoyeni, the MD in question, argued that firing him was \u201cnot in the best interest of the public.\u201d\n\nThe Federal High Court in Abuja dismissed Omoyeni by relying on Sections 32 and 33 of the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA) 1991 as amended. The revised BOFIA of 2020 further empowers the CBN to take such actions, including against entire board members whether they be kings or princes.\n\nNo wonder Emefiele was decisive on Thursday, donning his typical green tie with patriotic pride. But this wasn\u2019t his first time executing this aspect of his powers.\n\nThis Skye is the limit\n\nOn July 4, 2016, the CBN fired Skye Bank\u2019s management team and board.\n\nEmefiele announced the dismissal himself, citing Skye Bank\u2019s inability to meet requirements for capital adequacy ratio (CAR) \u2013 a measure of how much capital banks have to protect customers\u2019 deposits. Skye Bank is now the significantly less popular but stable Polaris Bank.\n\nWhich brings us back to First Bank, established in 1894 and one of Nigeria\u2019s top five banks by metrics that matter; assets, deposits, customer base, revenue, credit and branch footprint. It is \u201csystemically important\u201d to Nigeria\u2019s financial system but is it significantly in good shape?\n\nIn his Thursday address, Emefiele admitted something; banks don\u2019t really have to call the CBN in before choosing their leaders. Here are his words:\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, the board of a bank is vested with the authority to make changes in the management team subject to the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s approval. After such changes, the board applies to the CBN for approval and no-objection.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever\u2026\u201d and this is the catch; the above applies to banks that are in a regular state of health. First Bank, as Emefiele explained and financial reports show, has been sickly and under close watch since 2016.\n\n\u201c\u2026the CBN considers itself a key stakeholder in management changes involving First Bank of Nigeria due to the forbearances and close monitoring by the bank over the last five years, aimed at stemming the slide [and] growing concern [over] the status of First Bank.\u201d\n\nAnd so when First Bank removed and replaced a CEO within a week, it inevitably raised eyebrows.\n\nBanks typically announce such seismic moves months ahead, followed by a detailed dance of succession engagements.\n\nTo flip the executive switch in days is dodgy enough; doing it while under intensive care and without the resident doctor\u2019s say-so? Juvenile.\n\nIt\u2019s not a perfect 10\n\nThursday\u2019s events give the impression that the CBN is committed to enforcing the code of corporate governance revised for banks in 2017:\n\n\u201cWe have the Code of Corporate Governance and Code for Bank Directors. You sign these codes before you become a director.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is part of the employment terms. One of the things in these codes is that if you are having a non-performing loan, it is a ground to remove you from being a director.\u201d\n\nWe now know that Oba Otudeko, Chairman of First Bank of Nigeria Holdings, has a bad bill of insider loans to clear. But it is possible that the CBN would not have punished him or any director this week.\n\nTowards the end of his press conference, Emefiele said he repeatedly called Otudeko on the phone, asking him not to remove Adeduntan (whose first five-year tenure as CEO expires December 31, 2021) without the CBN\u2019s involvement. Otudeko did not budge, convincing the board to proceed.\n\nAs such, this week\u2019s sensational dismissal is partly the result of a clash of personalities. It is not fully a strict adherence to sacred statutes or non-negotiable tradition. By his own admission, Emefiele took action because a regulatory line was crossed but also because he was crossed.\n\nBut he took action. For a day, his office took itself seriously and fulfilled a responsibility in the public interest.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nNigeria\u2019s telecommunications workers to go on strike\n\nHelium Health launches in Kenya\n\nMarketForce acquires Digiduka\n\nPlanned strike by Nigeria\u2019s telecommunications workers.\n\nThe Private Telecommunications and Communications Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PTECSSAN) has announced a three-day warning strike starting today, Wednesday, June 16.\n\nAccording to The Punch, the PTECSSAN President, Opeyemi Tomori, decried the poor working conditions of its members and the disregard for labour laws in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigerians are no strangers to strike actions, but this would be the first by the country\u2019s telecommunications workers. Techpoint Africa spoke with customer care representatives from MTN and Airtel, who either claimed ignorance of the strike or said that their services would not be affected.\n\nIf it goes ahead as planned, it could have damaging effects on an economy already grappling with a Twitter ban and widespread insecurity.\n\nInterestingly, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) records that Nigeria\u2019s telecommunications industry contributed 15.05% to the nation\u2019s GDP in 2020.\n\nFollowing reports of a planned strike by telecommunications workers last year, the Federal Government stepped in. They may do so again.\n\nHelium Health launches in Kenya\n\nAdegoke Olubisi (CEO), Tito Ovia (Head, Public Growth Sector), Dimeji Sofowora (CFO)\n\nAfter announcing expansion plans last year, Nigerian healthtech startup, Helium Health, has finally launched in Kenya. This comes after its $10 million Series A raise in May 2020.\n\nAt the time of the raise, the startup announced that the funds would be used for its expansion and the development of new products to make the doctor-patient experience more seamless.\n\nCo-founder and Head of Public Sector Growth, Tito Ovia, announced that the startup is already working with three local partners to improve efficiency and provide better service to patients. Simultaneously, it is rolling out its services in Liberia and Uganda.\n\nHelium Health claims to have over 300 healthcare providers and 5,000 health professionals using its technology to improve access to healthcare for patients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith this move, the six-year-old startup is now present in six West African countries, making it one of the largest healthtech startups in the region.\n\nHealthtech startups in the continent have started getting more recognition, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Disrupt Africa reports that funding for healthtech startups on the continent increased by 257.5% from 2019 to 2020.\n\nMarketForce acquires Digiduka\n\nKenyan startup, MarketForce, has announced the acquisition of Digiduka. The company provides a software solution that allows field agents to record their activities and collect data using handheld devices electronically. This way, businesses can monitor the performance of their sales channels.\n\nOn the other hand, Digiduka helps retailers earn extra money by reselling digital services such as airtime and electricity tokens and also provide them with the payments infrastructure needed to run their businesses.\n\nAccording to Tesh Mbaabu, MarketForce Co-founder and CEO, acquiring Digiduka, rather than competing with them, makes sense as it means the two companies are joining forces to solve a common problem. As part of the buy, Digiduka\u2019s staff will join MarketForce\u2019s team.\n\nFounded in 2018, MarketForce has raised over $2.5 million in funding from investors such as Future Africa, Y Combinator, Ventures Platform, and EchoVC Partners.\n\nAcquisitions are attractive to startups looking to enter new markets, and this seems to be the case with Digiduka. For example, Ajua, a Kenyan consumer experience platform for businesses, bought WayaWaya in April 2021 to take advantage of its payment bots.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nThe biggest stereotypes about young, unemployed Africans.

Reportedly, users may be unable to conveniently use data and call services during the three days as the strike is likely to disrupt these services.\n\nAccording to The Punch, PTECSSAN is embarking on the strike to express their concerns against what the General Secretary, Okonu Abdullahi, calls \u201carbitrary sackings and casualisations\u201d.\n\nAbdullahi said that workers are usually outsourced, which has caused a significant problem in the industry. And since it\u2019s a continual problem, workers are always shortchanged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent times, PTECSSAN has made demands and even threatened to go on strike regarding this problem. However, none of their demands has been met.\n\nIn August 2020, PTECSSAN threatened to go on a two-week warning strike over the remuneration of workers, employee relations practices, exit packages for long-term staff, and alleged abuse of expatriate quota, among others.\n\nMoreover, in March 2021, the telecom association planned to embark on industrial strike action against Huawei Technologies Nigeria Limited, a telecom equipment company. They kept denying workers the right to unionise.\n\nHowever, following the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami\u2019s intervention, that strike action was suspended. In a statement, he said that the telecom equipment company was ready to address the concerns PTECSSAN raised.\n\nThe strike action reportedly commencing today is against the precarious working conditions in the telecom sector like ignoring occupational health and safety, lack of hazard allowance and poor remuneration, and the abuse of national laws and institutions by employers.\n\nWhile the association may be protesting for its rights, the disruptions of data and call services may affect the Nigerian economy.\n\nYesterday, Tuesday, June 15, 2021, MTN reportedly said that due to insecurity in the country, service in Nigeria might be disrupted.\n\nWhat this means is that MTN\u2019s technical support team, in some cases, may not get to the site and achieve an optimum result timely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecall that we wrote that the Nigerian telecom lost 15.5 million mobile subscribers between December 2020 and March 2021 following the SIM registration ban. Therefore, this won\u2019t be the first disruption to the telecom sector in recent months.\n\nIn 2020, Internet shutdowns cost sub-Saharan Africa $237.4 million.\n\nAccording to Statista, as of January 2021, there were 4.66 billion active Internet users globally. In Nigeria, as of January 2021, there were 187.9 million mobile connections and 104.4 million people connected to the Internet, per Data Reportal.\n\nDeloitte\u2019s 2016 The Economic Impact of Disruptions to Internet Connectivity Report shows that in a low connectivity country, with a GDP per capita of $6,000, a population of c. 40 million people, and fixed broadband penetration of c. 5%, a temporary Internet shutdown could have an estimated GDP impact of c. $3 million per day of disruption, amounting a 0.4% of daily GDP.\n\nThis reveals the importance of the Internet to business today.\n\nWe reached out to MTN and Airtel, but as of press time, we are yet to receive a response.\n\nIt\u2019s not certain if Pantami will intervene this time, neither is it known if the industrial strike action will aid the association\u2019s demands.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nLAGOS \u2013 Some members of youth corpers deployed to serve in the northern parts of the country have rejected the offers with a reason of Insecurity those states.\n\nThey have however called on the Presidency and National Assembly to intervene by allowing them from the southern part to remind in their respective states because of incessant bandits activities being perpetrate in the said areas.\n\nMostly the complains came from medical corps members who are worried about their lives due to the insecurity in the northern region where cases of Boko Haram, herdsmen and banditry violence have worsened in recent times.\n\nAuthoritative source revealed that the authority of the National Youth Service Corps ( NYSC) have denied applications for redeployment from the north tendered by some southern corps members, mainly doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals.\n\nThe medical corps members are worried about their lives due to the insecurity in the northern region where cases of Boko Haram, herdsmen and banditry violence have worsened in recent times.\n\nOne of the corpers who spoke with our correspondent on anonymity, a young doctor said that the relocation forms were filled by the corps members who had health issues while some wanted to redeploy for the sake of insecurity in the region.\n\nHowever, he said they were denied redeployment from the North. Lately corps members are being deployed to meet the needs of the health care system in the region, owing to the state government\u2019s failure to employ more doctors and nurses.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cHow do the NYSC authority want us to work and contribute our quota to the development of our mother\u2019s land in an areas that are not safe, where kidnappers on daily basis invade the areas, even with the presence of security operatives\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to the presidency and the National Assembly to intervene and reason along with us because It\u2019s just a sucide mission\u201d, he said.\n\nHe also noted that there were hardly any provisions made for the corps members in terms of accommodation and security.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe country\u2019s insecurity has affected various states in Nigeria, and it is becoming alarming. This is to the Director-General of NYSC; please allow all corps members to relocate or redeploy to their states of choice.\n\n\u201cWe expect that when posted to a camp, and after you manage to spend three weeks in camp, you should be able to relocate to your state of choice irrespective of your state of origin or course of study because the country is unstable right now.\n\n\u201cThe NYSC DG has made relocation difficult for doctors, nurses, medical laboratory scientists and pharmacists and people who studied some other courses.\n\n\u201cWe observe that some failed State governments are using these sets of people in place of doctors and nurses that ought to be in the system. The government has refused to employ workers, so corps members in the medical profession are used in hospitals as the major staff members instead of a support system.\n\n\u201cThey have refused to relocate us to where we want to go because it feels safe for us. At a time like this, we need to be around our family or relatives and not just in any state, so it is so wrong to disapprove our relocation requests.\n\n\u201cI believe we have just one life to live and our lives are more important than where we are posted to work. I am a medical doctor, posted to Jos, Plateau State, but due to the insecurity, we decided to redeploy from there and some of my colleagues used medical reports, which showed they were not OK. The criteria for leaving were medical reasons or insecurity, or marriage, so we submitted our relocation form. I left the orientation camp because I was not too fine; I wanted to go back to Delta.\n\n\u201cIn my camp, only about two persons were allowed to relocate out of about 33 doctors and those who got theirs were seriously connected. Should we go to the North and die because I am a government child?\n\n\u201cOf all my friends who are also medical practitioners, only about four were posted to Ekiti, Osun and other southern states; the rest were taken to Sokoto and Kaduna. One of us encountered bandits on his way to Sokoto; he escaped, though and we had to ask him to put on his WhatsApp location to know wherever he was going.\n\n\u201cThe accommodation they give corps members is not befitting. My friend in Borno told me they lost a corps member, a pharmacist, during the camp. She was 24 years old and she had started panting after they played volleyball. They rushed her to the clinic but in less than 10 minutes, she died. The clinic had no oxygen. It was after she died that the oxygen arrived. So the official there told them to lie that the lady died at the referral hospital. You can imagine this\u201d, the corper disclosed\n\n...",

A brush cutter is a powered garden or agricultural tool used to trim weeds, small trees, and other foliage not accessible by a lawnmower or rotary mower.\n\nIn a letter from SUBEB, signed on behalf of the Executive Chairman by the Public and Private Partnership Officer, Akinlehin Temitope, the board thanked the leading philanthropist and community supporter and offered its warmest regards.\n\nThe letter which is specifically in respect of the donation to Imule Primary in Esan West LGA on March 18, 2021, read in part, \u201cThe Board lauds your generous initiative of complementing her efforts in ensuring quality basic education delivery in Edo State and also looks forward to more partnership in this regard.\u201d\n\nMr. Iseghohimen thanked the Education Board for the gesture noting that he received the letter of commendation with great joy and deep appreciation.

He noted that the development of the community must not only be the responsibility of the government but of every member of the community whether they reside there or not.\n\nHe ascribed all the glory to God for his help and pledged to persist in seeking ways to contribute to the socio-economic development of Esan land and Edo State.\n\nMr. Iseghohimen called on other well-meaning individuals to support the government\u2019s effort to improve the quality of life in communities across not just Esan West but also the whole Edo State.\n\nThe philanthropist had earlier renovated Eresoyen Primary School in Uhogua, Community in Edo State and is constantly looking for new options to give back to the community.\n\nDennis Ainabel Iseghohimen is the founder and Director of Nicholas Auto Solution (NAS), www.nicholasautosolution.co.za, Founder, ROTBW Foundation www.rotbwfoundation.com among other businesses.\n\n...",

It provides disadvantaged and vulnerable women with a one-off, unconditional N10,000 cash transfer to boost their household income generation. This we believe will help reduce their vulnerability and meet their livelihood needs,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said it is gratifying to note that majority of women who benefitted from the scheme have been able to grow the seed capital.\n\nWhile thanking Aliko Dangote Foundation to coming to assist the vulnerable women in Bauchi State, Governor Senator Bala Abdulkadir Muhammad said he was very elated with ADF\u2019s intervention across the country and especially in his state.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the intervention will support lives and livelihoods of women, children and families in Bauchi State.\n\n\u201cAliko Dangote is a beacon of hope for the Bauchi people. He has been creating not only business institutions at the highest levels but also touching lives at the lowest level. He seems to understand Nigeria more than some of us who are politicians. He\u2019s supporting our mothers who will help put food on our tables and train their children in schools.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just named the school of nursing and midwifery after him. This is to mark his huge contribution to our societies in Bauchi.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are also using this opportunity to inform him that he should come and invest in Bauchi. We have the highest deposit of limestone in the country. We have the largest arable land and the largest forest. Bauchi is also very peaceful and secured.\u201d\n\nThe Governor also presented a book to the Aliko Dangote Foundation.\n\nThe book was written over a 100 years ago by Sheik Uthman Danfodio, and titled: The Principle of Leadership.\n\nSpeaking also, the Speaker, State House of Assembly, Hon. Abubakar Y. Suleiman described the intervention as huge saying it would go a long way in supporting the poverty alleviation stride of the state government.\n\nHe said the state will continue to collaborate with the state in area of economic empowerment of womenfolk.\n\nCommending the foundation, First Lady and wife to the Governor Mrs Aisha Bala Muhammad said the intervention will help lift families from economic problems, even as she urged the women to invest it wisely.\n\nSpeaking, one of the beneficiaries Amina Musa, 50, said she would start micro business and use the profit to support her family.\n\nAnother beneficiary Jumai Rabiu, 47, described the intervention as huge and timely, adding that she will use the money judiciously and employ others too.",

The current deadline for a telephone user in the country is now June 30.\n\nMr Pantami sanctioned the licence review, which reportedly took place 20 years ago. The NCC is one of six agencies that the minister superintends. Others are NITDA, NIPOST, NIMC, NIGCOMSAT, and Galaxy Backbone.\n\nThe NCC has at least 8,000 licensees listed on its website. According to the commission, an \u201cinternational cable infrastructure and landing station\u201d licence costs $210,000 for 20 years.",

President Buhari has regularly demonstrated deep compassion and love for Borno State,\u201d Zulum said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe governor noted that not long ago, President Buhari gave approval for the NNPC to establish a power plant for the people of Borno, adding that the president\u2019s gesture was aimed to address electricity problems in Maiduguri and environs.\n\n\u201cThis landmark project will Insha Allah greatly impact on small, medium and large scale businesses to thrive.

The President is also likely to approve a Federal College of Education for Borno.\n\n\u201cFellow citizens, until Buhari gave us Polytechnic, Borno had since 1976, remained without a Federal Polytechnic and Federal College of Education, and this is whereas, most of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states have these Federal Government institutions,\u201d the governor said.\n\nZulum further said that President Buhari has since directed the Nigerian Customs, the North-East Development Commission and the National Emergency Management Agency, to always support Borno\u2019s IDPs with food intervention, noting that a large amount of the food items were shared to IDPs through Buhari\u2019s intervention.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor and the Chief of Army Staff (COAS ), Major General Faruk Yahaya are billed to arrive Maiduguri on Wednesday ahead of the President\u2019s visit.\n\nhttps://leadership.ng/zulum-delivers-556-capital-projects-in-2-years/",

Lukman indicated that President Buhari consistently highlights the primacy of security among the components of his administration\u2019s governing agenda, quoted the Presidwnt saying; \u201cWe have to secure Nigeria before we can manage it efficiently. And I assure you we are going to do that,\u201d the President has made it clear several times, the group said.\n\nEquipping Security Agencies and Building Morale: \u201cThe Nigeria Military is seeing the biggest investments in weaponry and equipment in decades. Hundreds of new platforms are being acquired for the Army, Air Force and Navy. The Nigeria Air Force has received 23 new aircraft since 2015, with at least a dozen more being expected, and the Navy has most recently acquired its first new Landing Ship Tank (LST) since 1979,\u201dstating that the administration has also, launched a Nigeria Police Trust Fund.\n\nPromoting Community-led Solutions to Insecurity: \u201cThe new Police Act signed by President Buhari in 2020 incorporates the concept of Community Policing.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari is a huge advocate for the re-institution by States of age-old communal security mechanisms that bring together traditional and community leaders and the Police, for the provision of credible intelligence and the resolution of conflicts and tensions as they arise.\u201d\n\nNew Security Infrastructure and Operations across Land and Maritime Environments: \u201cPresident Buhari has just flagged-off the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure project, to protect Nigeria\u2019s vast waterways up to the Gulf of Guinea.\n\n\u201cIn the last five years, a number of technological solutions are being deployed and implemented to support the Police, Immigration and other security agencies.\n\n\u201cThese includes the new Nigeria Police National Command and Control Centre (NPF-C4i); the new Nigeria Police Crime and Incident Database (NPC & IDB) Centre; the West Africa Police Information System (WAPIS), developed by INTERPOL; and the Migration and Data Analysis System (MIDAS), developed by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).\u201d\n\nThe group also pointed that the President while addressing underlying drivers of insecurity (poverty and youth unemployment), through programmes and policies in agriculture, manufacturing, small business support, ease of doing business, massive infrastructure investment, and many more added that, \u201cthe Buhari Administration has successfully lifted 10.5 million Nigerians out of poverty.\n\n\u201cThe Buhari Administration, working closely with the States and Local Governments, Legislature and Judiciary, continue to initiate more reforms that can improve the capacity of security agencies to secure the country and be resolute in its determination to rid Nigeria of crime and criminality.\n\n\u201cIt may take some time for Nigerians to see the full results of these interventions, but we are confident that safer days surely lie just ahead, for our country.\u201d",

Ordinarily, I could not just touch him. It was not allowed in our job.

I then realised that there was a danger. I immediately called the Head of State\u2019s personal physician, Dr. Wali, who arrived in the place in eight minutes from his house. He immediately gave Abacha two doses of injection, one at the heart and another close to his neck.

          "text": "The National Security Adviser, Babagana Mungono has been fingered as one of the high profile Nigerians threatening the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abdulrasheed Bawa, a source told SaharaReporters.\n\nThe action might not be unconnected to the wider probe into the finances of the Office of the NSA by the EFCC.\n\nBawa had on Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television programme, on Tuesday claimed he had been receiving death threats since he became the chairman of the anti-corruption agency.\n\n\u201cLast week, I was in New York, as all Nigerians are aware of. A very senior citizen received a phone call from somebody that is not even under investigation. What the caller said to him on the phone is that; he is going to kill the EFCC chairman,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I am going to kill him. I am going to kill him\u2019. This is to tell you how bad it is. It is actually real. Corruption can fight back.\u201d See Also News Some People Want Me Dead Because I\u2019m EFCC Boss\u2014Anti-Corruption Agency Boss, Bawa Says\n\nIn February 2021, the 40-year-old law enforcer was named as the new EFCC chairman to replace Ibrahim Magu, the former acting chairman of the anti-graft commission.\n\nA source in the EFCC however told SaharaReporters that Bawa was referring to Monguno.\n\n\u201cThe man he was referring to is Monguno, the current NSA. He is after Bawa\u2019s life because of the investigation of Brigadier-General Jafaru Mohammed, the former Director of Finance and Administration in the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), who oversaw the movement of money seized in Ikoyi and presently being investigated for looting,\u201d the source said.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how the anti-graft agency on March 11, 2021, obtained an interim forfeiture order from a Federal High Court in Abuja in respect of some properties allegedly belonging to Mungono but held in a proxy.\n\nIn her ruling, Justice Folashade Ogunbanjo granted an ex parte application for interim forfeiture of the assets and properties by the chairman of the EFCC, made on March 9.\n\nThe court ordered the publication of the interim forfeiture of the assets linked to a former Director of Finance in the Office of the NSA, Brigadier-General Jafaru Mohammed, and invited people \u201cwho may have interest in the assets and properties listed in the schedule to show cause, within 14 days of such publication, why a final order of forfeiture to the Federal Government of Nigeria of the said assets and properties should not be made.\u201d\n\nThe assets traced to the proxies and associates of the General include House on Plot 7, God\u2019s Own Estate, Road 1, Wamna District, Abuja; a fenced plot at No 1 Jubril Aminu Crescent, Katampe Extension, Abuja; plot at Kubwa Express, Directly opposite Abuja Model City Gate, Abuja; and a house on Block SD 22 House 2, Road 5, Kabusa Garden Estate, Abuja.\n\nOthers are No 15, 21 Crescent, 2nd Avenue, Gwarinpa Estate, Abuja; No 3 Liverpool Close, Sun City Estate, Abuja; No 52 Mainstreet, Sun City Estate, Abuja; and No 25 Osaka Street, Sun City Estate, Abuja.\n\nHowever, a security source had told SaharaReporters that Mohammed as the Director of Finance and Administration in the office of the NSA allegedly carried out many errands on behalf of Monguno.\n\n\u201cIt is not a secret that the NSA had a confidante in the Director of Finance, who used proxies on the instruction of his boss to acquire those properties. It was a very close-knitted deal in the sense that it would be difficult to trace any of these properties to them.\n\n\u201cBut with this move by the EFCC, it shows they might have some credible information at their disposal,\u201d the source had said.\n\nHe alleged that some top hierarchy in the Nigerian security architecture reported Monguno to President Buhari over the way he and Mohammed fleeced the coffers of the ONSA.\n\nThe source said, \u201cThe NSA is very skilled in presenting the holier-than-thou attitude in the public. But in truth, I think the rot in the ONSA under him is worse than that of Sambo Dasuki (ex-NSA boss). Monies were spirited out recklessly, and this prompted the military hierarchy then as it was to effect some changes in the ONSA.\n\n\u201cThis saw to the transfer of several officers including the Director of Finance, Brigadier-General Jafaru Mohammed; the Special Assistant to the NSA, Colonel AA Ibrahim and the Director Legal Intercept, SS Shehu by the army hierarchy sometime in 2020 as a means to bring sanity into the ONSA which was excessively abused.\u201d\n\nAnother top security source further corroborated this position when he stated that the NSA and his former Director of Finance and Administration indeed committed some infractions that went unnoticed by the EFCC under Ibrahim Magu.\n\n\u201cI am aware that this was one of the things that worked against the confirmation of Ibrahim Magu as the EFCC Chairman because the Department of State Services got wind of the dealings and subsequently made sweeping arrest that were at some point toned down because of the issues it would generate in the public,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cThis new development is therefore not surprising as most of us saw it coming with the way and manner the NSA and the director of finance and administration almost ran down the ONSA. I can assure you that those properties would be forfeited to the federal government as none of them would come forward to claim ownership.\n\n\u201cThe NSA was cut to size when he attempted to get approval for arms purchase from third party sources against the government directive of the country-to-country transaction in arms purchase. This deal was leaked by one of the former service chiefs who ensured that the president was briefed and the NSA was subsequently rebuked. Since then, there has been no love lost between them and the NSA, who uses any opportunity to launch scathing attacks on the tenure of the former service chiefs.\u201d\n\nAn EFCC source told SaharaReporters that preliminary investigations revealed that the properties were held in proxy for Monguno.\n\n\u201cThose properties were acquired by the former Director of Finance and Administration in the ONSA acting on instruction from Monguno. We were able to trace the deal and all those whose names were used on behalf of the NSA.\n\n\u201cThere is every likelihood that the court would eventually grant a final forfeiture to the federal government, which would indeed be a welcome development,\u201d the source said.",

          "text": "Yahaya was recently chosen by President Muhammadu Buhari to replace former COAS, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, who died in a plane crash in Kaduna.\n\nIn his statement, Benson, who spoke on behalf of the committees, also charged Yahaya with creating a virulent army that would be results-oriented.\n\n\u201cThis exercise comes at a very tough period in the history of our dear country, Nigeria,\u201d he remarked, assuring the army of the House of Representatives\u2019 continuing support.\n\n\u201cOur nation has been besieged by several security issues across all the geo-political zones with banditry, militancy and self-secessionists stretching our military to the extreme.\n\n\u201cThe worst is the lingering insurgency in the North-East. This war has cost the country a lot both financially and in terms of human lives. This must stop.\n\n\u201cThe Armed Forces of Nigeria needs to adopt innovative measures to curb the killings and wanton destruction of property as a result of these cases of insecurity. I therefore, hope that, if confirmed, the new Chief of Army Staff will do everything possible, working with other service chiefs, to bring this to an end.\n\n\u201cYou will agree with me that Nigeria deserves a re-invigorated Armed Forces that is robust, well-trained, adequately equipped, efficient and fully motivated to protect Nigerians from the devastating effects of terrorism and other security challenges in the country.\n\n\u201cThis screening exercise comes at the heels of Nigeria\u2019s twenty-two years of uninterrupted democratic experience. I must say that the relationship between the National Assembly and Armed Forces of Nigeria has progressively improved as the parliament continues to exercise the necessary democratic oversight of the defence sector.\n\n\u201cLet me reiterate the firm resolve of the 9th House of Representatives, ably led by the Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila and particularly, the Committees on Defence and that of Army\u2019s pledge to continually ensure a secure, peaceful and prosperous country for all Nigerians. We will therefore continue to work with the Armed Forces of Nigeria to achieve this.\n\n\u201cLet me assure you that the Joint Committees on Defence and Army will be thorough, transparent and sincere in the conduct of this screening.\n\n\u201cWe owe this to Nigerians as their representatives. Consequently, we seek your cooperation as we embark on this constitutional legislative process\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks, the Minister of Defence, Bashiru Magashi, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, expressed optimism that the House would find the army chief worthy of confirmation.\n\nAsked to introduce himself and defend his appointment, Yahaya, who chronicled his military exploits since his sojourn in the Nigeria Army 36 years ago, said he was fit for the job and will deliver.\n\nHe said: \u201cI joined the Navy 36 years ago. So, I brought along with me 36 years of military experience. I\u2019m abreast with the security requirements of Abuja, and so on.\n\n\u201cI was involved in several security operations. The challenges we are facing now, all are characterized by these areas I mentioned where I have first hand information and have commanded troops and I administered them in achieving what we\u2019ve done.\n\n\u201cI believe I have the requisite requirements by the grace of God to now provide my services in this office of the chief of Army Staff if confirmed. What I brought is wealth of experience and commitment. So, I\u2019m committed and determined to provide my best and also having known what\u2019s required to achieve results.\n\n\u201cSecurity is everybody business. The job cannot be done by one person. So we need all the support. And with the support of the people will win our fight against insecurity.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on lack of synergy among the hierarchy of army, navy, air force and other security agencies in the theatre of war posed by the chairman Committee, Namdas, Yahaya said there was perfect understanding, interaction and cooperation within them.\n\nNamdas had attributed their inability to win the war in north east to the lack of cooperation amongst the various security institutions.\n\nBut the army chief said he enjoyed a robust relationship with the other service chiefs who he said were well known to him even at the academy.\n\nHe, however, called for the cooperation of all Nigerians at various levels to enable him succeed.\n\n\u201cFrom experience, this job can not be done by any single service or entity. Indeed, in the Army, the Army itself is a group work not individual that\u2019s why we arranged in sections and companies and battalions and brigades.\n\n\u201cThis job is collective and as it was captured in the vision of the late Chief of Army Staff and in my own Mission too, there was also mentioned of joint environment in what we do, having realized that this job is not one service job.\n\n\u201cNot only that, it also requires other agencies, services and stakeholders. We have always operated together that is why you see composition, Army, Navy, Airforce are there and now including the Police, DSS, Civil Defense.\n\n\u201cAt the Army headquarters level, all the Service Chiefs now, we are all mates at the Academy. At one time or the other all of us work together. So, the synergy can\u2019t be anything better now that we\u2019re brought up together, we have trained together.\n\n\u201cAs we know, internal security is intelligence driven operation. So, we need others including communities, including traditional rulers and all others who can provide information. We work together,\u201d Yahaya said.",

          "title": "Niger gov\u2019s angst on 150 kid-captives: Bandits\u2019 informants in my government",
          "text": "Politicians within government corridors have been releasing strategic planning to bandits as informants in order to make money, Governor Abubakar Sani-Bello of Niger state has said.\n\nGovernor Sani-Bello stated this Tuesday when he commissioned 161 Special Vigilante Corps established to curb youth restiveness and street fighting in Minna.\n\n\u201cThere are politicians and others in government corridors who give out information to these criminals. Even when we hold meetings, few moments later, the bandits will be saying the governor has said this and that. I cannot trust anybody anymore,\u201d the governor declared.\n\nHe expressed concern that some people were eager to make money while children within ages three and 11years were in captivity.\n\n\u201cThey said I should bring money so that they can bring the children and I asked them, \u2018where will they find the children\u2019,\u201d the governor said.\n\nThe governor also decried media reportage which bandits got to know classified information about government actions, saying \u201cyou may think that the bandits are illiterates but they are very intelligent in processing information.\u201d\n\nDonating 10 operational vehicles and 20 motorcycles to the Special Vigilantes Corps, Governor Sani-Bello implored them to clear the miscreants that had disturbed residents of Minna for months.\n\nHe said unlike their counterparts in bandits-affected areas, the corps was not trained to engage in exchange of fire. \u201cThey are for now restricted to Minna by working with the police to identify and arrest the boys causing crisis in our streets, destroying property and injuring passers-by,\u201d the governor said.\n\nPresenting the special vigilantes, the state Commissioner of Police, Adamu Usman explained that the creation of the corps became necessary in order to keep peace in Minna while conventional security agencies fight bandits in other parts of the state.\n\nHe said the vigilantes had undergone two-week training and ready to work with police in curbing activities of street urchins in Minna.\n\nThe police boss assured that the vehicles and motorcycles donated by government would be judiciously used.\n\nGodogodo community cries out\n\nIn a related development, the people of Godogodo community in Jema\u2019a local government area of Kaduna state have expressed concern over the increasing security challenges bedevilling the area, and leading to loss of several lives and property.\n\nThey alleged that suspected herdsmen have killed many innocent people, including the head of vigilante group, Frank Zakiri, in Godogodo village.\n\nZakiri was known for leading other vigilantes in protecting his community and environs against invaders that killed and destroyed properties.\n\nThe increasing spate of killings in the area has caused fear among the people who could not sleep with their two eyes closed for fear of the unknown.\n\nA source who craved anonymity explained that the Chief of Godogodo, Iliya Ajiya, received the killing of the head of the vigilante with great shock, assuring the villagers would continue to fight against invaders for the protection of their community.\n\nHe said as a community, they had resolved, irrespective of any differences, to continue to protect one another against what he called \u201cenemies of progress especially during the rainy season when majority of the people who are peasant farmers will go out every day to farm for their survival.\u201d\n\nThe chief called on government at all levels to ensure proactive measures were taken to checkmate the activities of criminal elements in the society in order to allow people go about their lawful activities for a peaceful and harmonious society.\n\nResident want additional troops\n\nMeanwhile, a resident of Gwashi village in Bukkuyum local government area of Zamfara state, Yusha\u2019u Mohammed Gwashi, has appealed to the federal government to urgently deploy additional 200 troops to their area to fight the bandits terrorising their area.\n\nGwashi made the plea Tuesday in a telephone interview with Blueprint in Gusau, the state capital.\n\nHe said the bandits, in their large numbers, besieged their area between Sunday and Monday with sophisticated weapons on their way to Birnin Gwari Forest, and killed three locals while many others scampered for their safety.\n\nHe expressed worry that the bandits could warn them not to their farms as they threatened to kill anyone who acted contrary to the order.\n\n\u201cThe troops attached to our area are not up to one unit and the bandits use to come in their hundreds with heavy fire arms more than that of the troops, so we need more additional reinforcement of the troops to forestall insecurity challenges we are facing to bandits attacks on daily basis,\u201d Gwashi further pleaded.\n\nGwashi further hinted that as a result of Banditry in their area, many women and their childrens have left the area in fear of the Bandits attack, calling on federal and Zamfara state governments to take urgent steps in tackling the trend.\n\nGovernor Bello Mohammed Matawalle had last week, directed communities across the state to go on self-defence whenever bandits strike.\n\nFurther to this and other measures taken to halt banditry, the governor also suspended the Emir of Dansadau Alhaji Hussaini Umar and District Head of Nasarawa Mailayi Alhaji Bello Wakkala and the Emir of Zurmi,Alhaji Abubakar Atiku Muhammad for allegedly aiding and abetting the criminals in their jurisdictions.\n\nLawmaker pledges grazing field\n\nIn a related development, a lawmaker representing Zamfara North, Senator Sahabi Ya\u2019u, has promised to construct grazing grounds for herders in his constituency to complement government efforts at tackling insecurity in the state.\n\nSenator Ya\u2019u, who made this known while speaking to journalists in Gusau Tuesday, said the project would be established on grazing routes in the state.\n\nThe senator blamed alleged injustice meted out to the herders for the security challenges in the state, which he noted began with cattle rustling before degenerating to banditry.\n\n\u201cI think this (project) is in line with what Governor Bello Matawalle is doing to provide `RUGA\u2019 settlement for the herders.\n\n\u201cThis year (2021), part of my constituency projects, I intend to provide grazing grounds for herders so that they can be contained in one place.\n\n\u201cAfter identifying the location, securing it, we are going to plant the grass that will be harvested into belts for use every season of the year,\u201d he said.\n\nSenator Ya\u2019u said tackling insecurity is a collective responsibility, adding \u201cat the National Assembly level, we are doing our best to address the insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cThe insecurity we are facing is very disturbing. We have realised that we are in danger; it requires collaborative effort to address it. Everyone\u2019s support and contribution is needed not only state or federal government.\u201d",

This is because everyone can do it.

You took the oath of office to protect lives and property,\u201d he at the inauguration of the 21km Odufor-Umuoye Road in Etche Local Government Area of Rivers State.\n\nThe Governor added \u201cLet me also tell Mr President, he has said that security issues are left to the states; haba nau, President no be so (that is not true).\n\n\u201cThe Constitution did not say that. Who is the Commander-in-Chief? I am not the Commander-in-Chief; Mr President, you are the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u2018Be In Charge\u2019\n\nAccording to him, only the President has the power to appoint the heads of various security agencies such as the police, Nigerian Army, Nigerian Navy, Nigerian Air Force, Department of State Services (DSS), among others.\n\nGovernor Wike decried that the situation was so bad that governors could not give directives to commissioners of police in their states without the approval of the Inspector-General of Police appointed by the President.\n\n\u201cAllow us to pick who will be in charge; then you will see whether it will be the same thing because they (the security chiefs) cannot act until they take powers from you; we cannot tell them what to do.\n\n\u201cSo, why are we shifting the goalpost when the match is almost completed? It is not good.

Let me begin by congratulating the Chairman and Board Members on this unique opportunity to make further contributions to the progress and development of our dear country. I am also delighted at the re-appointment of the Chairman of the immediate past Board, Ambassador Fatima Balla Abubakar, along with most of its members into the new Board in the same capacities. Indeed, this is an eloquent testimony to the confidence of His Excellency, Mr. President in your performance.\n\n2. Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to reaffirm the full commitment of the Federal Government to the success of NYSC\u2019s mandate. There is no gainsaying the fact that the Scheme has made enormous contributions to the promotion of national unity and integration as well as the acceleration of development in various spheres, including education, health, infrastructural development, sports and social services, amongst others. NYSC, therefore, remains a great source of pride to the Government and the entire people of our dear country. Without doubt, all well-meaning Nigerians strongly recognize the continued relevance of the Scheme, especially at this critical period of our national life.\n\n3. The inauguration of this Board is taking place at a time when all hands must be on deck to further strengthen the Scheme. This underscores the enormity of the task before you. It is pleasing to note that the Chairman and members, who were in the immediate past Board, are adequately informed about the objectives, programmes, achievements and challenges of the Scheme. It is my ardent hope that you will work collectively to build on the successes made by the former Board. In particular, I charge both the returning and new members to continue to get acquainted with the provisions of the NYSC Act, especially as they relate to the roles and responsibilities of major stakeholders, including the Board.\n\n4. Distinguished Chairman and Board Members, I wish to use this unique occasion to once again affirm the satisfaction of the Federal Government with the achievements of the present Management of NYSC, which has enhanced the visibility of the Scheme. Accordingly, I commend the Director-General, the Management team, Staff and Corps members, whose collective efforts resulted in the successes recorded. I expect that members of the Board will deploy the political influence at their disposal to strengthen all levels of engagements aimed at sustaining the legacies of the scheme through continuous engagement with policy makers at various levels.\n\n5. I also commend the excellent synergy between the immediate past Board and the Management, which contributed to the remarkable achievements recently made by the Scheme. I wish to stress the need for the new Board to sustain the harmonious working relationship in line with the expectation of Mr. President. For emphasis, all your actions must be guided by extant regulations. At all times, your major pre-occupation should be the success of NYSC and, by extension, the success of this Administration.\n\n6. I am confident that you will work together to come up with initiatives that will make the Scheme even more impactful and increasingly endearing to all Nigerians. However, it is important to highlight the following guidelines as they affect roles, responsibilities and privileges of Members of the Governing Board as follows:\n\ni. The Board shall set up operational and administrative policies in accordance with Government policy directives and supervise the implementation of such policies;\n\nii. The Board shall not be involved directly in the day-to-day management of the Scheme;\n\niii. The Board must only operate on part-time basis in accordance with extant rules that forbids allocation of official quarters to Members on a permanent basis and use of official vehicles by Members on a permanent basis;\n\niv. Estacode allowances are only for overseas travels approved by the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and the Supervising Ministry;\n\nv. No Member of the Board shall be allowed to retain official vehicle for use on a permanent basis;\n\nvi. On the other hand, the core functions of the Chief Executive Officer include the day-to-day administration of the NYSC.\n\nFurthermore, the Board shall perform the following oversight responsibilities:\n\ni. Ensure that long-term interest of the Federal Government of Nigeria is served;\n\nii. Work with the Management to determine the Scheme\u2019s mission and long term strategy;\n\niii. Promote sustainable and cost-efficient activities of the NYSC;\n\niv. Establish and promote the objectives and integrity of the Scheme;\n\nv. Monitor the performance of the Management in achieving set objectives of the Scheme; and\n\nvi. Request appropriate reports from Management.\n\n7. I consider it appropriate to use this forum to once again endorse the proposal made by stakeholders for the establishment of the National Youth Service Corps Trust Fund. I am confident that such an initiative will go a long way in strengthening the Scheme and deepen its impact. Among other benefits, the Fund will make the NYSC Skill Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development programme more functional. It will, especially, serve as a sustainable source of providing start-up capital for the trained Corps members to actualize their business plans and in turn employ more Nigerians. Therefore, I appeal to all and sundry to support the actualization of the proposal. The NYSC Scheme will be sustained. It has become an integral part of our national development and unity architecture. Nigerian youth continue to benefit from this scheme. As a sign of the Federal Government\u2019s unflinching commitment to the NYSC, President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the automatic employment of 10 direct siblings of the diseased NYSC members, who lost their lives during the 2011 post-election violence in Bauchi State.\n\nMr. President also approved appropriate scholarships to the four children of Mr. Adowei Elliot.\n\n8. In conclusion, I wish to reaffirm the unflinching support of His Excellency, Mr. President, and the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development for both the National Governing Board and Management of the NYSC towards the continued success of the Scheme.\n\n9. I now have the pleasure to formally inaugurate the NYSC National Governing Board. Once again, I congratulate you and, as you set out to discharge this important national assignment, I pray the Almighty God to guide you at all times.\n\n10. Thank you and God bless",

A9, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision of the respondents to suspend Twitter has gravely infringed on my freedom of expression and that of broadcast stations and other Nigerian citizens who depend and rely daily on Twitter for information, expression and impartation of ideas. This has caused me emotional trauma and distress and limited my capacity to connect with the global community.\u201d\n\n.Mr Mohammed had, on June 4, announced a ban on the operations of the microblogging platform, Twitter, in Nigeria.\n\nHe also disclosed that the federal government had ordered the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to \u201cimmediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nthe AGF, Mr, Malami, also directed the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation (DPPF) in his office, \u201cto swing into action and commence, in earnest, the process of prosecution of violators of the Federal Government De-activation of operations of Twitter in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOwing to the ban, Nigerians have been denied access to Twitter and can only access by bypassing domain restrictions through alternative platforms\n\nThe suspension followed Twitter\u2019s deletion of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s controversial tweet about the civil war after some Nigerian users flagged it.\n\nThe government, in its response, accused the platform of bias against President Buhari and undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence. It also added that the ban is temporary and an attempt to curb fake news and Twitter\u2019s alleged roles in fueling activities that threaten Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.",

          "title": "Face to Face: Biden, Putin Ready for Long-anticipated Summit",
          "text": "President Joe Biden and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin sit down Wednesday for their highly anticipated summit in the Swiss city of Geneva, a moment of high-stakes diplomacy at a time when both leaders agree that U.S.-Russian relations are at an all-time low.\n\nFor four months, the two leaders have traded sharp rhetoric. Biden repeatedly called out Putin for malicious cyberattacks by Russian-based hackers on U.S. interests, a disregard for democracy with the jailing of Russia\u2019s foremost opposition leader and interference in American elections.\n\nPutin, for his part, has reacted with whatabout-isms and obfuscations \u2014 pointing to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol to argue that the U.S. has no business lecturing on democratic norms and insisting that the Russian government hasn\u2019t been involved in any election interference or cyberattacks despite U.S. intelligence showing otherwise.\n\nNow, the pair will meet for their first face-to-face as leaders \u2014 a conversation that is expected to last four to five hours. In advance, both sides set out to lower expectations.\n\nEven so, Biden has said it would be an important step if the United States and Russia were able to ultimately find \u201cstability and predictability\u201d in their relationship, a seemingly modest goal from the president for dealing with the person he sees as one of America\u2019s fiercest adversaries.\n\n\u201cWe should decide where it\u2019s in our mutual interest, in the interest of the world, to cooperate, and see if we can do that,\u201d Biden told reporters earlier this week. \u201cAnd the areas where we don\u2019t agree, make it clear what the red lines are.\u201d\n\nArrangements for the meeting have been carefully choreographed and vigorously negotiated by both sides.\n\nBiden first floated the meeting in an April phone call in which he informed Putin that he would be expelling several Russian diplomats and imposing sanctions against dozens of people and companies, part of an effort to hold the Kremlin accountable for interference in last year\u2019s presidential election and the hacking of federal agencies.\n\nPutin and his entourage will arrive first at the summit site: Villa La Grange, a grand lakeside mansion set in Geneva\u2019s biggest park. Next come Biden and his team. Swiss President Guy Parmelin will greet the two leaders.\n\nThe three will spend a moment together in front of the cameras, but only Parmelin is expected to make remarks, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.\n\nBiden and Putin first will hold a relatively intimate meeting joined by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Each side will have a translator.\n\nThe meeting will then expand to include five senior aides on each side.\n\nAfter the meeting concludes, Putin is scheduled to hold a solo news conference, with Biden following suit. The White House opted against a joint news conference, deciding it did not want to appear to elevate Putin at a moment when the president is urging European allies to pressure Putin to cut out myriad provocations.\n\nBiden sees himself with few peers on foreign policy. He traveled the globe as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and was given difficult foreign policy assignments by President Barack Obama when Biden was vice president. His portfolio included messy spots like Iraq and Ukraine and weighing the mettle of China\u2019s Xi Jinping during his rise to power.\n\nHe has repeatedly said that he believes executing effective foreign policy comes from forming strong personal relations, and he has managed to find rapport with both the likes of Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom Biden has labeled an \u201cautocrat,\u201d and conventional politicians like Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau.\n\nBut with Putin, whom the president has said is a \u201ckiller\u201d and has \u201cno soul,\u201d Biden has long been wary. At the same time, he acknowledges that Putin, who remained the most powerful figure in Russian politics over the span of five U.S. presidents, is not without talent. Biden this week suggested that he is approaching his meeting with Putin carefully.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s bright. He\u2019s tough,\u201d Biden told reporters. \u201cAnd I have found that he is a \u2014 as they say\u2026a worthy adversary.\u201d\n\nThere are hopes of finding small areas of agreement.\n\nNo commitments have been made, but according to the senior administration official, there are hopes that both sides will return their ambassadors to their respective postings following the meeting. Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Anatoly Antonov, was recalled from Washington about three months ago after Biden called Putin a killer; U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan left Moscow almost two months ago, after Russia suggested he return to Washington for consultations.\n\nBoth ambassadors will be in Geneva during Wednesday\u2019s meeting.\n\nBiden administration officials say they think common ground can be found on arms control. International arms control groups are pressing the Russian and American leaders to start a push for new arms control by holding \u201cstrategic stability\u201d talks \u2014 a series of government-to-government discussions meant to sort through the many areas of disagreement and tension on the national security front.\n\nThe Biden team will press its concerns on cybersecurity. In recent months, Russia-based hackers have launched crippling attacks on a major U.S. oil pipeline and a Brazil-headquartered meat supplier that operates in the U.S.\n\nThe Russian side has said that the imprisonment of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is an internal political matter and one area where Putin won\u2019t engage Biden. But the senior Biden administration official said there \u201cis no issue that is off the table for the president,\u201d suggesting Navalny will come up.\n\nThe meeting is sure to invite comparisons with President Donald Trump\u2019s 2018 meeting with Putin in Helsinki, where the two leaders held a joint news conference and Trump sided with Russian denials when asked whether Moscow had meddled in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBiden has prepared for his one-on-one by reviewing materials and consulting with officials across government and with outside advisers. Aides said the level of preparation wasn\u2019t unusual. Biden, in a brief exchange with reporters upon arriving in Geneva on Tuesday night, sought to offer the impression that he wasn\u2019t sweating his big meeting.\n\n\u201cI am always ready,\u201d Biden said.",
