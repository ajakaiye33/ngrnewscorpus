          "text": "By Festus Ahon, ASABA\n\nUrhobo People Congress, UPC, Monday, said those opposed to the nomination and confirmation of Chief Bernard Okumagba as the Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC as enemies of the region.\n\nThe group which stated this in a statement while reacting to a media report credited to Itsekiri Interest Group, IIG, called on President Buhari to inaugurate the NDDC Board already screened and confirmed by the Nigerian Senate since November 2019.\n\nUPC in the statement issued by its President, Otobrise Efetabore, and Secretary, Ufuoma Akpofure, said: \u201cWe are aware of the provisions of the NDDC Act on the qualifications of persons for appointment into the Board, for which Chief Bernard Okumagba is fully qualified.\n\nAlso Read: 2023: Survival of APC lies with Nigerian youths \u2013 Gbajabiamila\n\n\u201cChief Bernard Okumagba hails paternally from Warri South Local Government Area of Delta State which is an oil-producing area and maternally from Udu Local Government Area of Delta State which is also an oil-producing area. The attempt by the IIG to mislead the public on the issue of the lineage of Chief Bernard Okumagba is vexatious, mischievous and highly provocative.\n\n\u201cThe NDDC Act in Part 1, Section 2 (1) B requires one to come from an oil-producing area. An area is a definite geographical space bound by its recognition in the constitution as administrative space. Thus, an area is a state, a local government area or a senatorial district. In the context of the NDDC act, an oil-producing area is coterminous with an oil-producing local government area. Both Warri South Local Government Area and Udu Local Government Area are Oil Producing Areas of Delta State.\n\n\u201cUrhobo Nation is a legitimate oil and gas producers in the Niger Delta and hosts to some of the biggest oil and gas facilities in the Niger Delta such as the Otorogun Gas Plant in Chief Bernard Okumagba\u2019s maternal homestead and thereby their lands and waters have been impacted by the operations of the oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cUdu kingdom where Chief Bernard Okumagba hails from maternally is a major Oil and Gas producing Local Government Area. Udu is host to OMLs 34, 65 and the Otorogun Gas plant, the biggest Gas plant in the whole of West Africa.\n\n\u201cThe Oil and Gas facilities are managed by Nigeria Petroleum Development Company, NPDC. Udu has been contributing hugely to the economy of this country without much to show for it in terms of infrastructural amenities. Presently the construction of the 3rd phase of the Mega gas plant in Udu land is ongoing.\n\n\u201cWhen President Muhammadu Buhari eventually nominated our son Chief Bernard Okumagba as Managing Director of the NDDC in October 2019, we did thank President Buhari and the National Assembly members for the subsequent confirmation of the Board members now awaiting swearing-in by President Buhari.\n\n\u201cWe wish to state here categorically that anyone from the Niger Delta region who goes against the generally accepted appointment of Chief Bernard Okumagba is an enemy of the Niger Delta region.\n\n\u201cWe do not want a resurgence of ethnic hate and disharmony in the Niger Delta which the Itsekiri Interest Group (IIG) seems to be promoting by its inaccurate, misleading, vexatious and provocative statement.\n\n\u201cChief Bernard Okumagba is known to all across Delta State and the Niger Delta as a detribalised person, a committed and patriotic Niger Deltan. Nobody can point to him as an ethnic jingoist or a discriminator. By his education, training, pedigree and origin, Chief Bernard Okumagba is eminently qualified to lead the NDDC whether as Chairman or Managing Director.\u201d\n\nRecall that Chief Bernard Okumagba was nominated by President Muhammadu Buhari as Managing Director of the NDDC in October 2019 and was subsequently screened by the various agencies of government including the Nigerian Senate, which confirmed him on November 5, 2019.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Anything outside the system is a fake drug. So, we are going electronic. We are going to ensure that, products that are not manufactured within licensed premises, imported by the licensed importer and those that have addictive properties are properly distributed through the distribution channel electronically.\u201d\n\n\u201cAside from codeine that we all know, there are other psychotropic substances that cannot just be dispensed over the counter because they have addictive tendencies. So, with this consultant cadre, more emphasis will be put on this to ensure these drugs are dispensed properly.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Nigeria\u2019s readiness to produce a Covid-19 vaccine, Mora said Nigeria has the capacity to produce a vaccine and efforts are ongoing. \u201cI am supposed to be attending a conference at Igbinedion University, Okada, Edo State, where I am a Professor and a member of the Igbinedion University Teaching Hospital, where we are having the first-ever conference towards developing African vaccine for COVID-19.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe consultancy cadre as approved by the Federal Government for the Fellows of the West African Postgraduate College of Pharmacists will bring about recognition of competencies, skills and expertise of these fellows to be deployed in the healthcare facilities. Before there was no recognition but now, with the recognition given by the Head of Service, the Fellows will now be recognized and remunerated as consultants.\u201d\n\nThe Registrar, Pharmacist Council of Nigeria, Dr Elijah Mohammed said with the coming of the cadre, they have to all work together. \u201cThe members of the team have to come together. The major challenge is that individuals have refused to recognize other. So with the consultancy cadre coming up, misinformation, misunderstanding is the major challenges we are going to face.

And we are fighting against that seriously\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe were fighting that Kemisola should not deliver in prison but she eventually delivered in prison, the noise was everywhere, so if we say we don\u2019t want the naming ceremony in the prison custody, it is still part of the agitation to get her released\u201d.\n\n\u201clt\u2019s not about negativity, when we talk about prominent people in the world, most of them have been to the prison. Is it Mandela or Buhari? Obasanjo or Yaradua?\n\n\u201cI am confidently telling you that the quest to release Kemisola from prison is not about any negativity because I know that the boy is already born great and people are eager to know the baby\u2019s name and they are ready to attach importance to the name.\n\n\u201cAm sure that he\u2019s coming up great. But I must assure you that Kemisola will not spend Eight Days in custody after delivery.\n\nBarrister Temokun expressed optimism that tomorrow, ( Tuesday) she would be granted bail because the naming ceremony is on Wednesday.\n\nProcedures has to be followed before bail is granted- State Govt\n\nIn a reaction, the state Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Titiloye, said the bail application for the defendant had a procedure that the court was following.\n\nTitiloye noted that \u201d There are procedures for all court matters, it was a court order that put the person in the custody and the court order has to be followed in securing her bail .

          "text": "\u2026Report to us any threat \u2013 Iwuayanwu\n\nBy Chinonso Alozie, Owerri\n\nThe Northern Cattle Dealers Association of Nigeria has blamed the Miyetii Allah, for the widespread violence perpetrated by suspected \u201ckiller herdsmen\u201d in Igboland and other regions of the country even as they called on the Federal government to screen the foreign Fulani entry into Nigeria from the Central Republic.\n\nThis was the position of the Cattle Dealers Association, Imo state chapter led by Ibrahim Salihi, when they paid a courtesy visit to the Chairman Elders Forum, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chief Emmanuel Iwuayanwu, in Owerri.\n\nAccording to them, the Miyetti Allah were the people who always intervene whenever this dangerous group of \u201ckiller herdsmen\u201d were arrested by security operatives either for destroying farmlands or other wicked activities, adding that after some days they would be freed.\n\nHowever, they also called on the Federal government as well as state governors to screen the entry of Fulanis from the Central Republic especially those of Lubwa, ethnic group.\n\nAlso Read: Flood: Kano to expend N80m on clearance of drainages\n\nAccording to Salihi, \u201cBanditry did not start today, it started during Abacha regime, we have herders who came into Nigeria From Central Africa. There is an ethnic group in the Fulani tribe that are carrying AK 47, and are the most wicked people.\n\n\u201cThe Miyetti Allah not helping matters they are allying with this group, for instance, if your farms are destroyed by this group the Miyetti Allah is supposed to intervene by asking the herders to pay compensation. But they are supporting this group who are doing this \u00e0nd carrying arms. The Miyetti Allah is encouraging these people to destroy farms.\n\n\u201cFor example, you have your farm and I have my own and I destroy your own instead of saying sorry for destroying my farms you say that I will pay you, and if you pay me today and you don\u2019t pay me tomorrow, I will be angry and I will cut your cow and from there the problem starts and they will invite their people from Niger to come and fight for them. Fulani man carrying guns is not a lie even us who are not with them they kill our cows.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cAnother problem is that the Federal Government is not doing enough, as they are not screening these people coming in from Central Africa into Nigeria. The Federal Government should check Fulanis coming into the country \u00e0nd even the state governments should do the same.\n\n\u201cOur reason for coming here is to appeal to Chief Iwuanyanwu, to intervene in the insecurity in the land and that our people from the North are calling us to come back to the North and that bandits are killing the northerners in the East.\u201d\n\nReacting, the Chairman Elders Forum of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chief Emmanuel Iwuayanwu, said: \u201cYou have the right to leave in any part of the country. It is also wrong for governments to watch bandits kill and burn police stations and I want to tell you that those who are killing in Igboland are not Igbos. They are criminals. Let me also tell you that the situation in Imo state is under control. The governor is doing his best to restore peace which we have seen in the past few weeks. Anytime you receive any threat report to us.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "One of the key manifestos of the All Progressives Congress, APC during the 2015 presidential election campaign was to restructure the country for absolute transformation, DAILY POST recalls.\n\nFollowing President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s victory at the poll, expectations were lofty as Nigerians patiently waited for the new political system promised at the campaign ground only to see gestures depicting otherwise.\n\nIn a bid to quell the quest, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige on September 6 2016, assured Nigerians that the president was still making efforts to deliver on his campaign promises particularly the restructuring of Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking with journalists in Awka, Anambra State, the Minister said the Buhari- led administration had already commenced the restructuring process starting with the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nHe said, \u201cNigerians have changed their way of doing things for the better and have become more prudent and judicious in their spending pattern.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one after the other. After economic restructuring to reposition the economy of this country, the Buhari administration will embark on the political restructuring and will set the modalities for the exercise.\u201d\n\nHowever, the president who has kept mum on the restructuring for years recently broke his silence and declared his stance against calls for the new political system.\n\nThe president on June 19 vowed that his administration will not restructure the country, stressing that those agitating for separation and canvassing for restructuring are naive and ignorant of war.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe other issue is that those who are currently calling for restructuring and conference on what they call ethnic nationality, If you go to Southern Kaduna, Taraba, who is to represent them? We have a different combination of ethnicity in many parts of the country. Even Kano and Kaduna Igbo have properties. The same goes for Yorubas.\n\n\u201cThere are Fulani in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. So those calling for whether separation or restructuring, some of them I will say they are very naive or even mischievously dangerous. Those agitating for restructuring are ignorant of war and its consequences. Because Nigeria is a dominant force in west Africa\u201d.\n\nThe president\u2019s declaration has continued to trigger reactions from concerned Nigerians as many took to their social media handle to lambast the president.\n\nA former presidential aide, Reno Omokri described Buhari\u2019s promise as an election scam stating that it was the promise that gave him the victory in 2015.\n\n\u201cIf a Nigerian youth makes a false promise of marriage to a woman and obtains money from her, the EFCC will arrest him for \u2018romance scam\u2019.\n\n\u201cYet, Buhari made false promises to restructure Nigeria and obtained votes from Nigerians based on that. Is that not an\u2018 election scam\u2019? The biggest issue General Buhari campaigned on in 2015 was restructuring. Now, he says he will NEVER restructure Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIs that not a scam? That is deceit. That is obtaining votes by false pretences. That is why the Southwest and Southeast are agitating for secession.\n\n\u201cMay Buhari not drive Nigeria to war! Twitter deleted his tweet and he banned them. What about all the promises he made that he has now deleted? Should we ban Buhari too\u201d.\n\nA respondent, Promise Emeka who spoke to DAILY POST in Abuja, said the president used restructuring to market himself during the election.\n\n\u201cThey knew very well that the Southeast and South-South belong to the People\u2019s Democratic Party, PDP so they used restructuring to deceive our leaders to win the election.\n\n\u201cSeven years after the election, we are yet to get the promise.

          "text": "From John Adams, Minna\n\nIn what looks like a collapse in negotiation between the Niger state government and armed Bandits for the release of the 136 abducted students of the Salihu Tanko Islamiya School in Tegina, Rafi Local Government Area of the State, the State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello has ordered a full scale rescue operation to free the children.\n\nAbout 1,000 security agents, drawn from the Army, the Police, Civil Defence, the local hunters and local vigilantes have been mobilized for the rescue operation.\n\nThis is coming almost three weeks after the abduction of the school children, and after series of negotiations between the parents and the bandits.\n\nAddressing the security agents in Kagara, Rafi Local Government Area of the State on Monday, the Governor said the rescue operation had become necessary because it is obvious that the bandits are not being sincere with the negotiation.\n\n\u201cThe abductors are not honest, they are not honourable. After agreeing with parents they started shifting goal post and now we are here to take action\u201d.\n\nThe governor pointed out that since the government has ruled out payment of ransom it was time to take a decisive action against the bandits.\n\n\u201cNow that we have ruled out payment of ransom, it is time for government to take decisive measures towards ending the bandits activities that is forcefully changing the lives of the people especially in the rural areas.\n\n\u201cWe have to try our possible best not make them succeed in forcing us to change our normal lives, they started by displacing farmers from their farmlands, next, they moved to burning farms, then moved to kidnappings and forcing us to close our schools, now they have started attacking Islamic schools, only God knows what is next.\n\nThe Governor disclosed that \u201cmost of these Bandits are from outside the country, they are hired to cause problems for us. It is not the habit of the true Fulani to indulge in this kind of act. These bandits are well organised and coordinated. We can not fold our arms anymore but to take decisive and necessary steps to apprehend those involved, both the informants and the bandits\u201d.\n\nThe Governor had earlier met with Parents of the 136 kidnapped students of the Islammiya School and other stakeholders at the palace of the Emir of Kagara, Alh. Ahmed Garba Gunna, where he commiserated with them and urged them to exercise patience as government is exploring all avenues to ensure the safe rescue of the children.\n\nWhile commending the security personnel for their efforts in fighting the bandits in the last few weeks, Governor Sani Bello revealed that logistics have been provided, adding that \u201cyour allowances and other financial benefits will always be provided as at when due\u201d.\n\nThe governor who expressed sadness over the killing of 20 Vigilante Corps Members by the bandits in Magama Local Government recently however called on the Federal government to collaborate with her neighboring countries, saying \u201cfrom all indications, these bandits are foreigners\u201d.\n\nThe Emir of Kagara, Alh.

And if you remember, he had to do an Executive Order 10 in consonance with the constitution, so that we have independence, financial autonomy for the judiciary and legislature in the states. And he was happy that at least the strikes had been called off.\u201d\n\nThe minister also said government was apprehensive over the looming industrial action in Kaduna as regards the face-off between the state government and Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), and that this formed part of the discussion with President Buhari.\n\nHe said this followed complaints by the leadership of the NLC that the Kaduna State government had refused to obey the terms of agreement reached between the two parties after the Federal Government, through the Minister of Labour and Employment, intervened to broker a truce in the industrial dispute between the two parties.",

          "text": "From Kenneth Udeh, Abuja\n\nAs Nigeria join the rest of the world to commemorate the International Father\u2019s Day, Senate Chief Whip and Senator representing Abia North senatorial district, Orji Uzor Kalu, has urged fathers to unite to surmount the nation\u2019s current economic and security challenges.\n\nDescribing fathers as soldiers of Christ, the former Abia State governor, admitted that though Nigeria is going through some problems, fathers in the nation have a pivotal role to play to overcome the problems.\n\nThe chief whip made this known in a goodwill message during a special Sunday Mass at Our Lady Queen of Nigeria Pro-Cathedral, Abuja to mark the Father\u2019s Day celebration.\n\nKalu tasked the nation\u2019s fathers to rise to the occasion of defending the Church and the nation at large.\n\nHe appreciated fathers\u2019 efforts at home in raising citizens for the larger society, adding that they also ensured needs of the family are provided.\n\n\u201cOur commitment as Nigerians and fathers shall never be in vain. I urge all fathers in the country to put their heads together in the best interest of our nation. As a nation, we are in pains as a result of the security challenges that we are passing through.\n\n\u201cFathers should stand up as soldiers of Christ and defend the Church and Nigeria at large. As fathers, we must continue to advocate peace and unity in diversity beginning from our homes,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ambience of the church was lightened up as Kalu donated over N2 million to the Catholic Men Organisation (CMO), Catholic Women Organisation and officiating Catholic priests.\n\nIn his response, Rev. Father Charles congratulated fathers and acknowledged that the roles of fathers in nation building cannot be over-emphasised.\n\nThe Catholic cleric also urged fathers to register with CMO and lamented the refusal of some fathers in the church to join the organisation. He outlined the numerous benefits of aligning with the forum, while urging unregistered fathers to join the association.\n\nEarlier, the church conferred an award of patrons of the CMO on Joe Ezie and Emmanuel Umoh.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThe National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has arrested a serving officer of a law enforcement agency, Popoola Abayomi for selling assorted illicit drugs to students of a Federal university and cultists in Ogun state.\n\nBefore he was finally arrested, Abayomi, had been on the watch list of the agency in connection with drug related offences.\n\nA statement by the director, Media and Advocacy, Mr Femi Babafemi ,said the drug dealer who serves in the Lagos state Command of the security agency, was arrested on Wednesday June14, after days of surveillance on his wife\u2019s shop used as his sales point in Camp area of Abeokuta.\n\nOne of his salesmen, a motorcycle rider, Ogah, was trailed to the location at about 8pm and arrested with six pinches of Colorado weighing 1.17grams before Popoola who has been on the Agency\u2019s watch list was nabbed with different illicit drugs including codeine -17 bottles; cannabis -22.26grams; tramadol 230 -98grams; 61 tablets of flunitrazepam -23.72grams; 113 tablets of molly -48.16grams and sex drops -43.92grams.\n\nAfter the arrest of the two suspects, some student union officials of the institution blocked the NDLEA team with their official vehicle.\n\nThe narcotic agents, however, restrained themselves and after hours of standoff succeeded in moving the suspects to custody.\n\nIn the same vein, Adelodun Kamaldeen has been arrested by operatives of the Oyo state Command of the Agency at General Area, Ilorin, Kwara State, following the interception of a parcel containing cocaine and heroin that weighed 10.5grams and 4.8grams respectively on 13th June.\n\nThe following day, two ladies; Mary Peter, 40, and Mercy Oladele, 39, were arrested at Total Garden, Ibadan when NDLEA operatives acting on a tip-off, intercepted their commercial micra car. The two women were arrested with seven bags of cannabis weighing 77.23kg brought in from Ogbese, Ondo State, to supply a man they simply identified as Alhaji. According to them, they had earlier supplied the same Alhaji two bags before coming with the seven bags they were caught with.\n\nOn Friday June 18, operatives of the Oyo state Command acting on intelligence also raided the residence of Alhaji Faruq, at Elebu area, Akala expressway, Oluyole LGA, Ibadan, where they recovered 43 ampoules of methylphenidate. In Kaduna state, a drug trafficker, Segun Abraham was arrested at Panteka area of the state on 17th June with 211.500kg of skunk heading to Kano state.\n\nMeanwhile, a Nigerian returning from Pakistan, Ezenyeche Kingsley Ebuka has been arrested by NDLEA operatives at the Murtala Muhammed International Airpirt, MMIA, Ikeja Lagos with five pellets of heroin weighing 250grams discovered in his anus. The suspect had arrived the \u2018D\u2019 arrival hall of the airport on 14th June on Turkish airline flight from Pakistan with the illicit drug inserted in his anus. He however failed to beat the eagle eyes of narcotic officers during inward clearance of passengers on the flight.\n\nWhile commending the Ogun, Oyo, Kaduna and the MMIA Commands of the Agency for sustaining the offensive action against illicit drug trafficking and the cartels running it, Gen. Marwa warned that the NDLEA will not spare any law enforcement agent hiding under the privilege of his uniform to engage in narcotic criminal business.\n\n\u201cThose who think they can sabotage ongoing efforts to rid Nigeria of the menace of illicit drug trafficking and abuse hiding behind the fa\u00e7ade of their uniforms should better think twice because they\u2019ll have NDLEA to contend with.\u201d",

          "text": "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs allegedly mismanaged $68 million (about N28 billion) released by the President Muhammadu Buhari administration in 2018 for disbursement to some of the country\u2019s foreign missions, SaharaReporters learnt.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt from a government\u2019s audit report that the Ministry\u2019s Permanent Secretary has now been asked to explain how the funds, allegedly misused, were disbursed to the missions.\n\nNigeria Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyeama\n\nThese are contained in the Annual Report of the Auditor-General of the Accounts of the Federation of Nigeria for the year ended, December 31, 2018.\n\nThe Auditor-General\u2019s report stated that when queries were sent to the ministry to explain the issues around how $68 million was disbursed, no responses were received.\n\nThe report reads, \u201cIssue 1 \u2013 Lack of accountability in the Disbursement of intervention fund for distressed missions - $68,875,902. Financial Regulations No. 415 states that \u201cThe Federal Government requires all officers responsible for expenditure to exercise due economy.

          "text": "In Hero Mode, all Troy wants is to work at Playfield, his mom\u2019s 12-year-old gaming company. But she insists he focus on a dull computer science course at school. The real reason, however, is that she wants him to have a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood away from video games.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Playfield is sinking. Their only potential angel investor bailed because their latest game sucked. A cheap buy offer from a rival is on the table.\n\nBut Troy convinces his mom to let him rebuild the game. He adds a rainbow that talks and a Barack Obama feature. And the rest is\u2026 actually, go watch the rest.\n\nReal life Troy stories are rare in Nigeria but an active gaming community is growing. Platforms like Twitch and Discord are spurring a global gaming economy and a means for financial independence for young Nigerians \u2013 like Olaide and Ying-Yi Akanji.\n\nThey met in 2012 at a GCE exam hall. When they started dating, Olaide introduced Ying-Yi (who is half-Nigerian, half-Taiwanese) to online gaming. Now married, they are an ardent gaming couple.\n\nWhile speaking with them on Tech Republic \u2013 a weekly radio show produced by 88.5 UFM Lagos in collaboration with TechCabal \u2013 I felt nudged to pick a controller and earn some recharge card money, at least. But how does a rusty Millennial get started?\n\nBelow is an excerpt of the chat with the Akanji\u2019s, edited for clarity. Most questions are from Tech Republic hosts Jay and Didi.\n\nJay: What\u2019s the situation with gaming in Nigeria?\n\nOlaide: I have been playing video games since I was a kid. My first Playstation 2 was from my dad. I became very good at gaming but I felt it couldn\u2019t take me anywhere because our 300kbps internet was so bad. Playing online was just impossible.\n\nThen I moved to the UK to study software engineering and everything was better. I dived into e-sports and built a following on Twitch. But I was not comfortable with a foreign audience. Gaming was more fun when I moved back. I could chat and banter on my streams in Pidgin and Yoruba.\n\nBut then came the issues \u2013 internet and electricity. It was demotivating to the point where I almost quit. The main problem was ping \u2013 a measure of how fast you get responses when you click to pass or shoot or any other action.\n\nOur problem here is that when you click on a button for any of those actions, it needs to travel to a server in Europe before it returns to Nigeria. And if you are playing against someone in Europe, their ping is much faster. I may shoot him first but it may not get to him when I do; then he shoots a second later and wins. That\u2019s why you have not seen Nigerians breakthrough internationally.\n\nDidi: Okay, how do I get into gaming? Can I start now even if I didn\u2019t play as a kid?\n\nOlaide: Yes you can! That\u2019s what I love about gaming. When people tell me they don\u2019t like video games, I say you haven\u2019t tried it out. There are so many games out there, it\u2019s impossible for you to hate them all.\n\nA 16-year-old kid won $3million playing Fortnite in 2019 and I actually played in that tournament. I made it into the top 1,000 from the initial 80 million people. The top 100 played in the finals in the US.\n\nBut that prize money shows how this sport has grown. I think the biggest prize money ever won in Nigeria was around \u20a65million.\n\nJay: This is really an untapped market in Nigeria\n\nOlaide: Oh my God, there\u2019s so much potential. I\u2019ve had many conversations with companies that want to get into online gaming but they fear the risks. And it\u2019s understandable because you need 24/7 electricity.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories about NEPA taking power in the middle of a tournament. It\u2019s painful. When we compete against South Africans, they win because their internet is better.\n\nStill, the Nigerian gaming community is growing.\n\nDidi: How many female gamers are in Nigeria?\n\nYing-Yi: We have quite a few, but the gaming scene is saturated with guys. Girls in Nigeria have less time to play video games because they are more likely to do house chores, while guys can keep playing. Women gamers have to put in more effort. That means we are not a lot but we are getting there.\n\nParents also need to understand that gaming helps to improve cognitive reasoning of both boys and girls. Yes it can be sedentary but parents can set the balance between gaming and other activities.\n\nAlexander: So how do you pitch online gaming to people in government, as something good for the digital economy?\n\nOlaide: People are investing in electronic sports (esports) because every competition provides a level playing field for amateur and expert gamers. No connections needed.\n\nAnybody can buy a console, start playing and competing. Gamers like TimTheTatman are terrible at gaming but make millions because they make entertaining gaming videos. That opportunity should be open to all Nigerian youth looking for jobs and alternative income streams.\n\n\u2014\n\nListen to Tech Republic every Thursday at 2pm WAT on 88.5 UFM Lagos. Brought to you in collaboration with TechCabal.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to avoid investment scams in Nigeria",
          "text": "\u201cDo you want to double your money in 10 days?\u201d\n\nInvestment scams tend to start off the same way.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a social media advert or a video of a celebrity telling you that an \u2018investment platform\u2019 made them millionaires overnight.\n\nThey all echo an alarming promise: \u201cgive us your money and we will give you more returns than you\u2019ve ever seen in the market \u2013 oh and did we mention your money is sure to come back to you?\u201d\n\nThese offers always seem too good to be true. And they usually are.\n\nOver the past few weeks, two different scams have been uncovered in Nigeria. Insha-Allahu Investment is the latest of them.\n\nWith a business name that roughly translates to \u2018If God Wills\u2019, the company\u2019s CEO is currently on the run after promising investors up to 20% Return on Investment (ROI) in two months. Many of the investors put in their life savings and in one case, their inheritance in a bid to multiply their money.\n\nInvestment is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It requires work. The work on your part as the investor is to perform due diligence and ensure your money is going to the right place.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that many more investment scams will continue to spring up. Days after Brisk Capital\u2019s CEO was arrested for fraud, a tweet featuring a popular celebrity made the rounds.\n\nThe power to become a millionaire is in your hands. Start your journey to become a millionaire today by Joining the great @mcivip known as Millionaire Club where you can invest and earn big.\n\n\n\nOfficial website: https://t.co/HMfsRY9aCspic.twitter.com/i0gqGXYzjJ \u2014 Instablog9ja (@instablog9ja) May 28, 2021\n\nIn it, the actor claimed that the company, Millionaires Club Investment, would give you 50% ROI (Return on Investment) in 3 days.\n\n\u201cOkay, but how?\u201d\n\nThis is a question that should follow every claim of returns. If a company tells you they plan to give you 30% of your money back in say, a month as Brisk Capital did, it\u2019s important to ask for details of how exactly they plan on making those returns.\n\nI spoke to Adedayo Bakare, COO of Money Africa and Oluwatomi Solanke, CEO of Trove Finance to get an idea of how to gauge if a deal is too good to be true.\n\nThey both agree that there is a relative benchmark to employ when discussing investments in the country \u2013 it\u2019s called the MPR (Monetary Policy Rate) \u2013 it\u2019s usually around the price of most of the government\u2019s debt instruments \u2013 like bonds and treasury bills.\n\nAs of March 2021, the MPR for Nigeria was 11.5% per year. To find out how much that is monthly, we just need to divide by 12 and we have roughly 0.96% per month.\n\nSo as a rule of thumb, if you have any \u2018investment platform\u2019 offering you significantly more than 0.96% ROI per month then you should proceed with caution. If they\u2019re offering less, then you shouldn\u2019t bother with them at all because you could get more by buying debt instruments directly from the government.\n\nInvestment is, by nature, risky. Legitimate investment platforms are usually keen to inform you of the risks involved when you\u2019re putting your money with them. If a person is promising you 30% monthly and telling you it is low-risk then they are already lying to you and you should not bother doing business with them.\n\nThis is the first step in finding out if an \u2018investment opportunity\u2019 is a scam \u2013 investigate their ROI claims and how they intend to turn them into a reality.\n\nIf a company tells you they are investing in the stock market \u2013 which admittedly can give you high returns \u2013 you must be aware of the risks. The market is volatile and can move up or down very quickly.\n\nIf they say they are investing in real estate then, as an investor, the onus is on you to ask questions about the real estate offerings. Are they selling land? Renting out buildings? How exactly are they able to make that much money from renting or selling land within a short time frame.\n\nIf you find that a company\u2019s explanation for the \u2018how?\u2019 is satisfactory, then you should go on to the next item on our checklist: Regulation.\n\n\u201cAnd you are licensed by\u2026?\u201d\n\nThis is probably one of the most essential checks you must perform before you hand over funds to an investment company.\n\nIt is not enough that a company is \u2018registered\u2019 as a business. Any street-smart hustler can register a business.\n\nAn investment platform you are considering must be either: registered with the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), or be affiliated with a company that is licensed by the SEC or the CBN.\n\nA company claiming to be a financial services company of any kind that has no connection to the SEC or CBN is one to approach with extreme caution.\n\nTo be extra sure, when a company tells you they are licensed with the SEC or gives you their affiliate company (or trustee), you can click here to confirm their eligibility.\n\n\u201cWho did you say you were again?\u201d\n\nContinue your due diligence by looking into the company\u2019s track record.\n\nIt is important to find out what credentials the owners or managers of these companies have. In the case of Dominic Joshua, a quick search would have raised some doubt about the veracity of a 21-year-old investment wunderkind with no real track record.\n\nThis step is especially important when you speak with referees or the company\u2019s brand ambassadors. You shouldn\u2019t put your money into a company just because a friend or family member told you it was great.\n\nYou should also check the company\u2019s track record and find out if fraud allegations have been levelled against its founders, senior leaders, or board members.\n\nPlatforms like ours, Nairaland and even Facebook have been around long enough to have picked up news on all kinds of scams and their perpetrators. It would be good to search for the names of those people and companies and see what comes up.\n\nFinally, making wise and well-informed investment decisions is a great idea but the journey to financial freedom is no walk in the park and requires careful research.\n\nSo the next time you or a loved one are faced with a new \u2018investment opportunity,\u2019 we recommend you share this article with them.\n\n*This is not investment advice\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Two unhealthy decades later\n\nOnly Rwanda, Botswana and Zambia have budgeted over 15% to health in the last two decades. In Nigeria, budget allocation for healthcare was 4.15% and 3.91% in 2017 and 2018 respectively, as data by TechCabal Insights shows.\n\n\n\nWith governments\u2019 poor performance, the burden of funding African healthcare has largely fallen on the shoulders of the private sector, which accounts for nearly 60% of financing. The continent relies on private providers for nearly 50% of its healthcare needs.\n\nEast and Southern Africa remain the regions most affected by HIV in the world. But as other diseases like Ebola and COVID-19 have shown, Africa\u2019s healthcare concerns are systemic, broad and in need of huge capital injection.\n\nAfrica has an estimated $66 billion-a-year health financing gap and in the absence of serious government efforts, donors and the private sector have come through.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the value of PE and VC investments in African healthcare increased from 3% to 16% of total investments in the continent, according to the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (AVCA).\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, 97 private equity and venture capital fund investments worth $1.3bn were made in health care in Africa. Most healthcare deals in that period happened in Nigeria (15%), Morocco (11%), Egypt (10%), South Africa (8%) and Ghana (8%). Boluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nHealth care, as an investment sector, can be narrowed down to a number of segments, according to the GICS classification system: Equipment & Supplies, Providers & Services, Technology, Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals, and Life Sciences Tools & Services.\n\nAnd health technology (healthtech) has received the most attention recently in Africa.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, AVCA estimates that healthtech accounted for 35% of health care investments in Africa. In 2020 alone, healthtech was the bright star too \u2013 gulping 45% of health care investments.\n\nOne of the more eye-catching healthcare companies is mPharma. The Ghana-based startup is now present in 7 other countries and has raised over $40 million. It became a crucial partner in the Ghanaian government\u2019s vaccine distribution strategy this year and is tipped as one of Africa\u2019s next big companies..\n\nOther breakout healthcare startups in Africa include LifeBank, Helium Health and 54Gene in Nigeria, Ilara Health in Kenya, and Healthlane in Cameroon. These startups are filling critical gaps in blood products logistics, genetics data and hospital management technology to improve service delivery. More are coming on board.\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nAs with mPharma, new innovative health startups are relying on VC funding to rise to popular consciousness. To close the $66bn-a-year gap, the PE and VC community will be expected to invest larger checks at a faster rate in more startups. COVID-19, while an unfortunate pandemic, has spurred a welcome boost in visibility for healthcare startups.\n\nBut tough questions will have to be asked of governments as well. Are they doing their bit, at least keeping to what they agreed to 20 years ago? The first quarter of the 21st Century has only four years before it ends.

          "text": "The Buhari administration has stepped up efforts to regulate the online media in Nigeria in what is seen by many as attempts to further stifle the civic space in the country.\n\nTwo weeks after blocking Twitter\u2019s operations, the federal government has asked the House of Representatives to enact a law that will empower the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to control all forms of internet broadcasting and social media.\n\nThe request was made on Wednesday by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, during a public hearing organised by the house committee on information, national orientation, ethics, and values on a bill to amend the NBC Act.\n\nThe commission already controls television and radio broadcasting in Nigeria, based on provisions in Section 2(b) of the NBC Act. It states that \u201cthe Commission shall have [the] responsibility of receiving, processing and considering applications for the establishment, ownership or operation of radio and television stations including cable television services, direct satellite broadcast and any other medium of broadcasting.\u201d\n\nLai Mohammed now wants the commission to also regulate the online media, in addition to other channels of broadcasting. \u201cI want to add here specifically that internet broadcasting and all online media should be included in this because we have a responsibility to monitor contents, including Twitter,\u201d the minister told lawmakers.\n\nBefore Lai Mohammed\u2019s proposal, the broadcasting regulator had asked all social media platforms and service providers in the online broadcasting space in Nigeria to apply for a broadcast licence.\n\nPossible clampdown on freedom of expression\n\nWidespread criticism has trailed the proposal by the Nigerian government, which has only further stoked concerns over a possible clampdown on free speech and internet freedom by the Buhari administration.\n\nMedia stakeholders at the public hearing kicked against the inclusion of online media under NBC\u2019s mandate, asking the panel to instead make the commission more independent of the Minister of Information.\n\nOver time, the NBC has acted as an extension of the Ministry of Information and Culture, which rarely acts independently, and thus, the commission\u2019s operations have often been subject to political interference. This was condemned by the International Press Centre (IPC) and the Centre for Media Law and Advocacy in a joint statement that called for the neutrality of the commission.\n\nAccording to Akin Akingbulu, executive director of the Institute for Media and Society, the commission should not receive directives from the information minister. \u201cThe power to give directives to the commission, vested in the minister of information in section 6 should be removed and replaced with powers which include policy formulation for the broadcasting sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial media bill through the backdoor\u201d\n\nDespite the ban on Twitter, Nigerians continue to use the platform thanks to virtual private networks (VPNs) that help bypass the suspension. Many have taken to Twitter to express criticism over the proposed regulation of online media.\n\nBREAKING: NBC Amendment Bill Is Social Media Bill Through The Backdoor \u2014 SERAP (@SERAPNigeria) June 17, 2021\n\nAmendment of the NBC act;grafting the shoot of autocracy. \u2014 Senator Shehu Sani (@ShehuSani) June 17, 2021\n\nNigeria Govt is asking House of Reps to amend the NBC Act and include \u201cinternet broadcasting\u201d.\n\n\n\nThat means all online radio/TV stations must register with NBC and Lai Mohammed.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Google has announced opening up three new programmes targeted at supporting African entrepreneurs \u2014 the 6th cohort of Google for Startups Accelerator (GFSA) Africa, $3 million Black Founders Fund (BFF) Africa, and Google.org-backed $3 million grants for female entrepreneurs.\n\nFollowing a rigorous selection process earlier in the year, 15 tech startups have been chosen across the continent to participate in the GFSA; and the three-month online mentorship programme will begin today, June 21, 2021. Notably, the first virtual class of Google for Startups Accelerator Africa was launched last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGFSA Cohort 6. Source: Supplied\n\nGFSA has graduated 67 startups from the past five cohorts \u2014 represented across 17 African countries \u2014 since it launched in 2018.\n\nCharles Murito, Google\u2019s Africa Policy and Government Relations Director, told Techpoint Africa that these startups are in turn accelerating the continent\u2019s economy, having collectively raised over $72 million in capital and provided 2,800 jobs after participating in the programme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Founders Fund (BFF) Africa\n\nSimultaneously, applications will be opened for the $3 million Black Founders Fund for African startups in their early stage. The programme will have 50 African startups, led by Black founders, receive cheques between $50k and $100k.\n\nHowever, it is non-dilutive equity-free funding, which means the startups do not have to give up part of their shares to Google following the financing. In addition, the startups will get $220k in Google ads grants and cloud credits alongside training sessions and access to Google\u2019s network of mentors.\n\nEligibility\n\nTo be eligible for this, interested businesses must be a tech startup headquartered in either Botswana, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, or Zimbabwe; have a founding team of at least one black founding member, and possess technical skills to use Google\u2019s resources.\n\nHead of Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, Onajite Emerhor, adds that, for inclusiveness, the fund is open to companies that are focused on supporting the black community, not only those led by black C-level founders.\n\nQualified startups can apply here as applications close on July 7, 2021.\n\nSME grants and support for 500 female entrepreneurs\n\nMeanwhile, another $3 million has been earmarked as SME grants. This fulfils the company\u2019s promise to open funding initiatives to small businesses that are not online. The $3 million funds will be used to provide mentorship, coaching, and access to key markets for 5,000 female entrepreneurs with low digital skills come from rural areas and currently operate in an informal sector.\n\nThis will also include seed capital in the form of cash grants and Google product support for 500 aspiring female entrepreneurs. Beneficiaries will be chosen from Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and select Francophone countries.\n\nFor two of the programmes, Google will be working with two African partners, with a thriving community of entrepreneurs, to disburse the funds \u2014 Co-Creation Hub (CcHUB) for BFF, while Tony Elumelu Foundation will be in charge of grants for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Google\u2019s 14 years of presence in Africa, it has at different times launched investments initiatives that are far-reaching into the continent, not only South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, and Ghana, where it has physical offices. It has reached more locations through partnerships with tech hubs and startup communities in other locations.\n\nApart from funding, Google has also been actively involved in empowering African talents with digital skills. During his visit to Nigeria in 2017, Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, disclosed plans to train 10 million Africans in digital skills by 2022.\n\nIn January 2020, Google launched the Google Developers Space in Lagos, the first of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 to serve as an incubation ground for innovators. In the meantime, the tech giant has ongoing projects addressing Africa\u2019s Internet access and connectivity challenges.",

          "text": "Today, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nA possible policy on intellectual property in Nigeria\n\nSexual violence and tech\n\nThe latest news on 5G deployment in Nigeria\n\nNigeria\u2019s intellectual property policy\n\nNigeria may get an intellectual property (IP) policy soon. This was revealed by Nosakhare Uwadiae, Managing Partner, Gee Law Firm, at a webinar organised by the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON) in collaboration with the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC).\n\nWhy should we care? Currently, Nigeria loses over $287 million to IP theft annually. This also affects foreign direct investment (FDI), research and development (R&D), innovation, and technology transfer.\n\nEssentially, as a result of Nigeria\u2019s weak lP policy regime, amongst several other factors, the country loses inflows from FDI. Of course, this is apart from the lack of domestic R&D, innovation, and technology transfer because of copyright and patent protection challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery year that Nigeria has failed to address its failing IP policy regime, the country loses much-needed economy-boosting FDI. Citing the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a PwC study says that the strength of a country\u2019s patent protection is positively correlated to FDI inflows.\n\nAnd for a developing country like Nigeria, a 1% increase in the strength of patent protection leads to nearly a 1% increase in domestic R&D. A similar increase in trademark and copyright protection corresponds with a 1.4% and 3.3% increase in domestic R&D, respectively.\n\nNo date yet: While we do not have a date yet, Uwadiae \u2014 one of the draftsmen working on the policy document \u2014 says the ongoing efforts will pay off this time around and will crystallise into a workable policy in the not too distant future.\n\nStill wondering why you should care? Check this out: Why the Nigerian tech ecosystem needs to take intellectual property rights more seriously.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, sexual violence, and tech\n\nIn recent times, sexual violence cases seem to be on the rise. According to the United Nations, COVID-19-induced lockdowns exposed vulnerable people to more risk of sexual violence in 2020.\n\nAn increased spate of reported official and unofficial cases led the Nigerian government to create a national database of sex offenders in 2019. Unfortunately, this was not enough, and an even worse increase during the pandemic led governors in all 36 states to declare a state of emergency on rape.\n\nThey also agreed to set up a sex offender register and sign laws to punish the crime.\n\nFast forward to May 2021, and Lagos State \u2014 one of the few with an active online sex offender register \u2014 disclosed that it had added 206 names to its list of sexual offenders between 2020 and 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOluwanifemi did a deep dive into the issue, highlighting the various ways tech and social media have helped combat sexual violence in Nigeria.\n\nRead: How tech tools create a safe space for sexual violence survivors in Nigeria\n\nMore on 5G deployment in Nigeria\n\nPhoto Credit: <a href=\u201dhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/[email protected]/49713123696/\u201d>Ivan Radic</a> Flickr via <a href=\u201dhttp://compfight.com\u201d>Compfight</a> <a href=\u201dhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\u201d>cc</a>\n\nIt appears 5G deployment in Nigeria is gaining even more traction. Umar Danbatta, Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) CEO, has inaugurated a committee on Spectrum auction for 5G deployment.\n\nThis comes after the Commission signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Nigerian Communications Satellite (NIGCOMSAT) Limited on the use of C-Band Spectrum for 5G services in Nigeria.\n\nThe C-Band Spectrum is a mid-range frequency set at 3.6 GHz-4.2 GHz touted as the most suitable and appropriate frequency for deploying the 5G network services.\n\nRecall that the Nigerian Senate approved deployment plans after an investigation conducted by the Senate Joint Committee on Communications, Science and Technology, ICT, and Cyber Crimes and Primary Healthcare, and Communicable Diseases.\n\nThe Committee\u2019s mandate is to develop the Information Memorandum for the auction of the 3.5 GHz spectrum band, which will be used for the early deployment of 5G services in Nigeria. It will also develop an award process for the grant of these licences.\n\nThe Information Memorandum defines the process that the Commission has decided to adopt for the auctioning of the C-Band Spectrum. It will provide information on the Nigerian telecommunications market, details of the Spectrum, the pre-qualification process, the auction process, and an indicative timetable.\n\nWhile it has taken a while to get to this stage \u2014 2019-2021 \u2014 this is certainly great news for Nigerians despite the controversies which have shrouded 5G deployment in the country.\n\nLast week on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nMicrosoft issues copyright takedown request over leaked Windows 11 build.

          "title": "Lagos overtakes Nairobi as home to most start-ups",
          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s busiest city with a massive consumer market has overtaken Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital as home and a top destination for the greatest number of start-ups in Africa. Over 500 active start-ups operate out of Lagos.\n\nRead Also: Kenya overtakes Nigeria as top destination for start-ups investment deals in 2020\n\nThe most populous city in Nigeria gained five spots in 2021 to attain a global ranking of 122nd (122nd in 2020) after switching places with Nairobi, which now ranks 136th, according to the Global Startup Ecosystem Index 2021 by StartupBlink that ranked 1,000 cities and 100 countries.\n\nThe large population of Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s commercial hub is one of the reasons for the rise in start-ups in the city.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising that Lagos is the top start-up hub in Africa,\u201d Andrew S Nevin, Partner/Chief Economist, PwC, Nigeria said.\n\nThis is because, according to Nevin, \u201cThere are big challenges to solve on a massive scale,\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s only solvable with innovation.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s top economic performer has one of Nigeria\u2019s highest urbanisation rates as more people arrive in search of opportunity, creating demand for accommodation, financial service products, roads, health care and electricity, amongst other things.\n\nAlthough Lagos is Nigeria\u2019s smallest by land area, the centre of excellence is Africa\u2019s largest, a densely-packed megalopolis that is home to an estimated 21 million people. Nigeria\u2019s most populous.\n\nOn its own, Nigeria\u2019s economic capital would rank as Africa\u2019s seventh-largest economy. Known for its traffic gridlock and entrepreneurial dynamism, Lagos alone is responsible for about 30 percent of Nigeria\u2019s gross domestic product. If Lagos was a country, its economy which is worth over $136-billion would not only be the seventh-largest in Africa, it would be ahead of Cote D\u2019Ivoire and Kenya.\n\nA breakdown of the report by StartupBlink, one of the world\u2019s most comprehensive startup ecosystem map and research centres revealed that Lagos was also ranked in the global top 50 cities for E-commerce & Retail Technology and in the global top 100 for both Transportation Technology and Education Technology, a natural by-product of the pandemic\u2019s digital acceleration.\n\nIbadan was another city that saw a massive increase in ranking, jumping 601 spots to 353rd globally and 2nd in Nigeria, surpassing the Nigerian capital of Abuja. The latter ranked 3rd nationally, fell 12 spots to 466th on the global ranking, while Port Harcourt decreased by 6 spots to 906th.\n\nThe newest Nigerian city in the rankings, Enugu, came out at the 978th spot globally and 5th nationally. Benin City increased 9 spots to 979th, while Kano jumped 14 spots to 981st. In total, Nigeria now has seven cities in the global top 1000 and continues to have the highest number of ranked cities of any African nation.\n\nAs a result, Nigeria reported one of the notable increases in Africa, it leapt 5 spots to now rank 63rd globally. It is the highest-ranking country in Western Africa and the 3rd highest-ranking country in Africa.\n\n\u201cNigeria has increased significantly, gaining 5 spots to rank 63rd globally. It is the highest-ranking country in Western Africa and the 3rd highest-ranking country in Africa,\u201d research analysts at StartupBlink, said.\n\nWithin Africa, the Global Startup Ecosystem Index 2021 showed that there were differences among sub-regions. Central Africa had no representation in the rankings; Eastern Africa grew from 4 to 6 countries in the global top 100. Northern Africa kept its three representatives in the global top 100, yet two of the three nations (Tunisia and Morocco) declined in rank.\n\nSouthern Africa had a good year; not only did South Africa join the global top 50 this year, but a second Southern African country (Namibia) joined the rankings.\n\nIt was a good year for Western Africa as all ranked countries (Nigeria, Ghana, and Cape Verde) improved their rankings.\n\nDespite nurturing unicorns like Jumia, an online shop for electronics, phones, and fashion, Nigeria, according to StartupBlink, faces some major challenges, such as a lack of financing options and even a lack of broadband internet infrastructure.\n\n\u201cGovernment entrepreneurship programs are present but need to be developed, as does legislation and public sector support,\u201d the report said.\n\nNigerian and Kenyan start-ups accounted for over 77 percent of the total investment attracted in 2020. Nigeria alone was estimated to have been backed by more than $600 million in venture capital funding in 2019.\n\nAccess to funding for many of the smaller start-ups in Africa\u2019s largest economy remains a key challenge that is crippling growth.",

          "title": "Match-fixing: Siasia gets FIFA life ban reduced to five years by CAS",
          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nA former Super Eagles player and coach, Samson Siasia, who was handed a life ban by the world football governing body FIFA over match-fixing allegations has had his punishment reduced to a five-year ban by the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS).\n\nThe reduction of Siasia\u2019s punishment was communicated via an official statement by CAS on Monday.\n\nAccording to CAS, a life ban for a first time offender who was also passive in the said offence was inappropriate though such acts need to be punished all the same to serve as a deterrent to others.\n\nOffence\n\nAs revealed by CAS, in 2010, a match-fixer tried to involve Siasia as a coach of a club under his strict instructions. With the promise of employment benefits, Siasia would have had to always field several players under the control of the match-fixer. The negotiations between the match-fixer and Siasia in relation to the conditions of employment were conducted by email over a period of two months.\n\nEventually, the club did not accept or could not afford Mr Siasia\u2019s requests and the negotiations ended.\n\nNew punishment\n\nOn this premise, the CAS Panel confirmed the Challenged Decision and reduced the punishment for the ex-Super Eagles star. \u201cMr Siasia is banned for 5 (five) years from taking part in any kind of football-related activity at national and international level (administrative, sports or any other) as of 16 August 2019,\u201d CAS said in its Monday statement.\n\nIt added: \u201cThe imposed fine of CHF 50,000 (fifty thousand Swiss Francs) on Mr Siasia is set aside.\n\n\u201cThe Panel determined the imposition of a life ban to be disproportionate for a first offence which was committed passively and which had not had an adverse or immediate effect on football stakeholders, and that a five-year ban would still achieve the envisaged aim of punishing the infringement committed by Mr Siasia.\u201d\n\nThe panel acknowledged the need for sanctions to be sufficiently high enough to eradicate bribery and especially match-fixing in football.\n\nHowever, the panel considered in the particular circumstances of this matter that it would be inappropriate and excessive to impose a financial sanction in addition to the five-year ban, since the ban sanction already incorporated a financial punishment in eliminating football as a source of revenue for Siasia, and considering that Siasia had not obtained any gain or pecuniary benefit from his unethical behaviour.\n\nCareer\n\nSiasia played 51 international matches for Nigeria, in which he scored 13 goals. He was part of the team that participated in the 1994 FIFA World Cup and won the 1994 African Nations Cup. He was also a member of the Nigerian team that won bronze at the 1992 African Nations Cup in Senegal and he played for the Super Eagles over a period of 11 years.\n\nIn 2005, Siasia coached the Under-20 team (Flying Eagles), taking them to the final of both the 2005 Under-20 World Cup and the U-20 African Youth Championship. He won the African Youth Championship and advanced all the way to the World Cup final \u2013 before losing to Argentina 2\u20131. He also assisted Augustine Eguavoen in coaching the national team.\n\nSamson Siasia was appointed national U-23 coach in January 2007. In 2008, he coached the Nigerian Under-23 Olympic squad to the final against Argentina; he also led Nigeria to a bronze medal finish at the Rio 2016 Olympics among other accomplishments as a manager.\n\nSiasia also coached the Nigerian national team, the Super Eagles, between February and August 2016.",

          "text": "By Abankula\n\nThe Anambra governorship ambition of Chukwuma Soludo, the former CBN governor, has run into troubled waters.\n\nThe deepening schism in his All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) may make INEC apply the Zamfara treatment, reports indicated.\n\nIn Zamfara, the All Progressives Congress, in the run-up to the 2019 elections, broke into factions and failed to hold legal primaries for all elective posts.\n\nINEC and the courts later stripped the party of the entire posts won, many by landslide.\n\nTwo days to the 23 June primary of APGA to pick its flag bearer, a faction led by Jude Okeke, said the exercise may be futile.\n\nHe said INEC might exclude the party from the governorship election slated for November 6.\n\nThe Publicity Secretary of the Okeke-led faction of the party, Ikechukwu Chukwunyere, gave reasons the disqualification may happen.\n\nIn a report by Punch, The group accused the Victor Oye-led faction of the party of alleged refusal to submit the statutory 21 days notice on the Special Ward Congress to the Commission.\n\nChukwunyere specifically said the Oye faction did not duly notify INEC on the plan to hold ward congresses ahead of the governorship poll within the 21 days recommended by its regulations and Section 85 of the Electoral Act.\n\nThe Publicity Secretary, who distributed copies of the INEC letter confirming the non-receipt of APGA\u2019s 21 days notification, said the Electoral umpire had communicated its position on the matter to the Okeke\u2019s faction in two separate letters.\n\nIn one of the letters, obtained by our correspondent, the commission addressed his position to the principal counsel of a law firm, Omas and Partners, who had earlier written and asked for the information while relying on the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe letter dated June 18, 2021 and signed by the Secretary to the Commission, Rose Oriaran-Anthony, read:\n\n\u201cThis is to inform you that the commission did not receive the statutory 21 days\u2019 notice for the nomination of APGA Anambra State governorship candidate from Victor Oye led APGA.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the commission did not monitor the said ward congress and as such, there is no monitoring report of the Commission.\u201d\n\nThe second letter, also signed by Oriaran-Anthony, and addressed to the National Chairman of APGA also read, \u201cPlease refer to your letter dated June 16, 2021 forwarding the list of delegates for the nomination of APGA\u2019s Governorship Candidate in the forthcoming Anambra State Governorship Election.\n\n\u201cThis is to notify you that the records of the Commission indicate that APGA did not duly notify the Commission of the date of the Congress where the ad hoc delegates were elected as required by Section 85 of the Electoral Act 2010 (As Amended)\n\n\u201cAccordingly the Commission is unable to confirm if the Ad hoc Delegates list submitted by your party is the outcome of a democratic process as required by Section 87(7) of the Electoral Act 2010 (As Amended).\n\n\u201cThe Commission wishes to emphasize the need for full compliance with all legal requirements for the conduct of Party Primaries as earlier communicated in the Commissions letter to your Party dated 7 June 2021 (REF: INEC/DEPM/UPPM/119/1/37).\u201d\n\nChukwunyere alleged that the two letters by INEC have therefore rendered APGA\u2019s governorship primary being proposed for Wednesday, June 23, as an exercise in futility because \u201cthe use of invalid delegate list will exclude the party from the election.\u201d\n\nChukwunyere further alleged that the Okeke faction remains the only option and hope for APGA to have a candidate in the Anambra Governorship Election since it had dully submitted all the notices.\n\nChukwunyere said, \u201cWe are aware of the position of INEC on this matter. As disheartening as it is, there is still hope for the party.\n\n\u201cAlthough the Oye faction had missed the issuance of statutory notice, all hope is not lost if the party backs the Okeke faction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is because the Okeke faction has served all valid notices for the APGA primary in Anambra. It is important to join hands with the faction now if the party must take part in the election,\u201d he added.\n\nProfessor Chukwuma Soludo, is a frontrunner to clinch the governorship ticket of APGA. He is from Anambra south, where it is believed, APGA may pick its candidate.\n\nSeven other aspirants are in the race against him.\n\nThey are Chukwuma Umeoji, Carter Umeh, Chief Damian Okoro, Chief Akachukwu Nwankpo, Okwudili Nwankwo and hankGod Kenechukwu Ibeh.\n\nThree of the aspirants are serving members of the Anambra State House of Assembly.",

          "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\n\nPresiding Bishop, Living Faith Church Worldwide, David Oyedepo has said Nigeria\u2019s economy will collapse if the investments of God\u2019s people are removed.\n\nHe spoke during a sermon on Sunday at the Church\u2019s Canaan Land in Ogun, Southwest Nigeria.\n\nOyedepo said in the 70s and early 80s, churches in Nigeria were in pitiable conditions, saying there were church buildings going on uncompleted for 20 years.\n\n\u201cYou know where the Church was in Nigeria, in the 70s, in the early 80s? It was a pitiable assembly of people. That painful proverb, \u201cas poor as Church rat\u201d, was a true description of the Church. You could have a Church building going on for 20 years.\n\n\u201cI saw one in my place. 20 years without completion. All the powerful ministries were renting shops and sheds, in fact they called us mushroom churches. You know mushroom grows today and disappears tomorrow.\n\n\u201cBut when that move came and people\u2019s hearts began to pant after God, the story of men began to change. Remove the products of revival from Nigeria economy\u2026, there is nothing remaining.\n\n\u201cLet me say this and I am saying this very boldly: The only thing remaining in Nigeria today are the investments of God\u2019s people. The only one! You know the other people are busy killing themselves. No plan, no purpose, no forward looking,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Oyedepo, \u201cCheck all the employment of labour today in this country, authentic, not manipulated stuff. They are believers. Those are products of a revival. Unleashing financial fortune to advance His Kingdom.\n\n\u201cThat is why your Church will be building rural churches and at the same time building the Ark and building every other thing that is coming around. Don\u2019t miss your place in this thing.\u201d\n\nOyedepo also said there are many financial giants rising in this Church and that they were not going to rise on the platform of expertise or skill but their heart for God.\n\nHe said if he got N100 billion today, he would not have any problem where to invest the money.\n\n\u201cSir, if I had a hundred billion now, I don\u2019t have any problem where to put it. I don\u2019t have any problem where to put it Sir.

There is actually no part of the country that has not been impacted positively in the areas of infrastructure, Agriculture and economic support initiatives based on peculiarities of the regions. What an area lacks in one aspect is compensated for in another.\n\n\u201cOn a final note, I implore you all to never despair, nor relent in our joint task of nation building. Remember, we have no other country but Nigeria. It is the responsibility of every one of us to work towards the development and advancement of this country.\n\n\u201cLet us cease the opportunity to put unpleasant experiences and controversies of the past behind us as we forge a better future for the APC and for our dear country, Nigeria\u201d, he stated.\n\nConvention, Congresses\n\nChairman of the CECPC and Yobe state Governor, Hon.

Buni also advised the party\u2019s youths never to allow themselves to be used by divisive elements.\n\n\u201cAs the most energetic segment of the population, retrogressive elements with evil interests in causing confusion, creating and fanning hate and disunity will always rely on you to achieve such negative and unpatriotic tendencies and to destroy your future. You must resist them. You should never allow yourselves to be used as tools in the hands of these treacherous elements\u201d, he charged.\n\n\u2018Isiewu\u2019, Nigeria\u2019s only industry\n\nIn his goodwill message to the occasion, former Governor of Imo state, Sen.

I traveled to China and I saw smokes everywhere, they were producing one thing or the other, but the only smoke you see here in Nigeria is that of \u2018Isiewu and peppersoup\u201d, Okorocha stated.\n\nEarlier, APC National Youth Leader, Barr. Ismaeel Ahmed, said the conference was organized based on the need to prepare the youths for more responsibilities.\n\nHe recalled how President Muhammadu Buhari consistently scored over 10 million votes in the three general elections he participated in since 1999 and urged the youths to translate their numerical strength into votes for the APC in the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cWe are going to deliver this party in the future, especially in 2023, 2027 and beyond.\u201d",

          "text": "The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Monday announced that it has reduced the life ban imposed on former Head Coach of Nigeria\u2019s Super Eagles, Samson Siasia to five years.\n\nWorld football governing body, FIFA, had slammed Siasia with life ban over alleged match fixing scandal.\n\nHowever, the Court ruled that Siasia was a first offender and it would be injustice to ban him for life even when he has not received any financial benefit from the deal that brought the punishment on him.\n\nThe judgement was delivered after CAS heard Siasia\u2019s appeal earlier.\n\nThe CAS said in a media release Monday afternoon that \u201cCAS has issued its decision in the appeal filed by the Nigerian football coach Samson Siasia against the decision rendered by the Adjudicatory Chamber of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) on 11 April 2019 (the Challenged Decision).\n\n\u201cIn such decision, Samson Siasia was found guilty of infringement of article 1 (bribery) of the 2009 FIFA Code of Ethics and sanctioned with a life ban from taking part in any kind of football-related activity at national and international level (administrative, sports or any other) and a fine of CHF 50,000 was imposed on him.\n\n\u201cIn 2010, a match fixer tried to involve Mr Siasia as a coach of a club under his strict instructions. With the promise of employment benefits, Mr Siasia would have had to always field several players under the control of the match fixer.\n\n\u201cThe negotiations between the match fixer and Mr Siasia in relation to the conditions of employment were conducted by email over a period of two months. \u201cEventually, the club did not accept or could not afford Mr Siasia\u2019s requests and the negotiations ended.\n\n\u201cThe CAS Panel confirmed the Challenged Decision, with the exception of the following elements:\n\n\u201cMr Siasia is banned for 5 (five) years from taking part in any kind of football-related activity at national and international level (administrative, sports or any other) as of 16 August 2019.\n\n\u201cThe imposed fine of CHF 50,000 (fifty thousand Swiss Francs) on Mr Siasia is set aside.\n\n\u201cThe Panel determined the imposition of a life ban to be disproportionate for a first offence which was committed passively and which had not had an adverse or immediate effect on football stakeholders, and that a five-year ban would still achieve the envisaged aim of punishing the infringement committed by Mr Siasia.\n\n\u201cThe Panel acknowledged the need for sanctions to be sufficiently high enough to eradicate bribery and especially match-fixing in football.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Panel considered in the particular circumstances of this matter that it would be inappropriate and excessive to impose a financial sanction in addition to the five-year ban, since the ban sanction already incorporated a financial punishment in eliminating football as a source of revenue for Mr Siasia, and considering that Mr Siasia had not obtained any gain or pecuniary benefit from his unethical behavior.\u201d",

          "text": "To stimulate rapid technological transformation of the country, the Federal Government has resolved to establish two additional Universities of Technology in Jigawa and Akwa Ibom States.\n\nThe federal government took the decision after a comprehensive review of the policy by key stakeholders in the education sector and also in fulfillment of the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s campgain promise to establish an apex National Institute of Technology, NIT, in Abuja with six satellite Universities of Technology, one in each geo-political zone of the country.\n\nThe Minister of Education, Malam Adamu Adamu disclosed this to journalists in a press briefing in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nAdamu said that the federal government would upgrade the four existing Universities of Technology located in Yola (North East), Akure (South West), Owerri (South East) and Minna (North Central).\n\nRepresented by the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Education, Arc. Sonny Echono, the Minister revealed that plans are underway to establish a National Institute of Technology,NIT, in Abuja.\n\nHe said the Institute shall be patterned after similar institutions in Singapore and Malaysia to serve essentially as a postgraduate centre devoted to research and innovation, drawing the best graduates from the six Universities of Technology, as well as other exceptional graduates from reputable universities within and outside Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to inform you that President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the phased development programme, compelled by our lean resources. Accordingly the 2nos new Universities of Technology will be established in 2021 while the upgrade of the existing 4nos Universities of Technology and the National Institute of Technology will come on stream next year.\n\n\u201cMr. President also observed from the report of the Presidential TaskForce on Covid-19 (now PSC) that the sudden outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic exposed the weak institutional capacity for disease control and surveillance in the country, particularly with respect to medical facilities, modern laboratory equipment, trained personnel and supporting infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWith the recent establishment of the only Federal Government owned University of Health Sciences, Otukpo in Benue State and the huge gap in Doctor-patient ratio as well as in medical research and production of pharmaceutical products, Government recognized the compelling need to establish two (2nos) other specialized universities in Health, Nutrition and Medical Sciences to be located at Azare, Bauchi State and Ila Orangun, Osun State. These shall lay a solid foundation for building national preparedness and resilience in anticipation of future challenges in the health sector while reducing medical tourism to countries like India, UAE, Egypt, Europe and the USA,\u201d he said.\n\nAdamu said president Buhari has approved a take-off grant of N4 Billion each for the Universities of Technology and N5Billion each for the Universities of Health Science from the funding Resources of Tetfund for early take-off.\n\nHe however disclosed that the Federal Ministry of Education will collaborate with the Federal Ministries of Health, Science and Technology, Communications and Digital Economy, the FCT Administration as well as other relevant agencies and Institutions to facilitate speedy actualization of these Legacy Projects of the Buhari Administration.",

The success of the exercise depends to a considerable extent on citizens\u2019 awareness through voter education. There will be new registrants, requests for intra-State and inter-State transfers as well as the replacement of voters\u2019 cards as provided by law. Furthermore, with the relocation of voting points to underserved areas as autonomous polling units, there is need for massive publicity so that citizens are familiar with their voting locations well ahead of all forthcoming elections. We appeal for your partnership to achieve this goal,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nThe CVR exercise which is scheduled to commence on 28 June 2021 with an online pre-registration for a period of three weeks, will subsequently take place in 2,673 designated centres nationwide and subsequently devolve to the INEC LGA/Area Council Offices based on assessment of security report.\n\nOn the attacks on INEC\u2019s offices and damages done to its facilities in recent times and the readiness for subsequent elections, the INEC boss maintained that the Commission is not sitting aloof, as it is putting heads together to do the needful at ensuring that the electorates are not disenfranchised.\n\nIn his own remarks, Chris Isiguzo, President Nigerian Union of Journalists, he expressed delight that the previous engagements of the Union with the Commission has come to fruition and that the process of digitizing the electoral process has just started and that it will pave way for credible electoral process devoid of rancour, hitches and other challenges that face the electoral process.\n\n\u201cWith the leadership in INEC now, things are getting better.\n\n\u201cI hope with the off-season elections in Ekiti and Osun States, things will keep on getting better.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any other country, therefore, we will all try to put in our best in deepening our democracy,\u201d Isiguzo added.",

          "text": "Five non-governmental organisations and four journalists have filed a suit against the Federal Government at the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice in Abuja.\n\nIn the suit filed on Monday, they asked the court to declare the indefinite suspension of Twitter in Nigeria a violation of their human rights under international law.\n\nThey also want the court to order the government to immediately rescind the suspension order and compensate them for the violation of their rights.\n\nThe NGO applicants are Media Rights Agenda (MRA), Paradigm Initiative (PIN), Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ), the International Press Centre (IPC), and Tap Initiative for Citizens Development (TICD), while the journalists are David Hundeyin, Samuel Ogundipe, Blessing Oladunjoye, and Nwakamri Apollo.\n\nThe suit, lodged with number ECW/CCJ/APP/29/21 ECW/CCJ/APP/29/21, in a 73-page documentation, was filed on their behalf by Abuja-based human rights and free expression lawyer, Mojirayo Nkanga, under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights (ACHPR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Revised ECOWAS Treaty, and the Nigerian Constitution, among others.\n\nThe applicants claimed that Nigeria\u2019s ongoing suspension of Twitter, which came into effect on or around June 4, violated their right to freedom of expression and interfered with the ability of the journalists to do their work.\n\nSimilarly, they alleged that the general situation in Nigeria with respect to human rights has created an environment where freedom of expression was stifled, stressing that it has contributed to creating a chilling effect on press and media freedom.\n\nAccording to them, Nigeria has consented to be bound by the obligation to respect and protect the right to freedom of expression under the ICCPR and the ACHPR and therefore, any limitation imposed by the government on the right to freedom of expression can only be justifiable where the restriction is provided by law, serves a legitimate aim, and is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society.\n\nContending that these three conditions must all be met before any restriction on the right to freedom of expression can be considered legitimate, the applicants noted that the suspension of Twitter was not provided by law, that there was no justification for it under Nigeria\u2019s domestic laws, and that it was done by the government in an arbitrary manner in circumstances where there was no public or judicial oversight, transparency or accountability.\n\nThey, therefore, asked the court to declare the indefinite suspension of Twitter a continuous violation of their human rights under international law, particularly the right to seek and receive information, as well as the right to express and disseminate opinions under Article 9(1) and (2) of the African Charter; Article 19(2) of the ICCPR and the rights of journalists under Article 66(2)(c) of the Revised ECOWAS Treaty.\n\nThey also sought a declaration that the government\u2019s directive, through the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), for the deactivation of Twitter accounts in Nigeria violated their human rights under international law and that the threat by the Attorney-General of the Federation to criminally prosecute anybody found to be using Twitter in Nigeria following the suspension of the platform also violated their human rights under international law.\n\nThey urged the court to issue orders mandating the government to immediately take all necessary measures to rescind the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria and to take all necessary measures to guarantee non-recurrence in order to prevent the same violation from occurring in the future.\n\nThey also want the court to compel the government to issue adequate reparations, including restitution, compensation, and measures of satisfaction to them to be specified and submitted to the court, as well as to issue an order of injunction restraining the government, its servants, and agents from imposing criminal sanctions on individuals, including the applicants, who use Twitter or any other social media service provider.\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

Customers who have been to or connected through Nigeria in the last 14 days are not permitted to board from any other point to the UAE,\u201d the directive continued.\n\nOn Saturday Emirates had announced a planned resumption of flights, five months after it banned outbound flights from Abuja and Lagos. This followed the withdrawal of the Rapid Antigen Test the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had insisted passengers from Nigeria travelling to Dubai must take four hours before boarding their flights.\n\nThe UAE antigen test requirement was against Nigeria\u2019s policy that passengers travelling out of the country should conduct Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test 72 hours before their flight.\n\nBut on Saturday, the UAE issued a statement conceding that Nigerian passengers that wished to travel to Dubai \u201cmust have received a negative test result for PCR test taken within 48 hours before departure.\u201d\n\nThe statement posted on Instagram by the Dubai media office had also said passengers travelling from Nigeria should present a negative PCR test certificate with a QR Code from labs approved by the Nigerian government. It stated that all passengers must undergo a PCR test on arrival in Dubai, adding, \u201cTransit passengers should comply with entry protocol of final destination.\u201d\n\nThe media office said the new regulation was part of measures aimed at easing inbound travel restrictions by Dubai\u2019s Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management. The committee introduced new entry protocols for passengers effective June 23.\n\nHowever, Emirates gave no reason for the new suspension imposed but only apologised to customers and advised on next steps to be taken.\n\n\u201cWe regret the inconvenience caused, and affected customers should contact their booking agent or Emirates call centre for rebooking. Emirates remains committed to Nigeria, and we look forward to resuming passenger services when conditions allow.\u201d",
