          "title": "Electoral bill takes front burner as National Assembly resumes Tuesday",
          "text": "The National Assembly is billed to resume plenary on Tuesday after Christmas and New Year break, with expectations from Nigerians on the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill and the 1999 Constitution Review.\n\nThe President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had vetoed the electoral bill over the restriction of political parties to direct primary, insisting on the direct, indirect and consensus options.\n\nBoth the Senate and the House of Representatives had suspended action on the bill till resumption on January 18, 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, a member of the House of Representatives from Plateau State, Dachung Bagos, has said more than 300 members of the legislative chamber across party lines are willing to override Buhari\u2019s veto on the electoral bill.\n\nBagos, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, in an interview with our correspondent, noted that the proposed vetoing of the President, which reportedly garnered signatures from over 75 of the 109 members of the Senate, would have also succeeded in the House.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that if we were given that opportunity to gather signatures, we will get over 300 signatures. If we were given the opportunity to gather signatures, we will have more than (the required) two-third (majority),\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked why members of the House are not mobilising to override the veto, the lawmaker said, \u201cThe electoral bill is what every politician is interested in. And mind you, vetoing the President at this particular period is not about direct or indirect primary.\n\n\u201cThe concern here is, let it not be that because of direct primary, it will now be an issue that the 9th National Assembly will not be able to amend the Electoral Act.\u201d\n\nBagos, however, expressed concern that Buhari might reject the bill again, recalling how the President raised various issues against each of the four versions passed by the 8th National Assembly before time ran against the proposal.\n\nThe lawmaker vowed that opposition members of the parliament would prevent a repeat of what Buhari did to the bill under the last Assembly.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

On the other hand, the gap between the government and the people, all these things are encapsulated into what is called IPOB. So I want people to understand that IPOB/Nnamdi Kanu is more like an outcome, an effect, it is a reaction but the cause is somewhere else.\n\n\u201cThat reaction is pervasive and the effect is affecting everybody. Everybody is worried about the number of checkpoints we have on the road. From here to my community is supposed to be 30 minutes but it will take you two hours or more. The road is so bad and unemployment is high.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the number of local governments and states in Nigeria, it is lopsided against the South East. If you look at the structure of the security architecture in Nigeria, it is lopsided against the South East. If you look at every other aspect of political life in Nigeria, it appears to be a conspiracy against the South East. All these things are obvious. These things are encapsulated in what you call IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu etc.\u201d\n\nOgbonnia expressed the belief that by the time all the issues are explained to the President, he will have a change of mind on Kanu.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, has alerted members of the public that a cybercrime group has perfected a scheme to deliver ransomware to targeted organizational networks. The Commission in a statement signed by its Director of Public Affairs, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde urged the public to be vigilant to avoid falling victims of cyber attacks.\n\nThe NCC said the new ransomware uncovered by security experts has been categorised, by the Nigerian Computer Emergency Response Team\u2019s (ngCERT), as high-risk and critical. It noted that according to the ngCERT advisory, the criminal group is said to have been mailing out USB thumb drives to many organisations in the hope that recipients will plug them into their PCs and install the ransomware on their networks.\n\nWhile businesses are being targeted, criminals could soon begin sending infected USB drives to individuals, the Commission explained further. Describing how the cybercrime group runs the ransomeware, the NCC noted that the ngCERT advisory says the USB drives contain so-called \u2018BadUSB\u2019 attacks. The Commission said: \u201cThe BadUSB exploits the USB standards versatility and allows an attacker to reprogram a USB drive to emulate a keyboard to create keystrokes and commands on a computer. It then installs malware prior to the operating system booting, or spoofs a network card to redirect traffic.\n\n\u201cAccording to ngCERT, the attack has been seen in the US where the USB drives were sent in the mail through the Postal Service and Parcel Service. One type contained a message impersonating the US Department of Health and Human Services and claimed to be a COVID-19 warning. Other malicious USBs were sent in the post with a gift card claiming to be from Amazon.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cHowever, ngCERT has offered recommendations that will enable corporate and individual networks to mitigate the impact of this new cyber attack and be protected from the ransomware. These recommendations include a call on individuals and organisations not to insert USB drives from unknown sources, even if they\u2019re addressed to you or your organization. In addition, if the USB drive comes from a company or a person one is not familiar with and trusts, it is recommended that one contacts the source to confirm they actually sent the USB drive.\n\n\u201cFinally, ngCERT has advised Information and Communication Technology as well as other Internet users to report any incident of system compromises to ngCERT via [email protected], for technical assistance.\u201d",

          "text": "From Molly Kilete and Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nChief of Army Staff (COAS), Faruk Yahaya, has lauded the contribution of the media, especially The Sun, to the fight against terrorism and other sundry security challenges in the country.\n\nYahaya said The Sun, as one of the biggest media companies in the country, with one of the widest circulation strengths, has contributed in no small measure in promoting activities of the armed forces, especially the army.\n\nThe army chief, who called for more collaboration with The Sun, said with media support, about 50 percent of the insurgency war would be won.\n\nThe COAS made the appeal when he received the Managing Director and Editor-in-Chief of The Sun Publishing Limited, Onuoha Ukeh, and the newspaper\u2019s management team in his office at the Army Headquarters in Abuja.\n\nYahaya, while acknowledging major successes so far recorded by the army, appealed to the media to stop giving publicity to the evil activities of terrorists, bandits, kidnappers and other criminal groups upsetting the peace of the country.\n\nHe further called on Nigerians to join hands in the fight against insurgency, saying the war can only be won when all hands are on deck.\n\nHe said terrorists and other criminal groups continue to thrive because of the publicity they get from the media.\n\n\u201cThe media should stop publicising their atrocities and they would no longer be relevant,\u201d he said.\n\nYahaya, who said the Nigerian Army and other security agencies have made tremendous successes in its counterterrorism, anti-banditry and other internal security operations across the country, lamented that such operations were not given the needed publicity they should get.\n\nAs a result, he said oftentimes, the publicity given to terrorists\u2019 activities dampen the morale of troops.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate The Sun Publishing Company for all the effort to publicise our activities. Media is key in all our activities, particularly now in this era of information communication technology. They are key partners, particularly in their non-kinetic lines of operations.\n\n\u201cThey are the ones that reach out to others. Particularly in counter-insurgency operations, the insurgents thrive on publicity they gain from the media. They get their strength from the media. If for example, there is a blackout on what they do and nobody hears about their activities, 50 percent of the job is done.\n\n\u201cBut when their activities are published, over and again, they thrive from there. Sometimes this impacts negatively on the security forces and others, and sometimes seemingly giving them the notion that maybe they are weak or they are succeeding or they are so important criminals.\n\n\u201cThe army and the armed forces and other security agencies are productive in their operations and activities. It is in that light that we request the media to also, as part of their professional mandate, make deliberate efforts to join us in the fight against criminals and criminalities.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cWe are not saying they should not report, but they should make deliberate efforts to support the activities, the achievements of the army, the Armed Forces and ensure they are published. They would serve as encouragement to the troops. If the terrorists\u2019 activities are not reported in the media, 50 percent of the job is done.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Managing Director and Editor-in-Chief of The Sun Publishing Limited, Mr. Ukeh, commended officers and soldiers of the army for their commitment, dedication and sacrifices to ensure the unity and stability of the nation.\n\nHe said The Sun team\u2019s visit to the COAS was coming at an auspicious time when the nation was remembering the sacrifices of fallen heros.\n\n\u201cWe are happy to be here at a time of the Armed Forces Remembrance Day. We recognise the sacrifices of the army and the military in general. The army and military have done much for this nation. We appreciate this sacrifices and the effort to keep Nigeria safe,\u201d he said.\n\nUkeh also pledged the support of The Sun, in partnership with the Nigerian Army, in the fight against insurgency, banditry, kidnapping and other violent crimes ravaging the country.\n\nHe commended the COAS for making the welfare of personnel, especially those at the frontline, his top priority, as allowances are now being paid promptly, thereby boosting the morale of troops to give the terrorists the battle of their lives.\n\nUkeh, who used the occasion of the visit to congratulate officers and soldiers of the Nigerian Army as they celebrate the 2022 Armed Forces Remembrance Day, also commiserated with them over their deceased colleagues, who paid the supreme price for protecting the country and prayed God to grant their souls eternal rest.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is indeed a critical time for our nation where we are battling with insurgency, banditry, kidnapping and other sundry insecurity. The army has tried its best to keep Nigeria safe. We understand the challenges and sacrifices made by the army and the officers who are in the trenches, in the bush, facing the criminals so that we would be safe.\n\n\u201cWe thank you for these sacrifices and efforts you have made to save us. We are very happy with the COAS that since he assumed office the face of the war against insurgency and other sundry crime has changed because he has re-strategise and device means to effectively engage the terrorists and bandits it its operations.\n\n\u201cParticularly, we note the efforts you make to get some of the insurgents to repent and surrender. This strategy will shorten the war that we are waging. We commend you for that.\n\n\u201cWe are also happy with the synergy we are seeing among the Army, Navy, Air Force and other security agencies. We particularly take note of the way the army works with the Air Force in combating the insurgents and bandits.\u201d\n\nUkeh, while commending the COAS for his cordial relationship with the media, said: \u201cIt is what really prompted our visit today for us to strengthen relationships because the media can play a vital role even in the fight against terrorism, insurgency or kidnapping.\u201d\n\nThe managing director was accompanied on the visit by Daily Sun Editor, Ihenacho Nwosu; Editor, Saturday Sun, Tope Adeboboye and Editor, Nation\u2019s Capital and North, Folasade Adetutu-Koyi.",

They are yet to make any monetary demand\u201d, he said.\n\nAlso another group of gunmen attacked Jigawa, Dogo Fadama and surrounding communities killing two people while four others were abducted.\n\nA resident of Jigawa community, Umar Mohammed confirmed the invasion, saying that the gunmen took their time as they conducted house to house search and rustled a large number of cattle in the process.\n\nHe said that the attack which also occurred on Friday, took the community unaware but majority of the residents managed to escape as they ran into the bush before they (gunmen) arrived.\n\nThe operation, they said began at about 3.30 pm and lasted till about 6 :00pm with no help coming from anywhere despite several distress calls put across to security agents.\n\nA source close to Kulho community said one victim identified as Alhaji Tanko Kulho was shot dead and 16 people were abducted, adding that Shops were ransacked and over 18 motorcycles were stolen by the invaders.\n\nA resident of Kulho, Abdulrahman Kulho Adamu who confirmed the attack on telephone to our correspondent, said that six of his family members including his three elder brothers were among those abducted.\n\n\u201cWe were all seated at the market square when we saw many motorcycles carrying at least three people each, and well armed with AK 47 riffles arrived the community, and before we knew what was happening they began to shot sporadically into air.\n\n\u201cPeople began to run and in the process one Alhaji Tanko was shot dead by the gunmen.

          "text": "\u2022Seek postponement of 2022 national census\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nAhead of the 2023 general election, the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has said the region will support only a presidential candidate who has the capacity to address the nation\u2019s socio-economic and security problems irrespective of where the person comes from.\n\nThe elders say they will no longer vote for a candidate based on sentiments as they did for President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015, describing the incumbent as a disappointment to not only the North but the entire country.\n\nNEF\u2019s Director, Publicity and Advocacy, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, said this yesterday in an interview with journalists during a meeting of Northern Leaders of Thought held in Kaduna.\n\nThe northern elders also advised the federal government to postpone the planned 2022 National Census because of the large numbers of displaced Nigerians and the nearness of the census to the 2023 elections.\n\nBaba-Ahmed said Nigerians, especially northerners would vote for the best candidate, whether he or she is from the northern or southern part of the country.\n\nBaba-Ahmed dismissed calls by some groups that the presidency should be left for the South, describing such agitation as \u201ccommand democracy.\u201d\n\nHe said Nigerians, especially northerners did not bargain for the current economic and security challenges under Buhari\u2019s administration, saying that the North\u2019s support for Buhari in 2015 and 2019 was a mistake, which should not be repeated in 2023.\n\n\u201cNortherners were told that if Buhari becomes president, the country would be secured; he will fight corruption; the economy will improve, but now we are worst. This is not fiction.\n\n\u201cThis is not propaganda, it is not fiction, it is a fact on the ground,\u201d he added.\n\nHe pointed out that there are millions of Internally Displaced Peoples Camps (IDPs) in the North-west, where Buhari comes from as a result of deadly activities of bandits and lamented that the government has refused to admit it.\n\n\u201cThey are refusing to accommodate this view and consider the fact that we have internally displaced people.\n\n\u201cThis is not the Nigeria that we voted for President Buhari; so, he is a disappointment and that is why we are calling on Nigerians, particularly, northerners to be very careful; don\u2019t repeat the same mistake.\n\n\u201cChoose a northerner if you want, but please make sure he is the best among those that are available including candidates from the South,\u201d the NEF spokesman added.\n\nHe argued that presidential candidates should have a team to work with to be able to articulate their vision.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t just come to us as Buhari did in 2015 and 2019. We want to vote for a team. We want a President who will have a team ready to transit with them to form a government.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want a President that will take six months thinking about who will run his government. We want to do things differently otherwise the North is doomed and this country is doomed,\u201d Baba-Ahmed said.\n\nHe said those who urged the political parties not to field northern candidates are not democrats.\n\n\u201cThis is what they will call command democracy. It is a very primitive politics and retrogressive,\u201d he said and urged those he described as \u201creal politicians\u201d from the Southern part of the country to enlighten those making such demands.\n\nSpeaking further, he said it would be wrong to tell a part of the country not to contest.\n\n\u201cYou threatened that any political party that fields a northern candidate should not be voted for.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing like that in the constitution. Sadly, some people will be speaking in this manner.\n\n\u201cWhat we said to them is that the democratic processes will not be restricted to satisfy them,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, Nigerians should decide who they want.\n\n\u201cA northerner and a southerner have equal rights to contest.\n\n\u201cNortherners should be very careful in choosing who they vote for.\n\n\u201cThat is how we ended up with President Buhari. We don\u2019t want to repeat the same mistake.\n\n\u201cIt is not enough to be a northerner; you have to be better than other candidates; you have to be the best for the North and the best for the rest of Nigeria. We are looking for a Nigerian President,\u201d Baba-Ahmed, said.\n\nAlso in his opening address at the event, the convener of NEF and former Vice-Chancellor of the Ahmadu Bello University, Prof. Ango Abdullahi, said the North has always been the kingmaker in Nigeria\u2019s politics.\n\n\u201cI heard somebody boasting some few days ago that he was a kingmaker and now he wants to be king; well the North has always been the kingmaker politically in Nigeria and nobody else; it is not a matter of arrogance; that is the reality and it has not changed,\u201d Abdullahi said, apparently referring to the National leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Ahmed who recently declared his presidential ambition.\n\nAbdullahi lamented that Nigeria is going through many challenges, saying that the NEF meeting will proffer practical solutions.\n\n\u201cThey promised things will be different and that they will take over the challenges confronting us, not just in the country, but our region. Things don\u2019t seem to be getting better, rather things seem to be getting worst,\u201d he said.\n\nA communique issued at the end of the meeting decried the security situation in the North and urged President Buhari, governors and legislators to revisit and re-prioritise spending on security as well as address the scourge of poverty.\n\nThe communique signed by former Vice-Chancellor of Plateau State University, Prof. Doknan Shenni, maintained that the fundamental rights of all political parties to field candidates of their choices, and the right of voters to freely exercise choices over who leads them should not be compromised.\n\nThe communique maintained that \u201cnortherners have equal rights to aspire to all offices but they must raise competence, evidence of personal integrity and commitments to the rule of law above all other considerations.\n\nThe communique lamented that the desperate poor economic condition of most northerners poses additional threats to security and the democratic process and urged leaders to avoid pushing the population into deeper poverty and desperation amid challenging economic policies and a lack of empathy.\n\nIt advised the federal government to postpone the planned 2022 National Census because of the large numbers of displaced Nigerians and the closeness of the census to the 2023 elections.\n\nIt further called on President Muhammadu Buhari to assent to the proposed amendments to the Electoral Act, as this will improve the quality of elections, starting from 2023.\n\nThe communique called on key Northern groups to engage their southern counterparts to improve understanding, lower tensions and contribute to the creation of an atmosphere that allows all Nigerian to live in peace with each other.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Our Correspondents\n\nThe 2022 Armed Forces Remembrance Day was marked yesterday in Abuja with President Muhammadu Buhari presiding.\n\nAlso to commemorate the day, some governors, including Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, Douye Diri of Bayelsa State, Aminu Masari of Katsina State, Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State, as well as former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and former President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki, have called for peace and improved security across the country.\n\nAs the country continues to tackle security challenges ahead of the 2023 general election, the 36 state governors and the governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will hold separate meetings this week on the state of the nation.\n\nThis is coming as the All Progressives Congress (APC) has admitted that the country\u2019s security challenges are daunting, stressing however that Buhari\u2019s administration will overcome the prevailing security situation soon.\n\nOn its part, the main opposition, the PDP, saluted members of the Armed Forces for their courage, loyalty, sacrifice and resilience in defending the country.\n\nActivities to commemorate the Armed Forces Remembrance Day had commenced on October 28, 2021, when the president launched the remembrance emblem at the State House, Abuja.\n\nDuring yesterday\u2019s ceremony, which took place at the National Arcade, opposite the Eagle Square in the Three Arms Zone, Buhari inspected a Guard of Honour mounted by detachments of the Nigerian Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the Nigerian Legion.\n\nPrayers were said by Christian and Muslim clerics for the peaceful repose of the souls of the dead and the health of the nation.\n\nBuhari laid a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier as a mark of last respect to the fallen heroes who paid the supreme price to keep global peace and the nation\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\nTop officials who also laid wreaths include Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan; Speaker, House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila; Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad; Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Mohammed Bello represented by the Minister of State, Ramatu Aliyu, and his Defence counterpart, Major-General Bashir Magashi (rtd).\n\nOthers are the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, Service Chiefs, the Nigerian Legion, among others.\n\nTwenty-one gun salutes were thereafter fired at the event followed by the signing of the Remembrance Day anniversary register by the president accompanied by the Senate President, House of Representatives Speaker, Chief Justice of the Federation, military chiefs and other top government officials.\n\nPresident Buhari thereafter released white pigeons to indicate the harmony at the venue and the nation.\n\nThe president, who arrived at the venue at about 10.05 a.m. in a Black Limousine, was ushered into the arena by the Guards Parade led by Major M A Toriola.\n\nOn hand to receive President Buhari was the Commander of the Guards Brigade, Major-General Apiti Usman alongside Vice President Osinbajo, Senate President, Lawan; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gbajabiamila; Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Muhammad; Chief of Defence Staff, General Irabor; service chiefs and Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba.\n\nGovs Seek Peace, Improved Security, to Meet on State of Nation\n\nMeanwhile, some governors who spoke at the occasion of the Armed Forces Remembrance Day in their respective states have called for improved security in the country.\n\nAddressing journalists after laying a wreath to commemorate this year\u2019s event in Benin City, Edo State Governor, Obaseki, urged Nigerians not to take the country\u2019s unity, which was achieved on the blood of the nation\u2019s fallen heroes, for granted.\n\nObaseki promised that the government would integrate family members of the fallen heroes in the social empowerment schemes being implemented in the state.\n\n\u201cThe unity of this country has been achieved on the blood of our fallen heroes and it is not something that we should take for granted or we should joke with. People are still sacrificing in the various arenas and battles in the country today and we shouldn\u2019t take it lightly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are here today to remember the gallant Nigerian soldiers and members of the armed forces who lost their lives in the cause of defending our country. We are here today because people gave up their lives and have done so through the years. We should stop making unguided utterances about the unity of this country.\n\n\u201cPeople must understand that such careless talks caused the loss of lives and we should not lead ourselves where history will repeat itself in this country.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Bayelsa State Governor, Diri, called on politicians to avoid actions that would lead to bloodletting in the 2023 elections.\n\nDiri who made the call at the Peace Park in Yenagoa said the outcome of elections should be determined by the ballot box and not the strength of the gun.\n\nHe added that the ultimate power to enthrone leadership lies in the hands of God.\n\nThe governor recalled the bloodletting that characterised the 2019 governorship campaigns in the Nembe community and cautioned that all political players should vow never to allow the killing of youths in the state because of elections despite their ambitions.\n\nSimilarly, Rivers State Governor, Wike has urged Buhari to stop the incessant killing of Nigerians by Boko Haram groups and bandits.\n\nThe governor said the president should redouble efforts in fulfilling his cardinal electoral promise of securing the country.\n\nWike made the call at the venue of the occasion held at the Isaac Adaka Boro Park, Port Harcourt.\n\nHe argued that Nigeria is at the crossroads with everyone weary about the prolonged Boko Haram insurgency in parts of the country.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge that some progress has been made in the fight against the insurgents.\n\n\u201cHowever, the generality of Nigerians believes that the progress made cannot be good enough in so far as Boko Haram, its affiliates and the bandits are still active in the North-east, North-west and some other parts of the country killing, maiming and kidnapping helpless people, including school children, and destroying and displacing hapless communities.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, call on Mr President to redouble his efforts and fulfil his cardinal electoral promise to secure the country and ensure that Nigerians feel safe and remain safe and secure wherever they are in their own country,\u201d Wike explained.\n\nAlso speaking yesterday at this year Armed Forces Remembrance Day held at the Cenotaph, Uyo, Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State stressed that those things that may heat upon the polity and strain the cords of unity must be avoided.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford another national conflict; we cannot afford to send our youths to fight over issues that could have been addressed peacefully in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust,\u201d he stated.\n\nAlso addressing journalists on the occasion held at the Arcade Ground of the Governor\u2019s Office, Abeokuta, Ogun State Governor, Abiodun called on Nigerians to continue to ensure oneness and unity of the country, saying only one and the indivisible nation would ensure peace, progress and development.\n\nHe also called on the governments and well-meaning Nigerians to see to the welfare of the children and spouses left behind by the heroes who fought for the territorial integrity and unity of the nation.\n\n\u201cThis country must remain a one and indivisible country; these are ways we can continue to ensure that the labours of these young men and women are not in vain,\u201d he stated.\n\nMasari, who spoke in Katsina, said the relative peace being enjoyed in the state was as a result of the untiring sacrifice of the Nigerian soldiers towards securing the lives and properties of the citizens in the state.\n\nHe further attributed the gradual returns of peace in the state to the dedication, professional competence, and discipline of the troops and other security agencies, whom he said, sacrificed their lives for peace and unity to thrive in the state.\n\nMasari said: \u201cIt is also in recognition of these efforts that, I extend my profound appreciation on behalf of the government and people of Katsina State to the Commanders, officers, soldiers and airmen of 17 Brigade, Nigerian Army and 213 Nigerian Air Force Forward Operating Base for their untiring sacrifice towards securing lives and properties of the citizens of Katsina.\u201d\n\nThe governor explained that the supreme sacrifice that some of the falling heroes paid towards securing the lives and properties of the citizens will never be forgotten and prayed for their souls to have eternal rest.\n\nKano State Governor, Ganduje, called on the Armed Forces to rise to the challenges of insecurity in the country and rid the nation of criminals.\n\nHe explained that with the regard given to the past heroes, the security operatives in Nigeria should take their responsibility diligently.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt this is a day we should be remembering every year. I congratulate the organisers for organising the event for the last seven days and everything is concluded today.\u201d\n\nThe governor explained that \u201cThe importance of this day is to remember those who fought the Nigerian civil war to keep Nigeria one.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt we are benefitting from what they did in the past and therefore it is worthwhile to remember them.\u201d\n\nGovs Meet on State of the Nation\n\nIn a related development, two crucial meetings have been slated by the governors this week. The first meeting is the meeting of the PDP governors expected to take place in Port Harcourt on Monday.\n\nThe second meeting is the meeting of all the 36 state governors scheduled for Wednesday to discuss the state of the nation.\n\nHead of Media and Public Affairs of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), Mr Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, said in a statement yesterday that the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr Kayode Fayemi has invited the 36 governors to a very crucial meeting where pressing national concerns will be discussed.\n\nHowever, the details of the meeting were not disclosed.\n\nThe meeting is scheduled to take place Wednesday, January 19, 2022.\n\nThe statement disclosed that an invitation issued by the Director-General of the forum, Mr Asishana Bayo Okauru, at the weekend and sent to all the respective governors, said the meeting, which would be the first in 2022 would be an in-person meeting as opposed to the regular virtual ones, to effectively convey the messages of the meeting which are all characterised under item 2 of the agenda titled matters arising.\n\nAccording to Bello Bankindo, \u201cthe meeting which will commence at 8 p.m. will be at the NGF Secretariat in Abuja, where the NGF Chairman will thereafter, accompanied by all the 36 Governors, address a press conference.\n\nAlso, another meeting of the governors elected on the platform of the PDP is scheduled to hold in Port Harcourt where the party governors are expected to attend.\n\nThe meeting, which is the first in the year, would be attended by the National Chairman of the party, Dr Iyorchia Ayu and the National Secretary, Senator Samuel Anyanwu.\n\nAtiku Hails Veterans, Says Nigeria Owes Them Debt of Gratitude\n\nAs the nation commemorates this year\u2019s Armed Forces Remembrance Day, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has said Nigeria\u2019s military veterans cannot be repaid for their supreme sacrifices, adding that their welfare should be treated as a priority by any government.\n\nHe said that laying down one\u2019s life in the defence of your country and fellow citizens is the highest sacrifice for the sake of patriotism.\n\n\u201cSoldiers lose life and limb in the course of serving their country,\u201d adding that \u201cNigeria owes them a debt of eternal gratitude for their immeasurable sacrifices.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president advised the people in government to always give priority to the payment of the pensions and other entitlements of our military veterans as at when due.\n\nSaraki Tasks Next Administration on Insecurity\n\nIn his solidarity message on the occasion, former President of the Senate, Saraki, stated that Nigeria\u2019s next government must revisit all reports of the various security summits and other such recommendations and harmonise them to quickly end the security crisis across the country.\n\nHead of the Abubakar Bukola Saraki Media Office, Mr Yusuph Olaniyonu, quoted Saraki as saying in a statement yesterday that the implementation of the recommendations requires strong political will and transparency to ensure immediate success.\n\nSaraki also commended the courage and patriotism of the members of the various security agencies who have continued to fight against enemies of the country within and outside while also seeking better motivation for them and their families while they are in service and after retirement.\n\n\u201cWe already have enough recommendations from the various summits, dialogues, and special sessions on security organised by the executive, legislature, non-governmental organisations, and development partners. All a new government should do is harness the recommendations and demonstrate the strong will, determination, and urgency in translating them into operation,\u201d Saraki said.\n\nNigeria Security Challenges Daunting, Says APC\n\nMeanwhile, the ruling APC has admitted that the country\u2019s security challenges are daunting, but promised that the Buhari\u2019s administration would soon overcome the challenges.\n\nThe National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John Akpanudoedehe stated this in a statement issued yesterday to commemorate 2022 Armed Forces Remembrance Day\n\nHe commended the military for the focus, zeal and dedication displayed toward performing their constitutional roles.\n\n\u201cOur security challenges may seem daunting, but we assure Nigerians that the President Muhammadu Buhari government will overcome the prevailing insecurity situation soon,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said undoubtedly, Nigeria\u2019s Armed Forces have transformed to one of the most professional, dedicated and battle-ready outfits in the world, fighting terrorism and emerging crimes that threaten our collective peace and safety.\n\nPDP Demands More Attention to Welfare of Soldiers, Families\n\nOn its part, PDP saluted members of the Armed Forces for their courage, loyalty, sacrifice and resilience in defending our dear nation, particularly in the face of resurged insecurity in the last six years.\n\nThe party said in a statement its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Debo Ologunagba, acknowledged the bravery and patriotism of the gallant soldiers in the frontlines, who despite the daunting challenges, daily put their lives on the line, with many paying the supreme price for the unity and security of the country.\n\nThe PDP also demanded that the government takes steps to provide the military with adequate equipment as well as improve on the welfare of the troops to ensure effectiveness in their duty to the nation.\n\nIt said, \u201cOur Party urges the government to ensure the wellbeing of the families of our fallen heroes who gave their lives for our nation. Their families and loved ones should not be allowed to continue to suffer.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "OPEC Misses Production Target over Nigeria, Others\u2019 Under-performance",
          "text": "*Producers pumped 620,000 barrels below target in December 2021\n\n*Nigeria\u2019s compliance hits 239%\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe inability of Nigeria and other members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to pump enough crude oil has resulted in the overall failure of the group to meet its target production for December 2021, according to a survey.\n\nThe 13-member countries of OPEC and its allies led by Russia pumped some 620,000 barrels of oil per day below their combined quota, the survey showed while a survey by S&P Global Platts showed that OPEC\u2019s overall compliance stood at 116.5 per cent for the month with Nigeria\u2019s compliance at 239 per cent.\n\nOne of the secondary sources stated that whereas the target for Nigeria was 1.67 million barrels per day for the month, it only produced 1.44 million barrels per day in December and 1.49 million barrels per day in November.\n\nThe development widened the gap between the production quotas set by OPEC and its allies and their actual production.\n\nNigeria has been struggling to meet the quota allocated to it by OPEC but ageing infrastructure caused by years of under-investment in the upstream of the oil and gas sector has made it difficult for the country to achieve its target.\n\nSabotage caused by vandalism, technical issues, as well as difficulties with restarting oil wells the country shut down last year in the heat of the Covid-19 pandemic, have worsened the challenges.\n\nBut despite the limitation, the largest individual increase in production was in West Africa, where Angola boosted output by 90,000 bpd to 1.2 million bpd. Although this was the highest monthly level in 2021, Angola was still 190,000 bpd below its December quota.\n\nWest Africa also saw the biggest individual decline last month, with Nigerian output tumbling and defying state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari\u2019s forecast that the country would reach its target by the end of last year.\n\nThe S&P data showed that OPEC\u2019s 13 countries pumped 28.04 million bpd of crude, up 190,000 bpd from November, while nine non-OPEC partners pumped 13.98 million bpd, an increase of 120,000 bpd.\n\nFourteen out of the 18 members with quotas fell short of their targets, including even its largest producer Russia, whose compliance rose above 100 per cent for the first time since February 2021, when severe winter temperatures shut-in wells and reduced pipeline flows.\n\nBut gains by Venezuela, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Angola far outstripped losses by Libya and Nigeria, making December the 10th straight month that OPEC+ output increased.\n\nThe 19 members, subject to production targets, pumped some 620,000 bpd below their combined caps, the survey showed.\n\nThe bloc has been hiking its quotas by a collective 400,000 bpd each month, which would put it on pace to restore production to pre-pandemic levels by late 2022.\n\nBut many countries are already maxing out their output levels or are close to it, lifting trader sentiment that was once quite bearish for the first quarter in anticipation of a major supply glut.\n\nBut despite its bullish outlook, Platts Analytics said it still expects the market to be oversupplied in the first quarter but estimates OPEC+ sustainable spare production capacity will shrink to 800,000 bpd by June if it maintains its monthly quota rises, creating \u201can uncomfortably thin market buffer in the second half of the year.\u201d\n\nThe alliance is scheduled to next meet on February 2 to decide whether to proceed with another 400,000 bpd quota increase for March.\n\nOPEC members such as Iran, Libya and Venezuela are exempt from quotas under the agreement, while non-OPEC Mexico quit the deal in July 2020 and thus was not included in the survey, though the country continues to send a representative to the group\u2019s meetings.\n\nThe survey stated that Iraq was also up 60,000 bpd in the month to 4.31 million bpd, continuing to exceed its quota, according to the survey, while non-OPEC Kazakhstan posted a 70,000 bpd gain to 1.68 million bpd, well above its quota.\n\nLibyan output is expected to recover in short order to about 1.2 million bpd after authorities reached an agreement with the militia to reopen and lift force majeure on some oil terminals.\n\nBut Nigeria\u2019s prospects remain clouded, with deteriorating infrastructure that has seen all of its key export grades, including Agbami, Bonny Light, Forcados and Qua Iboe face severe production issues throughout the last year.\n\nOPEC has recently reassured the market that the group intends to unwind its cuts at a pace that ensures demand does not outstrip supply.\n\nHowever, the measured supply to the market has ensured that oil prices continued their surge hitting a two-month high during the week, amid projections that a lack of production capacity and limited investment\n\nin the sector could lift crude between $90 and $100 a barrel this year.\n\nA tight supply and easing concerns about the potential hit to demand from the Omicron coronavirus variant, combined to jack up prices as Brent sold for $85.04 a barrel on Thursday and the United States West\n\nTexas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up to $82.90.\n\nBrent prices have not touched $90 and $100 since 2014 when they were retreating from a record high above $115 to as low as $57 by the end of the year.\n\nThough the Omicron coronavirus variant has pushed COVID-19 cases far above peaks hit last year, it is expected that oil prices will be supported by the reluctance of many governments to restore the strict restrictions that hammered the global economy when the pandemic took hold in 2020.\n\nThe news is both good and bad for Nigeria which should ordinarily earn more foreign exchange from the sale of crude but now has to deal with paying more subsidy since there\u2019s a positive relationship between the international prices of the commodity and how much Nigerians get the product at the pump.\n\nOn December 22, the National Assembly approved a N17.126 trillion ($38 billion) budget for 2022, anchored on an oil price benchmark of $62 per barrel.\n\nThe approved oil price assumption was higher than the $57 per barrel price that President Muhammadu Buhari had proposed to the parliament on October 7 and also higher than the oil price benchmark of $40 per barrel adopted by the government for the 2021 budget.\n\nIn addition, Nigeria retained the oil production target of 1.88 million bpd, including condensate production of between 300,000-400,000 bpd, for its revenue calculation in 2022.\n\nThis is as compared to the output target of 1.86 million bpd the government had set for the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "My Meeting with Tinubu Not About Presidency, Fayemi Clarifies",
          "text": "*Denies dropping undeclared presidential ambition\n\n*Makinde wishes ex-Lagos gov well, says he wants best for Nigeria\n\nVictor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nGovernor of Ekiti State, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has clarified that his recent meeting with the former Governor of Lagos State, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, offered an avenue to ruminate on the progress of the nation and not about any 2023 presidential ambition.\n\nThis is as Oyo State Governor, Mr. Seyi Makinde, yesterday wished Tinubu well in his 2023 presidential ambition, adding that he would want the best for Nigeria.\n\nFayemi berated those he described as spin doctors, who claimed that he dropped his veiled presidential ambition at the meeting when nothing of such happened.\n\nThe two notable leaders had a closed-door meeting where undisclosed issues were discussed, which some had misinterpreted to mean strategy over the 2023 presidency, which the duo was said to be interested in.\n\nBut Fayemi, in a statement signed yesterday by his Chief Press Secretary (CPS), Mr Yinka Oyebode, debunked the claim in some quarters that the 2023 presidency formed the crux of his discussion with Tinubu, saying he is free to meet with the APC leader anytime he wishes, being his political leader and tutor.\n\n\u201cIt was a family meeting of minds. It is therefore disingenuous of the spin doctors who were nowhere near the venue of the meeting to begin to second guess discussions at the meeting.\n\n\u201cIn a democratic setting like ours with so many issues begging for attention, discussions will go on daily among political leaders at various levels. Political leadership plays an indispensable role in foisting great responsibilities on people, thus both formal and informal discourses cannot be wished away.\n\n\u201cCreating a fictional social media frenzy out of such meeting where issues of national discourse are discussed would thus amount to an ill wind that blows no one any good.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Tinubu is a former two-term governor of Lagos State and national leader of the APC, while Dr Fayemi, also a chieftain of the party, is the governor of Ekiti State and current Chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum.\n\n\u201cMeeting between the two leaders, dates as far back as their days in exile, when they were both involved in the struggle to wrest the country away from military jackboots, and has since been a regular occurrence both within and outside the country\u2019s political space. So there should not be any big deal in seeing them meet, except someone has opted to create mischief out of it\u201d.\n\nFayemi stated that the details of their meeting remain undisclosed, saying that: \u201cSeeing the two of them who are being rumoured as potential presidential aspirants from the South-west together may naturally give way to speculations that the 2023 presidential election could form part of their discussions.\n\n\u201cThis may have been further fuelled by the fact that Asiwaju Tinubu said he had informed President Muhammadu Buhari that he would be coveting the presidential seat in 2023. Dr Fayemi on the other hand has yet to give any visible sign in that direction.\n\n\u201cHowever, both Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s declared ambition and Fayemi\u2019s undeclared ambition have now been taken up and given verve by some spin doctors, particularly those who believe such could rev up their relevance in the eyes of either of the political leaders.\u201d\n\nFayemi accused rumour peddlers of surreptitiously scrambling for relevance by weaving, not half-truths, but blatant lies into the Tinubu-Fayemi meeting, saying it signposted Fayemi surrendering his undeclared ambition to Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s declared one.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, they have been dishing out barefaced and unsubstantiated lies that Dr Fayemi at the closed-door meeting \u2018debunked the raging rumour of his 2023 presidential ambition and pledged support for the national leader of APC Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\u201d\n\nFayemi said the story by the spin doctors stands logic in the head and stands not only disclaimed but condemned, saying it must have been sourced from the rumour mill, or as a beer parlour gist. At its best, it is a mere conjecture.\n\n\u201cIf and when Dr Fayemi chooses to declare his interest in running for the 2023 presidential ticket, he would not be embarking on an ego trip that would warrant going into the unhealthy contest with Asiwaju Tinubu or anyone else.\n\n\u201cFayemi sees Tinubu as his leader in politics and reserves respect for him as a national leader of his party. Neither will he run the race to use it to negotiate with anyone. Rather he will run because he is convinced he should do so,\u201d the statement added.\n\nMeanwhile, Oyo State Governor, Makinde, has wished Tinubu, well in his 2023 presidential ambition, but added that he would want the best for Nigeria.\n\nHe said this when Tinubu visited him over the demise of a former governor of Oyo State, Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala, and two prominent traditional rulers \u2013 the Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Jimoh Oyewumi Ajagungbade III, and the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji, Aje Ogunguniso I.\n\nA statement issued yesterday the Chief Press Secretary to the Oyo State governor, Mr. Taiwo Adisa quoted the governor as saying that the National Leader of APC stood for politics without bitterness.\n\nAccording to Makinde, politicians may fight, struggle for political positions, but power can only come from God.\n\nMakinde said: \u201cI want to welcome you (Tinubu) to Oyo State. We are really grateful for this visit. This is the year political parties will elect their candidates towards the election that is coming next year. So, what this had demonstrated to us is, you stood for politics without bitterness.\n\n\u201cDuring this political season, you may have to question yourself on why you need to come to the Government House because people might have another interpretation to it. But you sent a message to me and I was delighted to host you in Ibadan.\n\n\u201cWe lost two traditional rulers almost in quick succession. First, it was Soun of Ogbomoso land, and we were planning for the burial when the Olubadan of Ibadanland also joined his ancestors. We were still in the middle of that when former Governor Akala also died. I can see that in Oyo State, we try to take politics out of what we call \u2018omoluabi\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe may fight, struggle for political positions but we know power can only come from God and He gives it to whomever He will like to give it to at whatever time.\n\n\u201cWe really thank you for this visit and want to let you know that we have taken proper notice that you have risen above politics and all that is going around here to come and share with us at this moment that we are grieving. We say thank you.\n\n\u201cLet me also use this opportunity to wish you well in your political quest to govern this nation. We want the best for this country and only the best is good enough at this particular time.\u201d\n\nThe statement quoted Tinubu as saying that the reign of the two prominent traditional rulers was peaceful, adding that the duo contributed to the peaceful atmosphere of the state.\n\nTinubu was also quoted as stating that the late Governor Alao-Akala equally contributed immensely to the political development and the love radiating within the political arena in the state.\n\n\u201cI want to thank you, the governor. It was only last night that I thought of my coming here and we are here today. Having lost a former governor of this state, the Olubadan of Ibadanland and Soun of Ogbomoso, it is just for us to go back to the sense of value of people and their lives\n\n\u201cWith this situation, we share in your loss. You, as the governor on the saddle of power, take responsibility for the situation here. I want to say that we thank God Ibadan has been peaceful and not a den of violence but peaceful.\n\n\u201cEvery other thing that has happened has taught us in the book of religion that we are just passing through and we will leave one day. But no matter how long, it is difficult to absorb the loss easily.\n\n\u201cThank you for being accommodating. We gave you a short hour\u2019s notice and you responded.\n\n\u201cThat is a demonstration of a good character, which is rare. People get, sometimes, intoxicated with power and the arrogance of office can be overwhelming, but not with you. Thank you for receiving us so quickly.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps has disbanded the Anti-vandal Unit of the Rivers State Command of the corps following allegations by the governor of the state, Nyesom Wike.\n\nSome weeks ago, Wike accused the NSCDC unit and police of aiding and abetting vandals and illegal bunkers to carry out their nefarious activities in the state.\n\nNSCDC CG, Ahmed Audi.\n\nReacting to this, the NSCDC Commandant General, Ahmed Audi, in a statement on Saturday expressed shock over the allegations as he ordered the suspension of the head of the anti-vandal team and the disbandment of the unit.\n\nThe statement issued by the NSCDC\u2019s Director of Public Relations, Olusola Odumosu, reads, \u201cWorried by this disappointing development, the CG has ordered the suspension of the head of the anti-vandal team and the disbandment of the unit with immediate effect, pending the outcome of an independent inquiry set up to look into the weighty allegations levelled against the unit by the governor.\"\n\nAudi also ordered the Acting DCG in charge of investigation and intelligence to summon all the personnel involved to the national headquarters in Abuja for further investigation to determine the level of involvement and or culpability to dispense justice appropriately.\n\nHe also said the allegations as not being in tandem with his vision for the corps, stressing that he won\u2019t condone any criminal act or act of compromise by any personnel.\n\nHe assured Governor Wike of getting to the root of the matter without delay, promising more synergy with the state government towards discharging more effective service delivery to the good people of Rivers State.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cThe swift action taken by me is to close any identified gaps in our operations and service to the nation, I will not tolerate any act of indiscipline, compromise or sabotage under any guise; our founding fathers have worked so hard to earn a good name for the service as a noble organization and I will not allow a few bad eggs to spoil our name, image, our credibility, and integrity. We will investigate those fingered in the allegations and deal decisively with them if found guilty to serve as a deterrent to others.\n\n\u201cOur moral principles are not negotiable; we are going to rejig the unit and fish out those spoiling the name of the corps, my fight against vandals, illegal oil bunkers and those stealing our collective wealth and sabotaging our economy is unflinching and we will redouble our efforts to whittle down this act of sabotage and bring to justice anyone, not in tune with our vision and mission for the service.\u201d",

          "text": "Olumide Akpata, the president of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), says the issues delaying the approval of the electoral bill may be a \u201csmokescreen\u201d to keep the present provisions for the 2023 polls.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had, in December 2021, withheld assent to the bill, stating that the clause recommending direct primary for political parties \u201cviolates the spirit of democracy\u201d.\n\nElectronic transmission of election results and compulsory direct primaries for political parties are among the amendments proposed by the national assembly.\n\nSpeaking at a town hall meeting held on the electoral bill and organised by Yiaga Africa, a civil society organisation, Akpata said it is disappointing to have such back-and-forth issues on the bill even though the president and the leadership of the national assembly belong to the same party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so disappointed with the ways things have panned out. Almost everything about that bill smells progress. Most of the provisions of the bill are pro-people. I see those provisions as incremental steps,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe cannot get it right all at once. So, we can forgive people that say our government is anti-people; you can forgive them if they come to that conclusion.\n\n\u201cEverything rises and falls on leadership; leadership at the executive arm and in the legislature. We have a bill that has so many innovations that would advance the course of this nation and our people, including ensuring that INEC gets funding one year before the election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople with disabilities are included in the process, including that you must submit the names of your nominees 180 days before the election. These are all all provisions that are responding to issues that have been highlighted in the process that are in need of fixing.\n\n\u201cSo, Mr President has pointed out these issues of direct or indirect primaries. He had decided that on the basis of that, he is sending it back to the national assembly.\n\n\u201cI think that we can be forgiven when we conclude if this is a smokescreen of some sort and that there is a spanner thrown in the works to keep us in the moment, so that we will stay with the present dispensation, because this is something that could easily have been fixed.\n\n\u201cMr President is of the same party as those who control the national assembly. If our leaders are interested in the progress for the people and for the nation, these are house issues that could have been sorted out by those in charge of affairs in both arms of government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSince the president has thrown in the charge about the direct and indirect primaries and if that provision is removed he would assent the bill, I welcome it to the members of the national assembly to take him at his words.

          "text": "After 6 months, the Nigerian government has lifted the suspension of Twitter operations in the country following approval by President Muhammadu Buhari. The removal of the suspension took effect from 12 AM Thursday, January 13, 2022.\n\nThe announcement was made on Wednesday by the Chairman Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement and Director-General National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi.\n\nAbdullahi stated that the approval was given following a memo written by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Ibrahim to the President. In the memo, the minister updated and requested the President\u2019s approval for the lifting of the suspension based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\n\nRecall that the Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operation on June 4, 2021, following the platform\u2019s decision to remove a controversial tweet by the Nigerian President, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The Nigerian government has insisted the suspension is a matter of national security and not related to the president\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to ban Twitter triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits filed against the Nigerian government; and national assembly hearings held to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nMy heart and tweet goes out to all the small businesses that lost revenue and opportunities during the #TwitterBan. May you find creative ways to recover speedily. I\u2019ll do my best to help with some free promotions. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude0e \u2014 Frank Donga\u2122 (@frankdonga_) January 12, 2022\n\nMid-way through the suspension period, during his Nigeria\u2019s 61st Independence Day anniversary presidential speech in October, President Buhari said the ban would only be lifted if the social media giant met certain conditions.\n\nA number of notable conditions include Twitter setting up a local office or a legal entity in the country, paying taxes locally and cooperating with the Nigerian government to regulate content and harmful tweets.\n\nThe statement on the lifting of the suspension indicates that these conditions have been met\u2014in the first quarter of this year Twitter is expected to establish a legal entity in Nigeria and in 2023 appoint a country representative to interface with Nigerian authorities. The execution timeline for the conditions begins from this week.\n\n\u201cConsidering Twitter\u2019s influence on our democracy, our economy, and the very fabric of our corporate existence as a nation, our priority is to adapt, not ban, Twitter,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn wake of removal of the suspension, Nigerians have come online to celebrate the end of an era of using VPNs to access Twitter. They\u2019ve also pointed out that the suspension was unnecessary and wonder if the removal was incentivised by the desire to use the platform to campaign for the country\u2019s upcoming elections next year.\n\nNot FG lifting the #TwitterBan 13 months to election, so they can come back and use this same social media to campaign.\n\n\n\nAffliction shall not rise a second time.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe#KeepitOn \u2014 QueenEsther Iroanusi (@QueenExtha) January 12, 2022\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Tarneem Saeed: The entrepreneur at the forefront of Sudan\u2019s economic renaissance",
          "text": "She left law in the UK, returned to Sudan, and built the largest online marketplace in the country. Now, she\u2019s building the biggest fintech startup in the country. How\u2019s Saeed doing all of this in Sudan, one of Africa\u2019s most conflict-torn political landscapes?\n\nIn the media, Sudan is often portrayed as an unstable country. In October last year, it made the news again; this time, not for the civil unrest that has engulfed the Northeast-African nation for the past 40 years but for alsoug, a marketplace startup in the country, which closed a $5 million institutional funding round.\n\nThis investment is the first of its kind since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period. So, it isn\u2019t only a big deal for the startup but for the entire ecosystem. It is a milestone that marks the beginning of a new era for business in Sudan.\n\nalsoug, founded in 2016 by Tarneem Saeed, is reportedly the biggest tech startup in the country; the funding round speaks to this fact. What is surprising, however, is that, in a conservative and conflict-torn nation like Sudan, a woman-led company is at the forefront of bringing Sudan\u2019s economy back to health.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTarneem Saeed and founding alsoug\n\nSaeed left Sudan for the first time when she was 14. Her father was a successful Sudanese businessman and her mother a top professional in the humanitarian space. At the time, the Sudanese educational system had gone to shambles, so Saeed\u2019s parents shipped Saeed and her brother to Canada to continue their education. From Canada, Saeed proceeded to the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) where she studied law and served as the president of the Arabic Society.\n\nShe worked as a corporate lawyer at Allen and Overy, a global law firm present in over 60 countries, for 4 years. In 2014, she took a sabbatical to visit Sudan to help a family friend put together a collection of coffee table books focused on Sudanese\u2019s artists.\n\nUpon getting to Sudan and staying a few days, she began to see how disconnected the country was from the digital economy.\n\n\u201cSudan felt so cut off from the world. It was like in the 1990s; people and businesses weren\u2019t harnessing the full power of the internet. Coming from London, Sudan just felt really empty,\u201d Saeed said. \u201cOne thing that irked me the most was how difficult it was to find out the price of anything. You had to ask someone to get the price of a car, house, and even cattle.\u201d\n\nThis didn\u2019t sit well with Saeed. Sudan has a staggering 64% of its population under the age of 24 and boasts a mobile penetration rate of 73%\u2014so, why was it still living in the 1990s?\n\nSaeed decided to do something about it. Throughout 2015, she and her small team were building a broker platform where people could check the prices of goods and services. In 2016, alsoug was launched as a classified marketplace.\n\n\u201cWe chose the classifieds model because Sudan was quite unstable and the internet wasn\u2019t great,\u201d said Saeed. \u201cThe beauty of the online classifieds platform, however, is that it doesn\u2019t require heavy tech, and you can do a lot on it while keeping costs fairly low.\u201d\n\nTarneem Saeed, founder/CEO of Alsoug\n\nIn 2016\u20132017, the telecommunication companies present in Sudan were in survival mode. They were cutting operation costs and not reinvesting in the country. As a result, the country\u2019s tech got old and any mass digital product had to be light so that people could access it with their 2G and not-so-strong 3G.\n\nalsoug continued as a classified platform where people would go to check out the price of things\u2014as Saeed had envisioned it\u2014and connect with sellers. Saeed and her team took to the streets to onboard offline merchants, educating them about alsoug\u2019s value. The team also doubled down on SEO since they couldn\u2019t advertise on social media because Facebook won\u2019t allow them to target Sudan. After a while, the platform started picking up momentum.\n\nAfter the success of the classifieds model, Saeed\u2019s thesis that Sudanese aren\u2019t suspicious of tech and would embrace it, if provided, was now proven, and it was time for alsoug to pivot into a scalable business model\u2014where the platform facilitates more than just discovery but also payments and fulfillment.\n\nA big problem is a big opportunity\n\nalsoug has pivoted into a marketplace that facilitates an entire e-commerce value chain, but there\u2019s a problem: there aren\u2019t any existing digital payment options to plug into. \u201cThere was no M-Pesa or Paystack,\u201d Saeed said, so the company couldn\u2019t process payments online and had to settle for cash on delivery.\n\nAfter using this model for a while, the company realised that they\u2019d have to build their own payment gateway. After all, this wouldn\u2019t be the first time they\u2019d build supporting tech from scratch: Saeed said they\u2019d earlier built their own SMS tool after a series of terrible experiences with some third parties.\n\n\u201cSo, we started looking into building our payment gateway, obtaining licenses, and talking to potential partners. Then we met Ashraf Sabry Fawry CEO and some other key shareholders, who convinced us that if we were going into the payment space, we\u2019d have to spend more money,\u201d said Saeed.\n\n\u201cWe realised we could build a payment network across Sudan. We decided to raise capital, but we were keen on bringing in adventurous VCs with high ethical standards who\u2019d understand that doing business in Sudan is a long-term play. It took a while to close, but it\u2019s worth the time.\u201d\n\nalsoug now has a payment gateway called Cashi that facilitates payments on its marketplace; and the company is also on the brink of rolling out its POS machines across the nation. What started as a buyer-seller matchmaking site has morphed into a full-blown e-commerce and fintech powerhouse.\n\nThe alsoug roadmap is very ambitious. However, building as a woman in Sudan is a tough call. This is not only true for Sudanese women, it\u2019s the reality of every female founder across the world.\n\n\u201cThere are places I can\u2019t go to and have to rely on male employees to go there. For example, I can\u2019t go to the car market because it\u2019s a male-dominated market and women aren\u2019t taken seriously there.\u201d\n\nAlsoug team at work\n\nSaeed also narrated how in most meetings with regulators or government officials, they directed their questions to her male employees rather than her. She, however, isn\u2019t deterred by this because instead of taking it as an insult, she\u2019s turned it into fuel driving her ambition. She said one way to look at it and not feel disrespected is to consider that Sudan is majorly an Islamic environment where it\u2019s believed that men should lower their gaze.\n\nAccording to Saeed, the company has managed to capture the biggest market share because of their operational strategy. Though there are some Arab marketplaces competing with them, they are not bothered. Over the years, a number of companies have come, launched, and then shut down within a short period of time. Before anyone knew what was happening Sudan had eaten them up whole and spit them out of its borders.\n\nThe Sudan market is tough, and what helped alsoug was building light as they grew; they didn\u2019t try to overweigh the market all at once. Now the market trusts them to deliver even on other fronts\u2014like fintech.\n\n\u201cNo one has managed to penetrate the offline market and sustain growth the way we have. We have gone from people throwing us out of their shops to them coming to us,\u201d Saeed said with a faint giggle. \u201cAt the beginning, a lot of people didn\u2019t understand. For example, real estate brokers thought we\u2019d come to steal their jobs, but when we encouraged them to get on the platform, they realised an increase in their sales exponentially in the course of a year.\u201d\n\nalsoug has used its empathetic offline education to turn competitors into customers and partners not only in the marketplace section, but also in the fintech division. According to Saeed, the company is not trying to compete with the banks, telecoms, and the budding fintech ecosystem; it just wants to fix the black holes by playing in a space where none of them is playing. \u201cDigital cash in and cash out,\u201d she said.\n\nSudan in retrospect\n\nTo really understand how much of a hard ground Sudan was and still is to do business in, a little context is necessary.\n\nSudan is the third-largest country in Africa: it has a landmass the size of Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Liberia, and Rwanda put together. But unlike other nations who have since moved on from their civil war days, Sudan is still stuck on hers.\n\nSince 1956 when Sudan first gained independence from the UK, there\u2019ve been only 11 years of peace. The initial attempts to build a parliamentary democracy in Sudan was met by coups in 1958 and 1969. However, in 1972, the Addis Ababa Agreement enforced a peace agreement between the government and separatist southern rebels.\n\nIn 1983, another civil war broke out when the military regime tried to impose Sharia law as part of its overall policy to \u201cIslamicise\u201d all of Sudan. The policy was pushed back by a rebel force called Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army from the south.\n\nThis event marked the end of the 11 years of nationwide peace but didn\u2019t mark the beginning of the conflict-laden nation that we know today. What turned Sudan to a bonafide hotspot, therefore, was the 1989 coup led by Omar al-Bashir, a politically and religiously extreme military leader.\n\nThe then ruling government and the southern opposition were reaching a compromise, but al-Bashir overthrew the government and declared himself chief of staff, prime minister, and chief of the armed forces\u2014positions he occupied for 30 years until 2019 when he was forced to resign.\n\nThe al-Bashir administration, in 1990\u201391, supported Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War. This made Bill Clinton to blacklist and isolate the country, and christen it a rogue state. Clinton also prohibited US investment in the country and reportedly sponsored neighbouring countries to repel Sudanese incursions.\n\nA little over 2 years since al-Bashir vacated the seat, the country is still in a mess. Abdalla Hamdok, the civilian prime minister installed to take the country back to democracy, resigned last week. The resignation that came amid further political deadlock and widespread pro-democracy protests has derailed the country\u2019s fragile transition into democratic rule.\n\nFor 50 years, the political landscape in Sudan has been everything but stable and peaceful.\n\nThis seems like a lot but no Sudanese story will be complete without the mention of years of horrific governments that performed a tribal cleansing on its people, starved and killed children, raped women, and rendered its citizens homeless in their country.\n\nSaeed returned to Sudan in 2014, the same year the international criminal court suspended its case with al-Bashir\u2014after two unsuccessful arrest warrants\u2014because of lack of support from the United Nations Security Council.\n\nSo, when Saeed says that \u201cif anybody built a thriving business in the midst of this persistent chaos that is Sudan, it is the alsoug team,\u201d she is right because it has been done and all the facts are there.\n\nThe vision that drives alsoug is bigger than any bottleneck. Apparently, the same passion that drives the CEO is what drives her employees\u2014building a company that makes life easy for every Sudanese and ushers the country into a prosperous era.\n\nalsoug has positioned itself as the answer to Sudanese intra-country commerce. It has provided a platform to sell and buy; an infrastructure that powers payment; and a logistics arm that fulfils last-mile delivery\u2014the three arms of commerce.\n\nSaeed is giving entrepreneurs in the country\u2019s nascent tech ecosystem and some government officials a fresh set of beliefs in building reputable businesses in the country. However, this is just the beginning because Saeed doesn\u2019t want alsoug to just be a champion in Sudan but also become a household name in Africa, like M-Pesa in Kenya, Flutterwave in Nigeria, Wave in Senegal, and even their major backer, Fawry in Egypt.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "ThankUCash targets the BNPL opportunity in Africa after raising $5.3m seed",
          "text": "Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), a short-term consumer financing that allows shoppers to purchase products online and pay in installments with nominal or no fees, is sweeping the global e-commerce sector. Afterpay, Klarna, Affirm, and Zip are some of the players leading this charge while tech and payments giants Apple, Square, PayPal, and Visa have their respective BNPL initiatives as they look to get a slice of the action.\n\nIn Africa, where most people are credit-averse, BNPL activity is just beginning to pick up. But there\u2019s a sense that consumers on the continent will embrace low or no-interest point-of-sale financing options, going by the rate at which Africans now take on loans at ridiculous interest rates to finance their needs. Last September, Australian company Zip acquired South Africa-based BNPL player Payflex, a deal that indicates Africa may be ripe for buy-now-pay-later services.\n\nA number of companies\u2014including neobanks, payment service providers, and traditional banks\u2014have already launched or are looking to roll out BNPL services in Africa. ThankUCash, a Nigeria-based multi-merchant rewards platform, this week said it has raised $5.3 million in seed funding, part of which it plans to spend on adding BNPL infrastructure to its suite of services, which already includes cashback on purchases and deals from merchants.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have gone into lending and it is gaining traction, but the main issue has been using the loans for other things rather than for why it was obtained,\u201d co-founder and CEO Simeon Ononobi told TechCabal. \u201cSo we had two options: build out the infrastructure for collecting and paying merchants directly (BNPL) or give out the tokens for such ourselves.\u201d\n\nConsidering there are already several companies offering consumer loans, ThankUCash decided to play in the infrastructure side of things. \u201cWe already have a merchant network and we will keep building it out, so why not use and extend that to our merchants?\u201d the CEO said.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThankUCash will provide the tech infrastructure that will connect merchants with loan facilities such that customers can pay directly for goods and services through its Super App, with loans. The company expects to kick off with the Beta \u201cin a few weeks\u201d, according to Ononobi.\n\nIn Nigeria, the majority of existing BNPL services are manual, provided by asset financing companies and sometimes merchants themselves. ThankUCash\u2019s platform will automate this process for its users and merchants. In line with its mission to build infrastructure that powers the emerging industry, Ononobi reveals the startup is currently approaching most players within the space.\n\n\u201cWe will have our machines in stores. So, as customers request loans, we generate a code for it; customers input it into the POS machine and the merchant gets credited directly. The code can only be used in the store chosen and only for the loan amount requested. Ultimately, the customer is buying straight from the merchants,\u201d Ononobi explained in a statement.\n\nThe opportunity to spread payment over an agreed period is sure to appeal to African consumers, especially in Nigeria where paying the total cost of acquiring high-ticket products at once has become more difficult, due to high inflation (currently at over 15%) and declining purchasing power. For merchants, embracing BNPL helps drive sales and bring in new customers.\n\nThankUCash has already signed a partnership with Nigerian fintech Interswitch to onboard all of the latter\u2019s merchants to boost its network. The company is also in talks with \u201cabout 7 other national and multinational banks\u201d for potential partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re opening this infrastructure to everybody and want to actually give that platform to loan companies,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Ononobi, Suraj Supekar (Chief Technology Officer), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP, Engineering), Connected Analytics, the parent company of ThankUCash, currently operates in 3 of Nigeria\u2019s major cities\u2014Lagos, Abuja, and Port-Harcourt\u2014with a staff strength of about 45 employees.\n\nThe startup claims to have recorded over 600,000 users, with more than 1,000 stores on its platform and processed $80 million-plus in transaction volume within 2 years. Part of the fresh capital will be used to scale operations to other cities across Nigeria, expand to Ghana and Kenya, as well as add a new remittance product.\n\nThe ultimate goal for ThankUCash, according to Ononobi, is to create sustainable solutions for small businesses and merchants to succeed while increasing customer buying power. \u201cThe vision for us is not just for our merchants to be happy because they are staying in business and making money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also want to make spending fun, because with us there is always an opportunity for you\u2014be it cashback, deals, BNPL, or remittances.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn December 9, 2021, Technext held the maiden edition of Technext Coinference, a cryptocurrency and blockchain event, in Lagos, Nigeria. Barely a month later, some of the discussions at the event are becoming very key crypto and blockchain innovations to look out for in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe event kicked off with a keynote by the Nigerian Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba.\n\nEven though the Nigerian government has not been particularly fond of cryptocurrencies, Agba made some interesting comments about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. He mentioned use cases for blockchain that could turn the tides in some sectors of the country.\n\nStoring land as NFTs\n\nThe Minister said blockchain technology \u201copens up numerous possibilities for optimisation in our current systems across industries. And could be the biggest disruptor in finance and governance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCiting how blockchain could be harnessed to store real estate information, he said, \u201cin real estate and trade, we can harness blockchain to create and store all lands in their base units of a plot as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\u201d\n\nThis could go a long way in tracking the historical ownership of land on the blockchain. People can own lands and list them for sale the same way they own art on OpenSea, Rarible, and other NFT marketplaces.\n\nHow would it work?\n\nA piece of land has to be tokenised, just like artworks, collectables, and music. Information about the land will be included, and it will be uploaded (minted) on a blockchain.\n\nAccording to Finextra, tokenising real estate could also mean that several people can own a property together, giving more people without the financial wherewithal the opportunity to invest in real estate.\n\nOwning real estate outside the country would also be possible. Buying a house in another country could be as easy as shopping online. Once a property is listed on a marketplace with all the necessary information stored on a blockchain, ownership details go to the buyer. And with the help of smart contracts, third parties would not be needed.\n\nWhile these sound very interesting, Agba believes regulation still has to be put in place.\n\n\u201cTo have a fruitful conversation about the regulation of any industry, it is first important to have an understanding of the structure of governance overseeing the industry .\u201d\n\nThis, however, remains a challenge. The Minister said there is the question of who has the power to regulate cryptocurrency, a decision that can only be reached based on how cryptocurrency is classified \u2014 as a security, currency, or an asset.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto and naira will work together\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R Uzoma Dozie, Sparkle CEO and Buchi Okoro, Quidax CEO. Source: Technext\n\nFor a while, there has been a narrative that cryptocurrencies will replace fiat currencies such as the naira and the dollar. However, Buchi Okoro, CEO of crypto exchange, Quidax, doesn\u2019t think so.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never really had the thought that Bitcoin would replace the naira. I believe that it is supposed to be a collaborative system where crypto works with local currencies to make life better for everybody,\u201d Okoro said.\n\nHe believes fiat currencies will continue to be relevant to finance the same way digital communication will not replace physical communication; they will work together to enhance each other.\n\nOne area crypto will enhance fiat currencies is cross border transactions. This use case has been one of the earliest for cryptocurrencies. A trader in Nigeria, for instance, can swiftly pay his Chinese counterpart with crypto.\n\nOne of the conventional methods of cross border transfers is the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). Transactions on it take up to four days to be completed. Sending via crypto takes a significantly less amount of time with lower fees.\n\nSocial media is going to the metaverse\n\nThe metaverse, NFT, and Web3 were some of the biggest buzzwords of 2021 in the crypto sphere. When social media giant, Facebook, changed its name to Meta, the metaverse got even more attention, and according to Forbes, it is a trillion-dollar revenue opportunity.\n\nDuring a panel session at the Technext Coinference, Okoro said, \u201ca lot of engagements that will happen in the future will happen in the metaverse. The things we do on Twitter and Instagram will be done in the metaverse.\u201d\n\nHe added that it will change the way we interact and how we live day-to-day life. Life as we know it could move to a virtual world. Digital platforms already play a vital role in many aspects of human life.\n\nAlthough Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, did not say Meta\u2019s social media platforms will be turned into a metaverse, he did say, \u201cFrom now on, we will be metaverse-first, not Facebook-first.\u201d\n\nLike most innovations, the metaverse is still at the very early stages, and only a few people have experienced it. But with the commercial perks cited by Forbes, more investments could go into the metaverse, and we could subsequently see it go mainstream.\n\nSolana is the blockchain to watch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHanu Fejiro Abodje, Patricia CEO. Source: Technext\n\nHanu Fejiro Abodje, CEO of alternative payments solution company, Patricia, has indicated an interest in the Solana blockchain, which has been touted as the Ethereum killer.\n\nDuring his keynote address titled, Blockchain for Africa: The endless possibilities, Abodje pointed out how blockchain could disrupt African systems making them secure and more effective.\n\nWhen asked about the interesting platforms on which to build blockchain solutions, Abodje unequivocally pointed out Solana, saying it\u2019s one blockchain that should be paid a lot of attention.\n\nSolana is a decentralised blockchain platform founded in 2017. The chain has been praised for its fast transaction speed of over 2000 transactions per second, compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin that are only capable of about 15 transactions per second.\n\nDespite the rapid transaction speed, the fees are very low, with an average cost per transaction of $000.25.\n\nFast transactions and low fees aren\u2019t the only things that make Solana a blockchain to watch. It brings ease and simplicity to using crypto platforms, reducing the financial barrier of participating in activities such as NFTs and decentralised finance (DeFI).\n\nAfrican NFT project, Afrobubble, was created on the Solana blockchain because of the ease the chain brings to buying and selling NFTs.\n\nAccording to Chainalysis 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index, worldwide adoption jumped over 880%, with Nigeria and Kenya among the top ten countries with the highest adoption rate. If this trend continues, we could see some of these projections come true in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

This is because Twitter, the microblogging platform, has agreed to some conditions that must be met before the end of March 2022.\n\nSome of the conditions are:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter must register as a company in Nigeria\n\nIt must appoint a country representative to serve as a liaison between the company and the federal government\n\nIt must enrol Nigeria in its Partner Support and Law Enforcement Portals\n\nIt must comply with Nigerian tax obligations on its operations.\n\nHave we seen this before? Yes. In India, under the guise of promoting free speech and privacy, Twitter restored the accounts of some journalists and media organisations that the government had ordered suspended in 2021. This, among other things, caused Twitter to clash with the Indian government.\n\nLater that year, however, Twitter agreed to all government conditions imposed due to a lawsuit.\n\nBut now, in Nigeria, why would Twitter agree to some of the conditions imposed by the federal government? I\u2019m quite worried. Do you believe they stood to lose if they didn\u2019t compromise? Isn\u2019t this agreement cause for alarm?\n\nI think now is the right time to go over this again: #TwitterBan update: Should you worry if Twitter succumbs to Nigerian government\u2019s demands?\n\nMost importantly, what does this mean for Nigerians and the federal government in the future?\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole answered my questions and probably some of yours in this article: #Twitterban update: A precedent for future shutdowns?\n\nLipa Later\u2019s $12 million pre-Series A\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nKenyan Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) startup, Lipa Later, has raised $12 million in pre-Series A to expand into Nigeria, Ghana, and Tanzania.\n\nThe round saw participation from Cauris Finance, Lateral Frontiers VC, GreenHouse Capital, SOSV IV LLC, Sayani Investments, and Axian Financial Services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounded in 2018 by Eric Muli and Michael Maina, the company allows retailers to sell goods and services to consumers in affordable monthly instalments.\n\nMoreso, the company\u2019s product offering allows for both online and offline integration with retailers and both online and offline sales platforms, including mobile wallets for consumers.\n\nThe company, which already exists in Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda, claims it has built a reputation for delivering value for its investors right from its early days.

The app\u2019s features include a savings account, deposits, and transfers.\n\nWhy should you care? The company plans to enter eight emerging markets in Africa and Asia, the first of which will be Nigeria, before the end of March 2022.\n\n\u201cOur next market is going to be Nigeria, we have visited Nigeria a couple of times already, and it is one of our favourite countries,\u201d said Dubilet, adding that the launch will likely take place in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nWhile entering Nigeria may increase competition among the country\u2019s neobanks, the company\u2019s plan to use credit cards to provide cheaper and more accessible credit appears shaky.\n\nWith the West African country lacking a sophisticated credit bureau system to detail people\u2019s credit histories, it is unclear how Fintech Farm will operate using credit cards.\n\nBut Dubilet is optimistic, citing the company\u2019s data science teams, which he describes as \u201cone of the best in the world,\u201d to perform some magic.\n\nWhat /I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nCrazily high valuations, investor FOMO, the ripple effects of Y Combinator\u2019s new deal.

From the details of the agreement, the microblogging platform has agreed to some conditions which must be fulfilled before Q1 2022 ends.\n\nTwitter has shown a willingness to register as a company in Nigeria, appoint a country representative to act as a liaison between the company and the Federal Government. In addition to enrolling Nigeria in its Partner Support and Law Enforcement Portals, the company has also agreed to applicable tax obligations on its operations under Nigerian law.\n\nUsers\u2019 reactions\n\nSince the announcement\u2026\n\nWe are pleased that Twitter has been restored for everyone in Nigeria. Our mission in Nigeria & around the world, is to serve the public conversation.\n\nWe are deeply committed to Nigeria, where Twitter is used by people for commerce, cultural engagement, and civic participation.

Going by recent cases, it is commonplace to find these organisations severely sanctioned for violating rules with grey areas.\n\nLocal telecommunications companies are unlikely to push back when orders clearly violating citizens\u2019 fundamental right of access to information are given. Ordinarily, this does not apply to social media sites because they are not under their jurisdiction.\n\nEven though it seems the company might be giving the government too much discretionary power, it chose to negotiate rather than go the litigation route, as was the case in India.\n\nA flawed precedent?\n\nIf any other country has given Twitter a hard time, it\u2019s India. The repression started early in 2021 when, on the premise of promoting free speech and privacy, Twitter restored the accounts of some journalists and media organisations that the government gave the order to deactivate or suspend. Asides from that, the company failed to comply with the country\u2019s IT rules. In the months that followed, Twitter ran into more problems with the government, leading to the police visiting the company\u2019s office in India to serve a notice.\n\nBy July, Twitter agreed to comply with all government conditions following a legal suit fully. The court directed Twitter to issue a statement saying it intends to abide by the rules.\n\nIndia made a scapegoat of Twitter, which became an example for other Big Tech companies. As the government argued, Twitter has lost legal immunity for users\u2019 posts in India. Could this be the Nigerian government\u2019s plan?\n\nIf anything, strong-arming is common with governments that have shown authoritarian traits in the past and global company compliance might only fuel it.\n\nFar from over: Possible tales of \u2018once again\u2019\n\nWhile China is considered the region with the strictest Internet shutdowns, Africa is often regarded as the most volatile environment for social media. Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s history of Internet shutdowns dates back to 2007 with Guinea, and it was only a matter of time before other countries followed suit, with Nigeria joining the trend in 2020.\n\nCurrently, 32 of Africa\u2019s 54 countries have restricted access to the Internet for similar reasons ranging from protests to strikes. Elections, national security, and examinations also present opportunities for restrictions. Specifically, shutdowns have proven to be one of the government\u2019s tools to control information and communication.\n\nIt thus appears that a successful Internet shutdown in a country might result in many more. Ethiopia, for instance, has had 12 Internet shutdowns, and as of 2020, Chad had accumulated almost two and a half years of Internet disruptions within five years.\n\nWhile circumventing social media censorship with VPNs appears to be the easiest way out, the issue of privacy and free speech are still cause for worry.

          "text": "A huge infrastructure deficit, foreign exchange limitations as well as instability in Nigeria\u2019s agricultural heartlands will mean Africa\u2019s most populous nation will struggle to develop new comparative advantages, leaving the hydrocarbons sector responsible for 80-90% of export receipts until 2026, says a new report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, EIU\n\nUndersupply of electricity arising from huge underinvestment is expected to remain an impediment to economic growth, setting the scene for a very challenging time for the president to be elected in 2023.\n\nIn addition, the report says rigidities in the foreign-exchange market will become more pronounced when oil earnings decline (as is expected in 2025\u00ad26). Nigeria\u2019s economic growth will also be tempered by high debt-service costs, a large public-sector wage bill and security expenses elevate the spending profile.\n\nAccording to the report issued at the weekend, \u201cconvertibility restrictions\u2014de facto or de jure\u2014have a record of being imposed during such periods, most recently in 2020.\n\nRead also: Things to watch out for in Nigeria in 2022 \u2013 EIU\n\n\u201cThe risk of a repeat will have a long-term impact on investor confidence, and partly explains our projection that foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows will be equivalent to less than 1% of GDP a year in 2022-26.\u201d\n\nThe EIU expects real GDP growth to rise from an estimated 3% in 2021 to 3.5% in 2022 with growth picking up to an annual average of 3.8% in 2023-24 as credit conditions for the private sector continue to improve with the fiscal deficit narrowing.\n\nHowever, the report says \u201cthese growth rates are well below potential. Elevated domestic interest rates, low FDI, pervasive instability, elevated unemployment and infrastructure deficiencies will curtail dynamism.\n\n\u201cWe expect 2025-26 to be more challenging as oil prices and export volumes fall, the naira is devalued and inflation rises, with growth slipping to an annual average of 1.5% in these years.\u201d\n\nWhile the analysts at the EIU ranks the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) a major revamp of the oil sector, \u201coperating costs for onshore and shallow-water basins in Nigeria is high, exacerbated by instability.\n\n\u201cRoyal Dutch Shell is already pursuing divestment of such assets in a push towards a greener portfolio, and other majors could follow.\n\n\u201cAs domestic oil companies would be unable to match the investment power of outgoing oil majors, and despite offshore exploration investment as a result of the PIA, Nigerian crude output is expected to stay below 2011-14 highs.\n\nThe new law outlaws fuel subsidies in Nigeria, but the EIU says While \u201cthe government says that it will end petrol subsidies in early 2022, but we continue to assume that price liberalisation will only take place on a sustained basis after the elections in early 2023.\u201d\n\nAfter subsidies are lifted in 2023 and NNPC Ltd becomes fully commercialised, the downstream industry could become economically viable, which may allow Nigeria to eliminate petrol imports as a 650,000-barrel/day mega-refinery near Lagos comes on stream in 2022.\n\nThis, the EIU says will ease pressure on Nigeria\u2019s external balance and the naira by the middle of the forecast period.",

          "title": "2023 presidency: Who goes for the Igbo nation?",
          "text": "With about a year to the 2023 presidential election in Nigeria, political actors are already realigning and strategising ahead. This could be noticed in the last few weeks in the number of aspirants that have either made their intention to contest the presidency public, directly or indirectly.\n\nHowever, one issue that has remained contentious in recent years is the zoning of the presidency and which region should produce a successor to incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari in May next year.\n\nMany people of the southeast geo-political zone and their sympathisers from other parts of the country have argued that it is desirable to allow the Igbo nation to produce the next president.\n\nBut pundits say that the average Igbo man could be irritating when consideration is all about public interest or the common good. His republican nature, which has been his greatest undoing in the contraption called Nigeria, is always at play, restless, self-seeking, and blind to the bigger picture. It is all about self or nothing.\n\nPerhaps, the saying is true that the Igbo man is not a good politician because, as it is said, he enters the political chess game without tact and fails to see the power in number and greater gain in collaboration.\n\nGradually but steadily, the race towards 2023 presidential election that would expectedly right the wrongs of government, has begun and the contestation which should now be at the level of consultations, discussions, and alignment of forces, has already been taken to the market place.\n\nAnd, too early in the day, the Igbo nation and its hapless people are already burdened with confusion as to who goes for them as president. This is because, apparently without talking to themselves nor their next-door neighbours, some Igbo sons have joined the fray, all wanting to be president.\n\nAmbition is noble but could be ignoble when it is inordinate. Like aspiration, it is a virtue when it is planned and coordinated more so, when it relates to power which, in all ages and at all times, is not served on a platter but struggled for. The Igbo seems to think, erroneously, that power is going to be willed to him.\n\nThe zoning clamour is still raging. While the southeast still asks other zones to allow equity and fairness to take their pride of place, it does not seem the plea is getting the desired response or consideration.\n\nAspirants from other zones are already in the ring which is good reason and bold enough handwriting on the wall for Ndigbo to come together to ask the right questions: where do we go from here; who goes for us and how will he get there?\n\nNdigbo does not seem to be making any strong plan for power shift. Already, they have continued with the individualistic and selfish politics that has been their nemesis. Instead of sitting down to pick one or two persons to go as David or Goliath, everybody wants to be president all by themselves.\n\nWhose interest are those who want to be president out to serve? Did they sincerely ask themselves questions as to whether they are truly the messiah the Igbo nation has been waiting for; have they weighed the consequences of multiple aspirants in a complex society like Nigeria?\n\nRead also: APC gambles with 2023 as convention controversy persists\n\nHave they reasoned that multiple aspirants give the Igbo nation away as an unserious contender; that the little sentiments and consideration and even sympathy to zone the presidency to the region could be whittled down by this uncoordinated mode of aspiration?\n\nAlready, about five aspirants from the region, including Sam Ohuabunwa, Anyim Pius Anyim, David Umahi, Kingsley Moghalu, and Orji Uzor Kalu have indicated interest and expressed readiness to run.\n\nIf Nigerians are talking about governors who, in the last six years, have left footprints on the sands of time, David Umahi will not be in the number. He will be remembered, though, for always singing the praises of a captain whose ship is sinking in an angry and turbulent sea yet chooses to do nothing.\n\nMore than ever before, the Igbo nation needs to fight together/pull resources together to be able to fight money bags like Atiku Abubakar and Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The Igbo race does not have money-bag politicians yet. So, it has to be collaborative work to make any impact. The cacophony of voices we are hearing now, apparently coming from the wilderness, is not the right approach to making that impact.\n\nGeorge Obiozor, President-General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the apex Igbo socio-cultural group, the other day called on Ndi-Igbo to get it right this time by forging a common front in order to the needed mileage and support from other Nigerians to lead the country in 2023.\n\nThe former Nigerian ambassador, who reacted to recent declarations, is of the opinion that streamlining the number of aspirants from the beginning will help reposition the zone.\n\nObiozor added that the statistics on past presidents and the creation of states and local government areas as well as the National Assembly have shown that the zone deserves more.\n\nHe said: \u201cDefinitely, the idea of the President of Nigeria from Igboland is an idea whose time has come. It is politically and morally justifiable. As a matter of fact, it is important that at this time in the history of Nigeria, we will take reasonable decisions in order to heal the nation; give every part of the country a sense of belonging, stop the bickering and reunite the country, and reinvigorate the spirit of nationalism.\n\n\u201cTo be candid, we in Igboland are also ready to give you candidates and presidential aspirants that are competent, nationalistic, with the capacity to perform, with evidence of what they have done and what they can do for the rest of the country.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we are ready and all we are asking the nation is to obey the law of rotation in our history, which has been North and South and which created the balance \u2013 a political balance that has held our country together.\u201d\n\nIn his view, Chijioke J. Umelahi, a former Abia State lawmaker, thinks 2023 will present an opportunity for the Igbo nation to change the narratives that Igbos are not united and cannot organise themselves.\n\n\u201cFor a successful shot at the presidency in 2023, the Igbo nation needs a harmonised approach, which may not come easy, but it is very possible. The aspirants should bear in mind that it is not for self-enrichment, but going to Aso Rock is to seek the political and economic emancipation of the people in the zone and Nigeria at large,\u201d Umelahi said.\n\nThe former Abia lawmaker, who is aspiring for the ticket to the House of Representatives in 2023, said that getting Igbos together is simple by aligning with aspirants who always stand for the Igbo interest, and not undermining the power of influencers across the zone, whether security, market leaders, religious or community.\n\n\u201cI think we should do things differently this time. Those the Igbos trust to protect their interests should go for them. Let us put Igbo interest first, not party or state of origin. It worked in Anambra, and it worked in Imo, that\u2019s why haters of the Igbo nation were not happy and decided to use the Supreme Court against our collective interest in Imo State,\u201d Umelahi said.\n\nTerming it \u2018Igbo Emancipation 2023\u2019, Chigbu Onumah, a lawyer and activist based in Onitsha, Anambra State, noted that the 2023 ambition is achievable for the Igbo nation and that streamlining, fielding a credible candidate, and reaching out to other Nigerians with fairness message will help the Igbos occupy Aso Rock in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying other parts of Nigeria cannot rule, we have voted for aspirants from other parts of the country, now we ask for them to support us because, if it is \u2018One Nigeria\u2019, then the Igbos, who joined in the fight for Independence and who have contributed hugely to the development of the country, should be given a chance. If you don\u2019t, you are legitimising their agitation for Biafra\u201d, Onumah disclosed.\n\nSam Onikoyi, a Nigerian historian and Commonwealth researcher based in Brussels, supported Onumah\u2019s views, saying that fairness should be the watchword.\n\n\u201cIn democracy, nobody or region has monopoly of power, every party to the democratic arrangement should have a sense of belonging and I think the Igbos should be given a chance this time\u201d, he said.\n\nIn the case where any of the major political parties does not field an Igbo candidate, Umelahi said, the Igbos will boycott the election.\n\nOnikoyi thinks that it would encourage agitation, while Onumah warned that it would impede the development of the country as no country can thrive in injustice.\n\nWith about a year to the 2023 presidential election in Nigeria, political actors are already realigning and strategising ahead. This could be noticed in the last few weeks in the number of aspirants that have either made their intention to contest the 2023 presidency public, directly or indirectly.\n\nThough zoning is unconstitutional in Nigeria, political leaders say it is necessary due to the heterogeneous nature of the country to address complaints of marginalisation and domination and give equal power to ethnic groups.\n\nIn the last few years, there have been agitations for an Igbo presidency among leaders of the South-East; they say it is the turn of the region to rule after the expiration of Buhari\u2019s tenure.\n\nThe debate that the presidency should move to the South-East in 2023 has gained momentum in recent months, though political watchers say that the South-East has a strong case to present; the region is the only geopolitical zone in the South that had not produced a president or vice-president on any political party platform since 1999.\n\nLast year, Chekwas Okorie, a notable political leader in the region, told BusinessDay in an interview that the South-East had met and resolved that any political party that fielded candidates from the region would get massive votes and support from all Igbo\u2019s across the country.\n\n\u201cWe have resolved that any party that gives the presidential ticket to Igbo man in 2023 would get the votes of Igbo\u2019s massively across the country and that is our priority ahead of the 2023 election,\u201d he said.\n\nHe had warned the two major parties in the country that the region was tired of being used and abandoned, adding that it would not accept any position other than the presidency from the two major parties in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIgbo presidency is very realisable; it is far more realisable in 2023 than any other time. It is conventional but not in the constitution, even though that rotation is in the PDP constitution and in APC where I belong it is becoming a bit difficult to convince Nigerians that after eight years of President Buhari that another Northern would want to continue from there.\u201d\n\nThus, political observers say it may perhaps be an illusion to think that other regions would give the presidency on a platter of gold to the South-East, which could be seen in the increasing number of aspirants from other parts of the country who are daily declaring their interest in the presidency in 2023.\n\nHowever, with a growing number of aspirants emerging from the South-East, there are fears among observers that, just like in the past the dream may not be actualisable without a proper synergy and strategy.\n\nThey say there was a need for a united front and a consensus arrangement for a candidate that would fly the flag of the region in the presidential election.\n\nSimilarly, some political analysts have warned that the Igbo presidency may not become reality if the promoters of the agenda continue to tag it \u2018Igbo Presidency \u2018 because it would sound as if whoever emerges from the region would only serve the interest of the region.\n\n\u201cWhat I expect the promoters to say or canvass for is credible, competent and a nationalist as a president who should come from the Southeast. Yes, I agree that the Southeast is marginalised in terms of power-sharing and rotation but the region\u2019s leaders will need to be careful on the way they are tagging the agenda,\u201d political scientist Kunle Okunade said.\n\nOkunade added that the feasibility of the agenda lies in the hands of the political leaders from the extraction, their ability to negotiate further with other vested interests and factors in the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThey would need to negotiate and permutation across boards and mainstream political parties. Their emergence at the primaries of the political parties would determine how far their agenda can be realistic in 2023.\n\n\u201cThe Igbo political leaders still need to re-permutate properly and strategically so as to benefit from any crisis in the mainstream political parties ahead2023.\u201d\n\nAlso, Adeoye Adelaja, public affairs analyst, said that though the South-East should be given the opportunity to lead this country, he would only support a president that has the interest of all Nigerians at heart.\n\nAdeoye, however, warned that such a dream may be a mirage if the region cannot speak with one voice and galvanise themselves.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFor the project to become a reality, the entire South-East must first unite and speak in one voice, anything other than that would just be a waste of time.\n\n\u201cIn all fairness, Nigerians from the southeast should be given the opportunity to lead this country, but I am not in support of what seems like ethnopolitical coloration to the name called Igbo Presidency. What we need is a Nigerian President.\n\n\u201cI believe this will to a large extent douse the tension being experienced from the region. The challenge is that South Easterners must speak with one voice and negotiate with other regions so that the presidential bid can be possible.\u201d\n\nThe major factors that should determine who emerges as president are the capacity, competence, and character of such individuals, which I believe can be found in the region. Nigeria should be governed on the basis of fairness, equity, and justice so that every part of the country will have a sense of belonging.\n\n\u201cSo, for the project to become a reality, the entire southeast must first unite and speak in one voice, anything other than that would just be a waste of time.\n\n\u201cThere are aspirants from various parts of the country who would not respect the principle of rotation or zoning because they believe they have what it takes to clinch a ticket and win regardless of the principle of fair play,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) is gambling with the 2023 general election as the controversies surrounding the February National Convention are drifting the party to an implosion that would validate the warning of President Muhammadu Buhari about its imminent defeat.\n\nApparently worried by the crisis in his party as a result of the delay in the fixing of the exact date and venue for the convention as the February timeline approaches, Buhari warned that if APC does not settle its disagreements before its convention, the opposition, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) could take over in 2023.\n\nThe President at a recent interview on the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) said: \u201cIf the party cannot agree, then the opposition will take over\u201d while lamenting the pre-convention crisis rocking the party.\n\n\u201cWhat did the PDP do?

If the APC can\u2019t agree on the convention, the opposition will naturally take over,\u201d he said.\n\nBut more than a week after Buhari\u2019s warning, the crisis has continued to fester with more divisions even amongst the APC Governors some of whom are believed to be no longer happy with the Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party led by their colleague, Governor of Yobe State, Mai-Mala Buni.\n\nIt has been reliably gathered that division amongst the Progressive Governors was responsible for the postponement of their meeting scheduled last Sunday to iron out issues and probably set the date for the convention as some of them are at daggers drawn to have their biddings done at the convention.\n\nThe aborted meeting was announced by a ranking member of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) and\n\nPlateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, at the end of a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nSince then, there has been an uneasy calm amongst not just the Governors but other leaders of the party, including aspirants, especially those for the position of the National Chairman whose fate is at the moment hanging after they have carried out consultations across the country.\n\nWhile the Caretaker has not set date and venue for the convention, there is a subsisting suit filed by some aggrieved members of the party to stop the exercise on grounds that state congresses are yet to be completed in all the 36 states of the federation.\n\nRead also: APC group faults Tinubu, Umahi, others over declaration for 2023 presidency\n\nIn the suit filed against the planned February convention, five aggrieved party members sued the APC, Yobe State Governor, Buni, and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), as the defendants.\n\nThe plaintiffs \u2013 Suleiman Usman, Muhammed Shehu, Samaila Isahaka, Idris Isah and Audu Emmanuel \u2013 through the suit dated January 4, 2022, urged the court to restrain the Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee from going ahead with the scheduled convention.\n\nThis led to media reports last week that the APC convention would hold in June, confirming speculations and insinuations that the Caretaker is plotting to serve out the tenure of the dismissed former National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole which is to expire in June.\n\nThis was however, denied by the APC CECPC Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe who called on the general public to \u201ccompletely disregard fake news on the reported suspension of the planned National Convention\u201d, assuring the public that the CECPC \u201cis already embarking on consultations with party stakeholders to prepare the ground for a rancour-free National Convention.\u201d\n\nBut the Director General of PGF, Salihu Lukman asked the Caretaker to stop lying to Nigerians and APC members as all consultations about organising the Convention ended with the meeting of APC Governors with President Muhammadu Buhari on November 22, 2021.\n\nHe said the CECPC should also stop claiming that it is waiting for the meeting of Progressive Governors before it takes all the necessary decisions to commence the process of organising the Convention.\n\nLukman stressed that such a claim is not only dishonest but also taking the support of Progressive Governors for granted, which is why Progressive Governors have been reduced to punching bags of all party members regarding all the challenges facing the party.\n\nHe said: \u201cProgressive Governors, like all party members will not associate themselves with any act of disrespect to decisions validly taken in consultations with President Buhari. They will not take the responsibility of actions or inactions of the CECPC. Every responsibility of organising the Convention is vested with the CECPC.\u201d\n\nThe Director General of Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) urged the Mai-Mala Buni-led CECPC to resign\n\nin the event that it is unable to implement the decision to hold the Convention in February 2022, as decided, to save the APC, its leaders, including Governors) and members from the current spate of avoidable public embarrassment.\n\nLukman observed that the CECPC has no respect for President Buhari, which is responsible for why they are doing everything possible to sabotage decisions validly taken to hold the APC National Convention in February after consultation with the President.\n\nHe said the failure of the APC Caretaker Committee to announce any date and venue for the National Convention in that latest statement is a slap on the face of Nigerians and an insult on party members.\n\n\u201cOn November 22, 2021, the Chairman of PGF His Excellency Abubakar Atiku Bagudu led a delegation, which include the CECPC Chairman, His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni, to President Buhari to finalise consultations on the date of the Convention. Immediately after the meeting with President Buhari, His Excellency Bagudu announced the agreement reached with President Buhari to the effect that the Convention will hold in February 2022.\n\n\u201cWith such an agreement, the responsibility of the CECPC is to go ahead and start organising the Convention. With almost two months after, the CECPC has not issued any notice of the Convention to anyone. Not even the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), which by the provision of the Electoral Act as amended is required to be given at least 21 days\u2019 notice.\n\n\u201cThe truth must be told, the responsibility of organising the February 2022 APC National Convention rests squarely with the CECPC. At this point, it will be necessary to remind all members of the CECPC and by extension all leaders of APC that part of the reasons that made it very necessary to dissolve the Comrade Adams Oshiomhole led National Working Committee (NWC) was the disrespect for leaders and members of the party, especially by Comrade Oshiomhole, the former National Chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cThe CECPC leadership have returned the party back to mode of open disrespect for any recommendation given. It is even worse now given that the CECPC is ready to sacrifice the future of the party. Clearly, what is staring us in the face is that all the bad leadership records under Comrade Oshiomhole led NWC is about to be met and outstripped by the present CECPC,\u201d said.\n\nMeanwhile, sources close to the CECPC confided in BusinessDay that the Committee will be meeting on Tuesday this week to constitute sub-committees for the convention and fixe the date for the exercise.\n\n\u201cThe Caretaker Committee is meeting on Tuesday to set up sub-committees and also put the date for the convention to settle the matter hence the issue is bringing so much misunderstanding in our party. The Caretaker, especially Governor Buni doesn\u2019t want to take what President Buhari said on NTA for granted\u201d, the source said, pleading for anonymity.\n\nAkpanudoedehe had on December 20 the meeting of CECPC said the Committee resolved to setup sub-committees on budgeting and other relevant structures for the February National Convention.",

We don\u2019t need that central model. We don\u2019t need a central hospital any more. What we need are decentralised health clinics with Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCs) across the state, which will be the first point of contact for patients.\n\n\u201cIt is only based on reference from these units that you now come to a specialist hospital.

We will be having additional services, including oncology, cardiology, nephrology, physiotherapy and rehabilitation therapy.\n\n\u201cWe have identified the spots for all these services and it will run 24 hours.

          "title": "2023: Reconcile with Igbo youths \u2013 Elliot Uko appeals to Southeast leaders",
          "text": "Founder of Igbo Youth Movement (IYM), Evangelist Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, has appealed to the political leaders and elders of Igbo land to make effort to reconcile with the youths with a view to establishing unity of purpose, especially as the country prepares for election in 2023.\n\nUko, the Secretary of Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA), who made the plea to the leaders at the weekend, pointed out that the younger generation, who have been the most affected by the marginalisation of Ndigbo, have since lost of confidence in their leaders who in their estimation, have failed to do something about their situation.\n\n\u201cIf nobody told them, and they are incidentally unaware, methinks it\u2019s high time our regional leaders are told in no uncertain terms, that Ndigbo are thoroughly ashamed of the state of affairs in our region today, and that Ndigbo do not consist only of the tiny cabal of ex this and ex that, who actually constitute less than one percent of the population but insist on determining the fate of the Igbo race. Something they\u2019ve done for about half a century now, with dire consequences as proof of their great \u201ccommitment\u201d, talents and \u201cdedication,\u201d\u201d Uko said.\n\n\u201cThe disheartening condition of Igboland is testimony of their wonderful leadership for decades now. They must also be told that about 76% of Ndigbo population are below 50 years old. With more than 50 percent of them under 39. Have they ever wondered how they are perceived by the angry younger generation? Do they ever worry about the state of infrastructure in Igboland, the lack of job opportunities, the wave of migration out of the zone and the damaging effect of the long standing marginalisation and humiliation of our people on the psyche of the younger generation?\u201d\n\nAccording to Uko, if the Igbo political leaders were up to their responsibilities, they could have prevented the emerging separatist crisis in the zone, which he said started 22 years ago, even as he wondered why the factionalization of Ohanaeze Ndigbo is being allowed.\n\nHe therefore, called on them to make strategic efforts to win back the trust and confidence of the youths ahead of the 2023 general election in the overall interest of the Igbo quest for president.\n\n\u201cIf our leaders spared a thought for the people, they would not allow and condone factionalization of Ohanaeze. They would not have delayed in offering sincere suggestions to the solution to the 22 year old agitation ravaging our land and waiting until things get really bad, before raising their voice. They would have presented the truth to the central authorities long before now. They would have been loudly asking questions, how come a standard gauge modern railway was hurriedly constructed to Niger Republic, whereas South East Nigeria, known for trade and commerce, with terrible roads, left to their fate,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cThey would have endeavoured to show the younger generation that they are truly committed to the development of the region by fighting for at least one seaport in the zone. An inland container port will transform the region and explode commercial activities. The younger generation are educated, suave, urbane, articulate and social media savvy. They are aware of development strides in other regions of the world. They remain greatly disappointed with our leaders, moreso, with the obvious but saddening disposition of our leaders, that they alone know all things.\n\n\u201cIt is not true that ascendance to political leadership suddenly transforms people into geniuses overnight, who automatically become omniscient, knowing all things, things in heaven, things on earth and things beneath the earth. That holding political office turns people into perfect beings, saints and angels who cannot be advised or even criticized. That all the youths, activists and the entire masses are morons who know absolutely nothing because they aren\u2019t in Government. It\u2019s not true that our leaders have done excellently well within the last 50 years and therefore should be elevated to deities and supreme beings and are above reproach. What is true rather, is that the leadership cadre should ask themselves : how come our younger generation lost confidence in us? How come they don\u2019t trust us? How come a very large chunk of them lost faith in the system? What went wrong? It is only in sincerely seeking answers to these troubling questions, that we will stumble on the truth. The self-preservation and self advancement inclination present in our DNA and genes may have pushed us over the brink to the point we unwittingly hurt and offended our children. Our leaders need to do the right things now, to regain the respect of their children.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the inability of the leaders to understand the younger generation, whom he said have borne the brunt of marginalisation, contributed immensely to the emerging challenges.\n\nAccording to him, a change of approach had become necessary, as there is need to begin to mobilize the younger generation to register and get voters cards ahead of the election next year.\n\n\u201cStruggling to prove that we are always right and our children always wrong, hasn\u2019t helped. From the military era, to the 1999-2022 democratic experiment, our youth population have been totally and completely sidelined as if they don\u2019t matter. Fit only as political thugs, nothing more. No large-scale impactful skills acquisition, further education or arts, sports or entertainment programmes, to engage, sharpen or occupy our leaders of tomorrow,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey have borne the brunt of the serial oppression of our people over the years. Abandoned and utterly left to their devices, even as politicos provocatively pounded our streets in state-of-the art SUVs, suggesting to them to go to hell, they decided to take their destiny into their hands. When they, out of frustration began to let off steam and vent their anger, agitating for attention, they were shot at, and ignored for 22 years.\n\n\u201cEverybody heaps all the blame on them, while our leaders insist they are the best leaders in the world, and our youths, the worst youths in the world. That isn\u2019t true. Our youth has been blackmailed for too long. Our leaders must engage them now and work with them. Tagging them miscreants and criminals will not bring peace, harmony, resolution and closure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that people angling to lead Nigeria come 2023, cannot convince their masses, especially their younger generation, to register and vote. If all eligible Igbo voters register and vote, Ndigbo could boast of over 25 million votes and nobody can lead Nigeria without them. Incidentally, millions of Igbo youths are angry with Nigeria, and don\u2019t want to hear about Nigerian elections, and we still insist on calling them miscreants. My question: If a large chunk of our people refuse to vote in Nigerian elections and we refuse to engage and placate them, who will vote the Igbo Presidential candidate in? Are we actually depending on the Fulani, Yoruba or Kanuri to vote in the Igbo candidate into Aso rock? We will be making fools of ourselves, if we can\u2019t put our home in order, counting on the Hausa to vote an Igbo as President. Our youths are aggrieved, our activists are hounded, Ohanaeze is factionalised, even as millions of our people aren\u2019t interested in queuing and voting.\n\n\u201cWhy do we refuse to do our homework. This plea to our leaders is real and urgent. May we not disgrace ourselves as a people.\u201d",

          "title": "Why Two-thirds Of Lawmakers May Not Return To NASS",
          "text": "The trend where roughly 67 percent of members of the National Assembly do not make it back to the legislative body after every general election cycle is set to continue in 2023 as obstacles mount against sitting lawmakers.\n\nThe most notable of these obstacles are the failed attempts by the lawmakers to make direct primaries a must for political parties in picking flagbearers for electives offices, the growing number of party factions at the state level, which will likely lead to litigations with uncertain outcomes, and lawmakers who are planning to contest for other offices.\n\nIn the 2015 general election, for example, 70 of the 109 senators did not make back to the Senate while more than 250 members of the House of Representatives failed in their return bids.\n\nThe numbers were slightly better in 2019 as 45 senators and 209 House members made it back to the National Assembly. The 2010 Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 was meant to give the lawmakers a fighting chance against the dictates of state governors who control the party structures. President Muhammadu Buhari, however, rejected the bill late last year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBy LEADERSHIP Sunday\u2019s count, at least 18 senators are not planning to recontest their seats in the 2023 general elections; they are instead eyeing the governorship race in their respective states.\n\nThese include senators in Taraba, Bauchi, Kano, Plateau, Rivers, Delta, Cross River, Abia, Ebonyi, Ekiti and Oyo. In Taraba, it is all three senators of the state, while in Bauchi, Delta, Cross River and Oyo, no fewer than two senators are looking to contest for governor. And Ekiti where the governorship election will come up in June 2022, lawmakers in contention will not have to give up their seats at the National Assembly.\n\nCoupled with senators giving up their seats, the failed attempts to amend the electoral act now means that the path of every lawmaker to retaining their party ticket is through the government house in each state capital. In some cases, it is the governors themselves that want to go to the Senate while a number of their aides are campaigning for the lower chamber of the National Assembly. In virtually every state, governors\u2019 aides are lining up to replace current members of both the Senate and House of Representatives and, in some cases, even state assemblies.\n\nThe challenge is just as steep for lawmakers in the opposition parties facing popular candidates from within and hostile governors in the ruling party. In some, senatorial and House of Representative seats are determined by micro-zoning between constituencies, which changes after every election cycle.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis has largely contributed to the high turnover of lawmakers at the National Assembly since 1999 and has also eliminated some sitting lawmakers from the 2023 general elections. Here is a state-by-state analysis on how political events are playing out in the contest for party tickets.\n\nUzodimma In Search of Okorocha\u2019s Replacement\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC), Imo State Chapter, presents a picture of uncertainty, disunity and fierce acrimony as each faction seems combat ready to confront each other frontally. The battle for supremacy between Senator Frank Ibezim of APC representing Okigwe Senatorial zone (Imo North) and Senator Ifeanyi Ararume seems to resonate everyday as both parties are still bent on slugging it out.\n\nFor Senator Ararume it is not over until it is all over. The APC Senatorial ticket for Ararume is a walkover if the battle is left between him and Ibezim. However, Ibezim is lucky to have the backing of the governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodimma, coupled with the support of the minister of state for education, Dr Emeka Nwajiuba. The governor and the minister joined forces to wrest the ticket from Ararume\u2019s hands and the ripples generated by the controversy still rage. Uzodimma is bent on controlling the party in the state and is ready to overcome any obstacle in actualising this dream.\n\nThe governor is interested in having all the three Senatorial zones of the Senate in APC. Consequently, a business magnate and philanthropist, Alex Mbata, has been thrown up to challenge the PDP representative in the Senate, Onyewuchi Ezenwa, who represents Owerri zone (Imo East) in the Senate. Backed by the governor, Mbata is hoping to trash Senator Onyewuchi come 2023 senatorial election.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMbata is conversant with the system and, having created structures within Owerri zone, could be set to take over power in 2023. Mbata has gained popularity among the people through the initiation of empowerment programme and the party is ready to buy into this project due to the people-oriented gesture.\n\nThe Orlu Zone Senatorial seat is occupied former governor Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha of the APC, who paradoxically is bent on consolidating strong hold to the Orlu Senatorial throne. Having governed the state for eight years, he is believed to have fashioned a workable methodology for grasping and mastering the Imo political scenario.\n\nOkorocha for now does not have any challenger to the Orlu senatorial ticket. This is probably due to his political sagacity and manoeuvering which scare other intending contestants.\n\nHowever, the running battle between Uzodimma and Senator Okorocha may work against the incumbent senator as the governor is searching for an aspirant that has the capacity to challenge Senator Okorocha. While the search continues, the former governor holds strongly as the political colossus in Imo political landscape.\n\nThe House of Representatives seats in Imo state are occupied by politicians who are aware that you need the people and personalities to succeed.\n\nThe Ehime Mbano-Ihitte-Uboma representative in the House of Representatives, Hon. Chike Okafor understands the political chess board of the state and realigned to the present realities in the state, as the governor calls the shots and he who pays the piper dictates the tune.\n\nHon. Okafor thrives in empowering the constituent and leverages on his goodwill to win the hearts of the populace, having penetrated the structure in his constituency. And with the backing of the governor, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for any challenger to displace him come 2023 election.\n\nIkpeazu, Abaribe Could Trade Places\n\nThe three senators from Abia State, namely Enyinnaya Abaraibe (South) and Theodore Orji (Central) both of PDP, and Orji Uzor Kalu (North) of APC are serving their fourth, second and first terms respectively.\n\nJust recently, Abaraibe announced his interest in the governorship of the state, but if he changes his mind and wishes to return to the Red Chamber, he may have to contend with Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, who is said to have an eye for the seat.\n\nOther challengers could be Barr F. N. Nwosu, a 2015 and 2019 governorship aspirant, and Rep Nkem Abonta, the fourth-term representative of Ukwa East/Ukwa West federal constituency of the state.\n\nJust like Abaribe, T.A. Orji, a former chief staff to then Governor Kalu and two-term governor of the state himself, has indicated at different occasions that he would step down in 2023.\n\nHowever, if his \u201cconstituents prevail in him to return,\u201d he is likely going to face Senator Nkechi Nwogu, Chidi Ajaegbu, and Rep Solomon Adaele from the Ngwa divide of the senatorial district.\n\nKalu, the chief whip of the Senate, recently said he would run for president if it is zone to the South East, but would no doubt contest the Senate seat again if he scales through his APC hurdles.\n\nFourth and second term Reps Nkeiruka Onyejeocha and Uko Nkole of Umunneochi/Isuikwuato and Arochukwu/Ohafia federal constituencies respectively and, the deputy governor, Ude Oko Chukwu, may pose threats to the ambition.\n\nSimilarly, having represented Arochukwu/Ohafia federal constituency from 1999 -2003 and the district from 2015-2019, Senator Mao Ohuabunwa is still a serious obstacle to the former governor of the state.\n\nFor Ben Kalu, the first term representative of Bende federal constituency, it has gone past the realm of speculation that Chimobi Anyaso will give him a tough battle for the seat.\n\nAnyaso, the first runner-up to Anyaso in the 2019 general election, has since then been visibly competing for recognition with the lawmaker space-for-space across the constituency.\n\nAnother representative from the state, who is likely to be challenged, is second term lawmaker, Adaele of Obingwa/Osisioma/Ugwunagbo federal constituency. He may have already started looking over his shoulder for the chief press secretary to the governor, Barr Onyebuchi Ememanka.\n\nAs for Darlington Nwokocha of Isiala Ngwa North/Isiala Ngwa South federal constituency, a second term lawmaker, Hon Ginger Onwusibe of Isiala Ngwa state constituency, and the commissioner for Local Government and Chieftancy Affairs, Prince Chris Enweremadu, may want to shove him aside.\n\nUgwuanyi Fixes Gaze On Presidential, VP, Senatorial Tickets\n\nEnugu State has three senatorial zones and the three persons representing the zones are Senator Chimaraoke Nnamani (Enugu East), Senator Chuwuka Utazi (Enugu North) and Senator Ike Ekweremadu (Enugu West).\n\nAlthough Nnamani, who was a former governor of Enugu, is a household name in his senatorial zone, it is expected that many people will contest against him come 2023. Among those is Senator Gilbert Nnaji, and a former chairman of the APC in the state, Ben Nwoye, among others. But Nnamani has the brightest chance to be re-elected in 2023.\n\nIn Enugu West Senatorial Zone, a former Deputy Senate President and current senator representing the zone, Ike Ekweremadu, may slug it out with a former governor of Enugu State, Sullivan Chime in 2023. Apart from Chime, others who may also contest for the seat are Barrister AOU Onyema but Ekweremadu has the brightest chance to win if he decides to re-contest.\n\nPerhaps the zone that will be the centre of the greatest battle is Enugu North Senatorial Zone where the incumbent governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, hails from. The senator representing the zone is Chukwuka Utazi. A member of the House of Representatives, Pat Asadu, may also contest the senatorial seat. There is also speculation that Ugwuanyi may also settle for the Senate in the event he fails to get the presidential or vice-presidential positions.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, Hon. Asadu Patrick, represents Nsukka/Igbo Eze South Federal constituency. He is likely to be challenged by Barrister George Ogara, a former governorship candidate of the APC.\n\nOgara is a grassroots politician but those following political happenings in the federal constituency are of the view that Asadu is well rooted and will easily win if he decides to re-contest.\n\nGovernor Umahi Versus 3 PDP Senators In Ebonyi\n\nIn Ebonyi State, the three senators representing the South, Central and North Senatorial zones of the state all belong to the opposition PDP and are the major financers of the party.\n\nSince the defection of the Ebonyi State Governor David Umahi to the ruling APC, Senators Obinna Ogba (Ebonyi Central), Michael Nnachi (Ebonyi South) and Sam Egwu Ebonyi (North) took the responsibility of paying party executives and other stakeholders, and as of today, it is not clear if any person within the party will challenge them in the forthcoming general election.\n\nObviously, the senators do not have the backing of the state governor as supporting their return to the red chamber amounts to anti-party activity.\n\nThe senators enjoy the backing of the party in the state having during the last PDP congresses in the state ensured that candidates of their choice emerged as ward, local government and state executives, thereby paving way for themselves ahead of the primary election in the state. They also enjoy popularity within their local government areas and the same cannot be said of the generality of the senatorial zones as they might face an uphill task in the general election since their major contenders from the other political parties also enjoy popularity in their own local government and senatorial zones.\n\nJust like the senators, the House of Representatives members, apart from the member representing Ikwo/Ezza South Federal Constituency, all belong to the PDP.\n\nApart from Hon Anayo Nwonu who has declared his intention to run for the governorship position of the state, and Senator Obinna Ogba, who also on January 1, 2022 made known his plans to also run for governorship of the state, many of the would-be aspirants are yet to make their intentions known.Senator Shettima Looking Safe In Borno\n\nFor Borno Central Senatorial District, which former governor of the state, Kashim Shettima, is representing at the upper chamber of the National Assembly, no challenger has been identified to face him in 2023, even though nobody knows if Shettima wants to return.\n\nBut since there is still time before the elections, pundits are of the belief that a challenger will emerge as time draws nearer. Shettima\u2019s relationship with the incumbent governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum whom Shettima handed over power to, will play a great role should any challenger emerge.\n\nFor Senator Ali Ndume who represents Southern Borno Senatorial District at the National Assembly, his return to the Senate for the third time would be a herculean task as people of his constituency might be in need of a change in representation.\n\nAlthough, Ndume has a cordial relationship with Governor Zulum, the emergence of two challengers for his seat might spell trouble for him.\n\nNotwithstanding, Bamanga Buba, one of the Ndume\u2019s challengers, is a new entrant to the political terrain of Borno, while Alhaji Idris Durkwa, another Ndume\u2019s challenger, is a force to reckon with.\n\nIdirs contested the 2019 gubernatorial elections at the party primary of the APC alongside the present Governor Zulum who won the primary. His outing in that election was not a bad one, as Borno stood still on his arrival from Abuja to declare his ambition. Idris lost the primary gallantly.\n\nAs for the Senator representing Northern Borno Senatorial district, Senator Abubakar Kyari, reclaiming his seat in 2023 equally requires hard work even though no serious contender has emerged to challenge him. But that could change with time.\n\nFor the House of Representatives, Hon Kadri Rahis, representing Borno Central, cannot be said to be in a bad relationship with the governor.\n\nOne of his major challengers might be Alhaji Abubakar Tijani, present Commissioner of Transport whom he contested against for the APC primary ticket for the House of Representatives and won.\n\nFor Jere Federal Constituency, Hon. Ahmed Satomi has not done bad in his representation as a first-timer, but his chances of returning might be fifty \u2013 fifty, as Jere is known for not returning representatives for a second term. Though challengers had not emerged, it is obvious that they will soon spring up any time.\n\nAnd for Dr Haruna Mshelia, member representing Hawul/ Askira-Uba Federal Constituency, his return to the seat might be impossible considering his level of aloofness to the grassroots after his election. Similarly, the ambition of Alhaji Usman Maman Durkwa, former deputy governor of Borno who enjoys a good relationship with the present governor, might spell a doom to Hon Mshelia\u2019s return to the House.\n\nIn the same vein, the member representing Gwoza/Chibok/Damboa Federal Constituency, Hon Ahmed Jaha, has been trying his best through massive constituency projects amid grassroots relationship. Although, no one has heard from Hon. Asabe Vilita who represented the constituency before Jaha, on her plans, Asabe who is a grassroots politician will make a statement should she have plans.\n\nAll 3 Taraba Senators Set Sights On Government House\n\nNone of the senators from Taraba State has indicated interest to recontest for the Senate seat come 2023 general election.\n\nLEADERSHIP Sunday gathered that Senator A.A. Yusuf (APC, Taraba Central) is working hard to clinch the governorship ticket of the party later this year.\n\nSen. Emmanuel Bwacha (PDP,Taraba South), deputy minority leader at the red chambers, recently declared plans to run for the governorship seat. Though Bwacha said he would unveil the platform which want to contest the election soon.\n\nSen. Shuaibu Lau (PDP, Taraba North) has not publicly spoken on the next election, but his political associates say he is hoping to succeed Governor Darius Ishaku in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Hon. Kasimi Mello Maigari (APC Jalingo, Yoro, Zong) is facing a challenge by the former member of Taraba state House of Assembly, Hassan Bapa.\n\nBapa, a PDP member, is said to be the favoured candidate of Governor Darius Ishaku. A political analyst in the state who spoke on the election said Bapa has an advantage over Maigeri, who has not made any public appearances in the state since he was elected to represent the constituency at the National Assembly.\n\nHon. Liman Shaulu (PDP, Ussa, Takum, Donga) is also facing stiff opposition within the party. The current member representing Donga constituency at Taraba State House of Assembly, Hon. Donglas Ndatse and the Chief of Staff to Governor Ishaku, Hon. Istifanus Gbana, are the preferred candidates by the governor to replace Shaulu in the race.\n\nHon. Mubarak Gembo (APC, Bali, Gasol federal constituency) is also being challenged by the chairman Bali LGA, Prince Musa Mahmood, who is from PDP.\n\nMahmood, a grassroots politician, has the blessings of both the PDP and the governor.\n\nAdamawa Governor Holds The Ace\n\nMr Stephen Maduwa, a childhood friend to Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri of Adamawa state, has been named as a major challenger to Senator Cliff Ishaku Abbo, representing Northern Senatorial zone of the state.\n\nIt is believed that it is high time for Governor Fintiri to pay back Maduwa, who stood by him during his electioneering campaign days by helping to defeat incumbent Senator Abbo, who defected from PDP to APC, just as hopes for Abbos\u2019s re-election are up in the air due to the aversion of his constituents to vote APC in the past.\n\nMaduwa\u2019s closeness to Fintiri, who is bankrolling PDP in the state, may give him the upper hand to clinch the party\u2019s flag during primaries.\n\nIn Adamawa Southern Zone, the incumbent Senator Binos Dauda Yaroa (PDP, South) would have to slug it out with Adamu Atiku Abubakar, Commissioner for Works and son of Nigeria\u2019s former Vice President Atiku Abubakar.\n\nAdamu is believed to be relying on name recognition and the political popularity of his father to win the Southern zone, which comprises of nine local government areas.\n\nAlso, former Senator Grace Bent, who recently defected to APC, would also give Sen. Yaroa a tough time in the primaries as she is seen to have sympathy support from the people of the zone after being frustrated by the ruling PDP in the state.\n\nSen. Aisha Dahiru Binani, representing Adamawa Central, pundits say, should bid farewell to the red chamber, as former Senator Abduazeez Nyako\u2019s intention to contest the seat under APC party is glaring.\n\nSen Nyako defected from African Democratic Congress (ADC) following a series of meetings and consultations with other members and politicians who also dumped the party to return back to APC. He is still counting on his father\u2019s legacy as the former governor of the state who is remembered for human capital development during his time.\n\nChallengers for the House of Representatives members from the state are yet to declare the ambitions publicly. The PDP and APC party secretariats could also not disclose names of their candidates.\n\nIn Bauchi, 2 Opposition Senators Challenge Bala Mohammed\n\nThe race for the three Bauchi senatorial seats is never an easy one especially as all the incumbents are from the APC, the leading opposition party in the state.\n\nSenator Lawal Yahaya Gumau (APC, Bauchi North), is believed to be eyeing the governorship seat in the state, while Alhaji Shehu Buba, from the same APC, has been consolidating effort to clinch the Bauchi North Senatorial seat, a position once occupied by the incumbent governor of Bauchi State, Bala Mohammed.\n\nThe race for Bauchi North is believed to be a hot one as the incumbent, Senator Adamu Bulkachuwa, is fast becoming unpopular among the electorate in the zone over what some constituents tagged \u2018non-performance.\u2019\n\nThe zone housed Baba Tela, the present Bauchi State Deputy Governor, and Sulaiman Nazif Gamawa, two politically lively former senators who represented the zone at the Senate from the camp of PDP. Many analysts believe both campaigns to be gathering momentum.\n\n\u201cBy party proximity, of course, Governor Mohammed will support either Baba Tela or Nazif Gamawa to help win the seat to their party from APC in 2023,\u201d said Salahudin Yakubu Gwani, a resident of Azare.\n\nHe said within the APC, there is a power play, especially given the fact the party is in control of the central government. He said Faruk Mustapha, a loyalist of the Education Minister, Malam Adamu Adamu, has great potential to succeed Senator Bulkachuwa in 2023.\n\nBauchi Central is no different from Bauchi North. The incumbent senator, Halliru Dauda Jika, is making moves to vie for the governorship seat of the state, which creates room for Isah Hamma Misau to seek a way of going back to the Senate.\n\nHowever, none of the current senators from Bauchi State has the blessings of Governor Bala Mohammed because of party differences.\n\nYahaya, Goje Plot To Oust Each Other In Gombe\n\nFormer two-term governor, Danjuma Goje, is the incumbent senator for the central zone. Being in the Senate since 2011, he is a heavyweight politician who has both adequate resources and supporters to retain his seat come 2023.\n\nHowever, he will not go unchallenged as some aspirants are already eyeing his seat. One of them is Barrister Idris Umar, a former minister of transport and former senator. It is also pertinent to note that Goje may not enjoy the support of the incumbent governor of the state Inuwa Yahaya as he and the governor have been at loggerheads in recent time.\n\nGombe North is being represented by three-time Senator Sa\u2019idu Alkali, so he is a very strong politician and popular. Besides, he has the backing of the state governor Inuwa Yahaya as the governor attends any political gathering organised by him.\n\nBut he is not without challenger as another known politician, Bala Bello Tinka, is nursing ambition to take over his seat under the platform of the APC. Tinka is a rich businessman and popular politician.\n\nIn Gombe South, Amos Bulus Kilawangs, is the senator representing the zone, but Joshua Lidani who was once a senator of the zone wants to bounce back in 2023. It could be said that the duo has almost the same political strengths in the party. But the present senator has no problem with the state governor.\n\nA Tinder Box In Kano\n\nKano South Senatorial district, with 16 local government areas, has former governor, Kabiru Ibrahim Gaya as the serving Senator, who is planning to extend his stay in a seat he has occupied since 2007.\n\nHowever, the growing popularity of Hon. Sulaiman Kawu Sumaila among the youths and women in the senatorial district is causing headaches for Gaya. Samaila, a one-time minority leader of the House of Representatives and Special Advisor to President Muhammadu Buhari is seriously working to take over from Gaya come 2023.\n\nRecall that the duo slugged it out during the APC primaries until the might of the governor and other top ranking members of the party pulled Kawu down before so Gaya could have his way during 2019 contest .\n\nSamaila accepted defeat and surrendered power to Gaya, although majority of the youths in Kano South are said to be strongly behind his senatorial contest and have vowed to back him up to actualise his dream in the next political dispensation.\n\nIn Kano North, the chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriation, Barau I. Jibril, has publicly stated his interest to contesting the governorship post.\n\nHowever, there are contrary opinion to that as some top members of the APC, who spoke to this reporter on anonymous condition, said the main target for him is to be allowed to retain his position at the end of it all.\n\nHowever, what seems to constitutes a stumbling block to his ambition is the likelihood of the incumbent governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, gunning for the same senatorial position when he finally finishes his tenure in May 2023 .\n\nAccording to a powerful voice who does not want his name in print, \u201cNothing will stop the governor from occupying that seat unless death\u201d.\n\nHe said Senator Barau knows quite well that his days are numbered on that seat after he joined the G7 group opposed to the state government headed by former governor, now Sen. Ibrahim Shekarau.\n\nLikewise the senator representing Kano Central, Malam Ibrahim Shekarau will be facing so many challenges in his effort to retain his seat in the Senate since he has drawn a battle line between him and Ganduje by forming a paradelle party leadership headed by Ahmadu Danzago against the governor\u2019s anointed party chairman, Abdullahi Abbas .\n\nOur Correspondent learnt that plans are underway to replace Shekarau with another very loyal member from the Gandujiyya group. When the time comes his name will be made public, the source said.\n\nHon Tijjani Abdulkadir Jobe, a five-time member of House of Reps for Rimin Gado, Tofa, and Dawakin Tofa Constituency, is also going to face serious challenge on his way back to the House because there is a political coldness between him and the state governor, Ganduje, and from all indication there is every likelihood that he will be seriously challenged by the governor\u2019s son Abba Umar Ganduje, who has since indicated interest in claiming the seat.\n\nIt was gathered that Hon. Jobe is one of the G7 members led by Shekarau and are giving the governor tough time in the court over to the purported ward and state congresses of the APC, held some couple of months ago.\n\nOn the other hand, the state government is determined also to remove the chairman, House Committee on Security, Hon. Sha\u2019aban Ibrahim Sharada, the member representing Kano Municipal, of his seat. Ibrahim clinched the position after a Supreme Court verdict in his favour.\n\nDuring the 2019 election, the governor openly backed Ishaq Yakasai, the present commissioner for special duties but they failed to make it as a result of some electoral lapses.\n\nRoad Block For Senators In Zamfara\n\nThere are serious obstacles facing all the three senators of Zamfara state in their hopes of returning to the National Assembly in 2023.\n\nSpeculations are rife for the emergence of potential contestants to face the incumbent senators. In the Central Senatorial district, several politicians are said to be targeting the upper chamber of the National Assembly, such as former deputy governor during Governor Abdul-Aziz Yari\u2019s tenure, Ibrahim Wakala; former speaker of the state assembly and Chief of Staff to the Speaker of House of Representatives, Sanusi Rikiji, while the incumbent, Sen. Hassan Nasiha is all struggling to retain the seat.\n\nAlso, the current senator of the Western zone, Sen. Lawal Dan\u2019iya, is facing serious threat as former deputy governor to Governor Mahmuda Shinkafi and uncle to Sen. Ahmad Sani, Mukhtar Ahmad, is being groomed for the Senate.\n\nAhmad, a close ally to Governor Matawalle, was initially to contest for the PDP ticket during the 2019 election, but declined. Trends might have changed now with the emergence of Matawalle as the governor of the state.\n\nAlso, the same trend is emerging in the Northern Senatorial district, as former member, House of Representatives, Hon. Sani Jaji, is pushing for the Senate.\n\nKaduna Waiting For el-Rufai To Show His Hand\n\nIn Kaduna South Senatorial district, the incumbent senator, Danjuma Laah, is serving his second term on the platform of the PDP and eyeing a return to the red chamber in 2023. He succeeded in breaking the jinx of serving more than one term.\n\nHowever, there are strong contenders from his party who have declared interest to unseat him come 2023, one of whom is Hon. Sunday Marshal Katung. If present indicators and feelers are anything to go by, he is one contender standing a very good chance of unseating the incumbent Senator. He has served as a member, House of Representatives, and was the running mate to the governorship candidate of the PDP in 2019 general elections after he won his primaries to return to the green chamber.\n\nAnother contender on the platform of the PDP is serving third-term House of Representative member, Hon. Shehu Nicholas Garba (Sarkin Noma), who has equally thrown his hat into the senatorial race for the district. Another contender from the APC is a retired federal civil servant and founder of Nok University Kachia (NUK), Chief Tony Hassan, but his chances are not very bright considering the fact that the senatorial district is predominantly PDP.\n\nIn Kaduna Central Senatorial district, Senator Uba Sani, information has it, is nursing a governorship ambition on the platform of APC. Although he got the support of the governor in 2019 to get elected into the red chamber, it is not clear whether he will get his support to succeed him at Sir Kashim Ibrahim House. In any case, a major contender for the senatorial seat is the present Speaker of the Kaduna House of Assembly, Yusuf Ibrahim Zailani, whom, it is rumoured, has the support of the governor. Another contender from the PDP is Lawal Usman (Mr La), whose acceptability has grown over time among the people of the district. In the 2019 general elections, he was the candidate of the PDP and polled reasonable votes but not enough to beat the candidate of the APC who had the support of the governor.\n\nFor Kaduna North Senatorial district, which has a serving Senator Abdu Kwori on the platform of the APC, it is not very clear who his challengers are presently. It is not also clear whether or not he will be seeking a return to the red chamber or would be seeking an executive position. Only time will tell.\n\nIn Chikun/Kajuru Federal Constituency, the incumbent representative is Hon. Yakubu Umar Barde, who has been there since 2003 on the platform of the PDP. It is not clear yet whether he will have a challenger from his party in 2023, but from the APC, Ekene Abubakar Adams has proved to be a strong contender. In 2019, he challenged him unsuccessfully on the platform of the APGA and has indicated interest again to challenge him this time around on the platform of the APC. There is no doubt that Hon. Barde is loved by his people and Chikun/ Kajuru Federal Constituency presently is in the hand of the PDP at both local governments. It will be difficult for any other party to make any significant impact there.\n\nIn Kachia/Kagarko Federal Constituency, the incumbent, Hon Gabriel Saleh Zock of the APC may not be too lucky to secure a return in 2023. His major contender on the platform of the PDP, Hon. David Umar Gurara, said he will not leave anything to chance to unseat him in 2023. Gurara , a former majority leader in Kaduna State House of Assembly, is loved by his people and may be rewarded in 2023.\n\nIn Kaduna South Federal Constituency, the present House of Representatives member Hon. Mukhtar Ahmed Monrovia had an overwhelming support in 2019 on the platform of the APC and might gain same in 2023 as no known contender has indicated any interest to challenge him at the moment.\n\nJigawa Senators May Not Return In 2023\n\nIn Jigawa State, all the three senators with the exception of senator representing Jigawa Northwest zone, face an uphill battle to retain their seats in the forthcoming 2023 general election.\n\nThe senators are going to find it very tough as the President Buhari factor and other factors that culminated in their success in 2019 general election will no longer be there.\n\nFor the senator representing Jigawa Central, Sabo Muhammad Nakudu, he will find it very difficult to even secure his party\u2019s (APC) ticket as many candidates with higher political profile want the ticket.\n\nSenator Sabo Nakudu, who is in his second term, has little to show in terms of bringing dividends of democracy to his constituency.\n\nThere is also a speculation that the senator is not in good terms with the state governor and he was also conspicuously absent during the last party congresses, which points to his lack of interest in party affairs.\n\nThe Senator representing Jigawa Northwest zone, Danladi Abdullahi Sankara has recently received a big nod from his constituency and APC in the state by declaring that they are proud of his representation.\n\nThe state party chairman, Hon Amimu Sani Gumel, was reported to have urged other APC senators to emulate the commitment of Sankara on party and community development.\n\nSenator Ibrahim Hadejia is representing Jigawa Northeast and he was former deputy governor of the state. His zone is one of the most keenly contested in Jigawa State politics, leaving his political future shaky as many political gladiators in the zone are after his seat now.\n\nEven though Senator Hadejia has cordial relationship with Governor Badaru his performance in terms of touching the lives of his people is below average. while he is not in the good books of his APC party leaders in the zone.\n\nIf eventually governor Badaru imposes him as APC candidate in the zone, certainly he will find it very difficult to win the elections in the absence of Buhari and Badaru factor in the state.\n\nHolding Forth For Plateau Governor\n\nPlateau State has two APC senators and one PDP senator. Plateau North has Senator ID Gyang, PDP, Plateau Central with Sen. Hazekiah Ayuba Dimka and Plateau South has Sen. Nora Ladi Daduut, both of the APC.\n\nSen. Nora Daduut won the bylection to replace Ignatius Longjan in the National Assembly after his demise in 2019.\n\nGovernor Simon Lalong single-handedly brought the university don with the view to hold forth for him till 2023 when his tenure in office will expire.\n\nFrom all indication, Prof. Nora will not contest the 2023 senatorial election as her principal, Governor Lalong, will take over from her as arranged.\n\nFor Plateau North, the incumbent Senator Gyang will battle his kinsman, Dr. Simon Mwadkhom, who is currently the member representing Riyom/Barki Ladi federal constituency. The duo are members of the opposition PDP.\n\nSenator ID Gyang has the backing of the leader of the party, Sen. Jonah Jang, the former governor and senator representing Plateau North.\n\nFor Plateau Central, the incumbent Senator Hezekiah Ayuba Dimka is said to be eyeing the seat of the governor of Plateau State. APC has zoned the 2023 gubernatorial election to Plateau Central.\n\nHon. Diket Plang, the special adviser to Governor Simon Lalong on Public Affairs and the former representative of Mangu/Bokkos Federal Constituency under the platform of the ruling APC is jostling to replace Sen. Hezekiah Dimka.\n\nHon. Plang will have the support of his principal and party structure. As a grassroots mobiliser, he is deeply rooted to get the better of Hon. James Ayuba.\n\nFor the Bassa/ Jos North Federal Constituency, former Rep, Hon. Suleiman Kwande, and another former Rep, Hon. Saleh Hassan; Commissioner of Commerce and Industry, Hon. Abey Akwu and former Minister of State Information and Culture, Ibrahim Nakande Dasuki, all of APC, and many others are jostling to replace the late Haruna Maitala, who represented Bassa/Jos North federal constituency who died in a ghastly road accident early this year.\n\nHon. Abey Akwu may have the day because of his support base; and having resigned as a commissioner after consultation, he may have the support of his party, APC, and of course his boss, Governor Simon Lalong.\n\nHowever, for Langtang North/ Langtang South federal constituency. Hon. Beni Lar of the PDP has been there for the fourth time now. The effort by APC-led administration to remove her since 2015 has been unsuccessful. Hon. Nandum Pienap, who recently defected to the ruling APC and with the support of the state government and APC state structures, he may pull a surprise to defeat the incumbent Hon. Beni Lar.\n\nAbdullahi Adamu Is Standing Tall In Nasarawa\n\nIn Nasarawa West Senatorial zone, the first governor of the state under the PDP between 1999 and 2007, is the current senator representing Nasarawa West Senatorial Zone. Popularly called Mayi (wizard), he is confronted by stiff rivalries even from his ruling APC. There is indication that Barrister Labaran Magaji is coming out with full force to unseat the incumbent senator. Magaji is an Egbirra man from Toto local government of Nasarawa state and is from the late Aliyu Akwe Doma camp.\n\nAnother contestant in the race for Senate 2023 is Hon Ahmed Aliyu Wadada, a two-time member of the House of Representatives for Karu/Kokona/Keffi. The politicians are putting heads together to retire Adamu. Even with the support of governor Abdullahi Sule to Senator Adamu, he will taste the bitter pills of politics.\n\nFor Nasarawa South Senatorial zone, no doubt the state governor, Engineer \u2018 is with the incumbent, former governor of the state, Umaru Tanko Al-Makura of the ruling APC. Al-Makura is a first-time senator and is in the good books of Gov. Abdullahi Sule who referred to him as an \u2018architect of modern Nasarawa State\u2019. Even with the backing of the governor, the Alago nation is looking at the possibility of grabbing the seat, which they see as theirs by right.\n\nRt. Hon. Mohammed Ogoshi Onawo, the running mate of Hon David Ombugadu, the governorship candidate of the PDP, is one of the challengers of Tanko Al-Makura. He is a popular politician whose marks in the sands of Nasarawa South especially Awe/Doma/Keana federal constituency are indelible. He represented his people for two consecutive terms, and is putting his house in order to challenge Mike Omeri, former director general of the National Orientation Agency (NOA) under the reign of President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nIn Nasarawa North, Sen. Godiya Akwashiki is working tirelessly to return to the Senate come 2023. He will experience difficulties politicking if truly Danladi Halilu Emvulanza, a billionaire and a governorship aspirant in 2019 election, joins the race under the APC. The former secretary of Nigeria Judicial Council (NJC) has shifted ground from wanting to contest for governor to looking to the Senate. Insiders say the governor is backing Emvulanza.\n\nZoning Displaces Senators In Niger\n\nBy the local zoning arrangements the Senator representing Niger South, Mohammed Bima Enagi is already out of the race , the Niger south is divided into three federal constituencies. The Federal constituency of the senator is hopefully expected to produce the next governor, thus automatically he is out of the race.\n\nNotwithstanding the arrangements, few names like Hon Ibrahim Ebbo from Lapai is said to be eyeing the position. His closeness to the Governor Abubakar Sani Bello as Special Adviser on Special Duties is seen as an advantage.\n\nAnother name that was mentioned is Ibrahim Liman, the boss of the Federal Fire Service, who retired recently. He is seen as an achiever for taking fire service to all the states from just four states that he inherited.\n\nFor Niger North, Senator Abdullahi Sabi has also been schemed out based on the zoning arrangements. The chairman of the party, Hon Haliru Jikantoro is from the same federal constituency as him, thus Kontagora and Rijau/Magama federal constituency are expected to produce the senator in 2023.\n\nNo clear names have been mentioned as many politicians are watching the body language of the governor who is from Kontagora, on whether he will go for it or not. But in PDP, Umar Mohammed Nasko is likely to give it a shot. He was the governorship candidate of the party in 2015 and 2019 and the electorate are familiar with him.\n\nIn Niger East, the zone is to produce the next deputy governor. In view of this if Paikor/ Bosso federal constituency, where the incumbent Senator Sani Musa comes, from produces the next deputy governor, he will be automatically ruled out.\n\nThere are no clear names mentioned yet as possible contenders. However, if Senator David Umaru who was removed by court decides to contest on the platform of another party, it will be difficult for the incumbent because he is said to have structures he can rely on.\n\nThe fight for the House of Representatives seats is as stiff as that of the senators but it is always stiffer in Chachanga and other urban federal constituencies.\n\nCurrently, Chachanga is represented by Hon Mohammed Umar Bago who is set to contest the governorship seat of the state. Names mentioned to take over from him are Mohammed Usman Tinau, current director-general of the state Pension Board. He is believed to be influential, with high intellectual capacity. Abdulraman Chatta is a young banker and financial management expert who is in touch with people while Ado Abubakar is said from an influential family.\n\nIn Bida, Gbako and Katcha federal constituency, the incumbent Hon Saidu Musa Abdul is said to be delivering the dividend of democracy to the people, but it was learnt that by zoning arrangement Gbako or Katcha is to produce the next member even though there are no clear names mentioned to be eyeing his seat.\n\nSuleja Gurara, Tafa federal constituency is represented by Abubakar Lado Suleja, who is eyeing the governorship position of the state, but even without that there are groups working behind scene to produce a formidable candidate who will comfortably slug it out with him because of his approach to politics.\n\nThe member representing Agaie/Lapai federal constituency, Abdullahi Mahmoud may find it difficult to come back because his alleged \u201cexclusive representation,\u201d and if the senator of Niger South is to come from Agaie, he may not have a chance especially against a very strong candidate like Mahmoud Abdullahi, the chief press secretary to the late Governor Abdulkadir Kure, who is loved by many in the constituency. He is said to be grassroots-oriented.\n\nContenders Lying Low In Kwara\n\nPoliticians in the fold of the ruling APC in Kwara State are still keeping their ambitions in the next political dispensation close to their chests.\n\nThe reluctance of the APC stalwarts in declaring their next political move might not be unconnected with the polarisation of the party in the state.\n\nWhile the main APC in the state is under the firm grip of the state governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, a splinter group, which christened itself as \u2018APC Loyal\u2019 is being led by the minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed.\n\nBy the time of filing this report, only one politician, Prince Saheed Popoola had shown interest in contesting the Kwara South Senate seat.\n\nPopoola is seeking to replace the incumbent, Senator Lola Ashiru. Popoola and Ashiru are both from Offa town.\n\nAshiru, an architect and a consistent opposition leader in the state before the advent of the administration of Governor AbdulRazaq, is loved by his people. He\u2019s a philanthropist of note. The senator is also in the camp of the governor just like his two other counterparts, in the struggle for the control of leadership of the state.\n\nOn the other side, Prince Popoola, a former Offa council chairman, commissioner and two- term member of the state House of Assembly, is also popular.\n\nHe carved a niche for himself as a performing chairman when he was elected under the platform of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) as the chairman of Offa local government. That was the time when the ACN held sway in Kwara.\n\nPopoola\u2019s antagonist posturing to the administration of Governor AbdulRazaq has further endeared him to his admirers, especially the politicians in the fold of Lai Mohammed- led APC in the state.\n\nHarmony Between Ortom And His Senators, Yet\u2026\n\nIn Benue State, all the senators are PDP, and because the governor is also PDP, their working relationship for now is a smooth one.\n\nAbout their backing to return in 2023, that is where there is confusion because there are rumours that the governor also want to contest for the Senate of Benue North West Senatorial District where Oker Jev is is first term senator.\n\nHowever, the governor in different fora said that he was yet to decide on whether he will be contesting any position or not come 2023.\n\n\u201cI am still waiting for God\u2019s direction,\u201d Ortom stated.\n\nSenator Jev himself has refused to comment on the development anytime he is approached by the media.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, out of the 11 members the state has, eight are of PDP while three are in other political parties.\n\nRecently, a three-term member of the House of Representatives, representing Gboko/Tarka at the Federal House of Representative who won the 2019 election under the platform of the APC defected to the PDP.\n\nIn another development, there are feelers that the House of Representatives member for Gwer East/Gwer West, Hon. Mark Gbillah of the PDP is also eyeing the Zone B Senate seat.\n\nIn Rivers, Wike Has PDP In His Pocket\n\nIn Rivers East senatorial district, the incumbent, Senator George Sekibo, has no plans to return to the Red Chamber of the National Assembly, as he is alleged to have his eyes set on the Rivers State Government House come 2023.\n\nHowever, the battle for the senatorial seat would be between Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike and former Commissioner for Education, Chief Allwell Onyesoh.\n\nAlthough, there are rumours that Wike is planning to run as a vice presidential candidate in 2023, he has the structure of the PDP in his pocket and can use it against Onyesoh, who only defected to the PDP from the APC less than two years ago.\n\nIn the Rivers South-East district, the incumbent, Senator Barry Mpigi, has two former senators, Lee Maeba and Olaka Nwogu, all members of the PDP to contend with.\n\nAlthough Mpigi joined the PDP from the APC few months to the 2019 general election, he is alleged to have the structure and backing of the governor to return to the National Assembly in 2023.\n\nIn Rivers West district, the incumbent Senator Betty Apiafi does not enjoy the support of Governor Wike to return to the Senate in 2023.\n\nEven if Apiafi tries to run for another term, she will have to contend with former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Prince Chibudom Nwuche, who was recently received into the PDP by Governor Wike.\n\nIn the Port Harcourt Federal Constituency 1, the incumbent, Hon. Ken Chikere is alleged not to have interest to return to the Green Chamber of the National Assembly.\n\nHowever, the member representing Port Harcourt Constituency 3 in the Rivers House of Assembly, Hon. Smart Adoki, is alleged to be the anointed of the governor to take over from Chikere.\n\nAdoki has a large followership and has structure and loyalists within the party that can deliver for him during the primaries.\n\nIn the Ikwerre/Emohua Federal Constituency, the incumbent, Hon. Boniface Emerengwa, seems not to have the support of Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike to return to the Green Chambers in 2023.\n\nEmerengwa will be struggling it out with the chairman of Ikwerre local government area of the state, Hon. Samuel Nwanosike, who has the structure and backing of the governor to go to the House of Representatives in 2023.\n\nGovernor Okawa Wants His Senatorial Seat BackThe three senators in Delta State are Peter Nwaoboshi, Ovie Omo Agege and James Manager, representing Delta North, Central and South respectively.\n\nThe likely challenger to Senator Nwaoboshi is Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, who wants to return to the Senate for a second term after his second term tenure as governor of Delta State. Nwaoboshi as APC Senator has the backing of the party but he is likely to be running mate to Omo Agege who has governorship ambition in 2023.\n\nIt is also been speculated that Hon Ndidi Elumelu, who is the minority leader, House of Representatives, and Hon Onyemachi Marakpor, former House of Representatives member, also of the PDP, are eyeing the position. If the governor is not going back to the Senate, then he is going to back either Elumelu or Marakpor who are his loyalists. They are party members and are equally popular in the party. Meanwhile, Victor Ochei, former speaker of the state assembly, may later indicate interest.\n\nSenator Omo Agege is of APC and cannot have the governor\u2019s backing. The deputy Senate president has governorship ambition and may not likely recontest the senatorial seat, meaning that a PDP member, Hon Evelyn Oboro, former member of House of Representatives and presently Commissioner for Water Resources, is a major contender to replace him.\n\nDefinitely, Governor Okowa will support Oboro any day especially when the woman has the support of the party, PDP. Also, Olorogun O\u2019tega Emerhor, 2015 former governorship candidate of APC, is warming up to replace Omo Agege.\n\nIn Delta South, Senator James Manager is campaigning to be governor in 2023 but many believe he is doing that to negotiate his way back to the Senate because the governorship slot has been zoned to Delta Central. Manager, a PDP member, has former governor Emmanuel Uduaghan, and chairman, Delta State Oil Producing Area Development Commission (DESOPADEC), Michael Diden to contend with.\n\nHowever, the governor will support Manager because of the cat and mouse relationship between him and Uduaghan. Okowa as the leader of the party may influence the party to support Manager who is more popular in the party than Uduaghan.\n\nBen Ayade Looking To Senate\n\nThe three senators representing Cross River North, South and Central senatorial districts definitely have gladiators within and outside their party, the PDP, who are likely going to fight them in the forthcoming primary elections later this year. Cross River is predominantly a PDP state, despite the fact that the state governor is of the APC. Since the advent of democracy in 1999, the state has consistently been led by a PDP governor if not for the incumbent Governor Ben Ayade who defected to the APC.\n\nThe only senator who would have received the governor\u2019s blessings for a rerun in 2023 elections would have been Senator Stephen Odey. Unfortunately, he was asked by the court to vacate his seat for his political arch rival, Sen. Jarigbe Agom Jarigbe, who now represents Cross River North Senatorial district at the National Assembly.\n\nThis is because in the Senator representing Cross River South senatorial district, Senator Gershom Bassey, a two-term lawmaker and a core PDP man, is jostling to run for the seat of governor. At the moment no political gladiator has indicated interest to contest election in the South to replace Sen. Bassey.\n\nIn Cross River Central Senatorial district, Senator Sandy Onoh of the PDP, who like his South counterpart, is also jostling to take over from Governor Ben Ayade, whose tenure would end by the end of 2022, had already prepared his political arsenal to ensure that no one ousts him from office. Those close to Prof. Onoh are of the opinion that besides the academic\u2019s struggling to secure the PDP ticket to enable him pursue his governorship ambition, he will also do everything humanly possible to secure the senatorial ticket again, just in case he is unable to secure the governorship ticket.\n\nEven though the picture of who will contest the senatorial election in the PDP with Sandy isn\u2019t clear, there are indications that he has a battle to contend with, as the former presidential adviser on anti-corruption, Barr. Obono Okoi Obla, whose campaign posters are already flooding virtually all the streets of the central senatorial district, indicating that he is going to run for Senate come 2023.\n\nIn the Cross River North Senatorial district where Senator Jarigbe Agom Jarigbe is senator, the only aspirant giving headache to him is Governor Ayade who is perceived by many as nursing ambition of going for the Senate ticket on the platform of the APC after his governorship tenure ends.\n\nHowever, in the PDP, the picture is not yet clear for now. No aspirant has come out to indicate interest to contest the Senatorial ticket with senator Jarigbe.\n\n2022 Osun Guber Race Eclipsing Lawmakers\u2019 Plans\n\nThe major focus of an average politician in Osun State for now is the gubernatorial election slated for this year.\n\nWhoever emerges as the governor on whichever party platform will determine in no small measure who emerges as members of parliament at the red, green or state chambers.\n\nThe power tussle within the ruling APC between the incumbent governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, and his predecessor and current Minister of Interior Rauf Aregbesola, will no doubt impact on who emerges as candidates of the party.\n\nCurrently, the two senator from Osun Central Senatorial district, Bashir Ajibola and that of Osun West, Adelere Oriolowo, both of APC, are in support of Governor Oyetola and for obvious reasons \u2013 the governor support them as well.\n\nHowever, a major senatorial contender from Osun West from Aregbesola camp is the former Speaker, Osun House of Assembly, Hon. Najeem Folasayo Salam.\n\nFor Osun East that has Senator Francis Fadahunsi as the sitting senator, there is yet to emerge any contender as his party, the PDP, is battling internal crises.\n\nIn Lagos, Governor Sanwo-Olu Has No Say\n\nIn Lagos State, it is a different political scenario when it comes to who represents the people in the Senate. It is not an all-comer\u2019s affair in the sense that a particular party in the last 23 years, controlled by politicians who identify with the \u201cprogressives\u201d fold that metamorphosed into APC, has governed the state.\n\nIn Lagos State the national leader of APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, leads other stakeholders in the Governance Advisory Council to decide the best candidates for senatorial positions. It is not in the purview of the state governor to decide. In fact, the governor\u2019s support does not count.\n\nPresently, Lagos senators include Tinubu\u2019s wife Senator Oluremi Tinubu, Lagos Central, Senator Tokunbo Abiru, Lagos East, and Senator Solomon Olamilekan Adeola, Lagos West, and if they are going to be retained or not in the upper chambers, they will be given right of first refusal depending on decision of party leaders.\n\nTwo Senators Ready To Take On Governor Makinde\n\nIn Oyo State, the ruling PDP has one only one senator while the opposition APC has the remaining two.\n\nThe PDP senator, Kola Balogun, representing Oyo South in the National Assembly, has not indicated any interest to contest the governorship of the state.\n\nIn APC, Senators Teslim Folarin (Oyo Central) and Fatal Buhari have eyes on the Agodi Government House come 2023.\n\nSenator Buhari, who was rated the best in terms of representation at the National Assembly, had started consultations and is showing interest in the coveted seat.\n\nThere is no way the governor could support them because of party affiliations. Their constraints may include, among others, the party\u2019s zoning arrangements and the decision of the people of the state to a change of government.\n\nContenders In Ekiti Bracing Up Epic Fights\n\nIn Ekiti State, the ruling APC has two senators, Opeyemi Bamidele (Central) and Olubumi Adetumbi (North), at the National Assembly.\n\nSenator Biodun Olujimi of the PDP is presently representing Ekiti South.\n\nAs of now, there are no known challengers to both Bamidele, who is also in the race for the June 18 governorship election in the state, and Adetumbi in their party, APC.\n\nThey seem to still enjoy the governor\u2019s support and the party\u2019s backing as well. They are popular among party members.\n\nA prominent member of the PDP and former member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Kehinde Agboola, who represents Ekiti North federal constituency, is said to be interested in the Senate ticket for the Northern senatorial zone of the state.\n\nAll of these, however, may change after the conclusion of the governorship election coming up in less than six months, when those eyeing the seats will openly come out to declared their aspirations.\n\nFor Senator Olujimi, who has also declared her intention to contest the governorship poll on the platform of the PDP, she is likely to have a challenger in the former member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Segun Adekola.\n\nAdekola, a strong member of PDP faction loyal to the former governor of the state, Ayodele Fayose, represented Ekiti South federal constituency l in the eighth National Assembly.\n\nOne Emure Ekiti-born Nicholas Tai Faweya has also registered his intention to vie for the South senatorial ticket on the platform of APC.",
          "summary": "The APC Senatorial ticket for Ararume is a walkover if the battle is left between him and Ibezim.\nObviously, the senators do not have the backing of the state governor as supporting their return to the red chamber amounts to anti-party activity.\nBesides, he has the backing of the state governor Inuwa Yahaya as the governor attends any political gathering organised by him.\nEmerengwa will be struggling it out with the chairman of Ikwerre local government area of the state, Hon.\nCross River is predominantly a PDP state, despite the fact that the state governor is of the APC.",

          "title": "REMEMBRANCE DAY: Buhari, Governors, Others Pay Tribute To Fallen Heroes",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari and governors of the 36 states of the federation yesterday led Nigerians to honour and pay glowing tributes to fallen heroes during the 2022 Armed Forces Remembrance Day across the country.\n\nOn October 28, 2021 President Buhari kick started activities to mark this year\u2019s Armed Forces Remembrance Day when he launched the remembrance emblem at the presidential villa.\n\nThis was followed by a memorial Christian service held at the National Ecumenical Centre last Sunday, as well as a special Islamic service and prayers on Friday at the National Mosque, Abuja.\n\nYesterday at the National Arcade, opposite the Eagle Square in Three Arms Zone, Buhari inspected a guard of honour mounted by detachments of the Nigerian Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the Nigerian Legion.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe president laid a wreath on the tomb of an unknown soldier as a mark of last respect to the fallen heroes who paid the supreme price to keep global peace and the nation\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\nThe president in a post on his verified Instagram handle said Nigerians must celebrate the armed forces as the pride of our country.\n\nAccording to him, they have time and again demonstrated unparalleled patriotism, courage, loyalty, and commitment as they grapple with daunting challenges of defending Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\nHe said the government will continue to do all within its powers to ensure that the armed forces are motivated to perform optimally and that welfare of our ex-servicemen remains a priority.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOthers who laid wreaths were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmad Lawan and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Tanko; minister of Defence, Maj. Gen. Bashir Salihi Magashi (rtd), and minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Mallam Mohammed Bello, represented by the minister of State, Hajia Ramatu Aliyu; Chief of Defence Staff, Gen Lucky Irabor, Service Chiefs and the Nigerian Legion, among others.\n\nThree volleys of 21 gun salute were fired at the event followed by the signing of the Remembrance Day anniversary register by the president who was accompanied by heads of the other branches of government, military chiefs and other top officials of government.\n\nThe president released white pigeons to indicate the harmony at the venue and the nation.\n\nLalong Urges Citizens To Honour Fallen Heroes By Embracing Peace\n\nIn Plateau, the state governor, Simon Lalong, paid tribute to Nigerian fallen heroes who have made sacrifices for the unity, peace and stability of Nigeria, urging all citizens to honour their courage by living in peace with one another and exposing criminals.\n\nLalong stated this yesterday during the laying of wreaths to commemorate the 2022 Armed Forces Remembrance Day at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Joseph Gomwalk Secretariat, Jos.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLalong who spoke with journalists after the event said the Nigerian Armed Forces and other security agencies have made sacrifices to not only keep Nigeria one, but to also ensure that the country\u2019s territorial integrity is kept intact.\n\nAbdulRazaq Seeks More Support For Security Agencies\n\nIn Kwara State, Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq yesterday called for more support for members of the armed forces and sister security agencies whose efforts, he said, has kept the country united and its people safe.\n\nSpeaking with journalists in Ilorin, the state capital, shortly after inspecting the guard of honour and laying the wreath in honour of fallen soldiers, AbdulRazaq urged members of the public to support families of fallen soldiers in every way possible as well as offer actionable intelligence to those still in active service.\n\n\u201cThe patriotic roles being played by the gallant officers in the Service in curtailing insurgency and other security threats cannot be quantified. We salute all of them, including those of them who had lost their lives in the course of serving the nation,\u201d the governor added.\n\nHe urged Nigerians to replicate the sacrifices of members of the Armed Forces to keep peace with more gratitude and necessary support, saying security is everyone\u2019s business.\n\nGombe Governor, Others Eulogise Fallen Heroes\n\nAlso, governor of Gombe State, Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya, and other eminent persons in the state yesterday laid wreath in honour of fallen heroes as part of activities marking the Armed Forces Remebrance Day Celebration.\n\nShortly after performing the wreath laying rites at the Pantami Township Stadium, Gombe, the governor explained that the wreath laying tradition is a formal sign of respect towards a particular tribute to the fallen heroes.\n\nRepresented at the occasion by his deputy, Manassah Daniel Jatau, the governor further explained that the fallen heroes have made great sacrifices for Nigerians to be free from insecurity, fear, unhappiness and other forms of miserable lives.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe must always remember these fallen heroes and appreciate them by way of respecting and helping those that are left behind, knowing too well that a time will come that we will also leave our families behind.\n\n\u201cThe people of Gombe State and indeed all Nigerians remain resolute in supporting activities of the legion. We also repose much in them, especially in these days of insecurity that is getting nearer and nearer to us by the day. At the rate it is worsening our coming together as one body can see us through. I appeal for relevant and timely information sharing to relevant agencies for the solution of our issues to be tackled\u201d.\n\nHe called on the people to assist in finding out solutions and apply them accordingly, even as he appealed to individuals and organisations to continue to support the members of the legion by offering financial and material assistance with a view to alleviating their sufferings.\n\nThe Speaker Gombe State House of Assembly, Abubakar Mohammed Luggerewo and the acting Chief Judge of Gombe State, Justice Joseph Ahmed Awak, represented by the state Grand Khadi, also performed the wreath laying in honour of the Unknown Soldier.\n\nThe event also featured the review of parade and release of pigeons by the deputy governor as a symbol of peace in the state and Nigeria, as well as performance of the reveille in honour of the fallen heroes.\n\nFintiri Lauds Military For Securing The Nation\n\nIn Adamawa, Governor Ahmadu Fintiri lauded the armed forces for securing the nation, urging them to redouble efforts in addressing all forms of insecurity.\n\nSpeaking during laying of wreaths in honour of the nation\u2019s fallen heroes to mark this year\u2019s Armed Forces Remembrance Day at Ribadu Square, the governor who saluted the courage of the falling heroes for paying the supreme price in serving the country harped on unity and peaceful coexistence in the state.\n\nSpecial prayers were offered as well as a minute silence in honor of the fallen heroes.\n\nMasari Lauds Military For Efforts In Curbing Banditry\n\nGovernor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State yesterday saluted the gallantry and efforts of the Nigerian Military in the fight against bandits and other criminal elements, saying their dedication and competent service to the nation have assisted greatly to the peace the state is enjoying.\n\nSpeaking during the Armed Forces Remembrance Day, the governor said the supreme sacrifice that the falling heroes paid towards securing the lives and properties of the citizens will never be forgotten, even as he prayed for their souls to have eternal rest.\n\nCheck Insecurity Now, Ganduje Tells Military\n\nGovernor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State yesterday called on the serving military officer to rise to the challenges of and rid the nation of criminals.\n\nHe made the call while responding to questions from journalists after laying the wreath during the Armed Forces Remembrance Day celebration in Kano.\n\nHe explained that with the regard given to fallen heroes, the security operatives in Nigeria must take their responsibility diligently.\n\nMatawalle Warns Against Divisive Utterances\n\nGovernor Bello Mohammed Matawalle of Zamfara State yesterday warmed against reckless utterances that are capable of causing division in the country.\n\nSpeaking during the 2022 Armed Forces Rememberance Day celebration in Gusau, the state capital, Matawalle said what Nigeria needs at the moment is peace and unity among the

          "text": "Labour unions and the Organised Private Sector (OPS) have said the reintroduction of excise duty on drinks in the country negates the federal government\u2019s aspiration on economic recovery and job creation.\n\nThe unions in separate interviews with LEADERSHIP Sunday at the weekend noted that it was very absurd for government to erase all the good works it was doing to re-awaken the economy with another tax burden on Nigerians.\n\nThe federal government had earlier announced the introduction of excise duty of N10 per litre on all non-alcoholic, carbonated and sweetened beverages in the country.\n\nThe charge was part of a new policy introduced in the Finance Act which was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari on December 31, 2021, alongside the 2022 Appropriation Bill.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nExcise duty refers to a form of tax imposed on the production, licensing and sale of goods.\n\nReacting to this development, the chief executive officer of Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), Dr Muda Yusuf, who faulted the decision, said the move was ill-timed and most inappropriate given the prevailing harsh economic and business conditions.\n\nThe citizens and the business community, he said, are already experiencing a galloping and volatile inflationary condition, stressing that the excise duty is also a negation of the economic recovery, job creation and poverty reduction aspirations of the federal government.\n\n\u201cMany upcoming small businesses in the beverage sector would be hard hit by this proposal. The millions of micro enterprises in the soft drinks\u2019 fruit juice distribution chain will be adversely impacted by the imposition of the excise tax,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNigerian manufacturing companies and indeed most investors, he noted, are going through tremendous stress at the moment, adding, \u201cThey are currently grappling with serious macro-economic challenges and structural constraints impacting on capacity utilization, productivity and competitiveness. This is affecting sales, turnover, profitability, shareholder value and the sustainability of investments.\u201d\n\nThe norm globally at this time, he stressed, is to provide incentives for industries to aid their recovery from the shocks of the pandemic and escalating costs, pointing out, \u201cWe cannot afford to be doing the exact opposite. Manufacturers, across all product segments need a respite, especially in the light of the unprecedented escalation of production and operating costs.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the director-general of Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Mr. Segun Ajayi-Kadir described the proposal as obnoxious and ill-timed.\n\n\u201cSeeing that the affected sub-sector has contributed most significantly to the economy and taxes despite the debilitating impact of naira devaluation, inadequacy of forex and the COVID-19 pandemic. The food and beverage contributed the highest (38 per cent) of the total manufacturing sector to the GDP, it comprises 22.5 per cent of manufacturing jobs and generates more than 1.5 million jobs. So, this excise would certainly cast a sunset to this performance,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that recent studies had shown that introducing excise on non-alcoholic beverages is likely to cause a 0.43 per cent contraction in output and about 40 per cent drop in total industry revenues in the next five years.\n\nThe director-general of Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Dr. Chinyere Almona had earlier stated that the immediate concerns were likely increase in prices which may lead to a decrease in demand and consequently, loss of jobs due to a reduction in production activities.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe prohibition on imported drinks, he said, should be better enforced to protect domestic production from unfair competition in the face of the high cost of production in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe chamber supports both the government\u2019s revenue drive and the pro-health considerations of several stakeholders, recommending that the realized revenue from these levies be channeled into improving the country\u2019s grossly inadequate health infrastructure. The allocation to the health sector in the 2022 federal budget of N876 billion should be reviewed upward to the region of a trillion naira invested into the sector in the next ten years,\u201d she said.\n\nStressing that the chamber is also concerned about the government\u2019s stance on the enforcement of revenue targets on government-owned enterprises, she noted that operations of these government-owned enterprises (GOEs) should not build up into a hostile business environment where the private sector will find it challenging to thrive.\n\n\u201cBeyond the levying of taxes on carbonated drinks to force a reduction in consumption, we urge the various public health agencies to regulate the production of sugary drinks to reduce their negative effect on human health,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, the leadership of the National Union of Food Beverage & Tobacco Employees (NUFBTE), has expressed disappointment with the way some groups are intentionally shutting down the economy through policy summersaults, even as it vowed to fight against the reintroduction until they have their way.\n\nThe acting general secretary, NUFBTE, Comrade Mike Olanrewaju, who made the feelings of the union known to LEADERSHIP said he wondered why government which is pursuing job creation could on other hand be bringing down the fulfilment of that goal through policy summersault.",

He also remarked that the advent of PAPSS would greatly address challenges such as: high-cost, lengthy correspondent banking relationships, delays, among many others, and therefore ease transactions among businesses across Africa.\n\nHe equally expressed optimism that PAPSS would enhance the volume of trade among countries, which were hitherto not recorded or were overlooked because of the informal approach towards these transactions. According to him, these were now captured to reflect the correct or at least close to the appropriate position of trading activities within the continent, while also boosting the level of economic activities across the continent.\n\nDangote noted the enormous potential and benefits of PAPSS, but nevertheless warned that such projects had their teething issues. He therefore urged regulators and participants across the continent to look beyond any such operational challenges and ensure a successful implementation of the PAPSS.\n\nIn thanking all the member countries and organisations who contributed to the success of PAPSS by playing key roles leading to launch of the project, he invoked the words of Ghana\u2019s first President and Prime Minister, and renown promoter of Pan Africanism \u2013 Kwame Nkrumah, stressing that \u201cThe forces that unite us are intrinsic and greater\u2026\u201d\n\nDangote thus charged African leaders and citizens to continue to promote the continent\u2019s intrinsic greatness through improved trade relations amongst African countries.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

We are absolutely devastated as a family. We can\u2019t say much now as their is an ongoing FBI investigation. We would like to say that we as a family do not condone any of his actions and would like to sincerely apologize wholeheartedly to all the victims involved in the unfortunate incident. Sitting in the incident room all last night at Greenbank until the early hours liaising with Faisal , the negotiators, FBI etc And although my brother was suffering from mental health issues we were confident that he would not harm the hostages. At around 3am the first person was released then an hour later he released the other 3 people through the fire door unharmed. Don\u2019t believe the bull#### in the media. They were released from the fire exit and Not rescued. At around 3am the first person was released then an hour later he released the other 3 people through the fire door unharmed.

ILWIAR. There was nothing we could have said to him or done that would have convinced him to surrender. The FBI are due to fly into the UK later today so we don\u2019t have much else to share at the moment. Obviously our priority will be to get him back to the UK for his Funeral prayers although we have been warned it could take weeks. We would also like to add that any attack on any human being be it a Jew, Christian or Muslim etc is wrong and should always be condemned. It is absolutely inexcusable for a Muslim to attack a Jew or for any Jew to attack a Muslim, Christian, Hindu vice versa etc etc Finally to all the people that have been bombarding us with non stop calls and texts please for the love of Allah STOP please STOP show some restraint and respect at such a difficult time for our family especially after losing our younger sibling barely 3 months ago. Please if you can grant us some privacy as we are grieving privately in our homes. Please keep our family present and deceased in your prayers.

It is good, it should be done but if we proceed to do it the way we are trying to do it now, we are likely to create more problems than it will solve,\u201d he said.\n\nRead Also: I Will Sign Electoral Bill If NASS Includes Consensus Candidates, Indirect Primaries \u2013 Buhari\n\nPresident Buhari had declined assent to the bill in December 2021, citing the cost of conducting direct primary elections, security challenges, and possible manipulation of electoral processes by political actors as part of the reasons for his decision.\n\nBut in a recent interview with Channels Television, he noted that for him to accent to the Bill, changes must be made to include the addition of consensus candidates, indirect primary options to the mode of selecting a candidate for an election, as against the initial direct mode as the only option to conduct primaries by political parties.\n\n\u201cThere should be options, you can\u2019t dictate to people and say you are doing democracy. Give them other options so they can make a choice,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "SERAP Writes Buhari, Seeks \u2018Copy Of Agreement With Twitter\u2019",
          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to use his good offices and leadership position to \u201cdirect the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed to provide our organization with a copy of the agreement recently signed with Twitter, Inc, and to widely publish the details of any such agreement.\u201d\n\nSERAP also urged him to \u201cdirect Alhaji Lai Mohammed to clarify the manner and scope in which the agreement with Twitter will be enforced, including whether the agreement incorporates respect for human rights, consistent with the Nigerian Constitution 1999 [as amended] and international obligations.\u201d\n\nIn the letter dated 15 January 2022 and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organization said: \u201cPublishing the agreement would enable Nigerians to scrutinize it, seek legal remedies as appropriate, and ensure that the conditions for lifting the suspension of Twitter are not used as pretexts to suppress legitimate discourse.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Five Killed, Houses Burnt After Farmers-Herders Clash In Ogun\n\nSERAP said: \u201cPublishing the agreement with Twitter would also promote transparency, accountability, and help to mitigate threats to Nigerians\u2019 rights online, as well as any interference with online privacy in ways that deter the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cNigerians are entitled to their constitutionally and internationally recognized human rights, such as the rights to freedom of expression, access to information, privacy, peaceful assembly, and association, as well as public participation both offline and online.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cAny agreement with social media companies must meet constitutional and international requirements, including legality, necessity, proportionality, and legitimacy.\n\n\u201cThis means that any conditions for lifting the suspension of Twitter must meet the requirements of regular legal processes and limit government discretion. Secretly agreed conditions will fail these fundamental requirements.\n\n\u201cThe government has a duty to demonstrate that the conditions for lifting the suspension of Twitter would not threaten or violate the enjoyment of Nigerians\u2019 human rights online and that the conditions are in pursuit of a legitimate goal in a democratic society.\n\n\u201cSERAP is concerned that the operation and enforcement of the agreement may be based on broadly worded restrictive laws, which may be used as pretexts to suppress legitimate discourse, interfere with online privacy, and deter the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cFor example, the statement by the government announcing the lifting of the suspension of Twitter used overly broad terms and phrases like \u2018prohibited publication\u2019, \u2018Nigerian laws\u2019, \u2018national culture and history\u2019. These open-ended terms and phrases may be used to suppress the legitimate exercise of human rights online.\n\n\u201cAny agreement with social media companies must not be used as a ploy to tighten governmental control over access to the internet, monitor internet activity, or to increase online censorship and the capacity of the government to restrict legitimate online content, contrary to standards on freedom of expression and privacy.\n\n\u201cSERAP notes the interdependence of human rights, such as the importance of privacy as a gateway to freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cSection 39 of the Nigerian Constitution, article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guarantee the right to hold opinions without interference, and the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers and through any medium.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution and human rights treaties impose duties on your government to ensure enabling environments for freedom of expression, privacy rights, and other human rights, and to protect their exercise.\u201d\n\nSERAP noted that \u201cWhile human rights law requires States to prohibit \u2018advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence\u2019, States must still satisfy the cumulative conditions of legality, necessity, proportionality and legitimacy in any agreement with social media companies.\n\n\u201cYour government has a legal obligation to promote universal Internet access, media diversity, and independence, as well as ensure that any agreements with Twitter and other social media companies are not used to impermissibly restrict these fundamental human rights.\n\n\u201cBy the combined reading of the provisions of the Constitution of Nigeria, the Freedom of Information Act 2011, and human rights treaties to which Nigeria is a state party, there are transparency obligations imposed on your government to widely publish the agreement and details of the conditions upon which the suspension of Twitter was lifted.\n\n\u201cIt is stated in the statement by the Federal Government that Twitter has reached an agreement with the government \u2018to manage prohibited publication in line with Nigerian laws.\u2019 We would be grateful for clarifications on the definition of \u2018prohibited information,\u2019 and the specific applicable Nigerian laws in the context of the agreement.\n\n\u201cIt is also stated in the statement by the Federal Government that Twitter has agreed to \u2018act with a respectful acknowledgment of Nigerian laws and the national culture and history on which such legislation has been built.\u2019 We would be grateful for clarifications on the specific and applicable Nigerian laws, national culture, and history upon which the operation and enforcement of the agreement will be based.\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the requested information and details are provided to us within 7 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal action in the public interest to compel your government to comply with our request.\n\n\u201cAccording to our information, the approval was given to lift the suspension of Twitter operation in Nigeria effective from 12am 13th January 2022 following the memo sent to you by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof Isa Ali Ibrahim. The decision to lift the suspension was reportedly based on the recommendations by the Technical Committee on Nigeria-Twitter Engagement.\n\n\u201cSERAP notes that Alhaji Lai Mohammed on 5th June 2021, announced the suspension of operation of Twitter by the Federal Government, following which a seven-man Presidential Committee was set up to engage Twitter Inc. The Presidential Committee, in turn, established a 20-member Technical Committee, which reportedly directly worked with the Twitter team.\u201d\n\nThe letter was copied to Alhaji Lai Mohammed and Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN, Attorney General of the Federation, and Minister of Justice.",

          "title": "No Title Defence for Djokovic as World No 1 Deported from Australia",
          "text": "Instead of starting the defence of his Australian Open title on Monday, Novak Djokovic was on his way home, a stunning and unprecedented end to his run of success at Melbourne Park.\n\nDjokovic has won nine of his 20 Grand Slam trophies at the Australian Open \u2014 including three in a row \u2014 and was scheduled to play in the main stadium to conclude Day 1 of the tournament.\n\nBut the No. 1-ranked player in men\u2019s tennis had to be deported from Australia after three Federal Court judges decided unanimously Sunday to affirm the immigration minister\u2019s right to cancel Djokovic\u2019s visa. The ruling was made less than 18 hours before the first Grand Slam matches of 2022 were scheduled to begin.\n\nDjokovic said he was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by the legal outcome but respected the decision and would cooperate in his \u201cdeparture from the country.\u201d He also said he planned \u201cto rest and to recuperate.\u201d\n\nThe 34-year-old from Serbia was trying to use a medical exemption approved by two independent medical panels and Tennis Australia to get around the requirements that everyone at the Australian Open \u2014 players, their support teams, spectators and others \u2014 be inoculated against COVID-19.\n\nDjokovic is not vaccinated, and the government said his presence could stir up anti-vaccine sentiments.\n\nThe saga started on Jan. 5, when Djokovic\u2019s flight landed at a Melbourne airport.\n\n\u201cI am uncomfortable that the focus of the past weeks has been on me,\u201d he said Sunday, \u201cand I hope that we can all now focus on the game and tournament I love.\u201d\n\nTennis Australia issued a statement saying it \u201crespects the decision of the Federal Court\u201d and added: \u201cWe look forward to a competitive and exciting Australian Open 2022 and wish all players the best of luck.\u201d\n\nDjokovic\u2019s absence means just one past champion is in the men\u2019s bracket: 2009 winner Rafael Nadal. And that also means now it is only Nadal who will have a chance to claim a 21st Grand Slam title and break a tie with Djokovic and Roger Federer (who is sidelined after a series of knee operations).\n\nDjokovic\u2019s dominance in Grand Slam play of late has been particularly impressive, winning four of the last seven major tournaments and finishing as the runner-up at two others. The only time he did not get at least to the final in that span was at the 2020 U.S. Open, where he was disqualified in the fourth round for hitting a ball that inadvertently hit a line judge in the throat after a game.\n\nLast season, Djokovic went 27-1 at majors, coming within a victory in the U.S. Open final of becoming the first man since 1969 to win a calendar-year Grand Slam.\n\nOn Monday night, Djokovic was supposed to play Miomir Kecmanovic, a Serbian ranked 78th, at Rod Laver Arena, the main stadium.\n\nInstead, Kecmanovic will head to a smaller arena to face 150th-ranked Salvatore Caruso of Italy, a so-called \u201clucky loser\u201d \u2014 someone who loses in qualifying rounds but gets access to the main draw because someone else withdraws after the first day\u2019s schedule was released.\n\nThird-seeded Alexander Zverev\u2019s opener against Daniel Altmaier was moved to Rod Laver Arena.\n\nThe Federal Court\u2019s decision was as polarizing as Djokovic\u2019s vaccination status in a city where residents spent more than 250 days in lockdown and faced harsh travel restrictions at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNadal was among those who said before Sunday\u2019s ruling that players knew the rules coming to Australia and no individual was bigger than the tournament.\n\nAfter the ruling, Vasek Pospisil, a Canadian who won the 2014 Wimbledon men\u2019s doubles title and has worked with Djokovic to form an association to represent players, tweeted: \u201cThere was a political agenda at play here with the (Australian) elections coming up which couldn\u2019t be more obvious.\u201d\n\nPospisil also wrote: \u201cThis is not his fault. He did not force his way into the country and did not \u2018make his own rules.\u2019\u201d\n\nPospisil said Djokovic wouldn\u2019t have traveled to Australia and would have \u201cbeen home with his family\u201d had he not received the medical exemption that turned out to be so contentious.\n\nThe ATP Tour described Djokovic\u2019s absence from the Australian Open as \u201ca loss for the game\u201d and said the court ruling \u201cmarks the end of a deeply regrettable series of events.\u201d\n\nThe tour said it \u201ccontinues to strongly recommend vaccination to all players.\u201d\n\nMore than 95% of the Top 100 in both the men\u2019s rankings and women\u2019s rankings have been vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nPatrick Mouratoglou, a coach who has worked with Serena Williams and other top players, said the \u201cbiggest loser of this mess is the tournament.\u201d\n\nDjokovic\u2019s visa originally was canceled on Jan. 6 and he spent four nights in an immigration detention hotel before that decision was overturned by a judge on procedural grounds last Monday.\n\nHe spent another night confined to an immigration hotel on Saturday while awaiting the result of his last legal challenge.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has defended Australia\u2019s tough border policies since Djokovic was detained, tweeting that \u201crules are rules\u201d on that day.\n\nMorrison, who will face a vote by May, issued a statement Sunday saying he welcomed the decision \u201cto keep our borders strong and keep Australians safe. \u2026 Australians have made many sacrifices during this pandemic, and they rightly expect the result of those sacrifices to be protected.\u201d",

          "title": "Expect More Worrisome Variants after Omicron, Scientists Say",
          "text": "Get ready to learn more Greek letters. Scientists warn that omicron\u2019s whirlwind advance practically ensures it won\u2019t be the last version of the coronavirus to worry the world.\n\nEvery infection provides a chance for the virus to mutate, and omicron has an edge over its predecessors: It spreads way faster despite emerging on a planet with a stronger patchwork of immunity from vaccines and prior illness.\n\nThat means more people in whom the virus can further evolve. Experts don\u2019t know what the next variants will look like or how they might shape the pandemic, but they say there\u2019s no guarantee the sequels of omicron will cause milder illness or that existing vaccines will work against them.\n\nThey urge wider vaccination now, while today\u2019s shots still work.\n\n\u201cThe faster omicron spreads, the more opportunities there are for mutation, potentially leading to more variants,\u201d Leonardo Martinez, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Boston University, said.\n\nSince it emerged in mid-November, omicron has raced across the globe like fire through dry grass. Research shows the variant is at least twice as contagious as delta and at least four times as contagious as the original version of the virus.\n\nOmicron is more likely than delta to reinfect individuals who previously had COVID-19 and to cause \u201cbreakthrough infections\u201d in vaccinated people while also attacking the unvaccinated. The World Health Organization reported a record 15 million new COVID-19 cases for the week of Jan. 3-9, a 55% increase from the previous week.\n\nAlong with keeping comparatively healthy people out of work and school, the ease with which the variant spreads increases the odds the virus will infect and linger inside people with weakened immune systems \u2013 giving it more time to develop potent mutations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the longer, persistent infections that seem to be the most likely breeding grounds for new variants,\u201d said Dr. Stuart Campbell Ray, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIt\u2019s only when you have very widespread infection that you\u2019re going to provide the opportunity for that to occur.\u201d\n\nBecause omicron appears to cause less severe disease than delta, its behavior has kindled hope that it could be the start of a trend that eventually makes the virus milder like a common cold.\n\nIt\u2019s a possibility, experts say, given that viruses don\u2019t spread well if they kill their hosts very quickly. But viruses don\u2019t always get less deadly over time.\n\nA variant could also achieve its main goal \u2013 replicating \u2013 if infected people developed mild symptoms initially, spread the virus by interacting with others, then got very sick later, Ray explained by way of example.\n\n\u201cPeople have wondered whether the virus will evolve to mildness. But there\u2019s no particular reason for it to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can be confident that the virus will become less lethal over time.\u201d\n\nGetting progressively better at evading immunity helps a virus to survive over the long term. When SARS-CoV-2 first struck, no one was immune. But infections and vaccines have conferred at least some immunity to much of the world, so the virus must adapt.\n\nThere are many possible avenues for evolution. Animals could potentially incubate and unleash new variants. Pet dogs and cats, deer and farm-raised mink are only a few of the animals vulnerable to the virus, which can potentially mutate within them and leap back to people.\n\nAnother potential route: With both omicron and delta circulating, people may get double infections that could spawn what Ray calls \u201cFrankenvariants,\u201d hybrids with characteristics of both types.\n\nWhen new variants do develop, scientists said it\u2019s still very difficult to know from genetic features which ones might take off. For example, omicron has many more mutations than previous variants, around 30 in the spike protein that lets it attach to human cells. But the so-called IHU variant identified in France and being monitored by the WHO has 46 mutations and doesn\u2019t seem to have spread much at all.\n\nTo curb the emergence of variants, scientists stress continuing with public health measures such as masking and getting vaccinated. While omicron is better able to evade immunity than delta, experts said, vaccines still offer protection and booster shots greatly reduce serious illness, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nAnne Thomas, a 64-year-old IT analyst in Westerly, Rhode Island, said she\u2019s fully vaccinated and boosted and also tries to stay safe by mostly staying home while her state has one of the highest COVID-19 case rates in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt at all that these viruses are going to continue to mutate and we\u2019re going to be dealing with this for a very long time,\u201d she said.\n\nRay likened vaccines to armor for humanity that greatly hinders viral spread even if it doesn\u2019t completely stop it. For a virus that spreads exponentially, he said, \u201canything that curbs transmission can have a great effect.\u201d Also, when vaccinated people get sick, Ray said their illness is usually milder and clears more quickly, leaving less time to spawn dangerous variants.\n\nExperts say the virus won\u2019t become endemic like the flu as long as global vaccination rates are so low. During a recent press conference, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that protecting people from future variants \u2014 including those that may be fully resistant to today\u2019s shots \u2014 depends on ending global vaccine inequity.\n\nTedros said he\u2019d like to see 70% of people in every country vaccinated by mid-year. Currently, there are dozens of countries where less than a quarter of the population is fully vaccinated, according to Johns Hopkins University statistics. And in the United States, many people continue to resist available vaccines.\n\n\u201cThese huge unvaccinated swaths in the U.S., Africa, Asia, Latin America and elsewhere are basically variant factories,\u201d said Dr. Prabhat Jha of the Centre for Global Health Research at St. Michael\u2019s Hospital in Toronto. \u201cIt\u2019s been a colossal failure in global leadership that we have not been able to do this.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, new variants are inevitable, said Louis Mansky, director of the Institute for Molecular Virology at the University of Minnesota.\n\nWith so many unvaccinated people, he said, \u201cthe virus is still kind of in control of what\u2019s going on.\u201d",
          "summary": "Scientists warn that omicron\u2019s whirlwind advance practically ensures it won\u2019t be the last version of the coronavirus to worry the world.\n\u201cThe faster omicron spreads, the more opportunities there are for mutation, potentially leading to more variants,\u201d Leonardo Martinez, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Boston University, said.\nWhen new variants do develop, scientists said it\u2019s still very difficult to know from genetic features which ones might take off.\nFor example, omicron has many more mutations than previous variants, around 30 in the spike protein that lets it attach to human cells.\nTo curb the emergence of variants, scientists stress continuing with public health measures such as masking and getting vaccinated.",

          "title": "Hostages Safe After Texas Synagogue Standoff; Captor Dead",
          "text": "Four hostages are safe and their captor is dead after an hourslong standoff that began when the man took over services at a Texas synagogue where he could be heard ranting on a livestream and demanding the release of a Pakistani neuroscientist who was convicted of trying to kill U.S. Army officers in Afghanistan.\n\nOne hostage held Saturday at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville was released during the standoff; three others got out about 9 p.m. when an FBI SWAT team entered the building, authorities said. The hostage taker was killed and FBI Special Agent in Charge Matt DeSarno said a team would investigate \u201cthe shooting incident.\u201d\n\nVideo from Dallas TV station WFAA shows people running out a door of the synagogue, and then a man holding a gun opening the same door just seconds later, before he turns around and closes the door. Moments later, several rounds of gunfire can be heard, followed by the sound of an explosion.\n\nFBI and police spokeswomen declined to answer questions about who shot the man.\n\nDeSarno said the hostage taker was specifically focused on an issue not directly connected to the Jewish community, and there was no immediate indication that the man was part of any broader plan. But DeSarno said the agency\u2019s investigation \u201cwill have global reach.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear why the attacker chose the synagogue.\n\nLaw enforcement officials who were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity earlier said that the hostage-taker demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist suspected of having ties to al-Qaida. He also said he wanted to be able to speak with her, according to the officials. Siddiqui is in federal prison in Texas.\n\nDeSarno said Saturday night that the man had been identified \u201cbut we are not prepared to release his identity or confirm his identity at this time.\u201d\n\nA rabbi in New York City received a call from the rabbi believed to be held hostage in the synagogue to demand Siddiqui\u2019s release, a law enforcement official said. The New York rabbi then called 911.\n\nPolice were first called to the synagogue around 11 a.m. and people were evacuated from the surrounding neighborhood soon after that, FBI Dallas spokeswoman Katie Chaumont said.\n\nSaturday\u2019s services were being livestreamed on the synagogue\u2019s Facebook page for a time. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that an angry man could be heard ranting and talking about religion at times during the livestream, which didn\u2019t show what was happening inside the synagogue.\n\nShortly before 2 p.m., the man said, \u201cYou got to do something. I don\u2019t want to see this guy dead.\u201d Moments later, the feed cut out. A Meta company spokesperson later confirmed that Facebook removed the video.\n\nMultiple people heard the hostage-taker refer to Siddiqui as his \u201csister\u201d on the livestream. But John Floyd, board chair for the Houston chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest Muslim advocacy group \u2014 said Siddiqui\u2019s brother, Mohammad Siddiqui, was not involved.\n\n\u201cThis assailant has nothing to do with Dr. Aafia, her family, or the global campaign to get justice for Dr. Aafia. We want the assailant to know that his actions are wicked and directly undermine those of us who are seeking justice for Dr. Aafia,\u201d said Floyd, who also is legal counsel for Mohammad Siddiqui. \u201cWe have confirmed that the family member being wrongly accused of this heinous act is not near the DFW Metro area.\u201d\n\nTexas resident Victoria Francis told the AP that she watched about an hour of the livestream before it cut out. She said she heard the man rant against America and claim he had a bomb.\n\n\u201cHe was just all over the map. He was pretty irritated and the more irritated he got, he\u2019d make more threats, like \u2018I\u2019m the guy with the bomb. If you make a mistake, this is all on you.\u2019 And he\u2019d laugh at that,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was clearly in extreme distress.\u201d\n\nFrancis, who grew up near Colleyville, tuned in after she read about the hostage situation. She said it sounded like the man was talking to the police department on the phone, with the rabbi and another person trying to help with the negotiations.\n\nColleyville, a community of about 26,000 people, is about 15 miles (23 kilometers) northeast of Fort Worth. The synagogue is nestled among large houses in a leafy residential neighborhood that includes several churches, a middle and elementary school and a horse farm.\n\nCongregation Beth Israel is led by Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker, who has been there since 2006 as the synagogue\u2019s first full-time rabbi. He has worked to bring a sense of spirituality, compassion and learning to the community, according to his biography, and he loves welcoming everyone, including LGBT people, into the congregation.\n\nAnna Salton Eisen, a founder and former president of the synagogue, said the congregation has about 140 members and Cytron-Walker has worked hard to build interfaith relationships in the community, including doing pulpit swaps and participating in a community peace walk. She described Saturday\u2019s events as \u201csurreal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is unlike anything we\u2019ve ever experienced. You know, it\u2019s a small town and it\u2019s a small congregation,\u201d Eisen said as the hostage situation was ongoing. \u201cNo matter how it turns out it\u2019s hard to fathom how we will all be changed by this, because surely we will be.\u201d\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued a statement thanking law enforcement after the hostage situation ended.\n\n\u201cThere is more we will learn in the days ahead about the motivations of the hostage taker. But let me be clear to anyone who intends to spread hate\u2014we will stand against anti-Semitism and against the rise of extremism in this country,\u201d Biden said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said on Twitter that he had been monitoring the situation closely. \u201cThis event is a stark reminder that antisemitism is still alive and we must continue to fight it worldwide,\u201d he wrote. He said he was \u201crelieved and thankful\u201d that the hostages were rescued.\n\nThe standoff had prompted increased security in other places, including New York City, where police said that they had increased their presence \u201cat key Jewish institutions\u201d out of an abundance of caution.\n\nSiddiqui earned advanced degrees from Brandeis University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before she was sentenced in 2010 to 86 years in prison on charges that she assaulted and shot at U.S. Army officers after being detained in Afghanistan two years earlier. The punishment sparked outrage in Pakistan among political leaders and her supporters, who viewed her as victimized by the American criminal justice system.\n\nIn the years since, Pakistan officials have expressed interest publicly in any sort of deal or swap that could result in her release from U.S. custody, and her case has continued to draw attention from supporters. In 2018, for instance, an Ohio man who prosecutors say planned to fly to Texas and attack the prison where Siddiqui is being held in an attempt to free her was sentenced to 22 years in prison.\n\n___\n\nGet Outlook for Android",
