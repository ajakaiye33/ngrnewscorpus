          "title": "NDLEA traces N4.2bn to Abba Kyari, co-accused\u2019s accounts",
          "text": "Fresh facts have emerged on how suspended super cop and former Commander of the Intelligence Response Team, DCP Abba Kyari; as well as his deputy, ACP Sunday Ubua, allegedly received a combined N4.2bn from their separate bank accounts.\n\nThe details are part of a report sent to the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, by the NDLEA.\n\nAccording to the drug enforcement agency, not less than N1.4bn passed through Kyari\u2019s account while he was commander of the IRT.\n\nHowever, Kyari\u2019s deputy, Ubua, may have received far more than him as not less than N2.8bn was traced to his eight bank accounts.\n\nAccording to investigations, Ubua allegedly received a lump sum of N2.664bn on August 15, 2019. The NDLEA is now working on the assumption that the sums traced to Kyari and his deputy may be connected to the sale of some illicit substances including Tramadol worth N3bn.\n\nA source said, \u201cYou will recall that the NDLEA is investigating an allegation that Kyari and his team seized a large consignment of tramadol in a warehouse at Amuwo Odofin in Lagos. The consignment was worth about N3bn.\n\n\u201cThe IRT under Kyari\u2019s command seized these drugs and they are believed to have sold the consignment to a cartel afterwards. It was around the time of this seizure that Kyari\u2019s deputy received a deposit of N2.664bn in his personal bank account. Out of this money, he purchased FBN Insurance shares worth about N100m.\u201d\n\nNDLEA seeks AGF\u2019s approval to confiscate Kyari\u2019s assets, bank accounts\n\nMeanwhile, the NDLEA has written a letter to the AGF seeking his approval for the confiscation of properties and assets belonging to the once revered super cop.\n\nIt was gathered that the NDLEA\u2019s request was dispatched to the justice minister last week following the March 7 arraignment of Kyari and his men for dealing in cocaine.\n\nKyari is facing eight counts of conspiracy, obstruction, and dealing in cocaine, and other related offences at the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nThe other defendants in the charge marked FHC/ABJ/57/2022, are four members of the IRT, Ubua, Bawa James, Simon Agirigba and John Nuhu.\n\nTwo other suspects arrested at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu, Chibunna Patrick Umeibe and Emeka Alphonsus Ezenwanne, were also listed as defendants.\n\nKyari, has been indicted in the United States for alleged involvement in a $1.1m scam carried out by a notorious Internet scammer, Ramon Abass, a.ka. Hushpuppi was suspended by the police last July.\n\nA source said the drug agency\u2019s request is receiving the AGF\u2019s attention, noting that Malami was in the process of approving the seizure of the embattled DCP\u2019s assets and property to ensure he did not benefit from the proceeds of crime.\n\nOur correspondent gathered that the ex-IRT commander\u2019s assets that will be confiscated include cash and money in bank accounts, vehicles, real estate, notably hotels, residential and commercial buildings; personal effects such as wristwatches, jewellery and other valuable possessions.\n\nThe PUNCH learnt that the AGF\u2019s approval was required by the NDLEA to seize a suspect\u2019s property pending conviction by the court.\n\nA senior officer stated, \u201cUnder the NDLEA Act, the NDLEA cannot forfeit his assets unless based on the consent of the Attorney-General. The NDLEA wrote last week and the AGF is considering the request.\u201d\n\nThe NDLEA spokesman, Mr Femi Babafemi, confirmed the development, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a normal procedure to seek approval for a no debit order on suspects\u2019 bank accounts when suspicious transactions are noticed in such accounts.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Justice has denied changing its legal opinion in respect of the money laundering case against Kyari, stating that the prima facie case against him still subsists.\n\nThe Director of Public Prosecution, Ministry of Justice, Mohammed Abubakar, said the AGF has not issued another opinion on the case, noting that the legal advice issued to the police in January still stands.\n\nAbubakar told our correspondent on the phone on Sunday that the police were expected to probe the allegation but failed to carry out the necessary forensic analysis of the phones of the suspects which could have provided the money trail linking the senior police officer to Hushpuppi\u2019s syndicate members.\n\nHe said, \u201cYou rightly quoted our first opinion where we said they (police) should establish the linkages- trace the money trail. We didn\u2019t say the case file doesn\u2019t contain sufficient evidence. It was their (police) response we were referring to. The prima facie evidence we said exists still exists.\n\n\u201cThe response they sent to us after we sent in our opinion did not sufficiently address the issues we raised. That was the point we raised; maybe, we should have done it differently. We didn\u2019t abrogate our opinion. Our legal opinion still subsists; you don\u2019t seek for legal opinion twice.\n\n\u201cThere is nowhere we said we changed our position. If you look very well, our position is the same as that of the Police Service Commission. When you have a case and you need further investigation and that further investigation is not conducted, you cannot go to court with half evidence.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the gaps in the police investigation, the DPP added, \u201cNormally, they should have done the forensic analysis of the phone records of all the suspects and that would have given them an idea of how they dealt with the money, which sent the money, when they collected the money, what they did with it. They didn\u2019t do all of these.\u201d\n\nIn a separate statement by his Spokesman, Umar Gwandu, the AGF stated that he had not changed his opinion on Kyari\u2019s indictment. Rather, he only called for a further probe, a demand which may have been misunderstood.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cIt was a case of work in progress in respect of which the office of the AGF requested for further probe in relation to some aspects of investigation.\n\n\u201cIt was clear that the conclusion on the alleged contradiction on the issue was a clear misconception. The office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice\u2019s stance is that no conclusion has been reached in the direction of absence of evidence relating to the first report.\u201d ,,\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "We won\u2019t make gunpoint negotiations with ASUU, says FG",
          "text": "THE Federal Ministry of Education has said it will not enter into agreements with the Academic Staff Union of Universities under duress.\n\nThe ministry called on ASUU to call off its strike \u201cso that we will not have gunpoint negotiations and make promises that we will not be able to fulfil.\u201d\n\nThe ministry\u2019s spokesman, Ben Goong, made this known in an interview with The PUNCH on Sunday.\n\nOur correspondent also gathered that the National Executive Council of the union, which is currently meeting at the University of Abuja, would announce the final decision on whether to proceed with an indefinite strike or suspend the current industrial action today (Monday).\n\nThe National President, ASUU, Emmanuel Osodeke, confirmed that the NEC was indeed meeting, but refused to make further comments.\n\n\u201cThe NEC is meeting and details will be communicated,\u201d the ASUU president simply said.\n\nHowever, a high ranking source in the NEC told our correspondent that the union would have no choice but to go on full blown strike as the government had failed to do anything tangible to meet its demands.\n\n\u201cThe government has not done any tangible thing since the announcement of the warning strike. As much as we are not happy about going on strike, I am afraid to say that we have no choice this time. However, the final decision lies with the NEC,\u201d the source said.\n\nHowever, Goong stated, \u201cThe government has done something tangible. Even The PUNCH has been reporting some of the things that the government did to avert this strike. If I were ASUU, I would call off the strike and that is what we are telling ASUU to do. Call off the strike so that nobody will be negotiating out of duress. If you continue the strike, we will have agreements at gunpoint with you.\n\n\u201cIf they stay on the strike, in a desperate attempt to make sure that the universities are re-opened, we will make agreements under duress. We are not in a state of war that you must be on strike before you negotiate. You say it is a warning strike and the government has begun the implementation of agreements, it is only normal that you call off your strike, but it is as if they have that mindset of a strike.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, fresh crises have risen following the declaration by the Director-General of the National Information Technology Development Agency, Kashifu Inuwa, that the University Transparency and Accountability Solution, created by ASUU in lieu of the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System for the payment of university lecturers, has failed an integrity test.\n\nASUU, in a statement on Sunday, accused Inuwa of deliberately misinforming the public and invited the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, as well as the NITDA boss to a public debate over the integrity of UTAS.\n\nThe statement by Osodeke, read in part, \u201cThe one-month roll-over strike by our union on February 14, 2022, has entered its fourth week. During this period, we have been having engagements with the government over the contending issues that necessitated the action. One of the contending issues is the deployment of the UTAS, which is a robust software created by the ASUU technical group to manage personnel and payroll in the university system.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government had referred UTAS to NITDA to conduct user acceptance test and vulnerability test assessment and penetration test prior to the final deployment. The process, which commenced on Thursday, March 3, is still ongoing.\n\n\u201cThis press statement is necessitated by the need for ASUU to put the records straight on the grounds already covered in our patriotic struggle to get the government to deploy UTAS as a suitable solution for salary payment.\n\n\u201cOf special concern is the statement credited to both the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy and the Director-General of NITDA to the effect that UTAS had failed the integrity test. Let us put it on record that an integrity test was carried out by NITDA on August 10, 2021, in the NUC, where relevant government agencies and all the end-users in the university system were present.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the end of the exercise, all without exception expressed satisfaction with UTAS. This was attested to the effect that UTAS scored 85 per cent in the User Acceptance Test.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "THE Saraki Support Group has said the eighth Senate under Dr Bukola Saraki passed the most bills since 1999 to give direction to the economy and strengthen the country\u2019s ability to tackle corruption.\n\nThis was in reaction to a statement issued by the Buhari Media Organisation alleging that Saraki\u2019s tenure as the 13th President of the Senate was a disaster.\n\nThe Director, SSG, Earl Onaiwu, disclosed this in a statement on Sunday, describing the allegation as an ignorant assessment.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe attention of the Saraki Support Group has been drawn to a statement signed by the duo of Niyi Akinsiju and Cassidy Maduekwe on behalf of the Buhari Media Organisation where they alleged that the tenure of Dr Bukola Saraki as the 13th President of the Nigerian Senate was a disaster.\n\n\u201cWe believe such a statement could only be signed by failed professionals and bootlickers, who could not appreciate the work of the legislature in a democracy. Otherwise, Akinsiju and Maduekwe would not have made such an ignorant assessment of the eighth Senate under Saraki, which has been adjudged as the best Senate since the return of democracy in Nigeria in 1999.\n\nWhen we read their statement, the question that came to our mind is whether these people live in Nigeria or they reside in Siberia, where they have no access to news about governance in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe facts are there that the eighth Senate passed the most bills since 1999 and they are not just ordinary bills. The bills passed by the eighth Senate are bills that helped to give direction to the economy, strengthen the nation\u2019s ability to tackle corruption, positively affect the lives of the people, and seek to make Nigerians secure.\u201d\n\nOnaiwu also explained that some of the innovations introduced under Saraki\u2019s tenure continued as a tradition in the Senate.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe 319 bills passed by the eighth Senate are more than all the bills passed by the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh Senate combined. The same thing is with the 192 petitions successfully attended to by the eighth Senate. Up till today, some of the innovations introduced by the eighth Senate continue as a tradition in the Senate.\n\n\u201cIn fact, laws like the Petroleum Industry Bill, CAMA, Police Reforms Act and the recently passed Electoral Act signed into law after passage by the current National Assembly were not different from the versions passed by the eighth Senate, which were rejected for political reasons by the executive.\n\n\u201cThe facts on the ground do not support the false claims made by the cheap propagandists in the BMO, whose relevance is decided by their genuflecting before government officials. If these ideologies are spreading falsehood, discerning Nigerians know the facts and they can decipher the difference. The eighth Senate led by Dr Bukola Saraki did well for Nigeria. It represented the independence of the judiciary and co-operated with the executive where necessary.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Dr Bukola Saraki\n\nBy Olayinka Ajayi\n\nFormer Senate President, Bukola Saraki has commended the Senate for shutting down President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s proposed amendment to Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act.\n\nSpeaking on a monitored programme on Channels television, \u2018Sunday Politics\u2019 Saraki who lauded the Red Chamber for being nationalistic in its approach said: \u201cI must commend the Senate for doing the right thing. What is the right thing? It is to make laws for the nation. Democracy is for the majority, if a political appointee has a burning desire to represent his people, then he must be ready to resign and go to contest.\n\n\u201cTo sit in an office, with undue advantage of that office, is totally unacceptable. It is not fair to others, so he can still resign and go to the contest. To me those are the things that truly do not help our democracy. So, the Senate did the right thing. It didn\u2019t even get a second reading. So, the National Assembly has shown that when you go to that chamber you think of Nigeria not the political party you are representing.

The House of Representatives would do the same thing because this is what is right.\n\nAsked if it would be fair on political appointees that were former governors like him, the former Senate President said: \u201cWhat is important for us now should be how to run an inclusive system. A lot of young people are giving up on the system. They feel the system is rigged and then you think we should make the system more difficult for them? I will not support that.

          "text": ",\n\nBy Peter Okutu, Abakaliki\n\nA former Senator in Ebonyi State, Senator Julius Ucha, Sunday, described the Court verdict on the removal of Governor David Umahi and his Deputy, Dr Kelechi Igwe as unconditional and illegal.\n\nHe added that the judgement of the Federal High Court in Abuja over the defection of Umahi and his deputy would be subject to judicial interpretation by the Appellate and Supreme Courts.\n\nIn a statement issued in Abakaliki, the Pioneer Speaker of Ebonyi State House of Assembly noted that the 1999 Constitution and 2010 Electoral Act both as amended did not contemplate what will happen when a serving Governor defects from one political party to another.\n\nUcha added: \u201cthe 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) stipulates reasons for the defection and those stipulations are only applicable to members of State House of Assembly and National Assembly. There\u2019s no provision in the Constitution contemplating what will happen when a Governor defects.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I do not know why the issue of the defection of a State Governor is a subject matter of litigation. The 1999 Constitution of the FRN as amended has a specific provision as to how a Governor can vacate his office. Those provisions are by death, resignation, incapacitation and by impeachment on misconduct by the State House of Assembly. It is not known to law or the Constitution that a Governor can be removed from office as a result of defection\u201d.\n\nUcha, a two term senator who represented Ebonyi Central, dismissed the nomination of some persons to act as a Governor and deputy Governor by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, as a sheer mockery and celebration of absurdity in the highest order.\n\nHe said that when the PDP was talking about reclaiming Ebonyi state, it was not only a distraction but deception and diversionary to make it difficult for Governor Umahi to install his successor.\n\n\u201cThey are pretty sure that it is practically impossible to remove the Governor on account of his defection from one political party to the other. So, their attention is focused on 2023 not on the instant case\u201d.\n\n\u201cI say this because 2010 Electoral Act and 1999 constitution as amended have specific provisions that make it impossible for anybody who has not fully participated in all the stages of election to be appointed a Governor\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt then follows that as provided in Section 141 of the 2010 Electoral Act as amended, it states that Election Tribunal or Court shall not under any circumstance, declare any person a winner of any election in which such a person has not fully participated in all the stages of the election. See also section 285 (13) which did not only emphasize but amplify the position of the Electoral Act in this matter\u201d.\n\nHe however stated that if a Party secures judgement against a State Governor on defection, the Governor has the right to appeal such judgement as in the case of Umahi and his deputy.\n\n\u201cIn any event, it is a trite law that when Courts of coordinate jurisdiction give conflicting judgement, Honourable the Attorney General of the Federation is at will to choose which order to obey\u201d.\n\n\u201cI want to call on our leaders whether in PDP or APC from the State who are busy recruiting outsiders to brew crisis in the state to desist from such machinations in order not to reincarnate the past political crisis that almost destroyed our dear state during the notorious Abuja Group between 1999 and 2003\u201d, Ucha said.\n\nThe APC chieftain, therefore, called on the people of Ebonyi State, the APC family in the State and Nigerians to remain calm as there are other levels of appellate Court and Supreme Court that will give further judicial interpretations to the laws as they relate to the instant case on the defection of a Serving State Governor.",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Peter Okutu, Abakaliki\n\nThe Ebonyi State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Sunday, came heavily on Governor Ezenwo Nyesom Wike of Rivers State for allegedly making uncomplimentary remarks against the personality and political status of Governor David Nweze Umahi of Ebonyi State.\n\nThe Governor of Rivers State was quoted as saying that Umahi was passing through a judicial crisis, following his defection from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP to the APC in the State.\n\nDisclosing this in a statement titled \u201cGov. Wike\u2019s reckless outburst against Gov David Umahi: An affront on Nigeria Judiciary\u201d, the State Chairman of APC, Chief Stanley Okoro-emegha alleged that Governor Wike \u201chas achieved nothing other than violence, turbulence and destruction of people\u2019s hard-earned property ever since he became the Governor of Rivers State\u201d.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cThe attention of the Ebonyi State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has been drawn to the reckless outburst of the primitive Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike. The Rivers State Governor was reacting to the very unjust and widely condemnable Federal High Court ruling which recently sacked Governor Umahi and his Deputy, Dr Kelechi Igwe.\n\n\u201cAfter listening to Governor Wike\u2019s reckless tirades against Governor Umahi, which is very characteristic of him, the Ebonyi APC feels obligated to reply the garrulous, highly pompous but poorly performing Governor of Rivers State, and to place him where he rightly belongs.\n\n\u201cNigerians are very much aware that there is no comparison between the widely rated performing Governor of Ebonyi State, Engr. Chief David Umahi, and the power-drunk Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, in any area, as Governor Umahi clearly surpasses the sleeping Governor of Rivers state in all indexes of performance both in private life and in Public service.\n\n\u201cIt is a measure of the rot in our Democracy that a Governor of a state will have no qualms in publicly reprimanding and threatening to deal with a fellow Governor over an issue that is before a court of competent jurisdiction. It speaks to the malaise in the Nigerian judiciary and further lends credible credence to the insinuations that our judicial system is indeed being manipulated by some powerful forces against ordinary Nigerians.\n\n\u201cGovernor David Umahi has since appealed the judgement of the Federal High Court Abuja while hoping that the appellate courts will upturn the ruling of the lower court because it is not in consonance with any of the already established legal precedents on the issue of defection in the country.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, Nigerians are however invited to note that the current travails of Governor David Umahi have nothing whatsoever to do with offending any law, but a clear case of political enemies persecuting a performing Governor because of his rising political profile as indicated by the utterances of Governor Wike.\n\n\u201cWike should know that it is God that lifts and not mortals like him. So, no amount of his evil plots will be portent enough as to be able to dislodge nor remove a serving Governor who was single-handedly installed by God Himself for a unique purpose for His people.\n\n\u201cWike and his co-travellers should go to hell and burn to ashes if they cannot accept the verdict of God which has clearly positioned Governor Umahi as the most qualified and preferred aspirant to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 and stop behaving like sadists who are hell-bent on equalizing misery.\n\n\u201cThe All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ebonyi State, the good people of Ebonyi State and indeed all lovers of Democracy will continue to support and pray for Governor Umahi not only for the restoration of his mandate but also for his victory as the President of Nigeria in 2023, because the wickedness of men can never overshadow the grace and mercy of God Almighty.\n\n\u201cIf not that Governor Umahi has warned us against attacking any leader or Governor on his behalf, i would have properly situated the despicable character in Rivers State Government House who now masquerades as a Governor.\n\n\u201cHowever Governor Wike is once again advised to focus his attention on solving the numerous developmental challenges buffetting his Rivers State, and stop dissipating energy sounding like the godfather of the Nigeria body-polity. \u201c\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Before now, the condition of this road was nothing to write home about. It was in a total and complete disrepair and rendering a lot of business moribund.

Some even left the country and we thought this was not good enough.\n\n\u201cI made a presentation to President Muhammadu Buhari to take over the road because it is a road of economic importance and we can not claim to live up to our responsibility without taking up the repair of the road.\n\n\u201cApart from leading to the industrial hub of the state, the road also serves as a link to Lagos, neighbouring states and some states in the north, so, it became imperative for us to put the road in good condition\u201d, he stated.\n\nAbiodun, however, said a team to be headed by his deputy would be set up to look into the Adesola Market as well as the abandoned flyover in the axis, reiterating that his administration would complete projects that have direct bearing on the lives of the people.\n\nHe further stated that his administration had awarded the construction of Ilisan-Ago-Iwoye and Ilaro-Owode roads, while talks were on with the Dangote Group to construct the Papalanto-Ilaro road.\n\nThe governor also restated the commitment of his administration to complete the Agro Cargo Airport at Ilishan-Remo, which according to him is expected to be completed on December this year.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Olodan of Odan, Oba Teslim Nosiru, said the road is very important as it serves not only the companies operating in the area but the residents.\n\nHe pleaded with the state government not to forget provision of modern fire station to respond to emergency situations, after the completion of the road.",

          "text": "Two groups, The Mandate Eye and the Akwa Ibom Integrity Alliance, have condemned the attack on Hon. Aniekan Bassey, Speaker of the Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly at Ibiono Ibom Local Government Area.\n\nBassey and Godwin Ekpo, the member representing Ibiono Ibom in the Assembly, had gone to consult stakeholders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on his senatorial ambition before the speaker was attacked by youths.\n\nIt was gathered that loyalists of a top governorship aspirant in the area insisted that before the speaker addressed them, he must remove his face cap which had the insignia of Governor Udom Emmanuel\u2019s preferred successor, Pastor Umo Eno.\n\nBassey refused to take the cap off, insisting he was not there to campaign for Eno but to consult on his ambition to run for senate in 2023. He was forced to leave after the youths insisted he could not address them with the cap on.\n\nResponding to the ugly incident, the groups in a joint press conference at the weekend by the leaders, Uwemedimo Umana, Stephen Abia and Faith Mbowo, described the incident as sacrilegious on the office of the Speaker who is the number three citizen in the state.\n\nBarrister Abia, who is the chairman of the Akwa Ibom Integrity Alliance, expressed disappointment that some people could constitute a nuisance and go about harassing politicians who do not align with their views in the 21st century.\n\n\u201cWe are indeed saddened that in the 21st century, a bunch of sane beings could constitute themselves into a nuisance and go around harassing and assaulting innocent persons who do not align with their political views.\n\n\u201cIt is worse that they could go as far as demanding that Hon. Aniekan Bassey the State\u2019s number three citizen should take off his cap because it carried the imprimatur of his preferred Governorship aspirant, Pastor Umo Eno, not that of their alleged principal, Senator Bassey Albert Akpan.\n\n\u201cAre these agitators telling us that if Aniekan Bassey had put on a pair of trousers or shirt with the inscription of Umo Eno, they would have stripped him naked before allowing him to consult Ibiono Ibom delegates?\u201d he asked.\n\nWhile commending the speaker for his peaceful disposition by leaving the scene immediately, Abia called on security agencies in the state to take further steps by ensuring that all those fingered in the act are brought to book immediately.\n\nAlso reacting, the Director of Communications, The Mandate Eye, Dr Uwemedimoh Umanah said the action of the youths was the height of disrespect to the office of the speaker and an infringement on his human rights.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis represented a sacrilege and the height of disrespect to the office of the No 3 Citizen of the state. Let us at this critical juncture salute Mr Speaker for displaying such unparalleled leadership and statesmanship through actions that circumvented violence and hostilities in the state. That Mr Speaker did not allow the appurtenances and weight of his office to influence him typifies altruistic leadership.\n\n\u201cThat dastardly act infringed on the fundamental right of association and speech of the Speaker, as enshrined in Section 40 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended, inter alia: \u2018Every person shall be entitled to assemble freely and associate with other persons, and in particular he may form or belong to any political party, trade union or any other association for the protection of his interests.\u2019\n\n\u201cTherefore undermining Mr Aniekan Bassey\u2019s fundamental rights is antithetical to democratic culture and the process of democratic consolidation in the state.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the agitation for micro-zoning the governorship to Itu/Ibiono Federal Constituency, the groups stressed that it was not the sole preserve of Ibiono Ibom, since there has never been micro- zoning for the governorship position in the state saying, \u201cthe Governorship position is therefore open to everyone in all the Local Government Areas in Uyo Senatorial District of Akwa Ibom State.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuffice it to say that, if the zoning of the governorship were done on the basis of Local Government Areas or micro- zoning, it would take about 36 years within Uyo alone, before it gets to the next Senatorial District. It is therefore morally reprehensible, unthoughtful, illogical and insensitive for any person or group to feel entitled to the seat of Governor and subject it to personal considerations- against the interest of the whole state,\u201d they said.",

          "text": "For Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, the Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the 2022 International Women\u2019s Day became a day for acknowledging his role in women empowerment in the country, as numerous beneficiaries of his efforts decorated him with awards of recognition.\n\nThe event was a public lecture organized by the Kano Civil Society Forum (KCSF), an umbrella body of over 200 women\u2019s rights groups, in conjunction with the Aminu Kano Centre for Democratic Studies of Bayero University, to mark the 2022 International Women Day (IWD), which Danbatta chaired yesterday in Kano State.\n\nHowever, while Danbatta, according to the programme event, was to present awards to various women who have distinguished themselves in different endeavours, little did he know that the beneficiaries of various youth entrepreneur skills and other empowerment programmes of both the Commission and his personal charity foundation, Danbatta Charity Foundation (NCF), planned an ambush to present their own prizes to him.\n\nIn the same vein, the CDS, Mumbayya House and KCSF also presented their award of recognition to the EVC, leaving the NCC boss visibly surprised.\n\nEarlier, Danbatta told the gathering that he is a strong believer in the potentiality of womenfolk and he has never hesitated to entrust responsibilities to his female colleagues because he has always found them to be very reliable when assigned official tasks.\n\n\u201cI am a very, very strong believer of the tremendous potentiality of members of the womenfolk. And they do it with such finesse, not with any aggression like men do. Women, by their very nature, are tender. They attend to whatever they are doing with finesse in a very careful manner. And they deliver on targets given to them before deadlines,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nSpeaking further, the EVC said, he has never given an assignment to any of the women in the Commission, which was not delivered before the deadline, \u201cto the extent that, ladies and gentlemen, I am always comfortable to have a woman chair committee, whenever there is a need\u201d.\n\nDanbatta, who said that respect for women is natural to him, as it is one of the values his late mum inculcated in him, expressed his delight about the fact that women are now working their way to the top echelon of responsibilities in the country.\n\n\u201cWe now have women in every sector of the economy, in every area of human endeavour. We have them as engineers, medical doctors, seasoned administrators, name it. In the commission I am heading, we have 4 female directors. The Director of Zonal Operations is a woman.\n\n\u201cThe Director of Policy competition, and Economic Analysis is a woman, and also a lawyer. Equally, the Director of Legal and Regulatory Services is a woman, and lastly the Director of Projects.\n\n\u201cAnd I am not saying this out of any disrespect for the womenfolk. Far from that. Importantly, more than 50% of the workforce in NCC is made up of women,\u201d Danbatta informed his audience.\n\nThe NCC boss further stated that the Commission is particularly committed to bridging the gender-oriented digital divide. Hence, the NCC has put, in the front burner, the need to expose girls and young women to more opportunities in the digital ecosystem, in line with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) resolution 70, which advocates gender mainstreaming and promotion of gender equality, as well as the empowerment of women through information and communications technology (ICT).\n\nThe EVC later commissioned the e-library of the Aminu Kano Centre for Democratic Studies, an arm of Bayero University, which was donated by the Commission in line with the Federal Government\u2019s commitment to the promotion of the digital economy programmes.",

          "text": "A former Senator in Ebonyi State, Julius Ucha, has described the removal order of Ebonyi State Governor, Engr David Umahi, and his deputy, Barrister Kelechi Igwe, as illegal.\n\nHe added that the judgment of the Federal High Court in Abuja over the defection of Umahi and his deputy would be subject to judicial interpretation by the appellate And supreme courts.\n\nIn a statement issued in Abakaliki, the pioneer Speaker of the Ebonyi State House of Assembly noted that the 1999 constitution and 2010 Electoral Act both as amended did not contemplate what will happen when a serving governor defects from one political party to another.\n\nUcha added: \u201cthe 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) stipulates reasons for the defection and those stipulations are only applicable to members of State House of Assembly and National Assembly. There\u2019s no provision in the Constitution contemplating what will happen when a Governor defects.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I do not know why the issue of the defection of a state Governor is a subject matter of litigation. The 1999 Constitution of the FRN as amended has a specific provision as to how a Governor can vacate his office. Those provisions are by death, resignation, incapacitation and by impeachment on misconduct by the State House of Assembly. It is not known to law or the Constitution that a Governor can be removed from office as a result of defection\u201d.\n\nUcha, a two-term senator, who represented Ebonyi Central, dismissed the nomination of some persons to act as a Governor and Deputy Governor by the Peoples Democratic Party as a sheer mockery and celebration of absurdity which must be discountenanced.\n\nHe said that when the PDP was talking about reclaiming Ebonyi State, it was not only a distraction but deception and diversionary to make it difficult for Governor Umahi to install his successor.\n\n\u201cThey are pretty sure that it is practically impossible to remove the Governor on account of his defection from one political party to the other. So, their attention is focused on 2023, not on the instant case.\n\n\u201cI say this because 2010 Electoral Act and 1999 constitution as amended have specific provisions that make it impossible for anybody who has not fully participated in all the stages of election to be appointed a Governor.\n\n\u201cIt then follows that as provided in Section 141 of the 2010 Electoral Act as amended, it states that Election Tribunal or Court shall not under any circumstance, declare any person a winner of any election in which such a person has not fully participated in all the stages of the election. See also section 285 (13) of 1999 Constitution of FRN as amended which did not only emphasize but amplified the position of the Electoral Act in this matter,\u201d he said.\n\nHe however stated that if a party secures judgment against a state Governor on defection, he has the right to appeal such judgment as in the case of Umahi and his deputy.\n\n\u201cIn any event, it is a trite law that when Courts of coordinate jurisdiction give conflicting judgement, Honourable the Attorney General of the Federation is at will to choose which order to obey.\n\n\u201cI want to call on our leaders whether in PDP or APC from the State who are busy recruiting outsiders to brew crisis in the state to desist from such machinations in order not to reincarnate the past political crisis that almost destroyed our dear state during the notorious Abuja Group between 1999 and 2003,\u201d Ucha said.\n\nThe APC chieftain, therefore, called on the people of Ebonyi State, the APC family in the state and Nigerians to remain calm as there are other levels of the appellate court and Supreme Court that will give further judicial interpretations to the laws as they relate to the instant case on the defection of a serving State Governor.",

          "title": "Depression after childbirth: A silent killer",
          "text": "Many women experience unexplainable emotional changes after childbirth, one of which is post-partum depression. However, depression after childbirth often worsens because some live in denial while others cannot seek help because of the fear of stigmatisation. OYEBOLA OWOLABI reports that conversations about mood swings after childbirth, and the need to ensure access to help, are scaling up.\n\nOmotola Uti, a mother of one, knew nothing about postpartum depression (PPD) till a few weeks to her delivery date. It was mentioned briefly during one of the ante-natal lectures, and this prompted her to further research into depression after childbirth \u2013 an illness that affects nothing less than 20 per cent of mothers in developing countries, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nThis, however, did not exclude her from the experience. \u201cI did not know about postpartum depression until few weeks to my delivery date, and that was because it was mentioned briefly during ante-natal. I then read further to get more understanding. And yes I experienced it after delivery. I was lost; I could not come to the reality of having just delivered my baby. I felt so strange that I avoided my baby sometimes. However my husband and mum gave the needed support, and because I had read about it, I was able to work on myself,\u201d she said.\n\nPraise Agboola is a mother of two who also experienced PPD after giving birth to her first child. She wept profusely during her christening, though she couldn\u2019t explain the reason for her sadness. \u201cI couldn\u2019t eat well, I couldn\u2019t sleep well, I was sad for no reason, I always felt like crying and, some days, I just wanted to walk away because I didn\u2019t want to see anybody come visit me or the baby. But I had a very supportive husband and mother who helped me in all ways and I gradually snapped out of it.\u201d\n\nWhile Uti and Agboola were lucky and are now sharing their stories to help others, some others are not. One of such is Bola Olorunyomi (pseudonym) who had one child before she died. This only child she could not even nurse because she died due to postpartum depression. Perhaps, her condition worsened because she was married to a cleric and they were too ashamed to seek medical help. They maybe lived in denial, or thought the world would say they didn\u2019t pray enough.\n\nDolapo Olaoye didn\u2019t experience any of this, but she lost someone to the condition. \u201cIs postpartum depression real? Yes, most definitely! I know someone who had it; so I know it is real. She is late now following some complications. And even if she was alive, she won\u2019t be willing to talk about it because she lived in denial.\u201d\n\nAccording to medical experts, PPD can occur during pregnancy or after the birth of a baby. Postpartum depression is usually diagnosed within a year after the woman has given birth, but can extend beyond that. Postpartum depression suffered by a mother following childbirth, typically arising from the combination of hormonal changes, psychological adjustment to motherhood, and fatigue; postnatal depression.\n\nIt is estimated that 10 to 15 per cent of new adult mothers develop PPD within the first year after giving birth, and the percentage increases up to 26 per cent in adolescent mothers, according to monsenso.com, an online health magazine. However, it often remains undiagnosed.\n\nPostpartum depression and its causes explained\n\nAccording to medical practitioners, depression after childbirth falls under types of mental illnesses which affect human beings, especially women. Mental illnesses are disorders, illnesses, conditions and challenges that affect the way we think, act and behave, says Dr. Maymunah Kadiri, a mental health advocate, psychiatrist and psychotherapist, who is also the Medical Director of Pinnacle Medical Services, Lekki, Lagos.\n\nDr. Kadiri, however, laments that women are generally twice prone to developing mental illnesses, one of which is depression. \u201cWomen generally are twice more depressed than men and there are some types of mental illnesses that are common in women than men, the most common being postpartum depression and this is because of our hormones.\n\n\u201cStudies will tell you that one out of every 10 women suffer postpartum depression. What most women experience is postpartum blues within the first three days of delivery, and over 80 per cent of women experience blues. But if a woman is still repulsive of her child after one week, then it grows into postpartum depression, and if not managed well, can lead to psychosis even after the baby has grown older,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Adebayo Awoniyi, a gynecologist at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idi-Araba, explains the diversity in the moods experienced by new mothers. \u201cThe spectrum starts with baby pink, baby blues, depression and the extreme, which is psychosis. Postpartum pink occurs few days after a woman gives birth and this happens to all women. The new mother has elevated hormones, excitement, happiness, hyperactive, and sometimes unable to sleep.\n\n\u201cPostpartum blues occurs in almost 80 per cent of women, especially after returning from the hospital and has no help. Symptoms could include inability to sleep because of the baby and the pressure is on. This, if not taken care of properly, depreciates into depression, which could present as low mood, lack of interest in what you enjoy, low energy. Psychosis is the extreme leg of the spectrum. You know it has gotten to this level when the woman hallucinates; some have delusion; while some might even talk of killing the baby.\u201d\n\nCauses of depression after childbirth could vary according to realities, but one generally-accepted cause remains life stressors. According to Mrs. Khadijat Hameed, a traditional health attendant of over 15 years, PPD could be hereditary when it is in the blood line. \u201cWhen a pregnant woman breaks certain taboos, either in her family or husband\u2019s, she could suffer postpartum depression. For instance, some women are not allowed to eat anything with salt, pepper and other condiments until seven days after delivery. If she does otherwise, it could result in postpartum depression, and sometimes death. There are also indications of spiritual undertones to it, especially those ones that refuse all forms of treatment. However, this condition is mostly caused by life stressors.\u201d\n\nProphetess Mary Famojuro, who runs a government-approved maternity home at Igando-Egan, Lagos State adds her voice to the reasons why women develop PPD. She said depression after childbirth can be acquired in three major ways: spiritual attack, hereditary factors and stress. \u201cThe spiritual attack is not very common, but sufferers will take treatment for life because the condition never really leaves them, it comes and goes seasonally. The woman will become pregnant while experiencing the condition, be delivered of her baby, get sane for a while, and become pregnant again in the condition.\n\n\u201cSometimes, it is hereditary like normal illnesses which affect the bloodline; meaning it could be in the third or fourth generation. I had a patient whose elder sister experienced it for all her pregnancies and they had to always visit Yaba or Abeokuta for treatment. The husband also explained that the condition lasts for the first six months after delivery. His wife was however having it for the first time. If this is traced through their blood line \u2013 paternal or maternal line \u2013 it could be discovered that one of their mothers had the problem. If it doesn\u2019t happen in the first to the third generation, it would in the fourth generation.\n\n\u201cSome develop it suddenly perhaps after experiencing life stressors, perhaps following a fight with the husband while pregnant. Women who are maltreated by their husbands during pregnancies are especially prone to developing this condition. However, it takes a lot of spiritual searching to know the source and cause, whether hereditary or otherwise, to be able to understand how to tackle it.\u201d\n\nDr. Kadiri agrees that PPD could be hereditary, but lists other risk factors that could cause the condition. She said PPD can be the result of exposure to certain environmental hazards \u2013 exhaust, toxins, alcohol. Others are life stressors \u2013 traumatic experiences, which could be relationship driven, economic or financial challenges, sickness, as well as school or work challenges. Blood chemistry can also cause it, she added.\n\n\u201cThere are certain mirror transmitters that cannot be seen in the brain, but when they malfunction, they cause chemical imbalances which trigger maladaptive behavioural issues. They could also be underlying medical conditions such as depression, diabetes, pre-menstrual disorder (which happens during our menstrual cycle) and some others.\n\n\u201cOther major causes of post-partum depression are the physiological changes that happen during and after pregnancy, such as the fluctuation of the hormones which cause very profound chemical changes in women. These changes get regulated with time but could also wreak havoc, especially the estrogen, which is significantly elevated during pregnancy, and then rapidly returns to normal within 24 hours of child birth.\n\n\u201cThe estrogen moves from one to 10 during pregnancy, but within 24 hours of having a baby, it goes back to one, that is a rapid return to normal. It is huge for a woman\u2019s brain chemistry to process and that is a primary contributor. Not all women will experience it, but some do and because they cannot cope, they start to behave abnormally.\n\n\u201cAnother all important factor is our lifestyle. In reality, women need more sleep than men, but we don\u2019t sleep. Lack of sleep and the stress associated with it (market runs, child care, school runs and others) force most women not to be intentional and deliberate about their wellbeing, and this can trigger a breakdown. There is also of course the social factor. Poverty is higher in women because most are not gainfully employed; women are not as empowered and employable as men. For example, some establishments do not readily employ a pregnant woman because of the fear of maternity leave. These factors can make women develop mental illness.\u201d\n\nPostpartum depression: Myth or reality\n\nIs PPD real, or is it a social construct following modernisation and technological advancement? Traditional medicine attendants argue that PPD is definitely not new to the Nigerian, nay Yoruba tradition. According to Mrs. Hameed, depression after childbirth is not a new phenomenon. Conversations about it are however not common because the society see it as an abnormality which should not be discussed in the open.\n\n\u201cPostpartum depression, in the Yoruba tradition, is called abisiwin, a condition which forces a woman to temporarily lose her sense of self after childbirth and so she is unwilling or unable to care for her herself or the child. Such a woman misbehaves and speaks incoherently. She could say she wants to throw the baby away. Some could start praying unnecessarily, maybe she was a prayer warrior, but she does it abnormally now. Some could also start cursing.\n\n\u201cWomen who suffer it do so in silence, having to lick their wounds in private because they don\u2019t want to be seen as lazy or otherwise. Another reason people keep quiet is because of stigmatisation, cultural beliefs and societal attitudes. Someone close to me was a victim but before she died, she opened up that her husband and siblings were always fighting and, in the process, the one who usually helps them died, and she was pregnant at the time. This caused her a lot of pains and she developed abisiwin which later led to her death.\u201d\n\nProphetess Famojuro provides a spiritual/religious perspective to it. \u201cI am a midwife with the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) and I can tell for sure that abisiwin is not new, it has been with us for ages but we usually don\u2019t talk about it because it was viewed as a disease and so should not be discussed. But as we get more knowledge in this job, we realise it is not a disease, but a disorder, the outcome of a particular situation/experience.\n\n\u201cA woman can develop \u2018abisiwin\u2019 after child birth if her husband\u2019s attitude toward her changes during pregnancy, or the woman couldn\u2019t get some baby items; these things could make her moody and destabilise her thoughts. The woman might begin to nag a lot; she reacts excessively to everything and her actions negate the reality of conversations.\n\n\u201cThe child might cry and instead of petting the baby, the mother shouts on it as if dealing with a three-year-old. She might even handle the baby anyhow and dress the baby in about six clothes. When we have such people, we pray for them and follow up medically. Some misbehave to the extent their baby is taken from them, and some women won\u2019t experience it until the second or third or even last child.\u201d\n\nFear of stigmatisation breeds silence\n\nBecause of the fear of stigmatisation, and sometimes self-denial, many women who suffer postpartum depression in Nigeria cannot speak out so they are not perceived as lazy or not woman enough. This is perhaps why there is no readily available data to measure its prevalence statistically, and so it is under reported. According to Dr. Awoniyi, the data available is under reported even in the world.\n\n\u201cPeople who have depression are about 15 to 20 per cent; almost all women experience postpartum blues, while it is about 0.1 to 0.2 per cent for psychosis. However, we might not have the actual figure here in Nigeria because people are not confident enough to share their experiences for the fear of stigmatisation. But, as a gynecologist, we try to address these issues from when the woman starts attending ante-natal clinic. We ask if there is any family history of mental disorders, is she having enough rest, is there domestic abuse, etc. It is after these questions that we know how to help the woman. We try as much as possible to work towards prevention.\u201d\n\nTreatment and management of postpartum depression\n\nJust like any other medical condition, PPD can be remedied, according to Mrs. Hammed. \u201cThe condition can be remedied with herbs and roots. Some they boil and drink, bath with, while some are used to prepare meals and they sleep off after eating. However, most young ones like me in this profession don\u2019t handle it because it is believed the condition could affect the caregiver if payment is taken for service. But the very elderly in age and experience, who understand the way and nature of the spiritual, have their methods of handling such cases.\u201d\n\nFor Prophetess Famojuro, handling a case of PPD requires both the spiritual and medical approaches. \u201cIn as much as we believe in the power and efficacy of prayers, we do not take the medical perspective for granted. One has to move with modern trends to remain relevant. We have had about five patients here and they all got well, even having more children without experiencing the condition. Some women would willingly open up to you during discussion, though not stating it outright. And when we hear such, we encourage them to return for the medications after delivery while we support with prayers.\u201d\n\nDr. Awoniyi, however, breaks the treatment plan into three steps. The first being identifying those who are at risk; second is breaking them into help groups \u2013 education, medication, rehabilitation, support, and level three is for the government to seeks ways to deal with the problem, a major one being to encourage women empowerment.\n\n\u201cWe identify those who are at risk and then decide how to help them. If they are smokers, we try to dissuade them from smoking. Do we need to collaborate with a psychiatrist, psychologist, or involve community and religious leaders? After this we educate, give medication, rehabilitate and give support where needed.\n\n\u201cThe third level is where the government should come in. There is a great need to establish special clinics where specialised services would be offered to these categories of women. There is also need for rehabilitation centres. But, above all, we need to encourage women empowerment. Women should be cared for because they are the backbone of every society; they need to be empowered financially because social status also plays a big role in why women suffer postpartum depression.\u201d",

          "text": "Electricity Generation Companies (GenCos) at the weekend painted a gloomy picture of the power sector as consumers groan under outages nationwide\n\nListed as their major challenges are N1.644 trillion owed them by a federal agency, the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company (NBET); lack of access to credit facilities and absence of a foreign technical partner.\n\nExecutive Secretary of the Association of Power Generation Companies (APGC), Dr Joy Ogaji, who highlighted the challenges, also said there has not been subsidy on electricity since the privatisation of the power sector in 2013.\n\nOgaji put the nation\u2019s current electricity generation at 4,000Megawatts and blamed the development on poor management of the power grid.\n\n\u201cCurrently today, we are owed by N1.644 trillion since 2013. One of the reasons that the power plants are down is due to inefficient management of the grid,\u201d she told reporters.\n\nThe APGC spokesman recalled that power generating plants were doing better when they were managed by a technical expert, Marek Martin.\n\nShe, therefore, advised the Federal Government to recall Martin, who according to her, developed tools that enabled the plants to work above average.\n\nHer words: \u201cRecently, you must have heard that Egbin in Lagos lost several units. When Marcel Martin was in Nigeria, he developed tools that were used to manage the grid by both the generation companies and distribution companies.\n\nShe also lamented that the GenCos exhausted all their borrowing sources after the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) warned banks against lending to them.\n\nThe Executive Secretary noted that were the thermal plants working optimally, the GenCos would produce about 9,000MW.\n\nAsked how many MWs the GenCos could generate if the thermal plants were working optimally, she replied:,\u201dIf you give us gas, provide FOREX to carry out maintenance. I have told you most of the units are down and money is needed to fix them.\n\n\u201cGive us enough money to pay our gas suppliers because it is prepayment. But for power, it takes and pays later. There is no way that this misalignment will help us.\n\n\u201cThe GenCos have exhausted all their lines of credit. You will remember in 2015 to 2016, the CBN told all the commercial banks not to lend money to the power sector again because we are not good at paying back.\n\n\u201cIf the government can clear our outstanding debts, give us foreign exchange to maintain our plants, we are ready to generate up to 8,000 to 9,000MW mechanically. That is if transmission and distribution are willing to take.\u201d\n\nOn electricity subsidy, she said: \u201cWe have not been given any subsidy.I say this because if the government has in the past brought N701billion; N601billion; N213billion, these are all monies geared towards our outstanding invoices.\n\n\u201cWhat we know is that part of our debts was paid through those facilities.\u201d",

It is impossible and can\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cBegging the Federal Government may simply give the impression that he is guilty of an offence when he has committed none.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government should do the needful by either withdrawing the charges on or before 8th April 2022 or allow for his unfettered discharge and acquittal.\u201d\n\nKanu was re-arraigned on January 19.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to the 15-count terrorism charge filed against him by the Federal Government.\n\nHe filed a preliminary objection to the charge, praying the court to strike out or quash them.\n\nOn the same day, an Umuahia High Court in Abia State awarded N1billion damages to Kanu in a judgment on his fundamental rights suit.\n\nKanu was accused of making a broadcast \u201cwith intent to intimidate the population\u201d, in which he \u201cthreatened that people will die, the whole world will standstill\u201d.\n\nHe was also accused of issuing \u201ca deadly threat\u201d that anyone who flouted his sit-at-home order should write his/her Will, which resulted in a lockdown of the Southeast.\n\nKanu also professed himself to be a member and leader of IPOB, a proscribed organisation in Nigeria, contrary to and punishable under Section 16 of the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act, 2013.\n\nHe was said to have incited members of the public \u201cto hunt and kill Nigerian security personnel and their families\u201d.\n\nThe Federal Government said Kanu directed IPOB members \u201cto manufacture bombs\u201d and to \u201cdestroy public facilities\u201d.\n\nHe also allegedly threatened the public not to come out on May 31, 2021, and directed them \u201cto destroy public transport system in Lagos, resulting in major economic loss to the government\u201d.\n\nThe prosecution said he \u201cimported into Nigeria and kept in Ubullisiuzor in Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State\u2026a radio transmitter known as Tram SOL concealed in a container of used household items which you declared as used household items\u201d.\n\nThe alleged offence, the prosecution said, is punishable under Section 1(2)(b) of the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act. 2013.",

          "text": "The Nigeria Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA, formerly Department of Petroleum Resources, DPR) has told the House of Representatives that only the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited can explain why it deducted about $1.2 billion from the Federation Account in 2019.\n\nThe agency said this in its response to a query from the Office of the Auditor General of the Federation (OAuGF) which asked it to recover the money from the NNPC or face sanction. In its annual report on Federal Government\u2019s consolidated financial statements of the year ended December 31, 2019 submitted to the National Assembly on August 18, 2019, the Auditor General for the Federation (AuGF) reported the deduction of $1,278,364,595.49 by the NNPC from oil and gas royalty assessed by the erstwhile DPR. The report said: \u201cAudit observed from the review of 2019 Joint Venture Ledger and other related records that the sum of US$1,278,364,595.49 was deducted by the NNPC from the Oil and Gas Royalty assessed by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) for 2019.\u201d\n\nThe AuGF gave a breakdown of the deduction as distribution of Mid/Downstream cost \u2013 $992,693,875.57; Repayment Agreement (RA) \u2013 Oil Royalty \u2013 $215,664,380.91; Modified Carry Agreement (MCA) \u2013 Oil Royalty \u2013 $59,075,576.79 and Modified Carry Agreement (MCA) \u2013 Gas Royalty \u2013 $10,930,762.22.\n\nIt added: \u201cThe deductions emanated from the assessments based on the Joint Venture arrangement that NNPC has with other operators in 2019, and no justifiable reasons were provided for the deductions of the above amount from proceeds of assessments before remittance into the Federation Account.\u201d\n\nThe AuGF stressed that in its response, the management of the DPR, as it was then, said: \u201cThe Department may have little or nothing to do in this regard because the deductions of the amount in question were made in accordance with the directive from the Federation Accounts and Allocation Committee (FAAC), and It is difficult to recover the amount from NNPC.\u201d\n\nThe AuGF said the Director/CEO of DPR should be directed to explain why U.S$1,278,364,595.49 was deducted by the NNPC from the Federation Account revenue proceeds, recover the said amount from the NNPC, deduct the 4 per cent cost of collection due on the amount and forward evidence of remittance into the Federation Account to the Public Account Committees of the National Assembly.\n\nFailure to do this, it said, the agency should be sanctioned for failure to collect and account for government revenue as stipulated in Paragraph 3112 (i) of the Financial Regulations.\n\nBut when the management appeared before the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Representatives, it said the money deducted by the NNPC was for priority projects of the Federal Government, adding that only the company could explain the deduction.\n\nThe NMDPRA said the money, which was supposed to enter an account belonging to the DPR and controlled by the AuGF, never entered the account.",

          "text": "\n\n* Says national convention still holds March 26\n\n*Bello, el-Rufai, Fayemi meet president in London\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has appraised recent developments in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and warned the leaders and members of the party to desist forthwith from name-calling and backstabbing.\n\nRather, he said, the party must be ready to put its house in order ahead of the planned national convention of the party holding in Abuja on March 26, 2022.\n\n\n\nThe embattled Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, is expected back in the country on Monday to assume the leadership of the party.\n\n\n\nAs Buni is being expected back to take over, the acting Chairman of the party and Niger State governor, Mr. Abubakar Sani Bello; Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai and their counterpart in Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, arrived London last night to meet with Buhari.\n\nThis is as the ruling party has clarified that the National Secretary of the party, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, did not resign his position, and was not sacked by the party.\n\n\n\nAs the governors elected on the platform of the ruling party await the outcome of the meeting between Buhari and some stakeholders of the party, they have also mounted pressure on Akpanudoedehe to sign the notice of the scheduled meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party.\n\n\n\nPresident Buhari, in a statement issued yesterday by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, tasked the leaders and membership of the APC to stop mudslinging ahead of the forthcoming national convention that will lead to the election of new national leaders to run the party for the next four years.\n\nHe also urged them to remain steadfast and maintain their unity if the party is to continue in the path of victory and its dominance at all levels throughout the country.\n\n\n\nThe president asked the APC members to look at the once-powerful, \u201cmain opposition\u201d Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) now enfeebled and adrift and learn lessons in disunity, mismanagement and corruption.\n\nHe warned that \u201dthey (PDP) failed in 16 years in power and a failure as opposition.\n\n\u201cYes, we are entitled to our share of dissent and intra-party discord. These are common in all parties, left and right all over the world.\n\n\n\n\u201dBut parties splintered by competing egos destine themselves to the worst possible fate\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, \u201dAs the country prepares for the long run-up to the 2023 presidential election, we all expect a robust debate on the issues that matter and what is going in the APC should be a reflection of this, not the infighting we are seeing. There must be no more distractions ahead of the convention to choose new leaders.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari recalled that the APC started with a confidence of victory, adding that the party today enjoys that confidence in nearly two-thirds of our 36 states.\n\n\n\nYet, he noted, this is a party that has been in existence barely for eight years, becoming the dominant party because it has thrown open its doors to defectors from other parties, big and small.\n\n\n\nThis alone, in addition to the fact \u201dwe didn\u2019t start on the note of arrogance of power, nor see government as a vehicle for self-aggrandisement, to be held at all costs, but a vehicle to bring development to all without discrimination-political, ethnic or regional to our dear country made this success possible.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe party, the president further noted, is proud of the fact that in its short period of existence, it has won two general elections decisively and despite losing a few states in 2019, it steadfastly expanded its pan-Nigerian outlook with significant defections of the opposition governors and parliamentarians into its fold.\n\n\n\n\u201dGiven all that is at a stake, we can expect contests into offices as we are now faced with to be heated although candidates and their promoters for party offices are not so much debating policy differences differences of management, personality, character, and suitability for the most important leadership roles in our country and therefore the continent.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuhari also stressed that for more than a week, the internal management affairs of the APC have been afforded generous media coverage \u2013 over and above its importance to the voters of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is important to ask what benefits the poor are getting during the period of intense negative coverage.\n\n\u201cWhen precisely the party\u2019s convention is held and who is the party\u2019s chairman is hardly a matter for the average voter: vastly more important is who convention delegates will elect as the party\u2019s flagbearer in the coming weeks to take forward the party\u2019s platform to the people in the general election in February next year.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, important for the media to put such matters into perspective. No one is debating policy differences here. That is for the general election. None of the declared aspirants and any of those that may step forward will change because of who may be in the party in the chairman\u2019s seat. It is essentially the same party.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course, the media are welcome to comment on the content of the character of the potential APC candidates; discuss their suitability for leadership; scrutinise their offer to the membership. But to focus on the routine internal divisions and magnify them into what they have become today is a waste of everyone\u2019s time, amounting to no more than a discussion over seating arrangements.\n\nThis is not what Nigerians talk of in their communities. They incline only for things that matter.\u201d\n\nBello, el-Rufai, Fayemi Meet Buhari in London\n\nMeanwhile, the acting Chairman of the party and Niger State Governor, Bello; Kaduna State Governor, el-Rufai and their counterpart in Ekiti State, Fayemi, arrived London last night to meet with Buhari.\n\nA source in the ruling party said the visit was informed by \u201cthe urgent need to brief the president on events since the new Acting Chairman took over as well as bring him up to speed with the preparations for the March 17 NEC meeting and the March 26 National Convention.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe team is also in London to check up on the President as he takes his deserved rest,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe source added that the governors\u2019 visit will put a final seal on all of APC\u2019s plans for the National Convention, especially its NEC meeting believed to be a major determinant of what would happen at the March 26 convention.\n\nBuni to Return This Week as Party Denies Sacking Akpanudoedehe\n\nIn a related development, Buni is expected back in the country on Monday to assume the leadership of the party.\n\nOne of Buni\u2019s aides informed THISDAY yesterday that as soon as the Yobe State governor returns to the country, he would take charge of the affairs of the party.\n\n\n\nThe aide, who pleaded anonymity, also stated that the acting Caretaker Chairman and Governor of Niger State, Bello is expected to vacate the seat for Buni to avoid dragging the party into any illegality.\n\nHe said: \u201cHe (Buni) is expected back on Monday and of course, with the position of INEC which made his position very clear and if you have read the dailies today, even the secretariat has backtracked and confirmed that he\u2019s still in charge.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs soon as he\u2019s back, obviously, the next thing is to take charge. I am sure the party or the acting chairman now will not want to drag the party into any unconstitutionality or any illegality.\u201d\n\nAlso, Buni\u2019s Director-General for Media and Publicity, Mr Mamman Mohmamed said the acting chairman had stated in unambiguous terms that he was in an acting capacity.\n\n\n\nHe stressed that whenever the substantive chairman comes back, the acting chairman would have to give way.\n\nMohammed said: \u201cThis is what we expect and this position is very clear by the regulatory body of political parties, which is the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). INEC as an institution has said that as far as it is concerned, Governor Buni remains the chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure nobody will want to act in another illegality. So, he is coming back and I am sure the acting chairman will vacate his seat for the substantive chairman.\u201d\n\n\n\nAsked if Buni will go ahead with the NEC meeting slated for Thursday, Mohammed said it would be part of the issues that would be considered when Buni is back.\n\nThe ruling party has also clarified that Akpanudoedehe did not resign his position, and was not sacked by the party.\n\n\n\nThere was confusion at the national secretariat of the party last Tuesday over the fate of Akpanudoedehe.\n\nWhile there were reports that Akpanudoedehe had tendered his resignation having read the handwriting from the new leadership, he had insisted that he was still the secretary except the President said otherwise.\n\nHowever, the APC Director of Publicity, Mr. Salisu Dambatta in a statement issued yesterday said the National Secretary never sent any resignation letter.\n\n\n\nDambatta stated: \u201cFurther to the media conference earlier held by the Spokesman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Mr. Ismaeel Ahmed, the party wishes to note that the Secretary of the CECPC, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, never sent a resignation letter to the party to the best of its knowledge and neither was he sacked as some social media blogs speculated. All those are utterly false.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe APC is one family, the Caretaker is one unit. We have an Acting Chairman who is racing against time to deliver a convention and committee members that are united in supporting him in carrying out that onerous mandate,\u201d Dambatta explained.\n\n\n\nHe called on the public to disregard social media stories that are not rooted in fact or even sound reasoning.\n\nTHISDAY checks however revealed that the twist in APC\u2019s narration may not be unconnected with the firm stand of the INEC not to recognise the Niger State Governor, Bello as the acting Caretaker Chairman.\n\n\n\nBello, who assumed the leadership of the party last Monday had written the electoral body notifying the commission of the party\u2019s decision to convene for an emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting.\n\nThe ruling party had scheduled its NEC meeting for Thursday, March 17, 2022, where it is believed that the leadership quagmire would be resolved.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered that Bello, upon resumption as acting Caretaker Chairman transmitted a letter dated March 8, 2022, informing INEC of the change of guard at the party\u2019s national secretariat.\n\n\n\nHowever, INEC in a letter signed by the Secretary to the commission, Mrs Rose Oriaran-Anthony and dated March 9, 2022, said the party must give it 21 days\u2019 notice and that the letter was not signed by the party\u2019s Chairman and Secretary.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered that INEC\u2019s response forced the party\u2019s stakeholders to bring Buni back to ensure that the emergency NEC meeting and the national convention of the party are held as scheduled.\n\nIn a related development, the governors elected on the platform of the ruling party are said to be waiting for the outcome of the meeting between Buhari and some stakeholders as part of the ongoing efforts to resolve the leadership crisis in the party.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered that the Attorney General of the Federation and the Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami was in London, while Buni also flew to London from Dubai to be part of the meeting.\n\n\n\nA source, who pleaded anonymity said: \u201cMalami is in London. His mission is two-fold: one, to let Buhari know of the outcome of the Senate rejection of the amendment of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act; two, to report on issues going on in the party. Buni was also in London but is expected back today or tomorrow\u201d\n\nInvestigations showed that the NEC meeting of APC will go on as INEC has no power over the internal control of the parties.\n\n\n\nAnother party source told THISDAY that the Secretary, Senator Akpanudoedehe and the acting Caretaker Chairman and the Governor of Niger State, Bello met with one of the founding fathers of the party on Friday in Abuja.\n\nAt the meeting, it was gathered that the party chieftain urged Akpanudoedehe to sign the notice of the NEC meeting.\n\n\n\nThe source said some APC governors are also talking to the secretary to see the need to sign the notice and save the party from destruction.\n\nThe source noted that all efforts are to ensure that the convention date of the party is not postponed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThere is anxiety among members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the national caucus of the main opposition party and the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) meet on Monday (tomorrow) and Tuesday to take a decision on the presidential ticket of the party, THISDAY has learnt.\n\n\n\nIn a memo to its national caucus, the main opposition party has directed members of the caucus to consider whether geopolitical zoning is in the interest of the PDP in winning the presidential election in 2023.\n\n\n\nThe party also urged its national caucus to determine the implications of throwing the presidential ticket open.\n\nWith the election of its National Chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu from the North, it was expected that the party\u2019s presidential candidate would emerge from the South.\n\n\n\nBut the main opposition party has been playing hide-and-seek games with the issue of where its presidential candidate would come from, raising concerns that it might throw the ticket open, against the popular agitation for power to shift to the South.\n\n\n\nUnlike the PDP, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has set the necessary machinery in motion to choose its presidential candidate from the South.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the two organs of the PDP will decide whether to zone or throw open the presidential ticket of the party for the 2023 general election.\n\n\n\nPDP NEC will also decide on the recommendation of the 2019 Elections Review Committee set up by the party to assess its performance in the last general election.\n\n\n\nThe committee headed by the Governor of Bauchi State, Senator Bala Mohammed had in its recommendation submitted to the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party on May 21, 2021, urged the party to allow interested party members to vie for the 2023 presidency, irrespective of their geopolitical zones.\n\n\n\nThe committee had anchored its position on the fact that across the land, Nigeria boasts of good hands capable of bailing the country \u201cout of her current quagmire.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe report of the committee had stated that: \u201cIn line with certain unwritten conventions of the nation\u2019s history, many people think that, for fairness and equity, the North-east and South-east geo-political zones that have had the shortest stints at the Presidency, should be given special consideration, in choosing the presidential flagbearer of the party, for the 2023 elections.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile we admit that this is a strong argument, we should not lose sight of the fact that Nigeria is endowed with many capable and very experienced leaders in every part of the country. Moreover, the exigencies of the moment demand that nothing should be compromised in choosing the leader, with the attributes to disentangle the country from the present quagmire.\n\n\n\n\u201cTherefore, we think that every Nigerian, from every part of the country, should be allowed to choose the best candidate, through a credible primary election; as a way of institutionalising a merit-based leadership recruitment process, for the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nReceiving the report, the former leader of the party under Prince Uche Secondus had pledged that the NEC would set up a technical committee to review the report, but it never did.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the report of the Bauchi State governor\u2019s committee would form the main agenda of the national caucus meeting and NEC meetings of the PDP.\n\n\n\nA source within the party\u2019s NWC told THISDAY at the weekend that: \u201cThese two organs of the party will look at the report of Governor Bala Mohammed\u2019s committee and in their wisdom decide to either throw the presidential ticket open or zone it to one of the six geo-political zones of the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the memo to the national caucus, there are variables we want them to consider. One is whether geopolitical zoning is in the interest of the PDP in winning the presidential election come 2023 and two, what will it cost the PDP if it throws the presidential ticket open.\n\n\n\n\u201cThree, as a party in opposition whether zoning in the PDP is in the overall interest of the party,\u201d the source explained.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY gathered that after the National Caucus and NEC meetings, the party\u2019s NWC will still take the issue to the Board of Trustees (BoT) and the PDP governors as well as the National Assembly caucus before a final decision would be reached.\n\nAppointment of Mobilisation Director Divides PDP Govs\n\nMeanwhile, the governors of the PDP are already divided over the appointment of a substantive director of mobilisation and organisation for the party.\n\nThe Department of Mobilisation and Organisation of the party is the engine room of the PDP in terms of the election of all delegates, both ad-hoc and statutory delegates, as well as election management.\n\n\n\nThe department is under the control and supervision of the National Organising Secretary, Umar Bature, who is a nominee of the Sokoto State Governor, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal, who is a presidential aspirant.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY gathered that a governor from one of the South-south states is the arrowhead of those who want the substantive director replaced with a new director from either Delta State or Imo or Kogi State, so as not to give any presidential aspirant undue advantage.\n\n\n\nHowever, it was learnt that some other governors of the party and the incumbent National Organising Secretary, Umar have rejected the names of those recommended for appointment for the position of new Director of Mobilisation and Organisation.\n\n\n\nThe National Organising Secretary who is a member of the National Working Committee has argued that he was not aware of the said appointment until the nominees were invited for interview.\n\n\n\nAn internal memo sighted by THISDAY, which was signed by the National Secretary of the PDP, Senator Samuel Anyanwu, listed those invited for the interview to include: Stephen Onuh from Kogi State; Dr Okey Mbionwu from Imo State and Mr Chukwuma Chinoye from Delta State.\n\n\n\nHowever, the National Organising Secretary is insisting as the head of organisation in the party that there is no need for a change of baton in the mobilisation because the primary elections are already very close.\n\nFollowing the disagreement, the PDP has suspended the planned appointment of a substantive director of mobilisation and organisation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\n*Nigeria ramps up output to 1.51m bpd\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nDespite the decision of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, OPEC+, to raise crude oil production by 340,000 barrels per day last month, the gap between the group\u2019s actual output and target still widened to 890,000 bpd, according to the cartel\u2019s report.\n\n\n\nIt was also a month that saw Nigeria raise output to 1.51 million bpd, a marked improvement from the previous few months when the country struggled to produce between 1.2 million bpd and 1.4 bpd.\n\n\n\nNigeria has been constrained in meeting its OPEC allocation for months, and as of January had as much as 300,000 barrels per day deficit, mainly due to ageing upstream infrastructure and sabotage as well as technical reasons.\n\n\n\nDespite the over 1.7 million barrels per day output allowed by OPEC+, the country had managed to increase production to about 1.4 million, the highest in recent times, going by the latest OPEC review.\n\nAlthough there are issues surrounding the sustainability of the current upward trend of the country\u2019s supply to the global market, it is seen as a good sign for the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\n\n\nThe latest report showed that production from OPEC+ participants was 38.25 million bpd in February, up from 37.91 million bpd in January, but below the target of 39.14 million, according to an Argus survey, which shares insights and analyses about energy and commodity markets worldwide.\n\n\n\nBut oil prices rose at the weekend, although they experienced their biggest weekly declines since November on fears of escalating bans on Russian oil as against efforts to bring more supply to the market from other major producers.\n\n\n\nIn a week of volatile trading marked by talk of Russian oil embargoes then potential supply additions from Iran, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates while fighting escalated in Ukraine, Brent, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark fell 5.2 per cent after hitting a 14-year high of $139.13 on Monday.\n\n\n\nIn the same vein, US crude was dropped 6.6 per cent after touching a high of $130.50 at the start of the trading week.\n\nA day earlier, crude oil prices fell significantly, tumbling from a 2008 high of $130, about the largest single-day percentage decline since April 2020.\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s benchmark oil dropped 13 per cent to $111 a barrel, while the WTI crude oil which topped $130 at the height of trading earlier in the week, lost 12 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe latest report indicated that notably, the quota-exempt OPEC members, Iran and Libya raised output by a combined 170,000 bpd in February, with the north African country accounting for 130,000 bpd of this after an early-January restart of four crude and condensate fields.\n\n\n\nBut 14 of the wider group\u2019s 19 members, including Nigeria, produced below quota in the month, as dwindling spare capacity, underinvestment and infrastructure restraints have constrained output increases.\n\n\n\nThe OPEC+ group\u2019s stance on rising prices is that they are down to geopolitics and not market fundamentals, with the organisation\u2019s Secretary-General, Mr Sanusi Barkindo, saying during the week that \u201cwe have no control over current events.\u201d\n\n\n\nBarkindo stated that despite the surging crude oil prices, there\u2019s no shortage of the commodity in the market, although he admitted that not all member countries are currently able to fulfil their obligations because of capacity constraints.\n\n\n\nOPEC+ ministers will meet on March 31, to decide a production strategy for May, when five countries \u2014 Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait and the UAE \u2014 will see upwards revisions to the baseline levels that determine their quotas and compliance.\n\n\n\nThis would see the combined monthly output quota increase move to 432,000 bpd from 400,000 bpd, which could go some way to satisfying calls for the group to raise the pace of production increases.\n\n\n\nMinister of State Petroleum, Mr Timipre Sylva, last week said that the absence of long-term investment in the oil and gas sector, as well as insecurity, should be blamed on Nigeria\u2019s current low crude oil production.\n\n\n\nSylva stated that this development was responsible for the inability of Nigeria to meet the OPEC quota in recent times in addition to the speed with which International Oil Companies (IOCs) and other investors were withdrawing investments in hydrocarbon exploitation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Under these conditions, it was easy for prejudice and fear to thrive.\n\n\u201cNation-building is about building a common sense of purpose, sense of shared destiny and collective imagination of belonging.\n\n\n\n\u201cNation-building is about building the tangible and intangible threads that hold a political entity together and give it a sense of purpose,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor said that the nation\u2019s founding fathers tried to deal with the challenge by adopting federalism and advocating a policy of unity-in-diversity.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the lack of consolidation of Nigerian federalism around commonly shared values and positions continues to undermine our efforts at nation-building.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis could be seen in the division between \u2018indigenes\u2019 and \u2018settlers\u2019, which has been a source of domestic tension and undermined our efforts at creating a common nationhood,\u201d Ganduje said.\n\nHe urged Nigerians not to see themselves as victims of their history, but be more responsible to overcome the challenges posed by their history.\n\n\n\nGanduje said leadership was a critical factor in nation-building, adding that it has to do with personal qualities of integrity, honesty, commitment and competence of individual leaders.\n\n\n\n\u201cLeadership is a critical factor in nation-building that has to do with personal qualities of integrity, honesty, commitment, and competence of individual leaders at the top.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd the collective qualities of common vision, focus and desire for the development of the elites as a whole,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\n\nHe said that was the reason why the nation must have a leadership that is committed to the rule of law, has a demonstrable sense of fair play and democratic tolerance.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnother important aspect of nation-building is the building of common citizenship.\n\n\u201cA common nationhood cannot be achieved while citizens are living such parallel lives.\n\nNations are built by healthy and skilled citizens.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn grounds of both equity and efficiency, we need to promote the access of the bulk of the Nigerian population to basic education, health, and housing,\u201d Ganduje said.\n\n\n\nThe governor added that Nigeria needs a social contract with its citizens as a basis for demanding loyalty and support.\n\n\n\n\u201cNigeria needs a social contract with its citizens as a basis for demanding their loyalty and support.\n\n\u201cLeaders must raise governance standards by cultivating the culture of good governance,\u201d he said.\n\nThe event was attended by the university Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Kayode Adebowale, Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado-Bayero, Sen.

          "text": "\n\n*Say bill conflicts with regulatory powers of existing agencies\n\nEmma Okonji\n\nLegal experts in Nigeria who attended the two days stakeholders\u2019 forum on National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) Bill 2021 in Lagos, which ended at the weekend, have picked holes in the new propositions contained in the proposed bill, which is a Repeal and Re-Enactment Bill 2021.\n\n\n\nThe legal practitioners described the bill as infiltrating and an attempt to unnecessarily duplicate the regulatory powers of some existing government agencies in the country.\n\n\n\nThey made their positions known during a webinar session on \u2018Stakeholders\u2019 Engagement for Legal Practitioners in Nigeria on National Information Technology Development Agency Bill, 2021.\n\n\n\nThis followed an earlier stakeholders\u2019 engagement meeting held by NITDA in Abuja to consider the proposed NITDA Bill 2021 which, among other things, was aimed at changing NITDA from an IT Development Agency, to a regulator of the information technology industry ecosystem.\n\n\n\nThe webinar, which was put together by the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Committee of the Nigeria Bar Association Section on Business Law (NBA-SBL), in collaboration with the NITDA and Farisad Investment Limited (FIL), was attended by stakeholders within the legal ecosystem, who reviewed the new provisions in the proposed Bill.\n\n\n\nDuring the webinar anchored by the Chief Executive Officer of FIL, Sanusi Musa, the NBA President, Mr Olumide Akpata, after his brief remarks, raised three fundamental concerns on the proposed bill, which, he said, should be looked into by stakeholders at the webinar. Akpata was represented by the ICT Committee Chairman for NBA-SBL, Mr Rotimi Ogunyemi.\n\n\n\nThe tripartite concerns raised by Akpata, were around how the bill will align with the Startup Bill before the National Assembly; how the NITDA Bill intends to navigate its way within the broadband context of other regulatory functions; and what will be the implications of the penalties for violation of certain sections of the bill on the ICT business environment.\n\n\n\nOther legal experts spoke on other areas of conflict of the proposed NITDA Bill with existing legations of some other organisations, including the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), Computer Professional Registration Council of Nigeria (CPN), Federal Completion and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unity (NFIU), Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), among others.\n\n\n\nEach of the Acts establishing all these existing agencies was looked into vis-\u00e0-vis the new provisions in the NITDA Bill and it was unanimously agreed by the legal stakeholders that there were regulatory conflicts that may be detrimental to the peaceful regulatory atmosphere being experienced in the nation\u2019s digital economy space.\n\n\n\nAside from some of the provisions overlapping on the regulatory functions of other agencies, the legal experts observed that a number of the provisions in the bill are ambiguous, unclear and capable of exerting substantial regulatory conflict in the system.\n\n\n\nThe legal practitioners called on those that drafted the NITDA Bill 2021 to go back and review it and ensure that they address all the areas of regulatory conflict with existing regulatory powers and functions of other agencies. Some of the stakeholders also called for an outright expunging of the conflicting sections from the bill, stating, however, that if NITDA wishes to collaborate with other agencies in some critical areas of regulations, it is better to simply \u201cresort to signing Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with other concerned agencies instead of interloping into their regulatory roles.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe stakeholders further stated that NITDA was supposed to be an ICT policy development and implementation agency and should not unnecessarily arrogate regulatory powers to itself, which are already being exercised by other agencies.\n\n\n\nJustifying the need for the review of the NITDA Act, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ibrahim Pantami, who was represented by his Technical Adviser, Prof. Saliu Junaidu, said the NITDA Act 2007 is one of the laws that require a repeal and re-enactment to keep it in tune with the developmental regulation direction of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS), 2020-2030.\n\n\n\nAlso justifying the need for the bill, Director-General of NITDA, Kashifu Abdullahi, said the scope of ICT has widened over the years with a lot of convergence and expansion in technology platforms being used by businesses and governments for delivery services. \u201cConsidering that NITDA Act is almost 16 years old, we consider it necessary to keep the Act up-to-date with the current reality in the Nigerian digital economy space,\u201d Abdullahi said.\n\n\n\nWhile providing information on the new provisions in the proposed NITDA Act 2021, Director, Legal Service Department at NITDA, Emmanuel Edet, said: \u201cWe know that some of the areas we would like to be regulating fall into the existing regulatory functions of some agencies, which informed why NITDA\u2019s emphasis would be on collaboration.\u201d\n\n\n\nResponding to a question raised on over-regulating the ICT ecosystem, Edet said: \u201cIt is better to over-regulate than to under-regulate. NITDA\u2019s vision is to evolve into a development/regulatory agency.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said while the major challenge identified so far by stakeholders has been the issue of regulatory overlap, NITDA would take a look at this and also put all the observations, comments and inputs by stakeholders into consideration, for further work on the proposed bill.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "On Friday, 3 Nigerian federal government agencies\u2014Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), National Information and Technology Development Agency (NITDA), and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Related Offences Commission (ICPC)\u2014collaborated with the Nigerian police force to raid some illegal financial institutions operating from their Opebi Road offices in Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Punch, digital lending platforms like GoCash, Okash, EasyCredit, Easi Moni, KashKash, and Speedy Choice were among the busted companies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe FCCPC, which led the joint operation, said the raid was a response to several customers\u2019 complaints about the malpractices carried out by financial institutions.\n\nSpeaking at the raid, the CEO at FCCPC, Babatunde Irukera, said the agency started investigating and monitoring these companies in 2020 when consumers started accusing them of mishandling and violating their private data in the process of loan recovery.\n\n\u201cThis information started quite a while ago. When the country was on lockdown in 2020 due to the pandemic, we started seeing the rise of money lenders,\u201d Irukera said. \u201cBecause of the lockdown, people needed small and instant loans to sustain, which is understandable. But, over a period of time, people started to complain about the malpractice of the lenders so we started tracking it.\u201d\n\nIrukera also mentioned that, towards the end of last year, the agency had gathered a lot of information and started working with some other key agencies to monitor these businesses.\n\nAccording to Irukera, their findings so far are: the interest rate charged by these digital lenders appears to violate the ethics of how lending is done; secondly, the unethical loan recovery practice of violating customers\u2019 privacy to abuse and shame them and their acquaintances.\n\n\u201cSo, we started an investigation trying to determine the location of these firms, which has been very difficult. These companies move around a lot, and it took us several months visiting each of their locations,\u201d he said.\n\nThe FCCPC boss, however, said investigations also revealed that the loan firms weren\u2019t Nigerian nor registered in the country, they don\u2019t have an address nor do they have a licence to do business in Nigeria. He also said that most of these companies operated from the same place and by the same person.\n\nWith no address, all these companies have are mobile apps that can be downloaded on both Google and Apple Stores. So the agency had to engage the people who have been their victims and gather more evidence.\n\nBy now, all the agencies involved had gotten enough information and evidence to convince the court to issue a warrant for them to proceed with an investigation into a search and seizure.\n\n\u201cAnd sometime last month, a court issued a warrant and between then and now, we were preparing a sting operation, which is what you are seeing here today. The reason for this is because we wanted to be sure we were hitting at the place where we could get many of them,\u201d said the FCCPC boss.\n\nHe also mentioned that the agency had issued an order to Apple and Google to take down these companies\u2019 apps from their platforms. It has also ordered the banks to freeze these companies\u2019 bank accounts.\n\nLast year, when NITDA sanctioned Sokoloan, TechCabal reported that that would be the first of many. Though it took longer than expected, it\u2019s finally happening.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t also mean that the people we are proceeding against today are the only ones\u2014no. We want to start with them. We also understand that there are between 5 and 7 companies operating at the same location,\u201d said Irukera, hinting at the agency\u2019s ambition to cleanse the nation of all illegal digital lending practices.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "\u201cHoly f*ck.\u201d\n\nThat was what Beeple tweeted when \u201cEverydays: The First 5,000 Days\u201d, his non-fungible Token (NFT) art and the first purely digital work of art ever offered by a major auction house, was bought for $69 million at Christie\u2019s in March last year. This event didn\u2019t only make Beeple the third richest artist in the world, it ushered in the beginning of a new era for the art world.\n\nWhile Beeple\u2019s was the most expensive JPEG NFT format, profile-pic NFT (PPF)\u2014NFTs that depict a portrait that can be used as a social media avatar\u2014also hit some record-breaking milestones. For example, Crypto Punk NFTs that were given out for free in 2017 at launch started trading for prices between $480,000 and $1.25 million in January 2021 and, by the end of the year, they wouldn\u2019t go for anything less than $4 million.\n\nThough NFT has been around since 2014, 2021 was the pivotal year for this \u201cnovelty and strange\u201d technology. It was the year it broke into the mainstream, disrupting the art world and waltzing its way into the hearts of almost every aspect of pop culture, from music to film to sports and literature.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile all of this was happening, a crop of young and curious African minds have also started to develop an appetite and build an NFT ecosystem on the continent. Although it felt\u2014still feels\u2014like a myth to the broader population, more people had started buying into it. Jacon Osinachi was well on his way to becoming the foremost NFT artist on the continent and, arguably, the world. Anthony Azekwoh would soon create and sell his first NFT \u201cThe Red Man\u201d, one of the most popular NFT pieces out of Africa. Zimbabwean Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d, a digital art of late African-American entertainment and sports stars\u2014DMX, Kobe Bryant, Aaliyah, Chadwick Boseman, Tupac Shakur, and Nipsey Hussle\u2014would soon be picked up and displayed on a billboard in New York\u2019s Times Square.\n\nSomewhere in Abuja, Nigeria, is Peace Ojemeh 24, a Nigerian product designer and an Open Source advocate, who, like everybody else, is trying to understand the \u201cinsanity\u201d around this technology, the reason anybody would spend millions of dollars on something intangible\u2014something they might never touch physically.\n\nWhile Ojemeh was still making sense of this, the original copy of \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d, a viral photo meme of a girl smirking as a fire roared behind her, sold for $500,000 (180 ETH at the time).\n\n\u201cReading about Disaster girl, a meme I casually use in my WhatsApp chats with friends, selling for such a ridiculous amount of dollars, was an awakening. I just knew I had to get in on NFTs,\u201d Ojemeh told TechCabal.\n\nBut judging from Ojemeh\u2019s journey, this could have been all talk. That wasn\u2019t the first time Ojemeh would get excited about crypto and its related ventures. In 2017 and 2018, she had planned to buy her first ethereum (ETH) but ended up not going through with it.\n\nWhen she finally did something in the space, it was a disaster. She bought edcoin, a crypto token from a Nigerian blockchain company Edmark. She even convinced her mother and uncle to invest in it but a few months after, while ETH ballooned into over $1,000, Edcoin started dropping in value.\n\nBy 2020, it was obvious edcoin wasn\u2019t going anywhere so she began to think of how to flip this seemingly bad investment into a lucrative one. She withdrew her investment from edcoin into ETH and then into e-gold and some other coins that yielded positives. This experience exposed her to the slippery world of crypto and the learnings from it shaped how she approaches crypto today.\n\nFounding Haze Monkey Society\n\nSo instead of going right into NFTs after the \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d news, Ojemeh decided to learn about the industry, and invested in some NFTs to have access to their communities to understand how they function and are being managed. By the time she gathered enough knowledge, she reached out to her friend Alabo Briggs, 22, a blockchain engineer, about building their own NFT collection. Briggs was on board with the idea and advised that they mint a few NFTs before launching a collection. But Ojemeh\u2019s ambition was bigger than that; she wanted to build a strong NFTs community like Crypto Punk and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) had built, and she wanted to hit the ground running.\n\nSo she convinced Briggs and in August, while Pablo Stanley, one of the world\u2019s most popular and respected product designers and doodlers, was launching Robotos, a 10,000-robot NFT collection, and selling out, Ojemeh and Briggs were building their collection of stoned monkeys they would call Haze Monkey Society.\n\nHaze Monkey Society was launched as a collection of 4,200 NFTs focused on building a no-code platform aimed at empowering NFT creators and artists and making an environmental impact in Africa.\n\n\u201cBecause we didn\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel, we needed to associate ourselves with a successful project while not being a complete replica. So with the success of BAYC, we chose to identify as monkeys,\u201d said Ojemeh. \u201cHaze indicates the weed-smoking culture among creatives. It\u2019s also an inspiration behind our unique number: 420.\u201d\n\nHaze Monkey has unique and rich storytelling built into each of its NFTs.\n\nA thoughtful roadmap\n\nOne of the things that determines the success of an NFT project is its community. And what makes a community thrive is the utilities, the benefits, that come from holding such NFT. Ojemeh and Briggs know this, and that\u2019s why they spent a lot of time deliberating on their roadmap.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to just sell NFTs, we are keen on finding a way to provide value to Haze Monkey\u2019s holders,\u201d said Ojemeh, who also consults for the United Nations, the International Telecommunication Union, and the African Union on a project that exposes technology as a career path to girls across African countries.\n\nBesides access to an exclusive social community, there are 3 major benefits on Haze Monkey\u2019s roadmap. One of them is the no-code platform which Ojemeh said was born out of creating an environment where people don\u2019t need deep tech knowledge to harness the blockchain technology.\n\nThe next one is the animation series about Haze Monkey\u2019s unique stories where holders and community members will be characters. Lastly, the duo, having been born and bred in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, where petroleum exploration in the area continues to pollute their water and atmosphere, decided to include something personal to them: they want to plant 100 trees somewhere in Africa for every single NFT minted.\n\nA learning curve that led to a new direction\n\nAbout 10 days before Haze Monkey NFTs would start its public minting in February, the team launched a countdown campaign and daily Twitter space discussion, where the community would come together, ask questions, calculate the societal impact of the project and, most importantly, the fortune it promises.\n\nThe minting calendar had been set; the public minting price was set at 0.08 ETH at a maximum of 4 NFTs per address and the presale price for those who had been whitelisted after performing some tasks or winning giveaways was pegged at 0.06 ETH at a maximum of 2 NFTs.\n\nIn one of those Twitter Spaces, a community member with a monkey avatar and a Mexican accent asked what would happen if the collection did not sell out within the opening week. For a few seconds, there was silence and one could tell he\u2019d ask an unexpected question. It was obvious the team hadn\u2019t considered this.\n\n\u201cWell, the plan is to sell out, but in a situation where we don\u2019t the community will decide what to do,\u201d answered Ashlei, one of the US-based community managers who was moderating the space.\n\nBefore the countdown campaign started, Haze Monkey had gathered over 5,000 organic social followers and over 6,000 Discord community members from across the globe. The project had also been listed and verified on 7 of the largest NFT platforms\u2014NFT Calendar, NFT Drop, NFT Evening, Coin Market Cap, Rarity, Next Drop, NFT Genie, and Rarity Sniper.\n\nWith this increasing traction at zero marketing budget, the possibility of not selling out was out of the question. But Haze Monkey did about 20%. Among other factors, this could be attributed to the recent scare of stolen NFTs issues on OpenSea, the biggest NFT marketplace in the world.\n\nHowever, the slow movement couldn\u2019t deter the team as they\u2019ve quickly started looking for new strategies. They are currently iterating their roadmap to suite the new reality and as a result, the community decided to reduce the amount of of Haze Monkey in circulation.\n\n\u201cAs a request from the community, our genesis collection was cut down to 1,242 with a vision of releasing the rest over time,\u201d Ojemeh told TechCabal.\n\nShe also mentioned that the community had initially agreed to cap volume at 1, 000, but because of how significant 420 is to the project and its weed-cultured monkeys, the number 1,242 was chosen.\n\nHaze Monkey is now a collection of 1,242 NFTs.\n\nThough built by Africans in Africa, Haze Monkey has already positioned itself as a global brand. In its Discord group, the project has about 5 different channels for people who can\u2019t speak English.

          "text": "Over the past month, at least 2 of Nigeria\u2019s largest commercial banks have announced reduced limits on international transactions using naira debit cards to $20 (around \u20a610,000) per month.\n\nThis comes as a longstanding scarcity of foreign exchange continues to bite Africa\u2019s largest economy and biggest oil exporter, despite the recent surge in global energy prices.\n\nNigerians can use their naira-denominated debit cards to pay for transactions billed in US dollars online. For every purchase, debits are made directly from their naira accounts at current exchange rates.\n\nBefore now, customers could spend up to $100 (\u20a650,000) on web transactions using their naira cards but that limit has been cut by Zenith Bank PLC and United Bank for Africa (UBA), per emails sent to customers and seen by TechCabal\n\n\u201cThe monthly card international spend limit for web transactions has been reviewed from $100 to $20,\u201d Zenith said, adding that the review is \u201cin response to today\u2019s economic realities.\u201d\n\nThat statement came about two weeks after UBA told its customers the same in February, with the reviewed naira card limits for international transactions taking effect March 1.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe banks have also suspended the use of naira cards for international Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cash withdrawals and POS transactions, meaning cardholders cannot perform cash withdrawals and payments via those channels outside the country.\n\n\u201cIf you have higher International spend requirements, simply visit any of our branches and request for a foreign currency debit or prepaid card, which are available in US Dollar, Pounds, and Euro variants,\u201d Zenith Bank added.\n\n\u201cRemember you can use your UBA Dollar, Pounds or Euro Card for international POS, ATM, and web transactions,\u201d UBA\u2019s mail read. \u201cIf you do not have one and would like to subscribe, please visit a branch close to you.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, Nigerians have reacted with displeasure on social media against the new limits as they restrict their ability to pay for international transactions like Netflix subscriptions, ads on Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms.\n\n$20/month spending limit on @UBAGroup cards???

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nRecently, my mental health has taken some heavy hits, and this week has been extremely stressful for me. Enough about me, though. What comes to mind when you hear the term \u201cmental health\u201d? A mad person?\n\nSide bar: It\u2019s encouraging to see how people are coming forward to test for mental illnesses and accept treatment. While this is still a long way off in Africa, it\u2019s certain we\u2019re getting there. So, thanks to the Internet for bringing it to light!\n\nBack to the matter. Is mental health only related to mental illnesses? Is it limited to schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, anxiety, eating disorder, depression, insomnia, alcohol and substance abuse, and other similar conditions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s your answer: Mental health encompasses more than just mental illnesses. It is related to how a person feels, thinks, and acts.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) describes it as a state of well-being in which an individual recognises his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and can contribute to his or her community.\n\nThis means that someone may have good mental health, no mental illness or be somewhere in between. This refers to the mental health spectrum.\n\nFor instance, Ayo, a 27-year-old graduate, may not exhibit any signs of mental illness but is unemployed, with a negative attitude toward himself and his relationships, or may not have a strong sense of purpose. Can you say Ayo is mentally healthy? Of course not!\n\nHaving good mental health and no mental illness is at the top of the spectrum, while having poor mental health and a mental illness is at the bottom. While the people who are somewhere in the middle may have good mental health but a mental illness, they may also have poor mental health but no mental illness.\n\nConsequently, we must all strive to be at the top of the mental health spectrum which begins with prioritising your mental health as much as you do your physical and sexual health.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nThe Nigeria Data Protection Bureau\n\nAntler East Africa\u2019s oversubscribed fund\n\nThe Nigeria Data Protection Bureau\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know that the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (CFRN) 1999 guarantees Nigerian citizens the fundamental right to privacy?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis means that under Section 37 of the CFRN, citizens have the right to privacy in their homes, correspondence, phone conversations, and telegraphic communications.\n\nThe Constitution, however, does not define \u201cprivacy\u201d or contain detailed privacy provisions. So, it is unclear how far Nigerian codified law protects data privacy.\n\nBut, personal data is becoming increasingly valuable, and it is constantly sought after by nefarious individuals who intend to exploit it to the detriment of the data subjects.\n\nThe current state of our laws demonstrates the need for Nigeria to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for data protection, don\u2019t you think?\n\nThis, among other reasons, could be why the Nigerian government announced that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved the establishment of a new agency, the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (NDPB), to focus on data protection and privacy in the country.\n\nOgheneruemu, a non-practising lawyer and Techpoint Africa Reporter, provided us with additional information about this new data protection enforcing body. What effect will this new agency have on your privacy rights?\n\nCheck it out here: Nigeria has a new data protection enforcing body; here\u2019s why you should care\n\nAntler East Africa\u2019s oversubscribed fund\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntler East Africa, a venture capital firm based in Nairobi, has closed a $13.5 million fund to invest in early-stage tech startups in an oversubscribed round.\n\nInitially, the VC intended to raise $10 million but ended up with $13.5 million. Do the math: they received an additional $3.5 million.\n\nThe round\u2019s limited partners include Baillie Gifford, Canica, and other institutional investors like the International Finance Corporation.\n\nAntler East Africa launched in August 2019, two years after Antler \u2013 its parent company \u2013 was founded by Magnus Grimeland. Every year, the VC firm employs a full venture building model with two cohorts.\n\nThe company uses a hybrid model acting as both a venture builder and a venture capital firm. From its $300 million fund, the firm has invested in over 250 companies ranging from pre-seed to Series C.\n\nSo far, five cohorts of 153 founders have graduated from the accelerator programs, and the firm has made 14 investments. AIfluence, Marketforce-subsidiary Digiduka, Honeycoin, Uncover Skincare, Try Cooked, and Vybe are some examples.\n\nAntler East Africa\u2019s new fund will allow it to invest in founders who want to build their startups from the ground up and already formed teams that require capital to scale.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nUnderstanding others\u2019 feelings: what is empathy and why do we need it?.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February 2022, the Nigerian government announced that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved a new agency, the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (NDPB)\n\nThe statement was signed by Uwa Suleiman, Media Aide to the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami.\n\nAccording to Suleiman, the NDPB was established in line with global best practices and would focus on data protection and privacy for the country.\n\nAmong other things, the statement credits the introduction of the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) and the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) with creating more awareness about data protection and resulting in the \u201cdatafication\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough we are not sure of the specifics of the agency\u2019s duties, Suleiman says the NDPB will consolidate the gains of the NDPR and support the process for the development of a primary legislation for data protection and privacy.\n\nFor now, we can say with certainty that Vincent Olatunji will head the NDPB as National Commissioner/CEO.\n\nOlatunji served as the Acting DG of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) until October 2016 before handing over to Pantami, nine months after his appointment.\n\nDoes Nigeria have a new Data Protection Authority?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe short answer to this is no.\n\nThe long answer, which requires some explaining, is maybe.\n\nWhen NITDA introduced the NDPR, the agency handed itself some oversight functions, effectively becoming Nigeria\u2019s default Data Protection Authority (DPA).\n\nBut what are DPAs? According to the European Commission, \u201cDPAs are independent public authorities that supervise, through investigative and corrective powers, the application of the data protection law. They provide expert advice on data protection issues and handle complaints lodged against violations of the General Data Protection Regulation and the relevant national laws.\u201d\n\nSo think of a DPA as a bodyguard to ensure your data rights are protected, and companies don\u2019t get away with anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria\u2019s case, this would apply to the NDPR\n\nHowever, unlike Europe and other countries \u2014 including some countries in Africa \u2014 NITDA did not create a separate entity to act as a DPA. A scenario that some have argued goes beyond the powers assigned in the NITDA Act.\n\nEssentially, one could argue that NITDA appointing itself DPA is unlawful or, in legal terms, void.\n\nThe NITDA Act empowers the Agency to \u201cdevelop guidelines for electronic governance and monitor the use of electronic data interchange and other forms of electronic communication transactions as an alternative to paper-based methods in government, commerce, education, the private and public sectors, labour, and other fields, where the use of electronic communication may improve the exchange of data and information.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the NITDA Act does not appear to give the Agency the power to issue the NDPR in itself. But that\u2019s a discussion for another day.\n\nGoing by this new development, though, it appears that four years into the NDPR\u2019s regime, we might be getting a DPA in the true sense of the word. Let\u2019s not get too far ahead of ourselves, though, because there\u2019s still the pesky problem of an establishing law.\n\nIn most countries, DPAs are created through a governing law or regulation. A presidential approval does not a DPA make, but this is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, for which we are cautiously optimistic.\n\nFor now, however, our earlier answers are still valid. Until NITDA or the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy confirms whether the NDPB is a DPA, we can only speculate.\n\nOlumide Babalola, Managing Partner at Olumide Babalola LP, believes that \u201cThe statement is silent on what form the Bureau would take. It reportedly currently shares an office with the National Information Technology Development Agency (\u2018NITDA\u2019).\n\n\u201cHence, as things stand, the Bureau is no more than a department under NITDA as it currently has no separate identity, not even a website where information on its operations can be accessed.\u201d\n\nWhat happens to the Data Protection Bill?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Suleiman\u2019s statement, the NDPB would \u201csupport the process for the development of a primary legislation for data protection and privacy.\u201d\n\nThe race to a dedicated data protection and privacy law has taken several turns. Filled with false starts, the closest Nigeria has come to a law passed by the National Assembly was in 2018 with the Nigeria Data Protection Bill 2018. Although both houses passed it in 2019, President Buhari withheld his assent.\n\nThe most successful attempt remains the NDPR, a guideline at best.\n\nThe Data Protection Bill 2020 (PDF) is currently before the National Assembly, but nothing much has been heard since a stakeholder session held in September 2020.\n\nThe Bill provides a much more robust approach to data protection, providing for more categories of data than the NDPR, which appears to deal more with electronic data. It also creates a Data Protection Commission, which should act as Nigeria\u2019s DPA.\n\nInterestingly, there are rumours that the Bill has been abandoned, and the federal government is seeking a consultant to draft a new one.\n\nWhat this means\n\nBusiness as usual for now.\n\nAlthough the uncertainty surrounding the NDPR and NITDA\u2019s power to appoint itself DPA are still dark areas, it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got for now.\n\nThe introduction of the NDPB raises a little wave of dust over Nigeria\u2019s data protection and privacy crate. It raises questions that cannot be adequately answered until we see appropriate legislation or more guidelines and perhaps a \u201cdedicated website.\u201d\n\nWhat follows should make for interesting times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you miss Apple\u2019s first event of the year? I did, but I saw a recap and the best way to describe my reaction is mind blown \ud83e\udd2f.\n\nThe event had some boring announcements, like the new iPhone colours and the underwhelmingly designed iPhone SE. To be fair, the SE comes with an impressive spec upgrade, but the design is a total replica of the 2020 SE.\n\nMy guess is that Apple wants you to buy their more high-end products rather than their budget (a $430 phone is not a budget phone ) products. So if you cannot afford the flagships, you should be able to buy the SE. Keyword being should.\n\nThe mind-blowing part of the event for me was when the Mac Studio was announced. A machine the size of a bowl of nkwobi, but with beastly specs. It runs on Apple\u2019s new chip \u2014 M1 Ultra \u2014 eight times faster than last year\u2019s M1 Max.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has a 20 core CPU, up to 8 terabytes of solid-state drive (SSD), and 128 gigabytes of unified memory or RAM. While the specs sound incredible, how it handles third-party software will decide its power.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe creation of Ozi with no-code tools\n\nOkHi\u2019s $1.5m raise\n\n$1.5m pre-seed by Yep!\n\nBuilding a startup with no-code tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross section of Ozi team. L-R: Israel Akpan, Co-founder and COO; Azeez Adejumo, Co-founder and CEO; Olukayaode Amusu, CMO. Source: Supplied.\n\nTwo University of Lagos (UNILAG) graduates \u2014 Adejumo Azeez and Israel Akpan \u2014 are building a tech startup without writing one line of code.\n\nHow did it begin? After spending months looking for a developer to build their product, the duo resorted to no-code tools. They found exciting products that didn\u2019t require any coding expertise. But even a startup built with no-code tools still has challenges.\n\nTheir startup, Ozi, can be described as a Communications as a Service product that Azeez and Akpan started in the university. But as their clientele grew in number and quality, privacy concerns they didn\u2019t consider rose, and they lost a considerable amount of clients.\n\nOzi provides chatbots and helps send bulk messages on WhatsApp. Although other platforms like SMS and email can be leveraged, the startup is doubling down on WhatsApp for several reasons. One of them is open rates.\n\nThe startup has recently closed a $10,000 angel round and has increased its user-base from 100 to 10,000\n\nOne thing I find interesting about Ozi is the different iterations and the challenges the founders have gone through in putting a startup together with no-code tools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you have a startup idea and have zero coding skills, you should read Ogheneruemu\u2019s conversation with Azeez and Akpan: How no-code tools helped two UNILAG graduates build omni-channel messaging platform, Ozi\n\nSmart addressing with OkHi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can find your home address easily on Google Maps, you are one of the very few Africans with a verifiable address. Getting packages delivered to your doorsteps would be hassle-free \u2014 for the most part.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re like me and your house doesn\u2019t even have a number, then we\u2019re among the 400 million Africans who do not have verifiable addresses. This makes getting deliveries or even opening bank accounts hard.\n\nInterestingly, OkHi, a smart-addressing startup, wants to solve this problem. The startup was built by Timbo Drayson when he noticed Google Maps doesn\u2019t work perfectly in Africa. In 2014, he launched the address verification startup in Kenya, verifying over 300,000 addresses so far.\n\nOkHi expanded into Nigeria after a $1.5 million seed and a partnership with Interswitch. Yesterday, it also announced another $1.5 million seed extension from investors, including Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga Agboola and Interswitch.\n\nOkHi had a conversation with Chimgozorim, and they discussed how the startup is providing address verification services for businesses, including eCommerce and ride-hailing startups. Please read it here: After verifying over 300,000 addresses in Kenya, OkHi secures $1.5 million to expand across Nigeria\n\nA $1.5m pre-seed by Yep!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoS user\n\nYep! is another neobank out of Africa but with an interesting mission. The fintech startup isn\u2019t just offering financial services to the digitally savvy but to every African without an Internet connection.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Yep!\u2019s Co-founder, Olaoluwa Awojoodu, said, \u201cWe want to bank the guys in Lagos as well as bank the guys in a village at Ikot Ekpene.\u201d\n\nHow? Yep! isn\u2019t Awojoodu\u2019s first rodeo in the finance world. He is the Founder of E-Settlement, a holding company for different financial entities; its agent banking platform, PayCentre Africa, has over 5 million customers.\n\nYep! will leverage this massive customer base to bring the underbanked among them into the \u201cdigital fold.\u201d\n\nExplaining, Awojoodu said, \u201cnot just the guys that are digitally enabled, but even the guys that are off the digital channels, we are going to bring everybody into the digital environment using both digital tools and agent networks.\u201d\n\nYep! has raised a $1.5 million pre-seed in a round led by Greenhouse Capital. While other fintechs, for example, OPay, have a similar model, its competitive advantage lies in how easily it can provide credit facilities for its agents.\n\nThe pre-seed fund will go into doubling its agent network to over 200,000 by the end of 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nWhat Happens When a Child Gets COVID?

          "text": "As the 2023 general elections draw closer, the issue of which zone will produce the next governor of Abia State is threatening the relative peace in the oil-producing state.\n\nTorn apart and at each other\u2019s throats are the Old Bende zone and Aba zone.\n\nThe second term of Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, who is from Aba zone (Ngwa), will expire in May 2023.\n\nBusinessDay gathered that his kinsmen, the Ukwa-Ngwa zone, are rooting for another eight years to correct what they termed the \u201cimbalance\u201d in the administration of the state, which, according to them, saw Old Bende, comprising Abia central and Abia North, occupy the seat of power for 18 years, and Aba zone having it for only eight years.\n\nThe root cause of the current imbroglio is said to be the statement made recently by the immediate past Governor, Theodore Orji, now a senator, that it was the turn of Abia North to produce the next governor.\n\nHe said this was in tandem with the state\u2019s \u2018Charter of Equity\u2019 said to have been signed on August 2, 1981, by political leaders at the time they were lobbying for the creation of the state.\n\nBut his stance has pitched him against the political stakeholders of Ukwa-Ngwa zone who are insisting that the Old Aba Zone should produce Ikpeazu\u2019s successor in 2023.\n\nOrji was said to have invited some key political stakeholders from the 17 Local Government Areas in the state to his Umuahia country home penultimate Sunday where he told them that power had to go back to Abia North in 2023, in keeping with Abia Charter of Equity.\n\nHe was said to have expressed rage at those opposed to the prevailing zoning arrangement in the state, describing any attempt to change the formula as \u201ca dangerous voyage\u201d.\n\nOrji, who facilitated the emergence and eventual victory of Ikpeazu in 2015, was said to have expressed anger over moves by the Ukwa-Ngwa zone to retain power beyond 2023, vowing that such injustice should not be allowed.\n\nHe reportedly told the gathering to return to their various communities with the message that power must return to Abia North in 2023.\n\nThe position of the former governor received applause from political players present at the meeting as echoes of \u2018Father of Equity rented the atmosphere,\u201d according to witnesses.\n\n\u201dAgain Senator Orji has sent a clear signal to all those scheming to truncate Abia Charter of Equity recommended by our founding fathers that they are on their own,\u201d Ifeanyi Umere, one of his loyalists said.\n\nRead also: Abia State: Our collective interest\n\nBut the former governor\u2019s position did not go down well with the Ukwa-Ngwa zone, as they insisted that power should rotate between Umuahia and Aba zones.\n\nAmong those rooting for the return of power to Ukwa-Ngwa are Nkechi Nwogu, a one-time senator and current chairman, Governing Council, University of Calabar; Enyinnaya Abaribe, Senate minority leader, and Max Nduaguibe.\n\nThose in support of power rotation to Abia north include former governors Theodore Orji and Orji Uzor Kalu; Mao Ohuabunwa, a former senator; and Benjamin Kalu, chairman House of Representatives Committee on Media and Publicity, who is said to be nursing a governorship ambition.\n\nIn its response to the senator, the Ukwa-Ngwa Leaders of Thought said, \u201cEighteen years of Umuahia (old Bende) Zone to eight years of Aba Zone cannot be equity.\u201d\n\nThey insisted in a letter signed by Kenneth Nkoro, chairman, and Henry Irondi, secretary, that any other interpretation amounted to attempts to distort the meaning and intentions of the Abia Charter Equity.\n\nThey cited the Abia Charter of Equity, which was quoted as saying that \u201cthe principle behind the Charter of Equity was that power should rotate between Aba and Umuahia (old Bende), the two parties to the agreement which pre-dated the creation of Abia State 10 years later.\u201d\n\nThe group said, \u201cThe record of the civilian governorship of Abia State shows Umuahia (Old Bende) Zone has dominated so much that equation does not balance. Umuahia has produced Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, two years of January 1992-November 1993; Dr Orji Uzor Kalu, eight years of May 1999 to May 2007; Dr Theodore Orji, another eight years of May 2007 to May 2015. It adds up to 18 years. Aba Zone has had only Dr Okezie Ikpeazu, who will complete eight years from May 2015 to May 2023.\n\n\u201cWhat type of equity equates eight years to 18 years? Was equity absent when Umuahia Zone had the governorship for 18 years? Another eight years for Umuahia Zone would be 26 years for Umuahia Zone and eight years for Aba Zone. We do not see any equity in that proposal.\u201d",

We want Edo to be a hub of tourism. Traffic is already building in Edo as over a million people are coming into the state. Our projection is that in three years time, five million will come.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have access to resources that can be brought to help us redefine where we are going,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cYusuf Ali, the Chairman of the Edo Sports Commission has excelled, both locally and internationally. In Edo, we have to catch them young in sports. Almost a million of our young generation are under the age of 12. We must rethink sports and catch them young.\n\n\u201c40 years ago, government regulated, operated and participated in sports, putting all the resources required into sports. Our emphasis today, as a government, is to continue to provide policy direction for sports.\u201d\n\nNoting that there\u2019s a lot of money outside government to finance and sustain sports, the governor said his administration is redesigning the state\u2019s sports policy and creating new laws to regulate sports, and bring capable and competent persons to help manage sports in the state.\n\nHe further noted, \u201cEdo State can start now to prepare for a global market in sports by identifying young talents in schools and catching them young. In five years time, the state can train about 10,000 to 20,000 talents and if 1,000 of these talents become global stars, the state will benefit greatly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am glad you have accepted to serve but I advise you to separate politics from sports if we must succeed in our plans. We should excel in all areas of sports as we continue to invest in sports development.\u201d\n\nChairman of the Edo State Sports Commission, Yusuf Ali pledged that his team will do their best to transform sports in Edo.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Sunday expressed his administration\u2019s readiness to set up a tripartite committee that would review the existing Chiefs Law of the State.\n\nThe Committee, according to the Governor, would involve a representative each from the members of the State Executive Council, Legislature and Traditional Council, with a mandate to painstakingly review, analyse critically and meticulously, the palpable grey areas in the said Law.\n\nThis is even as the Governor reaffirmed his Administration\u2019s commitment to further strengthening the traditional institution to enhance its capacity for effective and efficient service delivery to the people of the State.\n\nReceiving the proposed letter written by members of the State Traditional Council of Obas, aimed at effecting the review of the State Chiefs Law, at Government House, Osogbo, Governor Oyetola expressed delight at the move made by the monarchs to review the Chiefs Law, saying the initiative would go a long way to permanently find a possible and lasting solution to some of the challenges attributed to kingship and chieftaincy in the State.\n\nGovernor Oyetola, who described the gesture as a welcome development, assured that the tripartite Committee would be constituted in the next few days to swing into action.\n\nHe said the Committee when constituted would come up with suggestions and proffer workable solutions to some of the identified challenges in the existing Law, thus helping to ensure possible amendments that would suit the collective interest of the people of the State.\n\n\u201cI commend our traditional rulers on this visit. I thank you for your unflinching support, most importantly your continued show of love before, during and after the last primary election of our party. Your prayers when we visited you at your various palaces before the primary can never be forgotten as this manifested in the success we recorded at the party\u2019s primary election.\n\n\u201cAs to the Chiefs Law of our dear State, we will be very happy if that is reviewed. I am very happy that you are looking into it already. This is a welcome development.\n\n\u201cWe know most of these laws are obsolete and we welcome the idea of the tripartite Committee that you have come up with. It is our hope that this would further strengthen the traditional institution which has been our vision as a government.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in the fact that the existing Law has its own challenges and this has been causing a lot of crisis as to enthronement of monarchs among other chieftaincy-related matters.\n\n\u201cSo, to further demonstrate our commitment to ensuring a vibrant and viable traditional institution, we will set up the committee to look into it. I commend you for your efforts at keeping your domains safe.\n\n\u201cWe understand the little crisis in some towns, but we hope with this move and with the support from Federal Government, it will be a thing of the past. We appreciate your continued support to ensure security and adequate protection of lives and property of your subjects in your respective domains\u201d, Oyetola added.\n\nPresesenting the letter on behalf of the Chairman of Osun Council of Obas, Aragbiji of Iragbiji, Oba Abdul-Rasheed Ayotunde Olabomi, said the call to review the State Chiefs Law was arrived at having painstakingly assessed and evaluated the grey areas of the existing Law.\n\nOba Olabomi who is the leader of the Committee on State Chiefs Law set up by the members of the Traditional Council of Obas, said the review of the Law would help to innovatively reposition the traditional institution in the State.\n\nThe Aragbiji of Iragbiji said the Chairman of the Council and Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, was pleased with the decision of the Committee to get the Law reviewed.\n\nHe commended the Governor for according due respect to traditional rulers in the State, noting that his good gesture and kind-heartedness had endeared him more to the people of the State in general and traditional rulers in particular.\n\n\u201cSequel to the decision reached at the State Council of Obas meeting that the Chiefs Law of the State should be reviewed and necessary amendments made, the Committee set up by the Council recommended as follows:\n\n\u201cThat the review of the Law cannot be done in isolation; that the Council would need the collaboiration of both the Executive and Legislative arms of Government.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the Council decided to seek Your Excellency\u2019s approval for the setting up of a Tripartite Committee that would comprise the following representatives: Executive arm of Government; State House of Assembly and Council of Obas\u2019 Committee on the Review of the Chiefs Law.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to commend and appreciate Your Excellency for the respect and honour with which Your Excellency has been handling the Traditional Institution in the State. God Almighty shall continue to guide you right in all your endeavors.\n\n\u201cIt is the belief of the Council members that Your Excellency would also see reason for the review of the Chiefs Law which is to make the institution more dignifying\u201d, the letter reads in parts.\n\nSome of the traditional rulers in attendance are Owaloko of Iloko-Ijesa, Oba Hakeem Ogungbangbe; Orangun of Oke-Ila, Oba Adedokun Abolarinwa; Alapomu of Apomu, Oba Kayode Adenekan Afolabi; Salu of Edunabon, Oba Adesoji Kehinde Oladepo; and Olusongbe of Songbe, Oba Kamil Ajadi.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Abubakar Malami, Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General and Minister of Justice, has made a u-turn in his latest advice regarding the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, noting that there is no evidence linking the embattled police officer to money laundering.\n\nMalami in a letter dated February 4, 2022, with reference number, DPPA/LA/814/21, sought to exonerate Kyari, saying there was no link between him and Ramon Abbas, alias Hushpuppi, an international fraudster he was accused of receiving money from.\n\nThe AGF\u2019s February letter contradicted his January directive that Kyari should be probed for money laundering and for receiving 33 proceeds of crime.\n\nAccording to the recent letter written on behalf of the AGF by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Ministry of Justice, Mohammed Abubakar, the evidence contained in the case diary \u201cwas not sufficient to indicate or show that the said monies (N279mn) were laundered directly or indirectly by Kyari to disguise their origin.\u201d\n\nThe new position of the attorney-general, according to PUNCH, was contained in a letter titled, \u2018Re: Forwarding of the investigation report of the Nigeria Police Force Special Investigation Team and request for legal advice with regards to allegations of criminal conspiracy, aiding and abetting Internet fraud, wire fraud, identity theft and money laundering against DCP Abba Kyari\u2019.\n\nThe letter addressed to the IG, read in part, \u201cI am directed to inform you that after a careful study of the said response wherein you stated that \u2018the monies have been traced to Zenith Bank account no. 2255416115 belonging to Usman Ibrahim Waziri; Guaranty Trust Bank account no. 0130665392 belonging to Adekoya Sikiru; Zenith Bank account no. 2080537566 belonging to Hussein Ala and other funds went to Sharon Festus. The monies were withdrawn and utilised by the aforementioned account holders and the lady.\n\n\u201cIt is our view that the above response has not linked the suspect, DCP Abba Kyari, to the offence of money laundering as the evidence contained in the case diary is not sufficient to indicate or show that the said monies were laundered directly or indirectly by Kyari to disguise their origin, more so that the aforementioned recipients or receivers exonerated him in their statements as having nothing to do with the monies.\u201d\n\nThe justice minister said the police might wish to explore their internal disciplinary measures against Kyari through the Police Service Commission for breaching the code of conduct for law enforcement officers by hobnobbing with suspected fraudsters and people of questionable means in his capacity as a senior officer and head of the IRT.\n\nMalami also said Kyari could be sanctioned for violating the social media policy of the police by responding to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s indictment on Facebook; breaching the Police Code of Professional Ethics by accepting complaints and acting on such without recourse to established protocol and detaining a suspect, Vincent Chibuzor, for over a month without a valid court order and regards to his fundamental human rights.\n\nKyari, a Deputy Commissioner of Police, is wanted in the United States for alleged involvement in a $1.1m scam carried out by Hushpuppi, was suspended by the police last July.\n\nPolice investigations had revealed how a gang of international scammers led by Hushpuppi paid over N235 million to Kyari\u2019s younger brother.\n\nThe police report also said Kyari equally funnelled N44 million into his sibling\u2019s bank account in multiple transactions.\n\nHe is also facing eight counts of conspiracy, obstruction and dealing in cocaine, and other related offences at the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nThe other defendants in the charge marked FHC/ABJ/57/2022 are four members of the IRT, Sunday Ubia, Bawa James, Simon Agirigba and John Nuhu.\n\nTwo other suspects arrested at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu, Chibunna Patrick Umeibe and Emeka Alphonsus Ezenwanne, were also listed as defendants.\n\nSequel to the report of the Special Investigation Panel which probed Kyari\u2019s alleged links to Hushpuppi, the AGF had affirmed in January that investigations carried out by the police indicted the former IRT commander for money laundering.\n\nMalami, in a legal advice, had therefore, directed the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, to carry out further investigations, noting that a prima facie case of money laundering had been established against the DCP.\n\nHe had also said the force should intensify investigation into 33 crime proceeds received by the ex-IRT commander.\n\nThe AGF\u2019s legal advice read in part, \u201cThat there exists prima facie case of conspiracy, collaboration, receipt, conversion, transfer and/or retention of proceeds of unlawful activities contrary to the provision of sections 15, 17 & 18 of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2004 and Section 17 of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Establishment) Act, Cap E, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, against DCP Abba Kyari and other suspects in view of the overwhelming evidence showing the nature of his disguised financial transactions and activities with Abbas Hushpuppi, Efe Martins, Usman Ibrahim Waziri, Sikiru Adekoya, Hussaini Ala and Sharon Festus, who are all confirmed members of an international Internet fraud network.\n\n\u201cAlthough the facts and circumstances of this case as contained in the case file are suggestive to money laundering offences against DCP Abba Kyari and his accomplices namely: Abbas Hushpuppi, Efe Martins, Usman Ibrahim Waziri, Sikiru Adekoya, Hussaini Ala and Sharon Festus; to successfully prosecute them, there is a need for a more thorough dissecting and tracing of the suspected 33 proceeds of crime received by DCP Abba Kyari directly or indirectly through the said accomplices.\u201d\n\nHowever, Malami, in his latest advice contradicted his January directive that Kyari should be probed for money laundering and for receiving proceeds of crime.\n\nReacting to Malami\u2019s new position, the DPP said was based on the police report, noting that the police failed to probe the gaps identified in their investigation by the ministry.\n\nAbubakar insisted that the ministry did not say there was no evidence of money laundering against Kyari.\n\nThe DPP stated, \u201cWe said in the absence of the evidence, further investigation is needed and they should go ahead to try him on the administrative offences they have identified. We said they (police) should establish linkages \u2013 the money trail.\n\n\u201cInstead of them to go and investigate further the gaps we identified, they didn\u2019t. They just wrote back to say \u2018check paragraphs so and so\u2019. We are saying no, those paragraphs did not sufficiently establish the things we say you should establish.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the police have yet to submit a fresh report on Kyari as directed by the PSC, PUNCH reported.\n\nThe commission had rejected the police investigation on Kyari carried out by the SIP led by DIG Joseph Egbunike. It ordered a fresh one, which should have been submitted on February 25.\n\nDespite establishing the fact that a total of N279.120mn flowed to the younger Kyari\u2019s bank account at various times from the cyber scam syndicate members, the panel failed to invite or interrogate him.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari has blamed the media for giving undue coverage to matters that concern the All Progressives Congress (APC), which he suggested has contributed to crisis rocking the party.\n\nThis as he has advised party members to learn from what he called the failure of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), while warning the leaders and members of the party to desist from \u201cname-calling and backstabbing.\u201d\n\nThe president who spoke in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Garba Shehu, reiterated that the party\u2019s national convention would hold on March 26.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u2018President Buhari asks for order in the APC,\u2019 issued on Saturday, Buhari urged APC members to \u201cremain steadfast and maintain unity if the party is to continue in the path of victory and its dominance at all levels throughout the country.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cLook at the once-powerful, main opposition Peoples Democratic Party now enfeebled and adrift and learn lessons in disunity, mismanagement and corruption.\n\n\u201cThey (PDP) failed in 16 years in power and a failure as opposition.\n\n\u201cYes, we are entitled to our own share of dissent and intra-party discord. These are common in all parties, left and right all over the world.\n\n\u201cBut parties splintered by competing egos destine themselves to the worst possible fate.\n\n\u201cAs the country prepares for the long run-up to the 2023 presidential election, we all expect a robust debate on the issues that matter and what is going in the APC should be a reflection of this, not the infighting we are seeing. There must be no more distractions ahead of the convention to choose new leaders.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that APC started out with a confidence of victory and enjoyed confidence in nearly two-thirds of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cThis is a party that has been in existence barely for eight years, becoming the dominant party because it has thrown open its doors to defectors from other parties, big and small.\n\n\u201cThis alone, in addition to the fact that we didn\u2019t start on the note of arrogance of power, nor see government as a vehicle for self-aggrandisement, to be held at all costs, but a vehicle to bring development to all without discrimination-political, ethnic or regional to our dear country made this success possible.\n\n\u201cGiven all that is at a stake, we can expect contests into offices as we are now faced with to be heated although candidates and their promoters for party offices are not so much debating policy differences but differences of management, personality, character, and suitability for the most important leadership roles in our country and therefore the continent.\u201d\n\nThe presidentalso blamed the media for in the crisis rocking the party.\n\n\u201cIt is equally clear that over the last week or so, the internal management affairs of the APC have been afforded generous media coverage \u2013 over and above its importance to the voters of Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is important to ask what benefits the poor are getting during the period of intense negative coverage.\n\n\u201cWhen precisely the party\u2019s convention is held and who is the party\u2019s chairman is hardly a matter for the average voter: vastly more important is who convention delegates will elect as the party\u2019s flagbearer in the coming weeks to take forward the party\u2019s platform to the people in the general election in February next year.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore important for the media to put such matters into perspective. No one is debating policy differences here. That is for the general election. None of the declared aspirants and any of those that may step forward will change because of who may be in the party in the chairman\u2019s seat. It is essentially the same party.\n\n\u201cOf course, the media are welcome to comment on the content of the character of the potential APC candidates; discuss their suitability for leadership; scrutinize their offer to the membership. But to focus on the routine internal divisions and magnify them into what they have become today is a waste of everyone\u2019s time, amounting to no more than a discussion over seating arrangements.\n\n\u201cThis is not what Nigerians talk of in their communities. They have an inclination only for things that matter.\u201d",

          "text": "A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, Senator Magnus Ngei Abe, has ruled out dragging Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike to court, over allegation of embezzlement of funds levelled against him by the latter.\n\nWike had in 2017 accused Abe of embezzling funds meant for the construction of the Kpobie-Bodo Road in Gokana local government area of the state.\n\nBut, speaking during an interactive session with youth bodies and young professionals in Port Harcourt on Sunday, Abe described what transpired between him and Wike at the time as mere politics.\n\nThe APC chieftain said: \u201cNyesom Wike is my friend. That time he made that video, we were campaigning. He went to Gokana to campaign for his party and made those accusations against me. I went to Ikwerre to go and reply him and we attacked ourselves. We don\u2019t go to Court over such things.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhen we finished that election, I did a thanksgiving service and invited him. He came and admitted that he fought me. We have forgotten about that. It is now in the past.\n\n\u201cIf we continue endlessly to tear each other down over politics, the society cannot move forward. I am not suing Wike; I am not fighting him, I am not quarreling with him. In the course of our politics, we agree and disagree. That is what it is.\u201d\n\nAbe stated that what Rivers State needed ahead of the 2023 general election were people who are experienced in governance and politics and not not those who are new in politics.\n\nThe former lawmaker said: \u201cI am part of whatever success that we have had in Rivers State because I have been in Rivers State politics at least from 1998 or so.

We have better ideas; we know the things that did not work and cannot work, we know the things that can work and can be made better.\n\n\u201cThe temptation to throw away every old leadership and start afresh will not produce the desired result that we want because somebody starting afresh will have to learn what we already know. Somebody who is starting afresh will have to know what we already know should not be known.\u201d\n\nHe stated that it takes collective efforts of all the people of the state to build a Rivers State of their dream, saying that everything should not be left for the state governor or those in government alone.\n\nAbe added: \u201cIn building a state, in building a society, in building a community, everybody has a role to play. It is not just the governor or those that are in government. I have said it severally that great cities and great societies are built with sacrifices and efforts of its own people.\n\n\u201cIf you want a great society in Rivers State, if you want a great community, if we want a place where our dreams can be pursued and realised, we must be ready to make those sacrifices that will give us those results that we want.\n\n\u201cIf we want a great state, we must be prepared, all of us; we must change the way we behave, change the way we approach issues and most importantly, we must do things differently from the way we have done them before.

The roundtable, which is novel in the Nigerian Trade Industry, was well attended by executives and faculty members of Multimix Academy, other academicians of the supply chain, logistics and school of transport from the Lagos State University and the University of Lagos, the Chairman and board members of the Nigerian Institute of Transport Technology, Chief Executive Officers of reputable supply chain and logistics companies, and executives of Supply Chain, Logistics, procurement and sales departments of some of the biggest FMCGs, Manufacturing, Health and Finance companies in Nigeria.\n\nDr Obiora Madu, the Chairman of Multimix Academy and Director General, African Centre for Supply Chain, highlighted the purpose of the roundtable gathering in his welcome/ keynote address. \u201cThe purpose of this meeting is to design/update our curriculum to represent the needs, interests, and learning areas that members of the industry need in the workplace\u201d. He buttressed that Multimix Academy has provided consistent value and proficient industry leadership in the global trade sector in Nigeria.\n\nThe major highlight of the roundtable discussion was the division of participants into groups that focused on Supply chain, Procurement and Sourcing, Logistics and Warehousing, and International trade. The purpose of the group session was for the executives to draw from their personal experiences working with colleagues, subordinates and stakeholders in the field to create real-life situations within the Nigerian environment while maintaining global practices and having sincere conversations to solve the issues facing the industry. At the end of the breakout session, each group highlighted problems within the industry. The groups revealed that the industry requires development training on strategic influencing, leadership skills, project management skills, driver management skills, assets management, finance, communications skills, and the need for more onsite internships. Dr Obiora Madu, in response to the feedback, assured participants of the planned execution of their assessments and the influence it will have on the restructuring of the curriculum to meet the current need of the industry.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe programme was also an opportunity for Multimix Academy to unveil its new brand identity. Oluchi Okafor, the Managing Director of Multimix Academy, during the unveiling, mentioned that the current business environment in Nigeria, driven by innovations in technology and knowledge, is the reason for the change of the brand identity. \u201cIn the last two decades, Multimix Academy has been in the forefront of providing Logistics and Supply Chain Education in Nigeria.

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described the President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) administration as a perfect example of arrogance in failure.\n\nThe PDP asserted that Buhari presided over the most rudderless, corrupt, disunited, disorganized, arrogant political party and government in the history of the country; a fact that is already established by Nigerians across board.\n\nThe party was reacting to Buhari\u2019s warning to APC to take a example from PDP which fell as a result of disunity.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cLook at the once-powerful, main opposition Peoples Democratic Party now enfeebled and adrift and learn lessons in disunity, mismanagement and corruption. They failed in 16 years in power and a failure as opposition.\u201d\n\nPDP, in a statement issued by Debo Ologunagba, National Publicity Secretary, said the Buhari administration is a certified failure which has brought unprecedented economic hardship, chaos, escalated insecurity, a state of anomie and hopelessness in our country in the last six years.\n\nThe party said: \u201cIf Mr. President were \u2018present\u2019 as President and party leader, he should have known that the party that is \u201cenfeebled and adrift\u201d, plagued by \u2018disunity, mismanagement and corruption\u201d; \u201carrogance of power\u201d and \u201cself-aggrandizement\u201d which he alluded to, is not the PDP but the evidently mismanaged and mutating crisis ridden APC.\n\n\u201cIt is important to educate Mr. President on the arrogance of power in his refusal to timeously appoint an economic team or listen to wise counsel on the economy and security. This is why he completely mismanaged our national affairs and turned our nation into the poverty capital of the world and the third country with the highest level of terrorism according to the World Terrorism Index.\n\n\u201cSuch arrogance of power is manifesting in President Buhari and APC\u2019s refusal to accept failure for the near collapse of our economy from the $550 billion economy (largest in Africa and 26th globally) handed over to them in 2015 by the PDP; the fall of the naira from about N197 to a dollar to almost N600 today and the hike in petrol price from N87 per liter in 2015 to between N300 andN400 per liter today.\n\n\u201cIn addition to this, the price of diesel which is a critical component in the productive sector of the economy now stands at inconceivable N700 per liter under the APC.\n\n\u201cIs it not arrogance of power that informed the Buhari-led APC administration to import contaminated fuel, induce agonizing fuel scarcity on our citizens and yet had the effrontery to tell Nigerians that \u201cheaven will not fall\u201d over the fuel situation?\u201d\n\nIt added that the same arrogance of power accounted for the repeated refusal by the APC administration to obey Court Orders, \u201cfor President Buhari\u2019s repeated refusal to sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill until he was pressured by the PDP and Nigerians as well as his constant disdain toward the people in repeatedly refusing to address the nation on critical issues, notably during the October 2020 EndSARS protest and the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe arrogance and impunity of the APC administration also accounted for its refusal to prosecute APC leaders indicted for corruption; the barefaced denial that no one was killed in the EndSARS protest despite national and international evidence of bloody massacre of our youths at the Lekki Tollgate as well as the failure to account for the billions of naira Covid-19 Funds stolen by APC leaders.\n\n\u201cThis is in addition to the recent arrogant, corrupt and criminal removal of electricity subsidy without reference to Nigerians among other thoughtless and inhumane actions of the APC government.\n\n\u201cMoreover, it is ludicrous that Mr. President who confirmed that the APC as a party of irreconcilable political warlords, is bedeviled by \u201cthe infighting we are seeing\u201d instead of the expected \u201crobust debate on the issues that matter\u201d, is looking elsewhere for a lesson in \u201cdisunity, mismanagement and corruption\u201d.\n\n\u201cMr. President has so arrogantly mismanaged the APC that it is now plagued by two illegal national chairmen, multiple structures in States; enfeebled to the extent that it cannot conduct a valid National Convention or produce legitimate candidates for elections, with its activities no longer recognized by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\u201d",

          "text": "By Joan Nwagwu/Abuja\n\nThe Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has denied alleged failure of its proposed University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS), by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA).\n\nASUU President, Mr Emmauel Osodeke, said this in a statement made available to newsmen on Sunday in Abuja.\n\nOsodeke was reacting to recent statements credited to both the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy and Director-General, NITDA that UTAS had failed the integrity test.\n\n\u201cThis press statement is necessitated by the need for ASUU to put the records straight on the grounds already covered in our patriotic struggle to get the government to deploy UTAS as a suitable solution for salary payment in our university system.\n\n\u201cLet us put it on record that an integrity test was carried out by NITDA on Aug. 10, 2021 in NUC where relevant government agencies and all the end-users in the University system were present.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the exercise, all, without exception, expressed satisfaction with UTAS as a suitable solution for salary payment in our universities.\n\n\u201cThis was attested to by the report coming from NITDA then to the effect that UTAS scored 85 per cent in User Acceptance Test (UAT), \u2018\u2019he said.\n\nAccording to him, in a curious twist of submission, the NITDA Technical Team, after conducting a comprehensive functionality test came out to say that out of 687 test cases, 529 cases were satisfactory, 156 cases queried and two cases cautioned.\n\nHe added that taking this report on its face value, the percentage score was 77 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe question that arises from this is: Can 77 per cent in any known fair evaluation system be categorized as failure?\n\n\u201cSuffice it to say here that some observations and questions were raised by NITDA to which UTAS technical team has to provide clarification. As we speak, our engagement with NITDA over the second round of testing continues.\n\n\u201cThe union is worried that while this exercise is going on, the Minister and the DG, NITDA went to press after FEC meeting of Wednesday, 9 March, 2022, to mislead the nation that UTAS has failed the integrity test.\n\n\u201cWe wish to draw your attention to the fact that NITDA gave a report to the fact that NITDA gave the report that UTAS did well in both the integrity test and user acceptability verification.\n\n\u201cClearly, 85 per cent and 77 per cent are high class grades in any known evaluation system.\n\n\u201cIn their desperation to justify their false assertions, they threw up issues such as Data centre and hosting of UTAS software which are clearly outside the rubrics of ASUU\u2019s responsibilities in the deployment of UTAS, \u2019\u2019he said.\n\nOsodeke said that ASUU and NITDA were still engaged in the testing process and that it was pertinent to note that one of the core mandates of NITDA is to encourage local content development.\n\nHe, therefore, said that NITDA had to discharge its responsibility to ensure that the solution developed by Nigerian academics was deployed\n\nHe added that, in doing so, the principles of transparency should be adhered to by making available to the public the set of criteria or benchmarks for certification of information technology application in the country.\n\nHe also appealed to the DG, NITDA to stop making comments capable of jeopardising the joint on-going testing of UTAS between the NITDA Technical Team and its counterparts.\n\n\u201cHowever, if this behaviour continues, we will have no choice but to demand that the NITDA Technical Report on UTAS and our Union\u2019s response be made public in order to shed more light on the ongoing controversies without further waste of time.\n\n\u201cThe DG, NITDA and the minister superintending the agency are challenged to a public discussion on any national media to put all matters to rest for the benefit of our students, union members, and the Nigerian public in general,\u2019\u2019he said.\n\nOn the ongoing strike, he said the union had been having engagements with the government over the issues that necessitated it in the first place.\n\nThe union embarked on a nationwide warning strike to press home its members\u2019 demands beginning from Feb.14 .\n\nThe lecturers\u2019 demands include funding of the Revitalisation of Public Universities, Earned Academic Allowances, University Transparency Accountability Solution (UTAS) and promotion arrears.\n\nOthers are: the renegotiation of 2009 ASUU-FG Agreement and the inconsistency in Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS).",

          "text": "The federal government of Nigeria has declared illegal the operations of online banks such as GoCash, Okash, EasyCredit, Kashkash, Speedy Choice, and Easy Moni.\n\nOn Friday, the Federal Competition Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) raided the offices of financial institutions operating on Opebi Road in Ikeja, Lagos, in collaboration with the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), the National Information Technology Development Agency, and the Nigerian Police Force.\n\nCustomers had complained to the FCCPC about financial firms\u2019 malpractices, according to the FCCPC.\n\nCustomers had accused banking institutions of abusing their privacy in their debt recovery efforts, according to Babatunde Irukera, Chief Executive Officer, FCCPC, who spoke about the raid.\n\n\u201cThis information started quite a while ago. Some time ago, when the country was on lockdown in 2020 due to the pandemic, we started seeing the rise in money lenders,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBecause there was lockdown due to the pandemic, people needed small easy loan which is understandable. But over a period of time, people started complaining about the malpractices of the lenders, so we started tracking it\u201d\n\n\u201cTowards the end of last year, we gathered quite a lot of information. We started working with some other key agencies and the FCCPC led the meeting where we all agreed there would be a joint effort to look into these businesses.\u201d\n\nIrukera explained that the interest rate charged by online financial institutions appear to violate the ethics of how lending is done.\n\n\u201cThe key two things that were subject of concern were what seems to be the naming and shaming violation of people\u2019s privacy with respect to how these lenders recover their loans,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the interest rate seems to be a violation of the ethics on how lending is done. So, those were the two things that we set out to look for.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, we started an investigation trying to determine the location of these firms. That has been a very difficult thing. We did that for several months and some of them have moved from one place to the another and we have been visiting these places for months.\n\n\u201cWe found out that most of these companies operate from the same place. We also found out that many of them are actually operated by the same person. They are not Nigerian companies, they don\u2019t have an address in Nigeria and they are not registered in Nigeria with the Corporate Affairs Commission and they do not have any licence to do their business\u201d\n\nIrukera said the agency had written to global app companies asking them to suspend the operations of the online banks.\n\nHe said, \u201cEssentially, what they have is an app, and so we started gathering more information about them. We engaged the public and the people who had been their victims. They gave us more information\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we got more information we had enough evidence to convince the court to issue a warrant for us to proceed with an investigation into a search and seizure. And sometime last month, a court issued a warrant and between then and now, we were preparing a sting operation which is what you are seeing here today. The reason for this is because we wanted to be sure we are hitting at the place we could get many of them.\u201d\n\nHe explained, \u201cIn addition to what you are seeing here today, the FCCPC has also issued multiple orders today. Two of them are going to vendors: Apple and Google stores where some of these apps are available. We have asked them to shut these companies\u2019 apps down so that people will not be victimised anymore. Secondly, some of them (the orders) have gone to the bank, asking them to freeze the accounts used by these people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI must add though that not all money lenders are operating illegally and that is why it has been taking time for us to track these people.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t also mean that the people we are proceeding against today are the only ones, no. We want to start with them. We also understand that they are between five and seven companies operating at the same location.\u201d",

The clergyman confessed during [a] preliminary interview that he packed that quantity of illicit substance on his body to use during his three weeks crusade in Kenya,\u201d NDLEA spokesman, Femi Babafemi, said in the statement.\n\nThe preacher\u2019s church headquarters is in Isuaniocha, Mgbakwu Road, Awka, Awka North Local Government Area, Anambra State. He has branches in Lagos and Abuja.\n\nREAD ALSO: NDLEA Seizes Smuggled Opioid Capsules In Lagos Port\n\nSimilarly, another passenger, Nnakeanyi Chukwuka King, was intercepted with 40 parcels of Cocaine concealed in bottles of body cream weighing 9.70kg. They were recovered from him during a stop and search operation.\n\nHe was intercepted at the E-Arrival Hall of the MMIA and had boarded an Ethiopian Airlines flight from Sao Paulo, Brazil via Addis Ababa.\n\nThis is as the agency intercepted one Edo Blessing, three days later, at the Departure Hall of the airport with 2, 090 tablets of Tramadol 225mg and Flunitrazepam. The suspect, who is from Edo State and had boarded an Ethiopian Airlines flight, claimed ownership of the recovered psychotropic substances.\n\n\u201cAlso on the same day, operatives arrested a freight agent, Rafiu Abbas at the NAHCO Export Shed of the airport when he presented a cargo containing 19.15kg cannabis going to London. The illicit substance was concealed inside plastic containers labelled as \u2018African Dishes\u2019 and packed in a bag,\u201d the NDLEA added.\n\nAlso in Lagos, a 63-year-old Vincent Obimma was arrested on Friday in the Apapa Seaport corridor in Lagos with 350grams of cocaine and 150grams of heroin. The drugs were hidden in industrial torch packets heading to Kano, Kano State.\n\nIn a related development, James Okenwa was arrested in a follow-up operation at the Central Market, Kaduna. The suspect admitted ownership of 1,807 bottles of cough syrup with codeine that were earlier recovered from two suspects at the tollgate.\n\n\u201cAt the point of his arrest, another 152 bottles of the drug were recovered from his vehicle. He has accepted ownership of all the 1,959 bottles of the codeine syrup,\u201d the agency\u2019s statement explained.\n\nThere were also seizures and arrests in Yobe and Anambra states. In the former, two fake security agents, Akalonu Justin and Azimbi Festus, were arrested with 25 blocks of Cannabis Sativa weighing 12 .5kg and 1, 598 bottles of Codeine Syrup weighing 159.8 litres. They were coming from Onitsha and heading to Maiduguri in Borno State.\n\nAnother 85kg of Cannabis was recovered from the warehouse of a notorious drug dealer in the Pawari area of Damaturu, the state capital on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIn Anambra state, a total of 38,605 tablets of assorted opioids were recovered from a 29-year-old drug dealer, Awoke Friday at Nkwelle junction, Onitsha on Friday 11th March with the support of men of the Nigeria Police,\u201d Babafemi\u2019s statement read.\n\nFollowing the seizures and arrests, the Chairman/ Chief Executive of the NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa, lauded officers and men of the agency in the affected commands. He urged them to be focused on the fight against illicit drugs.",

These are common in all parties, left and right all over the world.\n\n\u201dBut parties splintered by competing egos destine themselves to the worst possible fate,\u201d the President warned.\n\n\u201dAs the country prepares for the long run up to the 2023 presidential election, we all expect a robust debate on the issues that matter and what is going in the APC should be a reflection of this, not the infighting we are seeing. There must be no more distractions ahead of the convention to choose new leaders.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that the APC started out with a confidence of victory and the party today enjoys that confidence in nearly two-thirds of our 36 states.\n\nYet, he noted, this is a party that has been in existence barely for eight years, becoming the dominant party because it has thrown open its doors to defectors from other parties, big and small.\n\nThis alone, addition to the fact \u201dwe didn\u2019t start on the note of arrogance of power, nor see government as a vehicle for self-aggrandizement, to be held at all costs, but a vehicle to bring development to all without discrimination-political, ethnic or regional to our dear country made this success possible.\u201d\n\nThe party, he went on to note, is proud of the fact that in its short period of existence, it has won two general elections decisively and despite losing a few states in 2019, it steadfastly expanded its pan-Nigerian outlook with significant defections of the opposition Governors and parliamentarians into its fold.\n\n\u201dGiven all that is at a stake, we can expect contests into offices as we are now faced with to be heated although candidates and their promoters for party offices are not so much debating policy differences but differences of management, personality, character, and suitability for the most important leadership roles in our country and therefore the continent.\u201d\n\nIt is equally clear that over the last week or so, the internal management affairs of the APC have been afforded generous media coverage \u2013 over and above its importance to the voters of Nigeria.\n\nIt is important to ask what benefits the poor are getting during the period of intense negative coverage.\n\nWhen precisely the party\u2019s convention is held and who is the party\u2019s chairman is hardly a matter for the average voter: vastly more important is who convention delegates will elect as the party\u2019s flagbearer in the coming weeks to take forward the party\u2019s platform to the people in the general election in February next year.\n\nIt is therefore important for the media to put such matters into perspective. No-one is debating policy differences here. That is for the general election. None of the declared aspirants and any of those that may step forward will change because of who may be in the party in the chairman\u2019s seat. It is essentially the same party.\n\nOf course the media are welcome to comment on the content of the character of the potential APC candidates; discuss their suitability for leadership; scrutinize their offer to the membership. But to focus on the routine internal divisions and magnify them into what they have become today is a waste of everyone\u2019s time, amounting to no more than a discussion over seating arrangements.\n\nThis is not what Nigerians talk of in their communities. They have an inclination only for things that matter.",

          "text": "The Governor Abdullahi Sani Bello-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) has made a U-Turn moments after a leaked letter from the Independent National Electoral Commission had subtly rejected the invitation to the emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee of the party.\n\nThe Bello-led CECPC had on Wednesday, 8 March written to the electoral body inviting it to the emergency NEC meeting of the party. The INEC in its reply stated clearly that the fact that the notice for the meeting was not signed by the National Chairman and National Secretary of the CECPC, runs contrary to the provision of the Article 1.1.3 of the Commission\u2019s Regulations and Guidelines for Political Party Operations (2014).\n\nAddressing the media at the Buhari House National Secretariat of the party on Friday in Abuja, the Spokesman of the CECPC, Ismaeel Ahmed, said, \u201cSomebody asked, what is the position of Governor Mai Mala Buni in the party, I think it\u2019s pretty simple. I don\u2019t know why this is a complicated process for a lot of people not to understand. Since the inception of this CECPC on June 25, 2020, whenever the chairman is not around and Governor Sani Bello is around, he acts on behalf of all as the Chairman.\n\n\u201cIt has always been the case that has never changed. It has always been the case. Now, we have a Convention on March 26. The chairman wrote a letter and transmitted power to Governor Bello to enable him go for medical treatment. Those are two emergencies. He has a medical emergency, that cannot wait for Convention. We have a Convention that cannot wait for him to be healthy.\n\n\u201cSo, one has to leave for the other, whichever, he has transmitted a letter and Governor Sani Bello has been acting appropriately. Why is it so difficult for people to understand that? Why is it so difficult for people to simply understand? I cannot understand why people are making this allegation.\n\n\u201cSo, Governor Sani Bello is acting the full authority of the Caretaker Committee and with the full authority of the stakeholders and with the full consent of Governor Mai Mala Buni. It is very clear and simple. If anybody has issues with any of our decisions, he can head to court. For now, we are doing it with the full backing of the law. So, there is no ambiguity on this, absolutely none.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of Senator John James Akpanudodehe, what is the position because I spelt others out the other members of the committee, but I didn\u2019t say anything about other people as well, we just talked about members of the committee. I didn\u2019t talk about their positions, whether secretary or chairman, since they have their responsibilities spelt out for them.\n\n\u201cThe other members are the ones told to come back to handle specific departments and that is what we are doing. At the full course of time, once all these are over, I will be able to brief you. But for now, these are the responsibilities of every member.\n\n\u201cAs part of efforts towards the hitch-free conduct of the March 26th National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) stepped up preparations this week.\n\n\u201cConvened a meeting chaired by the Acting Chairman and Governor of Niger State, H.E. Abubakar Sani Bello, where strategies were adopted to fast-track the process towards conducting a National Convention;\n\n\u201c35 State chairmen of the APC and that of the FCT were sworn-in and mandated to work towards ensuring unity and harmony in their states. They were also charged to mobilise the members and the people to enable the party win future elections;\n\n\u201cReceived and deliberated on the report of the Committee on zoning. After exhaustively deliberating on the report, it was approved and the zoning formula was made public. The zoning formula was well-received by members of the party and all Nigerians;\n\n\u201cAssigned schedules of specific responsibilities to each members of the Caretaker Committee aligned to the existing Directorates at the Party\u2019s headquarters. The purpose is to ensure speedy execution of the various activities leading to the National Convention on March 26, 2022. The exercise has the additional benefit of ensuring synergy between the leadership of the party and the Directorates.\n\n\u201cDeliberated on and disagreed with the Federal High Court in its judgement on the status of the Governor of Ebonyi state over his sound decision to leave the PDP and join the APC along with the majority of members of the State House Assembly; CECPC regards the judgement as a travesty of justice and stand with the Governor and Ebonyi state legislators on appealing to a higher court;\n\n\u201cStreamlined and expanded the leadership of the various sub committees for the conduct of National Convention by bringing in more Governors and Ministers of the Federal Republic to spearhead the process. This has obviously fostered and deepened sense of belonging, inclusiveness and reflect the mosaic nature of the membership of the party;\n\n\u201cReviewed and strengthened the membership of the National Convention Subcommittees by making them compact and lighter. The subcommittees earlier composed were unnecessarily unwieldy and comprised excessive number of members, a situation that can reduce their efficiency;\n\n\u201cThe CECPC committee chaired by His Excellency the Governor of Niger State has issued a notice for a meeting of the National Executive Committee of the party on March 17, 2022. As usual, a number of important issues will be discussed at the meeting.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, reacting to questions from journalists, Ismaeel Ahmed disclosed that the previously scheduled Zonal Congresses will now be part of the National Convention. He assured that the March 26th National Convention was on course and sacrosanct.",

The EssLibra Terminal is an integrated logistics off-dock terminal, ready for all export activities such as stuffing, on-site customs clearance and barging services.\n\nThe agency said the terminal covered an area of 120,000 square metres (sqm) that includes an export processing zone, trailer park, RoRo facility and fuel dump.\n\nSpeaking at the flag-off ceremony, the Managing Director of NPA, Mr Mohammed Bello-Koko, asked all agencies involved in the export processing value chain to deploy adequate personnel and work in synergy to ensure efficiency and quick turnaround in the processing of export cargoes.\n\nWhile commending the management of EssLibra for the quality of facilities at the terminal, he assured them of the readiness of NPA to remove all impediments against the seamless handling of locally manufactured exports and agro-allied commodities.\n\nBello Koko asked the management of the terminal to resist the temptation to veer off export processing for which the facility was built.\n\nAccording to him, the rationale for the establishment of the terminal is to have a one-stop shop where all inspection, consolidation and stuffing of export-bound cargo will be conducted in a synchronised manner to eliminate all the delays that rendered Nigeria\u2019s non-oil exports uncompetitive.\n\nHe said the NPA management would effectively implement all government policies geared towards the promotion of exports, as well as strengthening indigenous capacity through the promotion of local content.\n\n\u201cWe took cognisance of local content in the certification process of this terminal, and this is why I expect the host community to take ownership of this terminal and support its operations, because of the multiplier benefits to the host community\u201d, a statement by Ibrahim Nasiru, general manager of NPA\u2019s corporate and strategic communications division, quoted Bello-Koko as saying.\n\nOn his part, the Managing Director of EssLibra Nigeria Limited, Yemi Adunola, thanked the NPA and its technical partners, the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC), for their unalloyed support.\n\nHe pledged his company\u2019s readiness to render efficient services and a commitment to continuous improvement through sustained investments in human capital and requisite technology.\n\nEromosele Abiodun",

          "text": "Despite the decision of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, OPEC+, to raise crude oil production by 340,000 barrels per day last month, the gap between the group\u2019s actual output and target still widened to 890,000 bpd, according to the cartel\u2019s report.\n\nIt was also a month that saw Nigeria raise output to 1.51 million bpd, a marked improvement from the previous few months when the country struggled to produce between 1.2 million bpd and 1.4 bpd.\n\nNigeria has been constrained in meeting its OPEC allocation for months, and as of January had as much as 300,000 barrels per day deficit, mainly due to ageing upstream infrastructure and sabotage as well as technical reasons.\n\nDespite the over 1.7 million barrels per day output allowed by OPEC+, the country had managed to increase production to about 1.4 million, the highest in recent times, going by the latest OPEC review.\n\nAlthough there are issues surrounding the sustainability of the current upward trend of the country\u2019s supply to the global market, it is seen as a good sign for the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\nThe latest report showed that production from OPEC+ participants was 38.25 million bpd in February, up from 37.91 million bpd in January, but below the target of 39.14 million, according to an Argus survey, which shares insights and analyses about energy and commodity markets worldwide.\n\nBut oil prices rose at the weekend, although they experienced their biggest weekly declines since November on fears of escalating bans on Russian oil as against efforts to bring more supply to the market from other major producers.\n\nIn a week of volatile trading marked by talk of Russian oil embargoes then potential supply additions from Iran, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates while fighting escalated in Ukraine, Brent, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark fell 5.2 per cent after hitting a 14-year high of $139.13 on Monday.\n\nIn the same vein, US crude was dropped 6.6 per cent after touching a high of $130.50 at the start of the trading week.\n\nA day earlier, crude oil prices fell significantly, tumbling from a 2008 high of $130, about the largest single-day percentage decline since April 2020.\n\nNigeria\u2019s benchmark oil dropped 13 per cent to $111 a barrel, while the WTI crude oil which topped $130 at the height of trading earlier in the week, lost 12 per cent.\n\nThe latest report indicated that notably, the quota-exempt OPEC members, Iran and Libya raised output by a combined 170,000 bpd in February, with the north African country accounting for 130,000 bpd of this after an early-January restart of four crude and condensate fields.\n\nBut 14 of the wider group\u2019s 19 members, including Nigeria, produced below quota in the month, as dwindling spare capacity, underinvestment and infrastructure restraints have constrained output increases.\n\nThe OPEC+ group\u2019s stance on rising prices is that they are down to geopolitics and not market fundamentals, with the organisation\u2019s Secretary-General, Mr Sanusi Barkindo, saying during the week that \u201cwe have no control over current events.\u201d\n\nBarkindo stated that despite the surging crude oil prices, there\u2019s no shortage of the commodity in the market, although he admitted that not all member countries are currently able to fulfil their obligations because of capacity constraints.\n\nOPEC+ ministers will meet on March 31, to decide a production strategy for May, when five countries \u2014 Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait and the UAE \u2014 will see upwards revisions to the baseline levels that determine their quotas and compliance.\n\nThis would see the combined monthly output quota increase move to 432,000 bpd from 400,000 bpd, which could go some way to satisfying calls for the group to raise the pace of production increases.\n\nMinister of State Petroleum, Mr Timipre Sylva, last week said that the absence of long-term investment in the oil and gas sector, as well as insecurity, should be blamed on Nigeria\u2019s current low crude oil production.\n\nSylva stated that this development was responsible for the inability of Nigeria to meet the OPEC quota in recent times in addition to the speed with which International Oil Companies (IOCs) and other investors were withdrawing investments in hydrocarbon exploitation.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
