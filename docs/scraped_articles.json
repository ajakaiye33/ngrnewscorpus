          "text": "Amarachi Okeh\n\nMaternal and child health experts say pregnant women should seek prompt medical intervention for overdue pregnancy, warning that post-term babies are at risk of neurological deficiencies and death.\n\nThe experts, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologists at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, Dr. Chioma Eze and Dr. Obi Kenechukwu urged pregnant women to take the issue of overdue pregnancy serious at all times.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH Healthwise in separate interviews, the maternal and child health experts said caregivers must also intervene once pregnancy exceeds 42 weeks.\n\nAccording to Dr. Eze, any pregnancy that exceeds 42 weeks puts the baby\u2019s life at risk, noting that the baby may even die in the womb in extreme cases.\n\nThe gynaecologist explained that early-term delivery is between 37 to 38 weeks while full-term pregnancy is between 39 to 40 weeks.\n\nShe also noted that overdue babies are babies born after 42 weeks.\n\nOn the what happens to the baby after 42 weeks in the womb, Eze said, \u201cYou know, the baby is supplied nutrients from the mother through the placenta so that placenta, it has been found that it begins to degenerate so the supply of nutrients to the baby will not be optimal again.\n\n\u201cEven the volume of the amniotic fluid that makes the baby comfortable starts to reduce by this time\u201d.\n\nAlso speaking with PUNCH Healthwise Dr. Kenechukwu, said that a baby deprived of oxygen because of overdue pregnancy could have some neurological deficiencies, which he added, is also individualised.\n\n\u201cOnce it\u2019s the date of birth, we normally use 40 weeks, we don\u2019t wait till 42 weeks. In Nigeria, once it is 41 weeks and three days, the woman is induced,\u201d Dr. Kenechukwu said.\n\n\u201cA drug is given to the woman for the labour to start or for the cervix to start getting soft in preparation for the labour.\n\n\u201cNo matter the situation, the labour is induced at this time unless there\u2019s a contrary indicator for that labour to be made vaginally.\n\n\u201cThe thing is that the baby must come out, if not the baby may die and all of that,\u201d Kenechukwu said.\n\nAs reported by the BBC, a recent study conducted in the Netherlands and published in the International Journal of Epidemiology revealed that overdue babies are at risk of suffering from behavioural problems early in life and had more than twice the risk of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.\n\nAccording to the study, other complications that may arise from overdue births include a higher risk of stillbirth and other long-term health effects.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

He is identifiable, in constant communication and everyone knows where he is.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take Boko Haram for instance.

The insurgency is still going on and the Federal Government is not giving up.\n\n\u201cRegarding bandits, they are not centralised under one leadership. Who is the head of the bandits? Who is the equivanlent of Nmandi Kanu with banditry?\n\n\u201cBandits are just collections of independent criminals. It is a business for them.

          "text": "Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Abiodun Ige Adams\n\nBy Dapo Akinrefon, LAGOS\n\nYORUBA in the Diaspora, under the aegis of Yoruba One Voice, YOV, yesterday, renewed its call for the liberation of the Yoruba race, saying it is tired of the killings and destruction in the region.\n\nSpeaking at a conference held at a National Press Club, Washington DC, which aired globally via zoom, the group expressed worry over the state of insecurity in Nigeria, saying the call for the Yoruba Nation became imperative as the race could no longer tolerate killer herdsmen in the South West.\n\nThe zoom meeting was attended by the Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams; former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Mr. Obadiah Mailafia; Niger Delta activist, Anniko Briggs; Publicity Secretary, Yoruba Summit Group, Mogaji Gboyega Adejumo; a political analyst, Akogun Gani Balogun, and others.\n\nChairman of the YOV\u2019s Foreign Affairs Department and organizer of the conference, Debo Adekoya, said: \u201cOur people back home are being attacked and killed by Fulani herdsmen, supported by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cKiller herdsmen run amok in our land daily, with cases of extra-judicial killings already reaching an alarming crescendo.\n\n\u201cI am sure you must have seen videos shared on social networks of Yoruba men, women and children hacked by these heartless Fulani killers in our land.

The election was annulled by the Hausa/Fulani oligarchy and Abiola was arrested,\n\n\u201cHe was eventually killed on July 7, 1998.

No one, no matter how highly placed, is bigger than the country.\n\n\u201cIt is interesting that many are suddenly calling for a fair trial for Kanu as if he didn\u2019t get one before he decided to jump bail and flee. However, I can assure you that the fair deal that Kanu denied many of the victims of the violence which he wilfully instigated through his broadcasts and tweets will not be denied him.\n\n\u201cFinally, there have been speculations on how this re-arrest was pulled off and in which country the hitherto fugitive leader of the proscribed IPOB was nabbed.\n\n\u201cWhat we can tell you, once again, is that the re-arrest was made possible by the diligent efforts of our security and intelligence agencies, in collaboration with countries with which we have obligations. We continue to respect and honour the obligations,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nNnamdi Kanu caused death of 60 persons in 4 months \u2014FG\n\nThe government equally listed the alleged sins of Kanu in a letter to the international community, alleging that the IPOB leader orchestrated the killing of 60 persons and destruction of property in 55 violent attacks across the South-East and South-South zones within four months.\n\nThe FG stated this in a letter dated April 26, 2021 to western diplomats, NAN reports.\n\nIn the letter, it listed the alleged atrocities committed by members of IPOB on the instruction of Kanu who was then in exile.\n\nOne of the attachments to the letter listed the attacks on lives and property by IPOB and its militia arm, Eastern Security Network, ESN, in some parts of the country between January and April 2021.\n\nAccording to the letter from the Nigerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to some western countries, the Federal Government objected to a statement by an agency of a western nation whose government had noted that ESN was created to combat insecurity.\n\nThe Federal Government, in its letter, considered the statement as \u201cjustifying the establishment of a militia by a non-state actor and glossing over the destructive and violent acts of IPOB and the ESN.\n\n\u201dIn under four months this year, IPOB has carried out over fifty-five violent acts in various parts of South-East Nigeria killing scores of people and destroying many properties.\n\n\u201cIndeed, it would seem that the position of the (western nation) seems to have further emboldened Nnamdi Kanu, the self-confessed leader of IPOB.\n\n\u201dAs recently as 22nd April, 2021, broadcasting online from his base in London, Mr Kanu issued a series of instructions to his militia and other members of the outlawed organisation, on acts of violence to be carried out within the territory of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe letter made copious references to some of the threats issued by Kanu thus: \u201cOur madness has just begun.\n\n\u201cEvery night, young men will not sleep, you will come out, at the starting of every road that leads to every populated area under human habitation to make sure that appropriate road blocks are put in place to slow them down so we can catch them (Fulanis) and kill them.\n\n\u201cThat is what we want you to do. Obiano (Governor of Anambra State) from today onwards, anywhere you are seen in public you will be attacked \u2026. Obiano, \u2026 you are a dead man walking.\n\n\u201cAny landlord that gives accommodation or rents his house or her house to a Fulani person, to an army personnel, to somebody who works for the police or Department of State Services (DSS).Kill them.\n\n\u201cIf you see the army and the police in your place, kill all of them\u2026 Kill them.\n\n\u201cFrom today, I am announcing, there will be no election in Anambra State. Every edifice of election in Anambra State will be destroyed. I am warning you in advance. There will be no election. There will be no campaign in Anambra State.\n\n\u201cAny vehicle you see, from tonight (22nd April 2021), 12 midnight to 5, destroy it completely. That is the time they (referring to Fulanis) move about abducting people. And we keep quiet.\n\n\u201cWhat stops you young people from, once you see them coming around 4am in the morning, you will block all every exits, set it on fire?\n\n\u201cThey will exhaust all the ammunition that they have, then we capture them alive and cut off their heads. All of them. Decapitate them,\u201d the Federal Government further quoted Kanu\u2019s alleged instructions to IPOB members.\n\nThe Federal Government noted that IPOB members, following these instructions, intensified their attacks on the specified targets.\n\nAccording to the Federal Government, Kanu issued instructions from western capitals using Radio Biafra and IPOB members to carry them out in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor example, a day after Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State confirmed to newsmen that Nnamdi Kanu has ordered members of the group to kill him and other South-East governors, which orders were repeated on Radio Biafra, the private residence of Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma, in his hometown in Omuma, Oru East Local Government Area of Imo State, was attacked and set ablaze and two of the security men attached to the house were killed.\u201d\n\nThe letter then listed the IPOB attacks in S-East, S-South zones:\n\nAbia: Between January 26 and April 19, 2021, six policemen were killed while property worth huge sums were destroyed by IPOB members in coordinated attacks at Uratta junction, Aba North LGA; Omoba Police Station, Isiale-Ngwa South LGA; Abriba Community in Ohafia LGA, and Uzuakoli Police Station in Bende LGA.\n\nAkwa Ibom: 25 persons, including security personnel were killed in deliberate attacks on different locations across the state, between January 27 and April 19, 2021.\n\nCross River: Seven police officers were killed at Calabar-Ikom highway in Obubra and Yakur LGAs on March 2, 2021, while a soldier was killed two days later on March 4 at a military checkpoint at Obubra Junction in Obubra LGA.\n\nDelta: Between January 10 And April 14, IPOB members attacked and killed 11 persons including security personnel in Ughelli, Ndokwa East, Ezza South, Onicha, Ezza North, Ohaozara, Ohoukwu, LGAs.\n\nEnugu: Three policemen were killed in attacks on different locations across the state between February 28 and April 18.\n\nImo: Between January 3 and April 24, 2021, IPOB members killed seven persons and injured many others in different attacks in Orlu, Obouo, Aboh Mbaise, Chitte Uboma, Isiala Mbano, Owerri, Njaba, Mbatoli, Oru East LGAs.\n\nRivers: On April 17, 2021, IPOB operatives killed an NSCDC operative on guard duty at Shell crude oil manifold in Elelewon village in Obio/Akpor LGA and injured many others.\n\nThe Federal Government also told the western nation that its position may seem to have further emboldened Kanu, adding that this may explain the increased tempo of attacks carried out by members of his group.\n\nIPOB berates President Kenyatta for Kanu\u2019s abduction\n\nBut reacting Thursday, the IPOB accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya of stooping low to allegedly collude with the Federal Government to abduct its leader.\n\nIPOB expressed disappointment with the Kenyan President for allegedly betraying Kanu, saying it would hold him accountable for his action.\n\nIt also alleged that President Kenyatta and his government planned the abduction immediately Kanu entered the country before alerting Nigeria of his presence in Kenya and subsequent abduction with the assistance of Nigerian security agents.\n\nIPOB in a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, called on all Biafrans at home and in the Diaspora to boycott travels with Kenya Airways and stop patronising any product made in Kenya.\n\nIPOB\u2019s statement read: \u201cWe, the global movement of the Indigenous People of Biafra, express our disappointment with President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya and his Government over his role in the abduction of our Leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and his subsequent smuggling into Nigeria by the wicked Nigeria security agents.\n\n\u201cWe are still at shock why a President like Uhuru Kenyatta would stoop so low to collude with a terror-friendly government like Nigeria under President Muhamadu Buhari to abduct and dehumanise our Leader for doing nothing other than demanding the freedom of Biafrans from Nigeria\u2019s bondage.\n\n\u201cBased on our preliminary findings, President Uhuru Kenyatta was very instrumental to the abduction of our Leader in Kenya. The treacherous action of Uhuru Kenyatta against Nnamdi Kanu and Biafrans at large is a clear violation of the 1949 Geneva Convention, and United Nations Code.\n\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t understand why Uhuru Kenyatta and some corrupt officials of his government would prefer to betray Nnamdi Kanu and Biafrans.\n\n\u201cIs it because of Nigeria oil money? Is it because of the paltry N100 million bounty placed on Kanu\u2019s head by some Northern charlatans? Why would President Uhuru Kenyatta sell our leader, Mazi Nnamdi, to the evil hands of Nigerian government?\u201d\n\nMbaka breaks silence on arrest, says Nigeria may collapse\n\nIn a related development, the spiritual Director of Adoration Ministries, Enugu, Fr Ejike Mbaka, said: \u201dThe God in me will be in the jail with him because he says when you are suffering, I am also suffering. He says when you are afflicted, God is also afflicted, a place where the state prisoners were confined, He was there in the prison.\n\n\u201cLift your hands, we minister to all the prisons in the universe, especially in our country where our people are, we minister speedy release.\n\n\u201cAgain, let our leaders do the needful because when the major catastrophe happens in the future, they will not be exempted. If they like, let them jail everybody, that is not the solution, let them feel the pains in the eyes of teeming Nigerians. Go to the North, people are suffering yet a few are millionaires in Dollars, the same with other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cIntimidation will not solve the problem. I know that the real people who should be in prison are those arresting people and locking them up. I know that after this message, they will invite me again.\n\n\u201cThey are gradually succeeding in their gimmicks and tricks to make sure men of God are silent. Look at our medical experts, hot brains graduating from medical schools, where do they work?\n\nOhanaeze disowns statement saying Kanu refused to listen to Igbo leaders\n\nIn its reaction, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, disowned a statement credited to it on the re-arrest and arraignment of Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nChief Alex Ogbonnia, the National Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze, said the group was yet to make known its position.\n\n\u201cThe attention of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has been drawn to a publication currently circulating in the media suggesting that Ohanaeze has issued a statement regarding the alleged re-arrest and re-arraignment of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, we would have ignored the said press release but silence in this circumstance would mean giving validity to such fallacy by the unsuspecting public.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo led by Ambassador Professor George Obiozor has not issued any press statement on the matter. Ohanaeze Ndigbo as the apex Igbo cultural organisation does not issue public statements in a hurry,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe Ohanaeze spokesman noted that in the event of further breach of this warning, \u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo will be compelled to invoke the full weight of the law to deal with the offenders.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe group which issued the statement also called itself Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide.\n\nIt said Kanu\u2019s arrest will avert another civil war and bring peace to the South-East.\n\nIts secretary, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, said the development will bring violent agitations in the South-East to an end.\n\nNzuko Umunna insists on fair trial, safety, others\n\nIgbo professional and intellectual think-tank group, Nzuko Ummuna, called on the Federal Government to ensure fair trial and fundamental human rights for Kanu.\n\nNoting that the government is yet to provide details on the circumstances surrounding the \u201cinterception,\u201d the group hoped that \u201dhis arrest accords with international law and conventions to which Nigeria is obligated.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by Executive Secretary, Mr. Joe Odumuko; and Deputy Executive Secretary, Dr. Uju Agomoh, Nzuko Umunna asked \u201dthe Government to ensure that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s fundamental rights are secured to the fullest extent possible.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that Section 31 of the Nigerian Constitution and Article 4 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights obligates the Federal Government to ensure that Nnamdi Kanu does not suffer any bodily harm while in the custody of the state and its agencies.\n\n\u201cIt bears repeating that it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to secure the bodily integrity and personal dignity of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu while in its custody.\n\n\u201cWe shall hold the Nigerian Government and all state actors to account on this obligation under domestic and international laws to the fullest extent possible.\u201d\n\nFree Nnamdi Kanu\u2019 protest begins in London\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerians living in London, United Kingdom, have begun a protest to demand the release of Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nSome of the protesters waved the Biafran flag in a video obtained by SaharaReporters as they chanted, \u201cFree Nnamdi Kanu now.\u201d\n\nKanu is a British and a Nigerian citizen and it is believed that he had been staying in the UK.\n\nIgbo-British Lawyers give FG ultimatum to return Kanu to UK\n\nAlso speaking, a group of Igbo lawyers resident in the United Kingdom, described as illegal, the arrest and detention of Nnamdi Kanu by the Nigerian government.\n\nThe legal practitioners under the auspices of the Coalition of Igbo-British Lawyers condemned the Kenyan Government for arresting Kanu, who is also a British citizen, and handing him over to the Nigerian government.\n\nThe group revealed this in a statement signed by Barrister Ebuka Okoroafor and made available to SaharaReporters on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the lawyers, the Kenyan government has violated the human rights of Kanu, who possesses both Nigerian and British passports.\n\nIt condemned \u201dthe illegal and archaic manner in which the Kenyan Government acted in the illegal detention of the leader of IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, and the subsequent handing him over to the Nigerian Government without any due process.\n\n\u201cIt is worthy of note to mention that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu entered Kenya with his British passport, and the Kenyan government is fully aware of his citizenship status but still went ahead to perpetrate their illegal act which does not only breach the personal human rights of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu but also undermine the sovereignty of the British government,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nThe group also disclosed that the illegal action will be addressed at the International Criminal Court, in Hague, The Netherlands, while asking the Nigerian government to convey Kanu back to the United Kingdom before the expiration of 48 hours.\n\nThe Igbo British lawyers also stated that the failure of the Nigerian government to do so means it has declared war on Kanu, IPOB, and the entire Igbo.\n\n\u201cWhile this serves as a pre-action notice to the Kenyan Government as we shall be heading to the International Criminal Court to rectify the injustice done as it is trite law that injustice to one is injustice to all, we are also by this medium informing the Nigerian Government that they have 48 hours to return Mazi Nnamdi Kanu to the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cAnd if he has any charges to answer to, they should as a nation that is governed by the constitution, pass through the legal means of filing an extradition notice as failure to do so, we shall not hesitate to term this a declaration of war on not only Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and IPOB but all Igbo generally, and this we shall vehemently resist with all apparatus of law available at our disposal.\u2018\u2018\n\nKanu\u2019s ordeals \u2018ll not affect Biafra struggle \u2014 MASSOB\n\nThe Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra, MASSOB, said the current ordeals of Kanu in Nigeria would not in any way affect the struggle for the restoration of Biafra.\n\nAlthough the MASSOB leader, Comrade Uchenna Madu in a statement condemned the re \u2013 arrest of Kanu by the Nigerian government and her foreign collaborators, he observed that the IPOB leader is merely a figurehead in championing the self determination struggle for the actualization and restoration of Biafra.\n\nAccording to Madu, the re arrest of Kanu was inconsequential in the struggle.\n\nHe said: \u201cMazi Nnamdi Kanu and the activities of pro \u2013 Biafra agitators do not pose any danger to Nigeria\u2019s existence.\n\n\u201cWhat poses a dangerous problem to Nigeria\u2019s existence is the Fulani domination of Nigerian state against the general interest of other ethnic nationalities.\n\n\u201cAs freedom can never be achieved on a platter of gold, Biafra revolutionary struggle for actualization and restoration can never be punctured or derailed because of Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s current ordeals in the hands of our oppressive enemy.\n\n\u201cNigerian state will soon regret arresting him because he will become a thorn in their flesh.\n\n\u201cWe shall never relent or be discomforted because of the sponsored genocidal operations in Biafra land which we in MASSOB always see as a sign of jittery and frustration by some people.\u201d\n\nLobby firm hired by Nnamdi Kanu engages US govt on his arrest \u2014Report\n\nMeantime, BW Global Group, the American lobby firm hired by Nnamdi Kanu has reportedly engaged the US government over the arrest of the activist.\n\nForeign Lobby, a Washington-based platform, quoted the firm as saying it \u201chad been in touch with the State Department and Congress\u201d about the arrest of Kanu.\n\nThe IPOB leader was said to have signed a contract with BW Global Group to help promote IPOB in a bid to achieve its Biafra secession objective.\n\nThe $1750,000 deal reportedly took effect from March 1, 2021, and is expected to last for a year.\n\nA document relating to the contract had stated that, \u201cBWGG shall provide IPOB with services relating to the promotion of human rights and democracy, and shall otherwise act as an advocate for the indigenous people of Biafra.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Birrel, the co-owner of BW Global Group, told Foreign Lobby that Kanu\u2019s arrest \u201ccould have grave consequences in terms of human life.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know all of the details surrounding the thuggish actions of the Nigerian Security Forces which acted in a third country, against Mr. Kanu, a British citizen,\u201d he reportedly said.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the US will make its position clear regarding this unlawful abduction and assert support for Mr. Kanu\u2019s universal human rights.\u201d\n\nThe British High Commission in Abuja said on Wednesday that it is \u201ccurrently in the process of seeking clarification from the Nigerian government about the circumstances of the arrest.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Sunday Igboho\n\nThe Department of State Services, DSS, has explained how a joint team of security operatives raided the Soka, Ibadan residence of Yoruba self-determination agitator, Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho\u2019s residence, got into a gun battle that led to the death of two of Igboho\u2019s men, arrest of 13 and discovery of a cache of arms.\n\nIgboho\u2019s home had been raided on Thursday morning \u201cbased on intelligence that he had stockpiled arms\u201d.\n\nYou can watch the raid video HERE and see pictures of arms DSS said it recovered from Igboho\u2019s residence HERE.\n\nSpeaking on the raid, DSS spokesman, Peter Afunaya, told newsmen that \u201cA team of joint security operatives raided the residence of Sunday Adeyemo at Soka in Ibadan.\n\n\u201cOn approach to his residence, the team came under heavy gun attack by nine men suspected to be Igboho\u2019s guards. Six were armed with AK-47 guns and three others with pump action rifles.\n\n\u201cIn the course of the exchange, two of the armed men were gunned down, while the rest were arrested.\n\n\u201cOnly one operative, who was shot by the assailants in his right hand, sustained injury. The hour-long gun duel offered Igboho the chance to escape. Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, is now on the run.\u201d\n\nThe Service gave the names of those arrested to include: Abdulateef Ofeyagbe, Amoda Babatunde, aka Lady \u2018K\u2019, Tajudeen Erinoyen, Diakola Ademola, Abideen Shittu, Jamiu Noah, Ayobami Donald, Adelabe Usman, Oluwapelumi Kunle, Raji Kazeem, Taiwo Opeyemi and Bamidele Sunday.\n\nIt said at the time of addressing the press, one of the suspects was being profiled.\n\nThe DSS said: \u201cIgboho may run as far as he can. He may hide as long as he wants. He might have attacked security operatives as his strength carried him.\n\n\u201cBut this will be the end of his shenanigans. Soon, he will not have a hiding place. His strength will sure fail him. And the law will catch up with him. The law may be slow. But it will be steady.\n\n\u201cConsequently, ADEYEMO/IGBOHO is advised to turn himself into the nearest security agency. Those cheering and eulogising him may appeal to or advise him to do the needful.\n\n\u201cHe should surrender himself to the appropriate authorities. He or anyone can never be above the law. Meanwhile, those arrested will be charged accordingly\u201d (Read DSS\u2019 full statement HERE).\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Peter Duru\n\nAgain, after 45 years of being without motorable roads and electricity, residents of communities on the Apir-Tse Poor stretch of Makurdi town have been in euphoric mood following the completion of a 9.4km asphalted road that has opened up the communities for easy accessibility.\n\n\n\nThe road is also complemented with a 12-km stretch of power transmission line that electrifies the communities on that axis of the town.\n\n\n\nArewa Voice gathered from residents in the communities that the projects, which cost the state government over N1.4billion have completely transformed their lives by linking and opening up the communities in that part of Makurdi town for social, business and economic activities.\n\n\n\nThe residents of the hitherto forgotten communities who could not hide their excitement narrated how that axis of the town was abandoned for decades by successive governments and how life was so undesirable for them due to lack of a motorable road and power supply despite being situated in the state capital.\n\n\n\nFor 70-year-old Mrs. Eunice Afo, who said she had lived at Apir for close to 45 years, recalled how she had lived in the community for decades in darkness without access roads and social amenities.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut all that has changed today because this government has the interest of the people at heart. And that is why we now have electricity and a good road that we never dreamt of before now.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven if I answer the heavenly call I will go home a happy woman because my children can now proudly say and claim that they are in Makurdi town. We thank this government for giving us this gift and not making empty promises to us like other governments.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat this road and electricity has brought for us is unimaginable. As a trade-in food items, people now come from neigbouring communities to patronize me.\n\n\n\n\u201cBesides, we can now easily move into nearby rural communities to buy items that we sell in town here instead going far away to buy goods because we now have a good road that cut across several communities where we can access the goods we sell.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo we cannot thank his government enough for what they done for us. Our children will eternally celebrate this government for remembering that human beings also live in this part of the state capital,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nOn his part, a patent medicine shop owner, Richard Ikechukwu who explained he had lived in that part of Makurdi town for close to five years said since the completion of the electricity and road project his business had witnessed unimaginable patronage and boost.\n\n\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWhen work started on the road, most of us never believed it would be completed. But Governor Ortom has proved us wrong. In fact, I have been living here for about five years; when I came here it was very difficult passing through the stretch of road, especially during the rainy season because the place usually turned muddy.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut today we can see the dividends of democracy; the community has been opened up and whoever wants to bypass Makurdi main town if you are heading towards Ikpayonge from Gboko and even Taraba State all you need to do is to detour at Terwase Agbado and enjoy a smooth drive through our community and you are in Apir.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe cannot thank the government enough because aside giving us that sense of belonging as a people living in Makurdi, the state capital, the road has boosted our business activities.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can also enjoy constant security patrols because we have almost 10 kilometres of asphalted road that stretches through several communities who now easily come to our community on this part of Apir to patronise our businesses.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe now have night life in our communities with the coming of electricity as well as several other businesses that rely on electricity unlike what obtained in the past when such businesses never existed in this part of the state capital.\n\n\n\n\u201cAside recording bumper return in our businesses, we now can feel like people living in a town after several decades of neglect by successive governments in the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe completion of these two projects clearly shows that we have a listening government that places premium on the wellbeing of the people who by this gesture will remain indebted to the government,\u201d he added excitedly.\n\n\n\nAs for Joseph Patrick who owns a retail shop in that part of the town: \u201cAt last after several years of being forgotten, a king that remembers forgotten people has finally come to Benue state and we are elated that our condition has also change.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter living in this community for several years without a good motorable road that runs through the communities we now have every reason to proudly say that we also live in Makurdi town.\n\n\u201cAnd our businesses have suddenly turned around because people can now easily access our community and the level of patronage we now enjoy is unprecedented and this is a function of the special gift of electricity and road from a listening government for which we will remain an grateful.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "On the 28th of June, northern lawmakers gathered at the Zuma Resort, just on the outskirt of the Federal Capital Territory, and the agenda was to deliberate on the PIB.\n\nThe chairman of the caucus, Sarkin Adar from Sokoto State is the chairman of the lower chamber committee on petroleum (upstream). The event was well attended.\n\nThe Sultan of Sokoto, Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, the minister of petroleum, Mele Kyari, the Federal Capital Territory Minister, Mohammed Bello, the Governor of Nasarawa State, Abdulahi Sule, the chairman of Arewa Consultative Forum, Audu Ogbeh, Ango Abdulahi, Boss Mustapha, Simon Lalong all attended the meeting.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Sultan said the PIB must support the exploration of oil in the frontier basins.\n\n\u201cWe continue to talk about poverty, unemployment and the attendant insecurity while we are sitting on billions of barrels of Hydrocarbon from Sokoto Basin to Chad Basin, and from Gongola to Bida and Benue Trouh Basins untapped.\n\n\u201cWe should have a PlB that will encourage massive hydrocarbon exploration in those Frontier Basins.\u201d\n\nThe frontier basins refer to potential oil fields outside the Niger Delta basin. The PIB is proposing the establishment of a frontier basin exploration fund.\n\nThe original bill proposed 10% of the prospective mining licences fees for the fund.\n\nThe committee of the House on the other hand recommended 30% of the profit of the NNPC limited and 10% prospective mining licence. A major win for the north, where most of the basins are located.\n\nThe south on the other is interested in the host community trust fund. Section 240 of the bill makes provision for the host communities trust fund.\n\nThe House committee recommended 5 per cent for the host communities, which oil companies are to contribute to communities where they are operating.\n\nThe House passed that version, however, in the Senate, the host community fund proposal was amended.\n\nSen Sani Kaita, moved an amendment for it to be reduced to 3%, a move that caused mild disagreement.\n\nNow, two-chamber has passed two different versions.\n\nAside from that, the north also got another win, as revealed that Mohammed Monguno, the chairman ad hoc committee on PIB, said it\u2019s not only oil producing communities, but any community that pipeline passes through. Which means many communities in manys part of the country will benefit.\n\nThe following day, lawmakers from the south met at transcorp hilton in Abuja to discuss further on the matter.",

          "text": "Justice Inyang Edem Ekwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja has fixed September 20 for judgment in a suit by former Abia State Governor, Dr Orji Uzor Kalu, seeking to stop his retrial in an alleged N7.1billion fraud.\n\nThe Judge on Friday fixed the date after Kalu and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) adopted all processes filed for and against the suit.\n\nThe former governor, who is now a senator representing Abia North Senatorial District, is seeking to stop his retrial in a N7.1billion money laundering charges on the ground that he had been tried, convicted and imprisoned.\n\nProf. Awa Kalu SAN, counsel to the former governor, while adopting his processes informed that Kalu stood for trial for 12 years and got convicted and jailed for 10 years.\n\nHe cited section 36 (9) of the 1999 constitution which stipulates that no Nigerian shall be subjected to double jeopardy.\n\nAwa Kalu insisted that the former governor, having served a period of jail term, would be subjected to double jeopardy if allowed by the court to be put on trial for the second time.\n\nEx-Gov Kalu\u2019s firm battles to stop retrial in N7.1bn alleged fraud\n\nProfessor Kalu produced and read the Supreme Court judgment upon which the ex-governor was released after five months in prison adding that there was nowhere in the judgment where the apex court made order for his client\u2019s trial.\n\nHe challenged the EFCC to point out to the court where order for retrial was made against the former governor\n\nThe senior lawyer then urged the court to prohibit the EFCC from going ahead with the planned retrial.\n\nHowever, in a vehement opposition to the suit., the EFCC through its counsel Rotimi Jacobs SAN asked the court to dismiss the suit with anger.\n\nHe submitted that the judgment which led to release of Kalu has been declared a nullity by the Supreme Court which also ordered retrial of the appellant in the matter Mr Udeh Jones who stood trial with Kalu in the same charges.\n\nThe anti-graft commission argued that since the Supreme Court order benefitted Kalu, he must bear the burden that arose from the apex court verdict.\n\nJacobs described Kalu suit as approbating and reprobating at the same time, frivolous, irritating and sought for it\u2019s dismissal with order of Kalu to face retrial.\n\nIn a short ruling, Justice Ekwo fixed September 20 for judgment in the matter.\n\nSpecifically, Kalu is seeking an order of court prohibiting the federal government, through the EFCC, its officers, servants, others, agents, privies and any other person or bodies deriving authority from the Federal Republic of Nigeria, from retrying him on charge No. FHC/ABJ/CR/56/2007 between FRN vs Orji Kalu & 2 ors, or any other charge based on the same facts de novo, there being no extant judgment and ruling of a competent court in Nigeria mandating the same.\n\nThe ex-governor had also applied for order prohibiting the Federal Republic of Nigeria, through the EFCC (her agent), her officers, servants, others, agents, privies and any other person or bodies deriving authority from the Federal Republic of Nigeria, from retrying, harassing and intimidating him with respect to the charge as concerns charge No: FHC/ABJ/CR/56/2007 between FRN vs Orji Kalu & 2 ors or any other charge based on same facts as he need not suffer double jeopardy.\n\nAlso Kalu is asking the Federal High Court to restrain the EFCC from retrying him on the same alleged N7.1b money laundering charges against him.\n\nHe contested that having been tried once by EFCC, convicted and sentenced in the same charges FHC/ABJ/CR/56/ 2007, it will amount to double jeopardy for him if he is allowed to be subjected to a fresh trial on the same charge.",

While we were preparing for the rally, somebody was preparing plan B against the rally.\n\n\u201cThe plan was that they knew that nobody would stop Sunday Igboho from attending that peaceful rally that we have done in every state,\n\n\u201cSo somebody sent a message to DSS, to get to Ibadan and bring Sunday Igboho\u2019s body to Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe target was chief Sunday Igboho, the target was to kill him before the Lagos mega rally, they came heavily well prepared\n\n\u201cThey came 72 hours before the mega rally, if you read the DSS statement, you\u2019ll know they were prepared to kill him or label him as a criminal.\u201d\n\nKoiki also alleged that DSS officials took away a cat when they raided the house\n\nAccording to him, operatives thought Igboho turned into the cat to escape arrest.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said: \u201cChief Sunday Igboho escaped not because he was stronger but God rescued him.

          "text": "By Nicholas Kalu, Abuja\n\nTwo killed during joint security raid on agitator\u2019s Ibadan home\n\nAfenifere, ARG, OPC condemn action\n\nPolice: stay off Lagos\n\nYoruba nation agitator Sunday Adeyemo (a.k.a Sunday Igboho) has been declared wanted after a raid on his Ibadan home by a joint team of security operatives.\n\nDuring the early morning raid, about 1:34 am on Thursday, two of Igboho\u2019s men were killed, 13 were arrested and taken to Abuja. Igboho escaped.\n\nArms, ammunition, charms among other items, were recovered from the house after almost one hour of gun exchange between security operatives and Igboho\u2019s guards.\n\nDepartment of State Services (DSS) said last night that security operatives carried out the raid after an intelligence report confirmed the stockpiling of arms in the house.\n\nDSS spokesman Dr. Peter Afunanya told reporters that when security operatives approached the house, they came under heavy gunfire from nine of Igboho\u2019s men. Afunanya said six of the men were armed with AK-47 while the three had pump action rifles.\n\nAfunanya explained that Igboho escaped during the exchange of gunfire. He urged Igboho to turn himself in to the security agencies.\n\nVarious weapons, cash and charms were recovered in the raid, Afunanya said.\n\nIn a statement he read at a news conference, the DSS spokesman said: \u201cIn the early hours (about 0134 hours) of today, (1st July, 2021), a joint team of security operatives raided the residence of Sunday Adeniyi Adeyemo a.k.a. Sunday Igboho at Soka, Ibadan, Oyo State. This was based on intelligence that he had stockpiled arms in the place. On approach to the residence, the team came under heavy gun attack by nine (9) men, suspected to be Igboho\u2019s guards. Six (6) of them were armed with AK-47 gun and Three (3) others, with Pump-Action riffles.\n\n\u201cIn the course of the exchange, two (2) of Igboho\u2019s armed men were gunned down while the rest were subdued and arrested. Only one operative who was shot by the assailants on his right hand sustained injury. He has however received medical attention and he is very stable.\n\n\u201cAfterwards, the team procedurally searched the house and subsequently recovered the following among others:\n\nseven AK-47 assault rifles; three Pump Action guns; 30 fully charged AK-47 magazines; (5,000) rounds of 7.62mm ammunition; five cutlasses; one jack knife; one pen knife two pistol holsters; one binoculars and a wallet containing $5 in $1 denomination, local and international driver\u2019s licenses in his name, ATM cards and a German resident permit No. YO2N6K1NY bearing his name.\n\n\u201cAlso found were: two whistles; 50 cartridges; 18 walkie-talkies; three Voodoo charm jackets/traditional body armour; two laptops (Toshiba and One Compaq models); and his International Passport and those of many others (as displayed).\u201d\n\nAfunnaya said further exploitation and forensic analysis were ongoing.\n\nHe added: \u201cAside the items recovered from the building, thirteen (13) suspects including twelve (12) males and one (1) female were arrested and brought to Abuja. While one suspect is being profiled, the other twelve (12) paraded here are: Abdulateef Ofeyagbe; Amoda Babatunde (aka Lady K); Tajudeen Erinoyen; Diakola Ademola; Abideen Shittu; Jamiu Noah; Ayobami Donald; Adelabe Usman; Oluwafelumi Kunle; Raji Kazeem; Taiwo Opeyemi and Bamidele Sunday.\n\nHighlights of this brief are to:\n\n\u201cInform Nigerians and the world that Sunday Igboho and his group, in the guise of campaign for self-determination, have become well-armed and determined to undermine public order. This, the arrests and seizures are, no doubt, a confirmation of a grand plan by Igboho and his cohorts to wage a violent insurrection against the Nigerian State.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAlert foreign missions and licencing authorities within and outside Nigeria about this development and the possibility that Igboho could declare some of his personal permit and identity cards missing in order to seek their replacement.\n\n\u201cApprise stakeholders that the Five (5) AK-47 assault rifles recovered from the building are suspected to be those collected by Igboho\u2019s men from Nigerian Customs and Immigration personnel at Idi Iroko, Ogun State.\n\n\u201cThe gun duel which lasted for an hour offered Igboho the chance to escape. He is now on the run. Igboho may run as far as he can. He may hide as long as he wants. He might have attacked security operatives as his strength carried him. But this will be the end of his shenanigans. Soon, he will not have a hiding place. His strength will sure fail him. And the law will catch up with him. The law may be slow. But it will be steady.\n\n\u201cConsequently, Adeyemo/Igboho is advised to turn himself in to the nearest security agency. Those cheering and eulogising him may appeal to or advise him to do the needful. He should surrender himself to the appropriate authorities. He or anyone can never be above the law. Meanwhile, those arrested will be charged accordingly.\u201d\n\nMany groups including Afenifere, the Afenifere Renewal Group and Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) condemned the raid. Other groups also urged caution.",

We won\u2019t accept that.\n\n\u201cWe also want to tell the DSS to jettison any plans to inject our leader with poisonous vaccine that will make him die slowly. Any such attempt will come with unimaginable consequences! Nnamdi Kanu must not die in custody.\n\n\u201cThe Fulani- controlled federal government of Nigeria and DSS should release our leader for international medical check up. He must have access to his doctors to ascertain his current health status since he was abuducted and tortured by the security agents.\n\n\u201cWe declare without equivocations that the Nigeria Government should not take our calmness for granted. Should anything untoward happen to our leader while in detention or even after, we will totally cripple Nigeria and its Government.\n\nIPOB has also claimed that their leader is presently being tortured in his cell since he was locked up. \u201cOur intelligence units are following up events including the torture being meted out to him since his abduction. The world should see how the wicked Nigeria Government is provoking us.\n\n\u201cWhile Boko Haram terrorists and bandits maming and killing indigenous Nigerians in their ancestral lands are made to go free, and even the few captured ones are released and given cash after sumptuous treatment in detention, an innocent freedom fighter is made to languish in detention.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nFourteen years after the first attempt was made, the Senate and House of Representatives, yesterday, passed into law the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB).\n\nBut it was not without controversy and drama as senators and House of Reps disagreed on what percentage host communities should get from crude oil drilled in their areas.\n\nThe bill had originally proposed 2.5 per cent Equity Share Holding for Host Communities but the joint committee on Petroleum Resources (Upstream, Downstream and Gas) recommended five per cent in its final submision.\n\nWhile the House of Representatives raised the amount from 2.5 per cent to five per cent and passed the bill into law, senators from the northern part of the country rejected the five per cent recommended by its committee and insisted on three per cent.\n\nKaita Ahmed, representing President Muhammadu Buhari in the Senate, led the onslaught against the five per cent. Although senators who supported the retainment of the five per cent had their way when it was subjected to voice vote, Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, however, ruled contrarily.\n\nThe development led to a rowdy session as senators mainly from the south rejected the ruling even as Lawan tried without success to restore order.\n\nNorthern lawmakers, it was learnt, felt the allocation of five per cent would deprive other states of funds accruing from oil production in the Niger Delta even as they argued that three per cent was enough based on the briefing they got from Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipreye Sylva.\n\nSenaor Albert Bassey, however, explained that the reason for recommending five per cent was to remedy unfortunate incidents that may affect the assets.\n\nDissatisfied with the decision of the Lawan-led morthern senators, George Sekibo from Rivers State raised a Point of Order. He cited Order 73, which challenges the ruling of the chairman (Mr Lawan), and requires that he put the question to vote a second time. And should his opinion be again challenged, he should call each senators name to vote.\n\nLeader of the Senate, Yahaya Abdullahi, called on Sekibo to step down the request for individual senators\u2019 names to be called to vote on the issue. Lawan also appealed to Sekibo to step down the request.\n\n\u201cThis three per cent, at least the Senate did not pass 2.5 per cent, we passed something slightly higher than that. I appeal to Sekibo to withdraw the point of order. We should not insist on dividing the Senate. It is our right,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nIn withdrawing the call for a head count, Sekibo said the decision was against the interest of the country.\n\nDeputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, appeal to his northern colleagues to retain the five per cent also crashed.\n\nThe senate went ahead to approval a Host Community Trust Fund, which would be anchored by oil and gas companies operating in the host communities for the three per cent.\n\nThere is, however, the fear that host communities in the Niger Delta may only get a meagre share of three per cent if the figure is not harmonised by both chambers.\n\nThe Senate, however, approved a 30 per cent funding mechanism for Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) profit to fund exploration of frontier basins in parts of the country where search for crude oil in commercial quantity is ongoing.\n\nThere is an ongoing search for oil in commercial quantity in some northern states but no search in any part of the 17 southern states.\n\nThe Bill has also empowered the Minister of Petroleum to exercise certain supervisory powers in the management of the oil and gas sector.\n\nThe Bill states that the Minister shall \u201cformulate, monitor and administer government policy in the petroleum industry, exercise general supervision over the affairs and operations of the petroleum industry in accordance with the provisions of this Act, report developments in the petroleum industry to the government, represent Nigeria at international organisations on petroleum matters, promote an enabling environment for investment in the Nigerian petroleum industry,\n\nThe Bill also unbundled the NNPC into two commercialised corporation.\n\n\u201cThere is established the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (the Commission) which shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal. There is established the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (the Authority), which shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal. The Authority shall have the power to acquire, hold and dispose of property, sue and be sued in its own name.\n\n\u201cThe Authority shall be responsible for the technical and commercial regulation of midstream and downstream petroleum operations in the petroleum industry. The objects and functions of the Authority in this Part are limited to midstream and downstream petroleum operations in the petroleum industry.\n\nThe objectives of the Authority shall be to regulate midstream and downstream petroleum operations, including technical, operational, and commercial activities; ensure efficient, safe, effective and sustainable infrastructural development of midstream and downstream.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Adetutu Folasade-Koyi, Abuja, Emma Emeozor\n\nFederal Government said it has launched a manhunt for collaborators of leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu and would prosecute them irrespective of their status in the society.\n\nAt a press conference in Abuja, yesterday, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, revealed that Nigeria\u2019s intelligence and security agencies were on Kanu\u2019s trail across continents spanning two years before he was finally intercepted on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe commend the professionalism, diligence, patriotism and painstaking efforts of our security and intelligence agencies. We also thank the sister international agencies that collaborated with us to pull off this arrest.\n\n\u201cIt will interest Nigerians to know that for over two years, our security and intelligence agencies were on the trail of the proscribed IPOB leader as he lived a five-star life across several countries, travelling on chartered private jets, living in luxury apartments and turning out in designing clothes and shoes.\n\n\u201cOf course, as we all saw, he was wearing an attire made by Fendi, a luxury Italian fashion brand, when he was arrested.\n\n\u201cWe can tell you that the forensic investigation carried out so far has revealed a treasure trove of information on the proscribed IPOB leader and his collaborators.\n\n\u201cWhile the investigation continues, we assure you that none of the collaborators, irrespective of their standing in the society, will be spared.\n\n\u201cThey will all face the full wrath of the law for their activities that challenge our nation\u2019s sovereignty and threaten its unity. No one, no matter how highly placed, is bigger than the country.\n\n\u201cIt is interesting that many are suddenly calling for a fair trial for Kanu as if he didn\u2019t get one before he decided to jump bail and flee.\n\n\u201cHowever, I can assure you that the fair deal that Kanu denied many of the victims of the violence which he willfully instigated through his broadcasts and tweets will not be denied him.\n\n\u201cFinally, there have been speculations on how this re-arrest was pulled off and in which country the hitherto fugitive leader of the proscribed IPOB was nabbed.\n\n\u201cWhat we can tell you, once again, is that the re-arrest was made possible by the diligent efforts of our security and intelligence agencies, in collaboration with countries with which we have obligations. We continue to respect and honour the obligations.\u201d\n\nKanu, who is facing an 11-count charge of treason, treasonable felony, terrorism and illegal possession of firearms, among others, jumped bail in 2017 and left the country.\n\nAn Abuja High Court had on Tuesday granted the Department of State Services (DSS) custody of Kanu after he was arraigned and denied bail. His next appearance in court is on July 26-27.\n\nMeanwhile, a day after Kingsley, younger brother of the IPOB leader said the separatist leader was arrested in Kenya, Nairobi has denied the claim.\n\nSpokeswoman for the Kenyan interior ministry said it was not aware of the matter while the foreign affairs ministry in Nairobi did not respond to a request for comment, Reuters said. The reaction of the government of Kenya came as confusion trails the location Kanu was intercepted by security operatives.\n\nThe British High Commission in Nigeria has also said Kanu was not arrested in the United Kingdom where the embattled IPOB leader is a citizen. In a press release, the Mission said: \u201cIn response to any question on whether Nnamdi Kanu was extradited from the UK, we can reaffirm that Nnamdi Kanu was not arrested in the UK and nor was he extradited from the UK.\u201d\n\nThe UK has said it plans to seek clarification from the Federal Government, circumstances surrounding the arrest of Kanu. At a press conference on Monday, Malami break the news of Kanu\u2019s arrest saying he was intercepted following diligent intelligence by \u201cour security and intelligence agencies.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Rose Ejembi, Makurdi and Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu\n\nGovernor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has advised the Federal Government to ensure rule of law and due process is followed in Kalu\u2019s prosecution.\n\nHe said conscientious effort must be made by the Federal Government to allay the fear of some Nigerians that Kanu is not being prosecuted because he comes from a particular section of the country.\n\nGovernor Wike, who made this assertion during a television interview, explained that irrespective of the differences the arrested IPOB leader has with Rivers State government, due process must be followed in his prosecution.\n\nHe stated that for the Federal Government to demonstrate its resolve to address insecurity crisis facing the country, the same dragnet deployed to arrest Kanu must, as a matter of urgency, be extended to bandits and Miyetti Allah militias terrorising the country.\n\n\u201cWe must not make hullabaloo about the prosecution of Nnamdi Kanu. I don\u2019t agree with his principle. I have come out and said you (Kanu) cannot annex my State to be your own. But that does not mean that you\u2019ll not allow the law to take its course.\u201d\n\nThe governor insisted that government must arrest every wanted terrorist on its watchlist and ensure they are brought to book to face the full wrath of the law.\n\n\u201cYou cannot say because Nnamdi Kanu is from a particular area, let us prosecute him. The same thing must apply to all other people, the bandits, Miyetti Allah.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Benue Governor, Samuel Ortom urged the Federal Government to zealously arrest leaders of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore (MAKH) same way it arrested the Biafran freedom fighter.\n\n\u201cIf the Federal Government has demonstrated capacity to arrest Kanu, they should also exhibit the same zeal, will and decision to arrest Fulani herdsmen terrorising our state and country.\n\n\u201cLet that be done, they are living here with us. If Nnamdi Kanu can be arrested from a foreign land. I believe that if the Federal Government can exhibit the same will, they will arrest Fulani herdsmen, especially Miyetti Allah who have owned up to the killings in Benue state and have continued to terrorise our land.\u201d\n\nOrtom, who stated this in Makurdi wondered why Miyetti Allah would brand Kanu who is fighting for the liberation of his people a terrorist.\n\n\u201cIt is laughable and unfortunate when I heard that Miyetti Allah are calling Nnamdi Kanu a terrorist. Someone who is fighting for the liberation of his people is being called a terrorist by a terrorist organisation called Miyetti Allah and Fulani herdsmen. So, the Federal Government should rise up to its responsibilities and arrest the people.\u201d\n\nThe governor, however, noted that the Federal Government, after arresting Kanu, must follow due process to ensure justice.\n\n\u2022Re-arrest won\u2019t dampen Biafra struggle \u2013MASSOB\n\nHowever, the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) has said the actions of the Nigeria government and her foreign collaborators and the ordeal Kanu was going through would not dampen the Biafra struggle.\n\nReacting to Kanu\u2019s re-arrest and extradition to Nigeria, MASSOB in a statement issued by Uchenna Madu accused the Federal Government of being confusedly blind and clueless.\n\nThe group said this was because Kanu and activities of pro-Biafra agitators do not pose any danger to Nigeria\u2019s existence. The group said what poses problem to Nigeria\u2019s existence is Fulani domination of Nigerian state over the general interest of other ethnic nationalities.\n\n\u201cMazi Nnamdi Kanu has proven to be a loved figurehead in championing the self determination struggle for the actualisation and restoration of Biafra.\n\n\u201cAs freedom can never be achieved on a platter of gold, Biafra revolutionary struggle for actualisation and restoration can never be deterred or fluctuated because of Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s current ordeal in the hands of our oppressive enemy. Nigeria state will soon regret arresting him because he will become a thorn in their flesh.\u201d\n\nIt warned the Nigeria government to be careful with Kanu and accord him fair and unbiased court hearing, adding that the people of Biafra will never keep quiet over Kanu.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

He stressed that one of the operative was wounded during the operation.\n\nAfunaya gave the names of twelve persons arrested , a female inclusive, as Abdulateef OFEYAGBE\n\niAmoda BABATUNDE aka Lady K Tajudeen ERINOYEN, Diakola ADEMOLA, Abideen SHITTU\n\nJamiu NOAH, Ayobami DONALD\n\nAdelabe USMAN, Oluwafelumi KUNLE, Raji KAZEEM, Taiwo OPEYEMI and Bamidele SUNDAY.\n\nHe explained that a search was conducted in the house\n\nAfunaya\u2019s statement reads; \u201cIn the early hours (about 0134 hours) of today, 1st July, 2021, a joint team of security operatives raided the residence of Sunday Adeniyi Adeyemo a.k.a. SUNDAY IGBOHO at Soka, Ibadan, Oyo State. This was based on intelligence that he had stockpiled arms in the place.\n\n\u201cOn approach to the residence, the team came under heavy gun attack by nine (9) men, suspected to be IGBOHO\u2019s guards. Six (6) of them were armed with AK-47 gun and Three (3) others, with Pump-Action riffles.\n\n\u201cIn the course of the exchange, two (2) of IGBOHO\u2019s armed men were gunned down while the rest were subdued and arrested. Only one operative who was shot by the assailants on his right hand sustained injury. He has however received medical attention and is very stable.\n\n\u201cAfterwards, the team procedurally searched the house and subsequently recovered the following among others:Seven (7) AK-47 assault rifles; three (3) Pump Action guns; thirty (30) fully charged AK-47 magazines and five thousand (5,000) rounds of 7.62mm ammunition.\n\nHe also stated that five (5) cutlasses , one (1) Jack knife, one (1) Pen Knife;\n\ntwo (2) Pistol holsters;one (1) binoculars ; a wallet containing Five (5) US Dollars in one (1) Dollar denomination; local and international driver\u2019s licences in his name, ATM Cards, a German residence permit No. YO2N6K1NY bearing his name were found.\n\nAlso discovered , he said were two (2) whistles; fifty (5) Cartridges; eighteen (18) Walkie-Talkies;\n\nthree voodoo charm jackets/traditional body armour;\n\ntwo (2) Laptops (One (1) Toshiba and One (1) Compaq); and his International Passport and those of many others (as displayed here).

          "text": "Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan\n\nThe Department of State Services (DSS) said last night that it raided the residence of the Yoruba activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, accusing him and his associates of planning a violent insurrection against the state.\n\nThe secret police said its operatives raided his residence in Soka, Ibadan yesterday and arrested 13 of his associates.\n\nIt said operatives recovered seven AK-47 assault rifles, 30 fully charged AK-47 magazines and 5,000 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition.\n\nParading the suspects, the Public Relations Officer of the DSS, Dr. Peter Afunanya, said Igboho, in the course of agitation for self-determination, had become well-armed and a threat to public order.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe agency wishes to inform Nigerians and the world that Sunday Igboho and his group, in the guise of campaign for self-determination, have become well-armed and determined to undermine public order.\n\n\u201cThis, the arrests and seizures are, no doubt, a confirmation of a grand plan by Igboho and his cohorts to wage a violent insurrection against the Nigerian State.\u201d\n\nThe agency also alerted \u201cforeign missions and licensing authorities within and outside Nigeria about this development and the possibility that Igboho could declare some of his personal permit and identity cards missing in order to seek their replacement.\u201d\n\nAfunanya said the agency needed to inform stakeholders that the five AK-47 assault rifles recovered from the building were suspected to be those collected by Igboho\u2019s men from Nigerian Customs and Immigration personnel at Idi Iroko, Ogun State.\n\nHe said his associates engaged the operatives in a gun duel.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe gun duel, which lasted for an hour offered Igboho the chance to escape. Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a Sunday Igboho is now on the run. Igboho may run as far as he can. He may hide as long as he wants. He might have attacked security operatives as his strength carried him.\n\n\u201cBut this will be the end of his shenanigans. Soon, he will not have a hiding place. His strength will surely fail him and the law will catch up with him. The law may be slow. But it will be steady.\u201d\n\nHe advised Igboho to turn himself into the nearest security agency, calling also on those cheering and eulogising him to appeal to or advise him to do the needful.\n\n\u201cHe should surrender himself to the appropriate authorities. He or anyone can never be above the law. Meanwhile, those arrested will be charged accordingly,\u201d he said\n\nAfenifere, Others Kick\n\nApparently thinking that the raid was an unlawful attack, the pan Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere; the umbrella body of Yoruba self-determination groups, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO); a former Minister of Aviation, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode; and the Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Chief Gani Adams, yesterday condemned the attack on Igboho\u2019s residence.\n\nWhile Adams claimed that eight people were killed, an aide to Igboho put the death toll at two.\n\n\u201cThe situation now is very bad. Two Yoruba sons have been killed in the house of Chief Sunday Igboho. The two bodies have been taken away by the military. We do not know of the location where they were taken to,\u201d Igboho\u2019s spokesman, Mr. Olayomi Koiki, said.\n\nThose who lost their lives were said to be relatives of Igboho.\n\nThere were bloodstains on the floor of the premises as well as some of the rooms, indicating that some persons were hit by bullets.\n\nThere were also expended bullets at the front of the house and also on the premises.\n\nSome vehicles destroyed by bullets included a Sienna bus branded with pictures of Prof. Banji Akintoye and Igboho.\n\nReacting to the incident, Afenifere and IOO had accused the federal government of being behind the attack.\n\nAfenifere in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Jare Ajayi, said the manner of the attack indicated culpability on the part of the government.\n\nIt said: \u201cWe are forced into this deduction for a number of reasons. Firstly, eyewitness accounts indicated that the vehicles and uniforms of the attackers were that of the security agencies. Secondly, the failure of security agencies to confront the attackers further implicated the government. It was reported that the attack lasted for more than three hours. \u201cIgboho\u2019s residence is in a highly-populated area within minutes\u2019 reach to surrounding police stations. That no rescue team came from any of the police units, including the DSS office in Ibadan for the several hours that the attack lasted, makes it difficult not to believe that the government is complicit in the attack\u201d.\n\nIn his reaction, Fani-Kayode said two people were killed and their bodies were taken away with a large number of others arrested.\n\nHe added that Igboho\u2019s passport and travel documents were stolen together with his phones, his personal effects, computers and N2 million.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere were about 100 soldiers and security agents involved and Sunday managed to escape after his boys shielded him from the bullets. They insisted that he should leave whilst they resisted the attack as best as they could and with few numbers.\n\n\u201cMy question is this: what has this man done to deserve this? There is nothing he has been asked to do in terms of keeping the peace in the South-west by the federal government and the Yoruba elders that he has not done, including guaranteeing the security and safety of the local Hausa-Fulani population, building bridges, keeping the peace and having a dialogue with other ethnic nationalities in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Mr. Kehinde Aderemi, Adams said the attack was a ploy to silence Igboho from expressing his views on the state of the nation.\n\nHe, however, charged the federal government to investigate the circumstances surrounding the attack and to bring the perpetrators to book.\n\nIOO in a statement by Emeritus Prof. Banji Akintoye, and made available to THISDAY by his Communications Manager, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye, accused the Nigerian Army, accompanied by those he labelled international terrorists hired by the Nigerian state, of attacking Igboho\u2019s home.\n\nAkintoye also alleged that the assailants were all dressed in military uniform and spoke the French language fluently.\n\nHe stated that the gunmen killed seven occupants of the building and whisked away Igboho\u2019s wife and others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u00b7 Divests NNPC of regulatory power\n\n\u00b7 Presidency: Jinx broken\n\nDeji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe two chambers of the National Assembly yesterday passed the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), after about 13 years of legislative fireworks.\n\nAlthough the House of Representatives apparently skipped certain parliamentary procedures to pass the bill as witnessed by journalists at plenary, the Chairman of the House Ad-hoc Committee on the PIB, Hon. Mohammed Monguno, later told reporters that what transpired at the plenary did not actually mean that they passed it as widely reported.\n\nThe President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, said the demons behind the non-passage of the bill for many years had been defeated.\n\nAlso, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly (Senate), Senator Babajide Omoworare said the federal lawmakers had broken the jinx.\n\nHowever, there was uproar at the Senate as the senators disagreed on the profit share percentage to be allocated to the host communities in the PIB, before finally settling for three per cent.\n\nThe Senate passed the much-awaited PIB after a clause-by-clause consideration of all the 318 clauses of the bill.\n\nThe bill was first sent to the National Assembly in 2008 by President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, now deceased, without translating into an Act.\n\nChairman of the Senate Joint Committee on Petroleum Upstream/Downstream and Gas, Senator Sabo Nakudu, had earlier while presenting its committee\u2019s report before the Senate went into a closed-door session with the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, and the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Malam Mele Kyari.\n\nThe bill had proposed five per cent of the annual profit share of the oil companies for the host communities.\n\nShortly after the Senate resumed plenary after its executive session with Sylva and Kyari, Lawan commenced the clause-by-clause consideration of the bill.\n\nBy the time he got to clause 240, which made provision for five per cent trust fund for host communities, the plenary became rowdy.\n\nExplaining why the five per cent was reduced to three per cent shortly after the plenary, Nakudu said the earlier percentage, which was 2.5 was increased to five per cent.\n\nHe added that it was reduced after Kyari explained that five per cent is a huge amount of money.\n\nAccording to him, the three per cent amounts to half a billion dollars, adding that enabling environment needs to be created to attract investors as fossil oil is fast going out of fashion.\n\nMajority of senators later voted for three per cent contribution to the host communities, following a motion by Senator Ahmad Kaita, seconded by Senator Ibrahim Gobir, for an amendment to clause 240(2) of the bill.\n\nEfforts by the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, Senators James Manager, George Sekibo and Albert Akpan for an upward review were rejected.\n\nSekibo, in a move to sustain his agitation for an increase in contributions to host communities, relied on Order 73 of the Senate Rule and called for a division.\n\nBut the Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, prevailed on him to withdraw his call for division and reminded him of the commitment of senators to fostering unity while keeping in mind their obligation at all times to protect the national interest.\n\nLawan also told Sekibo of the overwhelming support of the lawmakers who had earlier approved that host communities should receive remediation and relief from monies accruing from gas flaring in the PIB.\n\nSekibo then withdrew his earlier call for division. During a clause-by-clause consideration of the bill, the Senate also approved the funding mechanism of 30 per cent of NNPC Limited\u2019s oil and gas profit in the production sharing, profit sharing, and risk service contracts to fund exploration of frontier basins.\n\nIt approved clause 4 of the bill, which seeks the establishment of the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission to provide technical regulatory functions to enforce, administer and implement laws, regulations and policies relating to upstream petroleum operations. The commission will, among others, ensure compliance with applicable national and international petroleum industry policies, standards and practices for upstream petroleum operations; and establish, monitor, regulate and enforce health, safety and environmental measures and standards relating to upstream petroleum operations.\n\nIn addition, the Senate also adopted the committee\u2019s recommendation to retain provisions in Clause 29 of the bill, approved the establishment of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority.\n\nClause 29(3) empowers the agency to be responsible for the technical and commercial regulation of midstream and downstream petroleum operations in the petroleum industry in Nigeria.\n\nIts function include implementing government\u2019s policies for midstream and downstream petroleum operations as directed by the minister; and to promote, establish and develop a positive environment for international and domestic investment in midstream and downstream petroleum operations.\n\nOthers are to ensure strict environmental implementation of policies, laws and regulations for midstream and downstream petroleum operations; and to develop and enforce a framework on tariff and pricing for natural gas and petroleum products. The recommendation of the joint committee was amended in clause 52(7d) to ensure that all monies received from gas flaring be channelled for the purpose of environmental remediation and relief of the host communities as against the development of infrastructure in midstream gas operations. The Senate, however, retained the recommendation of the joint committee in Clause 53, which empowers the Minister of Petroleum Resources to incorporate Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation as a limited liability company, to be known as NNPC Limited, six months after the commencement of the Act.\n\nIt adopted clause 53 that mandates the minister, at the incorporation of NNPC Limited, to consult with the Minister of Finance to determine the number and nominal value of the shares to be allotted, which would form the initial paid-up share capital of NNPC Limited.\n\nThe Senate also approved the ownership of all shares in NNPC Limited to be vested in the government at incorporation and held by the Ministry of Finance Incorporated on behalf of the government.\n\nLawan, after the passage of the PIB congratulated the National Assembly and the Joint Committee on Downstream Petroleum Sector; Petroleum Resources (Upstream); and Gas for the \u201ctremendous and historical achievement of passing the long-awaited Petroleum Industry Bill.\u201d\n\nHe said the passage of the PIB was an indication that the \u201cdemon\u201d behind its non-passage in the past had been finally defeated.\n\nLawan appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to give expeditious assent to the bill when it is eventually forwarded to him.\n\nAddressing journalists on PIB after plenary, the Senate spokesman, Senator Ajibola Bashiru, said: \u201cOn the three per cent that was approved for the upstream operating expenditure, from the projection made by the NNPC GMD, who briefed us, it will amount to $502.8million for the host community development fund.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly (Senate), Omoworare, has congratulated Buhari, Lawan, and the Speaker of the House Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, on the passage of the PIB by the National Assembly.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt should be noted that the efforts by the executive and legislature in Nigeria to put in place contemporary legislative and legal framework in the oil and gas sector has proved abortive since the year 2000; also, the non-amendment of the extant framework being the Petroleum Act of 1967, has affected the inflow of foreign direct investment as well as growth in local content.\n\n\u201cBreaking this jinx and achieving this feat is a testament that the executive and the legislature can really work together and truly engage each other, without compromising party position and individual perspective, in the most positive manner with a view to actualizing the common goal and communal good for Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAlso yesterday, the House of Representatives y passed the PIB.\n\nIt considered and adopted the report on the PIB for passage during its committee of the whole session.\n\nThe adoption, followed the consideration of all the 318 clauses of the bill, presented by Chairman of the Ad-hoc Committee on the PIB, Hon. Mohammed Monguno.\n\nMoving the motion for the consideration, Monguno said by passing the bill into law, the House would have written its name in gold.\n\nThe 318 clauses of the bill were put to a voice vote by the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase and they were unanimously adopted by the lawmakers.\n\nSpeaking after the consideration of the report, the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, hailed the House for achieving the feat.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to commend the 24 wise men and the 360 members in producing this 318 sections law. In the coming week, the electoral amendment will follow suit. By the time we are done, irrespective of which side of the divide you are on, this 9th House would have done us proud and recorded on the right side of the law.\u201d\n\nBut Monguno later told reporters that contrary to what has already been reported by the media, the bill had not been passed but was considered and adopted by the committee of the whole.\n\nBut his clarification confirmed that the lawmakers may have skipped the third reading stage to pass the bill\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Petroleum Industry Bill has suffered over the years in previous assemblies. But this time around, the 9th House of Representatives decided to take the bull by the horn and passed the bill. We decided to pass it with the speed of light because of the urgency it demands. Nigeria has lost a lot in terms of direct foreign investment in our oil and gas industry, as a result of obsolete laws affecting the oil and gas industry. In abroad their oil and gas laws is in tandem with international best practices.\u201d\n\nHe added that the bill will now be scheduled for third reading and final passage and then referred to the Buhari for assent.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ndubuisi Francis in Abuja\n\nThe federal government is projecting N900 billion for fuel subsidy in an estimated N11.907 trillion budget for 2022.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, said at a public presentation of the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and Fiscal Strategy Paper (FSP) yesterday in Abuja that at least N900 billion was being projected for fuel subsidy in 2022.\n\nThe minister lamented that subsidy is exerting huge cost on the country, adding that in a particular month, N150 billion was spent on subsidising petrol.\n\nShe said: \u201cRight now, we are subsidising consumption in Nigeria. We sell at N165 per litre when our neighbours are selling at N500 per litre. It is only the marketers that are benefiting by taking this product from Nigeria and selling it across borders. The common man is not benefiting.\n\n\u201cThe transition is not an easy one if we have to remove the subsidy. What are the alternatives? What can we provide for citizens? So we are projecting if we will be paying at least N900 billion subsidy for next year.\u201d\n\nAhmed regretted that the huge amount being channelled into subsidy could have been available in the Federation Account and shared to provide education, infrastructure and lead to a reduction in government borrowing.\n\n\u201cWe will reduce our borrowing. We will increase the amounts that states and local governments are collecting. We are being penny wise, pound foolish to think that by giving this subsidy that citizens are benefitting. But at the end of the day, the citizens are actually the ones that are carrying the brunt of the wealthy.\n\n\u201cSome have two, three, four cars and they are the ones that we are subsidising. It is not helping the farmer who needs a bus from his farm to the market. But if we get rid of subsidy completely, it is not a popular view with labour,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\nThe minister listed the key parameters for the 2022 budget to include a deficit of N5.6 trillion, an oil benchmark price of $57 per barrel, an N410.15 to the dollar exchange rate and oil production of 1.88 million barrels per day.\n\nThe budget is also to be anchored on a 13 per cent inflation rate and a 2.3 per cent gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nOn the funding of the N5.6 trillion deficit, Ahmed said it would be done through borrowing from both domestic and foreign sources at 50 per cent.\n\nDebt service obligations are also projected at N3.6 trillion.\n\nAhmed stated that the draft 2022-2024 MTEF/FSP has been prepared against the backdrop of the global economic recovery amidst improved vaccination outlook and lower incidence of infection.\n\nHowever, the minister said the MTEF showed that there were continuing global challenges in the aftermath of the COVID-19.\n\nOn measures to address the increasing government overdraft from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) through the apex bank\u2019s \u2018ways and means\u2019 window, the minister stated that by next year, the government would securitise the debt owed to the bank.\n\nAccording to her, from next year, the federal government will stay within the five per cent limit provided by the CBN Act and the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA).\n\nOn the 2021 budget performance, Ahmed said a total of N973 billion had been released for capital projects as of May.\n\nReacting to a question on the rising deficit, the Minister of State for Finance, Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba, said the deficit was trending down with the increase in revenue and reduction in operating costs.\n\nHe said the federal government was conscious of growing revenue sources, especially in the non-oil sector, adding that it is pursuing diversification of its earnings from oil to non-oil.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) yesterday failed to agree on whether or not to keep crude oil output at current levels or open the taps for a further easing of production quotas by roughly two million barrels between now and December.\n\nEarlier, there were expectations that the cartel could boost production output by another 400,000 barrels beginning in August, an increase seen as likely to be easily absorbed by the market amid expectations for rising demand.\n\nIt was gathered that the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMCC) failed to come to a conclusion on the recommendations and will meet again today to iron out the rough edges.\n\nAt the inconclusive meeting, the OPEC+ ministerial committee had proposed the planned increase to the wider group, but a disagreement between Saudi Arabia and Russia, the biggest producers in the OPEC+ alliance, remained largely unresolved.\n\nLast year, following the death-blow, dealt on the oil market by the COVID-19 pandemic, OPEC+ resolved to cut output by almost 10 million bpd from May 2020, with plans to phase out the curbs by the end of April 2022.\n\nBefore the deferment of the meeting, oil prices reacted with Brent crude trading above $75 a barrel, close to a two-and-a-half-year high as the policy from August to December was being awaited.\n\nWhile the full house decided to shift a definitive decision on the matter till today, OPEC had earlier finished its meeting just before an OPEC+ ministerial committee met after that, before the inconclusive one by OPEC+ ministers.\n\nThe Joint Technical Committee (JTC) of OPEC had a day earlier stated that it expected oil demand to grow by six million bpd in 2021 but flagged risks of a glut in 2022, saying there were \u201csignificant uncertainties\u201d including an uneven global recovery and rising cases of the Delta variant of Coronavirus.\n\nSources close to the meeting said the idea of a gradual increase featured in both policy drafts put forward for the vote at the ministerial meeting, while one of the proposals suggested extending the coalition\u2019s output restraint deal until the end of 2022.\n\nRussia hinted that it viewed the current oil price of around $75 per barrel as a sign of overheating, prompting Moscow to support a further increase of production by the group, with Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Alexander Novak, saying that prices in a range of $45-$60/bbl would be optimal.\n\nOne of the factors that could shape the decision today is the status of talks between Iran and the U.S., which are seeking to revive their nuclear pact and potentially lift sanctions on the Islamic Republic\u2019s oil exports.\n\nSpeaking during one of the sessions, the Secretary-General of OPEC, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, had urged members to be watchful of the pace of the global vaccination rollout versus the speed of COVID-19 variants taking hold.\n\nHe, however, stated that OPEC still sees growth in the second half of the year.\n\nOn the supply side, Barkindo reiterated that non-OPEC liquids production in 2021 is forecast to grow by 0.8 mb/d, a drop of 0.1 mb/d from the number presented in November 2020.\n\nHe said OPEC member-countries and all Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) participants had contributed to the rebound and recovery since November last year, with overall conformity levels consistently over 100 per cent.\n\nHe added that the administering of three billion doses of vaccine against COVID-19 worldwide represents an unprecedented achievement in the history of medical science, combined with the effects of around $26 trillion in fiscal and monetary stimulus in some countries.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "On Thursday, the national assembly passed the landmark Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) \u2014 a bill that seeks to provide guidance and fiscal framework for the oil and gas industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bill has been in the works since the tenure of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who led Nigeria between 1999 and 2007.\n\nIn 2018, after the national assembly passed a harmonised version of the bill \u2014 the petroleum industry governance bill (PIGB), President Muhammadu Buhari refused assent due to \u201clegal and constitutional reasons\u201d.\n\nThe PIB contains 5 chapters, including governance and institutions, administration, host communities development, petroleum industry fiscal framework and miscellaneous provisions in 319 clauses and 8 schedules.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStakeholders believe the bill would align activities in the oil and gas sector with the global best practices and ensure the state-owned oil firm operates effectively and efficiently.\n\nDuring the session on Thursday, fierce argument ensued in the senate over the allocation of 3 percent operating expenditure of oil firms to host communities.\n\nWHERE IS THE 3% COMING FROM?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStakeholders, most especially host communities are also asking if the 3 percent will be taken from the 13 percent derivation fund.\n\nThis claim is untrue. Unlike the 13 percent of oil revenue that will go to communities through state government, the three percent stated in the PIB will come from the oil company\u2019s operating expenses (OPEX) to the trust fund created for host communities.\n\nWhile the 13 percent derivation fund comes from the federation revenue to oil-producing communities as enshrined in section 162, sub-section 2 of the Nigerian Constitution, the 3 percent will be from the expenses of oil companies operating in the communities.\n\nAccording to the bill, the trust would enhance peace and cordial relationship between licensees and lessees and the communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPIB proposes its establishment within 12 months after the commencement date for new or existing oil mining leases.\n\nHere are other highlights of the newly newly passed bill.\n\nHOST COMMUNITY SHARE STILL A CONTEMPLATION\n\nIn the house of representatives\u2019 version, the bill provides for a settlor (operator) to make an annual contribution to the host community development trust fund of an amount equal to 5 percent of its actual yearly operating expenditure of the preceding financial year in the upstream and in the midstream and downstream in respect of all petroleum operations affecting the host communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe senate, however, proposes 3 percent to the host community.\n\nThis is lower than the 10 percent allocation agitated for by the host communities at a recent public hearing.\n\n30 PERCENT FROM NNPC REVENUE FOR OIL EXPLORATION IN FRONTIER BASINS\n\nThe senate committee recommended that 30 percent of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) profit from oil and gas should be used to fund the exploration of frontier basins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the bill, the house allocates 10 percent of rents on petroleum prospecting licences and 10 percent rent on petroleum mining leases to the frontier exploration fund.\n\nIt also allocates 30 percent of NNPC Limited\u2019s profit oil and profit in the production sharing, profit sharing and risk service contracts for the exploration fund.\n\nThe fund would be transferred to a frontier exploration fund escrow account dedicated for the exploration and development activities in the frontier acreages.\n\nVANDALISM, CIVIL UNREST NOW THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HOST COMMUNITIES\n\nAccording to the bill, the host community will now pay the cost for any act of pipeline vandalism and civil unrest in their domain. The cost of such is to be removed from the host community development fund.\n\nThe two chambers added a clause that \u201cprovided the interruption is not caused by technical or natural cause\u201d.\n\nTHE ESTABLISHMENT OF NNPC LIMITED\n\nThe bill established Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC Limited) to be incorporated under the Companies and Allied Matters Act.\n\nThe bill still vested ownership of all shares in the government, held by the ministry of finance. The offering of any shares of the company will be considered and approved by the federal executive council and the national council.\n\nThe senate opined that the \u201cgovernment may from time to time resort to NNPC Limited for strategic national security interventions, especially where the private commercial entities decided to withdraw from such operations due to unprofitable economics\u201d.\n\nThe lawmakers, however, said the reason is for government to ensure adequate supply and distribution of petroleum motor spirit (PMS) for a period not exceeding six months.\n\n\u201cAll associated costs shall be for the account of the federation,\u201d the national assembly stated.\n\nNEXT LINE OF ACTION\n\nWith the passage of the PIB by both chambers of the national assembly, it is expected that a joint committee would be constituted to harmonise adjustments in the bill and transmit it to the president for assent.",

          "title": "TeamApt closes undisclosed Series B round to extend its banking services across Africa",
          "text": "Nigeria-based TeamApt, which offers agent banking services with plans to roll out consumer-focused digital banking features, has raised an undisclosed sum in a Series B round.\n\nIn a statement, co-founder and CEO Tosin Eniolorunda said the funding \u201callows us to extend our solutions to other parts of Africa.\u201d The company currently operates only in Nigeria but has its sights set on breaking ground in a francophone African country later this year.\n\nOfficially undisclosed \u201cfor business reasons\u201d according to a TeamApt representative in an email, Eniolorunda had indicated in June that it was \u201ca couple of tens of millions of dollars\u201d in size. Two people familiar with the company\u2019s fundraising process confirmed it is at least $20 million.\n\nNovastar Ventures, the Kenya-based firm, led the round with the participation of Global Ventures (a firm in the United Arab Emirates), CDC Group (the UK\u2019s development finance institution), Soma Capital, Kepple Africa Ventures and Oui Capital.\n\nDutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO also got in on the action with a $2 million punt, according to TechCrunch.\n\nTosin Eniolofunda, CEO TeamApt.\n\nThis recent funding announcement follows TeamApt\u2019s $5.5m Series A round closed in 2019 led by Quantum Capital Partners, a Lagos-based investment firm owned by Jim Ovia, the founder of Zenith Bank.\n\nThough under the radar for much of its six year existence, TeamApt boasts numbers that would place it among Nigeria\u2019s most active and best performing financial technology startups.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s pivotal business at the moment is Moniepoint, a software solution that powers agent banking in Nigeria. The company says that it processed $3.5bn in May and is the leading agent banking platform on volume of transactions, citing an April report from the Shared Agent Network Expansion Facility (SANEF) \u2013 the body authorised by the Central Bank of Nigeria to oversee agent banking in Nigeria.\n\nSANEF\u2019s reports are not public and it is not clear which other companies are captured in it. But the agent banking space is thought to include Firstmonie, Paga and OPay, the Opera-backed fintech.\n\nIn March 2021, TeamApt said it processed over \u20a61trillion ($2.4 bn) for the first time. The $3.5 bn processed in May was from a base of 68 million transactions. Underlying these transactions is a network of agents numbering about 100,000 across Nigeria\u2019s 36 states.\n\nIn the twelve months ended April 2021, the company said it had processed a total of $16bn across its platforms which includes Monnify, a service that provides virtual accounts to fintechs and other service providers to facilitate instant notification of bank transactions.\n\nBut the majority of the company\u2019s operations (and revenue) is from Moniepoint, forming the basis for plans to evolve the platform into the consumer digital banking space. While Moniepoint will continue to power agent banking, TeamApt plans to build a consumer app side of it for individuals as a digital bank.\n\nBesides geographical expansion and a product launch, what else does TeamApt have up its sleeves?\n\nLast week, the company\u2019s founders were announced as the newest members of the Endeavor Nigeria network, which means they qualified to receive investment from the network\u2019s Catalyst Fund (There\u2019s precedent: Endeavor\u2019s investment in Flutterwave\u2018s Series B in January 2020).\n\nPlans for more funding are already underway.\n\nA TeamApt representative said \u201ca series C conversation is ongoing [and] should be completed in the coming months and we\u2019ll be happy to announce at that time.\u201d\n\nEniolorunda, the CEO, anticipates that they could soon rise to become a billion-dollar startup. \u201cWe expect the company to reach unicorn-type valuations soon,\u201d he told TechCabal in June.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "title": "Faith Keza is leading Irembo to fully digitise Rwanda",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were living in Rwanda today and needed to get a government-issued certificate, you can simply fill out some forms and make your payment \u2013 all online. Your certificate will be sent to your inbox when ready.\n\nIrembo is leading this digitisation of services in Rwanda. And steering the Irembo ship is Faith Keza.\n\nIt\u2019s 2 pm in Lagos when we sit to talk over Google Meet. Due to scheduling conflicts, our conversation had been delayed for some weeks but I was excited to be speaking with her.\n\nAfter getting her degree from MIT, she worked at Oracle, Delphix, Google and is now the CEO of Irembo. Faith is also on the board of the Rwanda National Bank and the Rwanda Development Board.\n\nSo how is she able to do all this? In an interview with UNICEF, she gives a very poignant response.\n\n\u201cThe word is grit,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you can persevere day in and day out, the days will be long but the years will be short and you\u2019ll get to somewhere exciting.\u201d\n\nFrom growing up in Rwanda to moving to the US for her university degree, her journey has been one of grit, excellence and a dedication to impacting the lives of people.\n\nHer name is Faith Keza and this is her life in tech.\n\nFor the love of math\n\nFaith Keza\u2019s mother was born away from home in Uganda and lived there until Faith was born. After the genocide in 1994, the family made their way back to Rwanda to start over.\n\nFaith was only about 3 years old at the time and she tells me she doesn\u2019t remember a lot from that time.\n\n\u201cI just have a memory of living with all my cousins in one house. And at that point, a lot of families used to live together because they were all moving. So as a kid, that was fun but I guess for the adults it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFaith started school in Rwanda and quickly discovered she loved mathematics. She liked the logic of it all. There were rules to follow and they could be replicated.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to high school, my passion for maths grew stronger. I really enjoyed it. Even in my free time, I would take on further maths.\u201d\n\nAnd while she enjoyed maths, she dreaded subjects like biology where the rule was to memorise scientific names and characteristics. No logic, just retention.\n\nAs she rounded up her O-levels, a scholarship opportunity presented itself. A Scottish billionaire had visited Rwanda around that time and had liked the country so much that he decided he wanted to sponsor one child to attend a royal school in the North of Scotland; a school his children attended.\n\nTests were done to determine the top students in the country and in the end, Faith Keza and another student were on their way to Scotland to start a new life and see the world through different lenses.\n\nWhile in the UK, at the end of her A-levels, Faith had to choose five schools to apply to. Following advice from her counsellor, she decided against applying to top schools like Oxford or Cambridge due to their low acceptance rates and in a bid not to \u201cwaste two of her chances.\u201d\n\nHer mother was not having any of that.\n\n\u201cWhen my mom heard about it she said \u2018No, Faith, you have to go to a top tier school\u2019\u201d\n\nBut applications to schools in the UK were closed at this time and Faith let her mother know that much. This was not a deterrent.\n\n\u201cAmerica is open. You should apply to America,\u201d her mother said to her.\n\nWhen Faith tells me about this encounter, she reveals that she did apply to America but at the time it was something she had done only to make her mother happy.\n\nThe letters followed soon. Brown had waitlisted her. But MIT\u2019s letter was a glowing acceptance. She was going to Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nIf you love maths let it go\u2026\n\nWhen I ask Faith about memories linked to MIT. She tells me she doesn\u2019t have great memories.\n\n\u201cEven today, I have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,\u201d she laughs \u201cI think a lot of people [from MIT] have it to some varying degree.\u201d\n\nMIT has a reputation. The school\u2019s acceptance rate is 6.7%, which is typical of most top schools. But it is also the alma mater to many great minds including the famous astronaut Buzz Aldrin and former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan.\n\nThis means that MIT students get into the university with a lot to prove. In the middle of studying, there is also the debilitating imposter syndrome that is often commonplace.\n\n\u201cBecause wherever you come from, you\u2019re used to being the best at something. You get there and you\u2019re really competing with kids who have done insane things and some of them are actual geniuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it was very hard to suddenly have to know how to study because most of the time [in high school] I would sit in class and get what was going on. Realising this, that was when the all-nighters and coffee addiction really began. So no, I don\u2019t have great memories.\u201d\n\nAfter a semester at MIT, Faith realized her maths major wasn\u2019t for her.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something more practical so I asked what was the other biggest major that everyone was excited about? And at that point, I think 50% of the class of MIT was computer scientists.\u201d\n\nSo computer science it was.\n\nIt starts at Oracle in the USA and ends at Irembo in Rwanda\n\nFaith\u2019s first job out of the university was as a software engineer with the tech giant, Oracle. Here she learnt real-world applications of a lot of the coding she had been doing at MIT.\n\nAfter two years at Oracle, she wanted a taste of the startup life and took up a software engineering role at Delphix. It was at Delphix that Faith started toying with the idea of returning to Africa. She had briefly considered moving to Nigeria where her partner Obinna Ukwuani was living at the time. They had both met in college.\n\nShe took a job at Google that was supposed to bring her back to an African country. But a lot of plans were stalled and so Faith decided to return on her own to Rwanda and while there, she joined Irembo as CTO.\n\nHer task was simple \u2013 Irembo was getting software from a third party and the prices were getting too high. They needed in-house software development. Faith was on the job.\n\n\u201cSo what we have been doing for the past five years is working with the government of Rwanda to digitise all their services.\u201d\n\nIn building these solutions, there have been some uphill tasks. An experience that stands out for Faith was during the process of digitising certificates, many people questioned the security of the online method. This was a teachable moment for her. She learnt that it was necessary to carry everyone along \u2013 explain things to them, learn their concerns, just make sure everyone feels heard and is involved.\n\nSitting on boards and looking to the future\n\nFaith loves audiobooks because \u201cyou can listen to them while you do other things.\u201d And with a life as busy as hers, who can blame her for multi-tasking. In 2018 and 2019, she was nominated to be on the boards of the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) and the Rwanda Development Board (RDB).\n\nOn these boards, she does a lot of things including consulting on the state of tech in the country and how the country can work towards their digital goals.\n\nBased on her hobbies, it\u2019s likely that Faith is looking forward to spending more time reading, making recipes from the internet, or watching Netflix \u2013 after they put out some new shows because she insists she has watched all the good ones.\n\nAnd now, as CEO of Irembo, the goal is to expand. With the largest growing youth population in the world, a digitised Africa will be a sight to behold.\n\nWith Faith Keza, Irembo could be at the front of that movement.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Branch\u2019s ambitious '20% investment' challenge to Nigerian banks",
          "text": "When Branch launched in Nigeria in 2017, it was a single product company with a money lending license to offer loans to individuals. Loans start from as low as \u20a61,000 (~$2) and increase gradually up to \u20a6500,000 (~$1,200) as the borrower repays.\n\nFour years, \u20a640 billion (~$97 million) and three million loans later, the business is evolving.\n\nThe company which also operates in Kenya, Tanzania and India acquired a Nigerian microfinance bank license this year. In doing so, Branch has joined the growing number of Nigerian fintechs maturing into digital banks after some years in the lending app nursery. Carbon and Fairmoney are in this class too.\n\nBranch\u2019s mobile app (available only for Android) now includes a wallet that offers users unlimited money transfers and commission-free bill payments, in addition to instant loans (it is quite instant; I have tried it more than once between April and now) that are collateral-free.\n\nBut the Branch feature that catches the eye is the \u201cInvest\u201d tab. Clicking the button, users are invited to \u201cEarn 20% per annum by investing with Branch.\u201d\n\nFor example, a user who keeps \u20a61 million in this product for a whole year receives \u20a6200,000 at the minimum. Returns are paid every Monday and if left in the Branch wallet, compound for the next payment.\n\n20%?! How are they able to offer that?\n\nYou are not alone in asking. It was the first question Dayo Ademola, Branch Nigeria\u2019s managing director, faced on CNBC in May. It was the main curiosity as well on a Zoom call with journalists earlier this month.\n\nAccording to a June 18, 2021 Central Bank of Nigeria fact sheet, Heritage Bank offers 13.88% on fixed deposits, the highest of any Nigerian deposit money bank. But that\u2019s an outlier; Access Bank\u2019s 7.28% is about the average rate.\n\nZenith Bank\u2019s 3.94%, though one of the lowest, is better than what Stanbic IBTC, Standard Chartered and First Bank all offer. So how is Branch, a startup, able to go so high on retail investments?\n\nInvestor capital, low costs\n\nTo assure customers that their funds are safe, Ademola explained that Branch\u2019s finance money license from the CBN permits them to offer fund management services and they \u201conly invest customer funds in principal securities and low-risk securities.\u201d\n\nShe does not specify what these securities are. Low-risk securities could be government treasury bills. But since practically every other bank makes the same claim and that the yield on instruments like treasury bills are stifled by inflation, Branch\u2019s extra margin has to come from elsewhere.\n\nSo, on CNBC as with the call with journalists, Ademola offered two reasons why Branch can afford its promise: investor capital and a profitable, lean business operation.\n\n\u201cOur investors have effectively taken a long view of our business in Nigeria,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nDayo Ademola, managing director of Branch Nigeria.\n\nBy this she points to the fact that Branch, which is a San Francisco-based company, has been funded by, among others, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of the biggest Silicon Valley venture capital investment firms and early Facebook investor.\n\nBoth organisations participated in Branch\u2019s two big funding rounds \u2013 a $170 million Series C round in April 2019 and a $70 million Series B a year earlier, attracted by Branch\u2019s branding as a \u201c$2 loan\u201d service for emerging markets. $50 million of that 2018 raise was a debt facility from a firm that focuses on alternative credit.\n\nVISA is also an investor in Branch and has driven their Nigeria expansion. But beyond leaning on investor capital, Ademola said Branch is able to depend on its balance sheet from lending to support other ambitions. \u201cOur lending business is profitable here.\u201d\n\nThis profitability, she explains, has been possible because of the lowered cost of not having to operate physical bank branches across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe operate on a lower cost structure than your typical commercial bank and are able to pass some of these savings on to our customers,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nBetter than your bank?\n\nBranch Nigeria\u2019s pitch, then, is that it is \u201cbetter than your bank.\u201d\n\nDigital banks tend to tease variations of this tagline \u2013 Kuda, for example, is the \u201cbank of the free.\u201d But as Ademola said, no other Nigerian fintech startup offers a 20% annual return on investment products.\n\nCarbon offers a number of options that offer between 9 and 11% earnings. There is not yet an investment product on Fairmoney.\n\nInvestment offerings on digital platforms Branch and Carbon. Source: Screenshots from both companies\u2019 mobile apps.\n\nBecause I have borrowed easily on Branch, there is an appeal to adventure along on their bold investment claim. But it may be necessary to approach promises of high-returns with a sense of caution.\n\n\u201cFintechs don\u2019t have cheap sources of deposits in the form of current and savings accounts (CASA), hence they may try to attract customers with high-reward, yet possibly high-risk deposit products,\u201d Adedayo Bakare, an investment analyst, tells me.\n\nWhile a 20% return is an enticing high reward, it also signals the high-risk nature of the models fintechs have to adopt in order to beat banks. \u201cHigher risk is also why they charge borrowers high rates on loans. Because it is not backed by collateral,\u201d Bakare adds.\n\nIndeed, Branch\u2019s microloans charge a 20% interest. A \u20a62,000 (~$5) loan for one month, for example, will be paid back with \u20a62,400 \u2013 a 20% interest rate. By contrast, Guaranty Trust Bank is able to lend to its customers at a 1.5% monthly rate.\n\nAnd how about investor capital as a pillar? Bakare is skeptical: \u201cIf you look at the structure of funding for banks, investor capital is not even up to 30% of funding in many cases.\u201d\n\nReaching every smartphone\n\nBranch doesn\u2019t have audited accounts in the public domain showing their non-performing loan (NPL) ratio and capital adequacy ratio (CAR).\n\nBoth numbers would give a clearer picture of the returns on their three million loans. Going by its profitability and investor capital, it would appear both metrics are in good health.\n\nIt will then be intriguing to see customer reaction to the newly launched investment offer. Nigerians have fallen for ponzi schemes at an alarming rate that suggests legitimate platforms offering high-reward returns can find an audience.\n\nAdemola, who became Branch\u2019s MD for Nigeria in March, is confident of being the country\u2019s go-to platform, extending financial access wherever a smartphone receives an internet signal.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In a fashion typical of African governments, authorities in the Kingdom of Eswatini have ordered network providers in the country to cut off access to the internet as a nationwide protest continues to rock the small southern African kingdom.\n\nDemonstrations demanding reforms to the country\u2019s absolute monarchy started during the weekend and things turned violent overnight on Tuesday as security forces fired gunshots and tear gas to disperse protesters, multiple reports show.\n\nActivists in the country are demanding democratic reforms and the lifting of bans on all opposition parties. They have said they will intensify demonstrations against the government, which have been on for four consecutive days now.\n\nVideos of people burning tires, throwing stones at cars, and barricading streets in cities like Manzini and Matsapha have also been circulating on social media.\n\nProtestors block roads in Manzini, King Mswati\u2019s Government blocks internet to control situation. pic.twitter.com/Pk9ao9duio \u2014 Swazi News (@SwaziNews) June 29, 2021\n\nEswatini protestors now operating at night burning businesses linked to King Mswati and Government properties.

Banks have also closed up until the unrest subsides.\n\nGovernment has further suspended schools & introduced a 6pm-5am curfew with immediate effect. Acting Prime Minister: \u201cAll offices should be closed by 3:30pm to allow workers to get home safely while essential workers will be required to produce a permit when travelling at night.\u201d \u2014 Eswatini Government (@EswatiniGovern1) June 29, 2021\n\nAnd in addition to these, the government has blocked the internet, according to several reports.\n\nESWATINI GOVT orders major network providers to cut internet connection, closes schools, imposes 6pm-5am curfew as protests continue. pic.twitter.com/wtMIEzte6u \u2014 Nation Breaking News (@NationBreaking) June 29, 2021\n\nOver the past few years, Africa has been plagued by social media and internet shutdowns in the run-up to elections and in response to protests or dissent.\n\nBetween January 2020 and February 2021, internet and social media blackouts were imposed in Uganda, Chad, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. Nigeria restricted access to Twitter on June 4, albeit under different circumstances.\n\nInternet blocks on the continent prevent access to social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp. In what is a worrying trend, local activists and international observers note that these blocks curtail the democratic right of freedom of speech and expression.\n\nAnger against Africa\u2019s last absolute monarch\n\nA former British protectorate, Eswatini is Africa\u2019s last absolute monarchy and one of the few remaining in the world. King Mswati III has ruled by decree for more than three decades, with unfettered political power over his 1 million people.\n\nThe royal family has come under fire for their lavish spending while most inhabitants, who are subsistence farmers, live below the poverty line. Crowned in 1986 when he was just 18, the king currently has 15 wives who occupy several state-funded palaces.\n\nThe small landlocked country changed its name from Swaziland in 2018, a move that was seen as a step towards democracy. However, King Mswati III has reportedly been running a repressive government, with several reported cases of human rights abuse, and consistently evaded years-long calls for meaningful democratic reforms.\n\nDespite anger towards Mswati over the years, demonstrations have not been commonplace in Eswatini. This is because the kingdom has continually stifled dissent and protests, as well as banned political parties from participating in parliamentary elections since 1973. Still, the 53-year-old monarch has denied being an autocrat.\n\nSeveral opposition leaders and activists were arrested in 2019, the same year when civil servants in the country went on several strike actions, accusing the monarch of draining public coffers at the expense of his subjects.\n\nThe series of crackdowns has done little to discourage anti-monarchy sentiment among the people as they continue to demand a democratic government that will serve their interests. This culminated in the ongoing anti-monarchy demonstrations in many parts of the country.\n\nAmid the protests, reports say the king has fled to neighbouring South Africa although Eswatini\u2019s acting Prime Minister, Themba Masuku, denied the claims on Tuesday. It\u2019s unclear at the moment what the situation is in the country but the internet shutdown is only likely to worsen the crisis.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article? Please fill out this survey.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "There\u2019s no such thing as a bad investment \u2013 TEN13\u2019s Stewart Glynn talks startup funding",
          "text": "As the pace of innovation in the African tech ecosystem ramps up, more attention would be given \u2014 and for a good reason \u2014 to the brave founders and innovators building Africa\u2019s future. However, angel investors and venture capitalists are a similarly courageous group of individuals who are seldom celebrated.\n\nTwice a month, we speak with an angel investor or venture capitalist backing Africa\u2019s innovators to draw insights from them. For this week\u2019s edition, I talked to Stewart Glynn, a Partner at TEN13, an Australian venture capital firm.\n\nGlynn grew up in Harare, Zimbabwe\u2019s capital and most populous city, in an entrepreneurial family. When it was time for university, he went to Australia to gain a degree in business, banking, and finance at the Queensland University of Technology.\n\nAfter that, he worked with General Electric and KPMG. During this time, he did a lot of work around helping businesses develop sustainable structures and mergers and acquisitions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis time in the corporate sector exposed him to technology and its disruptive effects in various industries. He was approached by Steve Baxter, \u2018Shark\u2019 on Shark Tank, and an Australian serial entrepreneur who founded SENet and Pipe Networks, which was acquired for about $400 million.\n\nBaxter had started investing in technology startups through his family\u2019s office, Transition Level Investments, but wanted to do more and so he tapped Glynn. Together, they invested in about 40 ventures around the world.\n\nIn December 2019, after wondering how to institutionalise their investments, Baxter and Glynn decided to start TEN13. Having seen the value that Baxter could bring with his experience as a founder, they chose to do things differently.\n\nRather than raise a seed fund, TEN13 has a network of over 200 entrepreneurs and corporate executives who supply more than funds to the startups that they invest in. These investors provide the companies with an extensive network and advice as they navigate their startup journeys. Investments at TEN13 are made on a deal by deal basis.\n\nSince its launch in the last 18 months, TEN13 has deployed about $20 million in 13 startups, including Australian edtech unicorn, Go1; fintech startup, ImaliPay; and Africa- focused fintech unicorn, Chipper Cash.\n\nAccording to Glynn, the idea is to get behind visionary founders at the earliest stage and provide them with the resources to take their companies to the next level. The average ticket size is between $250,000 and $1 million, with the possibility of more investment further down the road.\n\nOn bad investments and common mistakes founders make\n\nFor now, Glynn explains that the goal is to fund ten companies every year. An arduous task, as he claims they get about 70 to 80 startups looking for funding monthly. When I asked if there were any deals they had missed out on that hurt, he explained it is the norm in venture capital.\n\n\u201cIn our game, it\u2019s really about having a framework for decision making because as early-stage investors, you\u2019re making decisions with limited data. As an investor, you want to see a lot of companies in the anti-portfolio because that means you are seeing the right deals,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn investor\u2019s anti-portfolio are the deals which they pursued but did not invest in, either of their own volition or because other investors shut them out.\n\nAccording to research, nine out of 10 startups fail. Knowing this, I asked Glynn how TEN13 deals with investments that do not go according to plan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s such a thing as a bad investment. We understand that while the companies we back have a high potential for success, there\u2019re a lot of reasons why startups fail. When we invest in startups, we provide support for the founders to ensure that the startups have a good chance of success,\u201d he says.\n\nMost founders have grand plans to take on the world at the early stage, but without previous startup experience, they are likely to make mistakes. Glynn advises that this is the point when they need to narrow their focus and not spread themselves too thin \u2014 something they make sure these startups know.\n\nInstead, he advises that they identify one thing that would put them on the right path and focus on doing it for the next three to six months.\n\nHow to reach TEN13\n\nFor founders looking to get TEN13 on board as investors, he recommends that they reach out via email [email protected] or LinkedIn. He stresses that they are sector-agnostic and back founders who are building products for a global market. With a renewed focus on emerging markets, he recommends that founders in these markets building remarkable products should reach out to him.",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nGlobal tech giants commit to keeping women safe online\n\nMTN Uganda partners with TIP\n\nKenya plans to increase the cost of airtime and data\n\nGlobal tech giants to keep women and girls safe\n\nWhat happened? The United Nations announced yesterday, July 1, 2020, at its Generation Equality Forum in Paris, the public commitment of the world\u2019s largest tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Google, TikTok, and Twitter \u2014 to make their platforms safer for women.\n\nThe public commitment is to address online abuse against women and promote gender equality by introducing new systems or upgrading existing ones to make reporting abuse more effortless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, the World Wide Web Foundation began the initiative more than a year ago to bring stakeholders together to solve the challenge.\n\nAccording to Eve Kraicer, Policy Officer, Gender and Data Rights at the World Wide Web Foundation, during the period, the Foundation brought together 120 experts from tech companies, civil societies, academia, and governments from 35 countries to co-create solutions and prototypes to combat online abuse.\n\nThe Foundation will track the companies based on their commitments and receive annual progress reports.\n\nBut the world interacts with the Internet differently, right? Well, Kraicer assured that the solutions developed will consider how women in various parts of the world engage with the Internet.\n\nFor context, read here.\n\nMTN Uganda partners with TIP to build 5G Technology\n\nMTN Uganda has partnered with members under the Telecom Infra Project (TIP), an engineering-focused community, to automate its network preparation for 5G technology.\n\nWhy the partnership? MTN Uganda will use TIP\u2019s Disaggregated Cell Site Gateway (DCSG) technology to build network capabilities at 2,500 locations across Uganda. Because of this, MTN\u2019s network will be able to transition to 5G effortlessly.\n\nAccording to Al Monzer, MTN Uganda\u2019s Chief Technical Officer (CTO), the DCSG technology provides a faster transport network for all telecommunication traffic across networks, including phone calls, data, messages, mobile money, and digital services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat exactly does this mean? The CTO claims that DCSG technology could allow you to connect a phone call in a few milliseconds and allow cost-effective and efficient running of a far larger automated end-to-end network.\n\nAfrica\u2019s first? Uganda would reportedly be the first African country to implement this technology. In Europe and North America, the DCSG technology has been in use for quite some time.\n\nRemember that, in 2019, MTN Uganda began a new initiative committed to developing 5G technology as part of an ongoing transformation across its operations.\n\nSimilar? The Nigerian Senate, in May 2021, approved plans for 5G deployment in the country despite controversies surrounding it.\n\nTelecom service provider, Aviat Network, will manage the deployment of Disaggregated Cell Site Gateway technology in Uganda through Network Operating Software.\n\nKenya plans to increase the cost of airtime and data\n\nThe Kenyan Parliamentary Committee has proposed additional taxes that will increase the cost of airtime and Internet data services.\n\nThe National Assembly\u2019s Finance and National Planning Committee plans to have the taxman raid Internet service providers and mobile phone firms for additional taxes, according to modifications to the Finance Bill 2021, which has been sent to the Legislative Council for approval.\n\nWhat does this mean for Kenyans? Kenyans should brace themselves for an increase in Internet fees in the coming days if the Committee approves the proposal. By making this change, the tax on phone and Internet data service fees would go up from 15% to 20%.\n\nWhy? Lately, there are more people online in Kenya than ever before. Taxing Kenyans will reportedly generate short-term revenue for the government, which is having trouble coming up with ways to pay more than $33 billion in debt (Sh3.6 trillion).\n\nWhat\u2019s surprising is how the Parliament reduced betting excise taxes from 20% to 7.5% of the amount staked or wagered on gaming after proposing to increase taxes on Internet services.\n\nI believe that data is a lucrative cash cow for tax collectors because it enables them to collect large sums of money through various government services, including driver\u2019s licences, resulting in the cost of airtime.\n\nSimilar? 51 African countries have excise on airtime charges. In 2020, Nigeria increased voice and SMS tariffs, with the implementation of Value Added Tax (VAT), from 5% to 7.5%.\n\nWill the Committee pass the bill into law? Just like Nigeria passed the VAT bill into law, I think Kenya will do the same. What do you think?\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nGoogle sold $2.5 Million in AI to the Pentagon for its Covid-19 Recovery. Read.\n\nTwitter considers letting you limit tweets to \u2018trusted friends\u2019. Read.\n\n5 Major Reasons Religion Is the No.1 Cause of Poverty in Africa.

          "title": "BusinessDay @ 20: Going strong like the way we started",
          "text": "BusinessDay is 20 years old today. This newspaper, which is now the primus inter pares, announced its entry into the global financial journalism space exactly 20 years ago today.\n\nWith a strong ambition to change the economy, financial, business and industry narratives in Nigeria and the West African sub-region for the better, a carefully constituted five-member board comprising Pat Utomi as chairman, Frank Aigbogun (publisher/CEO), Alhaji Ibrahim Ida and Abiola Otaniyi as members, and Akinniyi Sowumi as the pioneer editor, BusinessDay on July 1, 2001, started a journey that today has made it the premium source of business and financial news and market intelligence for local and foreign investors across West Africa.\n\nOver that 20-year period, the publication has continued to seek to deliver the promise it set out at the start, as articulated by the pioneer chairman, Pat Utomi.\n\nRead Also: BusinessDay, NSE hold Nigerian Investor Value Awards today\n\nOn the front page of that historical publication, which we have reproduced the cover in this edition, Utomi wrote: \u201cAll great societies, as all outstanding enterprises, are the end result of a great idea. Ideas do not grow in the void. Often they come from bringing the intellect into the path of the flow of quality information, news, analysis and hard statistical data that BusinessDay promises to deliver.\u201d\n\nIn this 20th year, we are proud of the history we created and are part of as we have not only chronicled the very best of business stories in the period but shaped policies, shared insights, and converged the best global thought leaders in our conferences. Though coming out of the most disruptive economic and technology shifts in human history following Covid-19, we are as excited about the future that we see as we are so proud of the past that birthed us.\n\nAs we celebrate 20 years of impact journalism in Nigeria, many things have changed, while many things remain the way they were. Perhaps nothing symbolizes that the Nigerian economy has not changed in dramatic ways like the stories we carried in our first edition. Indeed, the first headline was \u201cGoods inspection cripples Benin Republic\u201d, written by Seidi Mulero. The story focused on the impact of the full inspection policy that covered land, sea and air on the level of patronage of ports in Benin Republic, a story that we believe will resonate with those that believe, even 20 years after, that Nigeria continues to fail to find a workable solution to the single West African market.\n\nAlso in the same edition, the central feature was on \u201cFaces of (Nigeria\u2019s) battered currency\u201d, showing that the story of the naira\u2019s weakness did not start in the last six years. Twenty years ago, though oil prices were rising, the country grappled with severe balance of payment problems, epitomized by the staggering over $30 billion debt.\n\nOther stories in the first edition were no less symptomatic of the way we have covered business since. Oluwole Elisha wrote \u201cBanks reject foreign exchange requests\u201d, exposing how banks rejected requests for foreign exchange from their customers as a demand management approach by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) through the banks.\n\nAnother banking-related story in the first edition was the declaration of N1.25 billion profit by the then Intercontinental Bank Plc headed by Erastus Akingbola. The story was written by Remi Njoku. Intercontinental Bank ran into trouble in 2009 after a special audit of the commercial banks in Nigeria by the Central Bank (CBN) listed it among nine banks found to be under-capitalized and badly managed. Intercontinental Bank was later taken over by Access Bank in 2013.\n\nAbba Kyari, the late Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, was celebrated in BusinessDay\u2019s maiden edition as that day coincided with his return to the United Bank for Africa (UBA) as vice chairman. The appointment came shortly after he retired as the managing director and chief executive of the same bank.\n\nThe strong presence of indigenous Nigerian banks on the African continent owes its success to the policy implemented in early 2000\u2019s which was the focus of the maiden edition of this newspaper. Writing for the Finance Beat with the headline \u201cBanks go for strong hands\u201d, Remi Njoku reported how banks had shifted attention to quality-oriented and well-trained staff in a bid to raise their standard to global standard.\n\nOther epic stories in the maiden edition focused on the different sectors and players in the Nigerian economy and the global developments as at that time.\n\n\u201cIs Coke losing flavour?\u201d was another important story that featured in BusinessDay\u2019s maiden publication. It was written by Anthony Osae-Brown, who later rose through the ranks to become the editor of the newspaper.\n\nThe maiden publication also featured Virgin Atlantic\u2019s maiden flight into Nigeria. Headlined \u201cA flight of Virgin\u201d, the story written by John Osadolor, now the deputy editor and head of BusinessDay\u2019s Abuja office, projected that Virgin Atlantic would challenge British Airways on the Lagos-London route with lower fares.\n\nThere was a photograph of Musiliu Smith, the then Inspector General of Police, and Gaius Obaseki, who was then the group managing director of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), conferring with each other. Undoubtedly, the two institutions headed by both men, then and now, remain very sensitive in Nigeria.\n\nBusinessDay also reported that \u201cNNPC reviews cash call payment\u201d in the maiden edition. \u201cThis move, it was learnt, is the apex oil industry authority\u2019s plan to reduce delay in payment of cash calls and avoid losses to government,\u201d the report said.\n\nAs a follow-up, BusinessDay also carried a story on why the country\u2019s oil and gas sector had not witnessed much progress. It was an interview with Chamberlin Oyibo conducted by Olusola Bello. Oyibo, in the interview titled \u201cGovernment interests derail oil industry\u201d, identified government running of oil and gas business as against providing policy guidance as the bane of the nation\u2019s oil and gas development.\n\nFrom first edition also, BusinessDay\u2019s Africa ambitions were clear. There was a section on Africa where the newspaper asked the question: \u201cWho speaks for Africa?\u201d A lot has since changed positively for the African continent with the elections of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, an Ethiopian, as director-general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), and Ngozi-Okonjo Iweala, a Nigerian, as director-general of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), who are currently projecting the image of Africa on the global scene.\n\nMany things have also changed within. BusinessDay has since migrated from a then weekly publication to a daily publication, and today it is accessible through print, online, and mobile. And we have led some of those changes.\n\nBusinessDay has always sought to provide contexts and empower you, our reader, with the information required to make your business decisions.",
          "summary": "As we celebrate 20 years of impact journalism in Nigeria, many things have changed, while many things remain the way they were.\nThe strong presence of indigenous Nigerian banks on the African continent owes its success to the policy implemented in early 2000\u2019s which was the focus of the maiden edition of this newspaper.\n\u201cIs Coke losing flavour?\u201d was another important story that featured in BusinessDay\u2019s maiden publication.\nThe maiden publication also featured Virgin Atlantic\u2019s maiden flight into Nigeria.\nBusinessDay also reported that \u201cNNPC reviews cash call payment\u201d in the maiden edition.",

          "title": "Nigeria struggles with poverty that private sector can fix",
          "text": "Between 1958 and 1962, an estimated 40 million people starved to death in China as a result of the largest socialist experiment in history.\n\nMao Zedong, who was the leader of China, had called this experiment the \u201cGreat Leap Forward,\u201d which was aimed at rapidly transforming the economy from agrarian to industrial, but for China it was a disaster. What was supposed to create wealth for the people had impoverished them like never before.\n\nPrivate farming was abolished and rural farmers were forced to work on collective farms where all production, resource allocation, and food distribution was centrally controlled by the Communist Party.\n\nThe Great Leap Forward was officially halted in January 1961 after three brutal years of death and destruction.\n\nRead Also: How China, India, Vietnam lifted millions out of poverty\n\nThe outcome of the experiment was predictable, because it matched the pattern of events unfolding in the \u201cterror famine\u201d of Ukraine in 1932, and in the Soviet Union in 1933, events that exposed the shortcomings of socialism and the government\u2019s omnipotent grip over an economy.\n\nChina had a rebirth after Deng Xiaoping rose to power in China and implemented a series of far-reaching market-economy reforms that fostered private ownership of property, boosted economic growth, created jobs and reduced poverty.\n\nBy 1983, the process of de-collectivising Chinese agriculture was almost complete. Mao\u2019s great socialist experiment, which had cost so many millions of lives, was over.\n\nInitially, the growth in private ownership across China was driven by increasing numbers of small-scale entrepreneurs setting up businesses, which were only allowed to employ a maximum of seven people. The increasing erosion of this socialist system that exclusively permitted public ownership under the management of a state-run economic planning authority was accelerated by the creation of Special Economic Areas.\n\nChina has been the better for its encouragement of private enterprise. Poverty has reduced from nearly 90 percent in 1980 to under 2 percent, according to latest World Bank figures, lifting over 800 million out of poverty in the process.\n\nRead Also: Buhari\u2019s denialism will compound the poverty crisis\n\nThe lesson here for a country like Nigeria, which is grappling with high levels of poverty, is that creating an enabling environment for the private sector to thrive while reducing the role of government in the economy may be the best way out of deepening poverty.\n\nWith 87 million Nigerians living in poverty, Nigeria is home to the highest number of poor people globally. The World Bank even predicts that the number will increase by another 7 million by year-end. That means that by the end of 2021, Nigerians living below $1.90 per day could rise to 94 million, that is the population of the United Kingdom and Australia combined.\n\nThe government in 2019 announced an ambitious plan to lift 100 million people out of poverty in 10 years.\n\nThe big question however is if the government is doing the right things to achieve this target. China, for one, was able to achieve such a feat but Nigeria is not exactly following in the steps of China by increasingly liberalising the economy and encouraging private enterprise.\n\nIf anything, the Nigerian government is seemingly tightening its grip on the economy when it should be giving the private sector a bigger role to play.\n\nThere are examples.\n\nThe state-owned oil company is now the sole importer of petroleum products into the country, displacing private importers who have been unable to sustain imports due to an unrealistic petrol price peg.\n\nThe Central bank is increasingly playing the role of financial intermediary in the place of commercial banks.\n\nThe government is also crowding out the private sector with its sheer size of borrowings. The government could raise close to N3 trillion this year from the domestic capital market alone, three times the N1 trillion that corporates are forecast to raise.\n\nTalks of a national airline are also never off the table in Nigeria.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari recently set up a committee on poverty composed of government officials.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t lift people out of poverty by setting committees,\u201d said Taiwo Oyedele, an economist and a partner at PWC Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe need an enabling environment for businesses to thrive,\u201d Oyedele said.\n\n\u201c50 percent of MSMEs in sub-Saharan Africa are in Nigeria even though we account for 20 percent of the population, this tells us that we need to provide an enabling environment and millions can be lifted out of poverty because if each of the MSMEs in Nigeria can employ one extra person we can create jobs and lift millions out of poverty,\u201d Oyedele added.\n\n\u201cMany small businesses just need the government to get out of the way,\u201d Oyedele said.\n\nThe private sector creates the bulk of jobs in Nigeria but data from the World Bank which shows that the ease of doing business in Nigeria ranks among the lowest globally (despite recent gains) means the private sector is constrained.\n\nNigeria improved its ranking on the latest World Bank ease of doing business ranking by moving 15 spots to 131 in 2020, but the country still has anti-business policies according to analysts.\n\n\u201cI would like to see the government focus on improving the ease of doing business to reduce poverty,\u201d a bank CEO told Business Day.\n\n\u201cIf doing business was easy in Nigeria, we can lend more affordably and more businesses can expand and employ more people, but that\u2019s not the case today with the many risks in the economy,\u201d the bank CEO, who did not want to be named said.",

          "title": "Flashback Friday when BusinessDay started in 2001",
          "text": "Ten numbers defined Nigeria\u2019s economy in 2001 when BusinessDay Newspapers commenced operations.\n\nThese numbers include the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 3 percent, inflation rate (18%), exchange rate (N135.5k/$), Monetary Rediscounted Rate (MRR) currently Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) 16.5 percent, price of oil ($25.5), and gross international reserves $9.87 million.\n\nOther numbers included gross domestic debt (21.5% of GDP), total revenues and grants (47.8% of GDP), Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) 21.5 percent, and GDP per capita ($294).\n\nRead Also: Growing the economy, improving governance, and integrating the nation\n\nThe first publication of BusinessDay in 2001 featured one of the macroeconomic numbers in a story titled \u201cBanks reject foreign exchange requests,\u201d written by Oluwole Elisha. The story exposed how banks rejected requests for foreign exchange from their customers as a demand management approach by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) through the banks.\n\nGDP 3.0%\n\nBusinessDay rolled out its first weekly edition two decades ago when Nigeria\u2019s economy or real GDP was growing at 3.0 percent in 2001 compared with 3.8 percent growth in the corresponding year of 2000, data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) stated.\n\nThe IMF noted in its Article IV of 2001 that Nigeria experienced a rebound in economic activity in 2000, spurred by increased public spending of the windfall gains stemming from higher oil prices and by a buoyant oil sector.\n\nReal GDP was estimated to have grown by 3.8 percent in 2000. Notwithstanding a sharp pick-up in activity in the non-oil sector, overall growth was projected to slow to 3 percent in 2001, owing in part to a reduction in Nigeria\u2019s OPEC oil production quota by more than 9 percent during the first quarter of 2001. At the same time, increased public spending stoked inflationary pressures.\n\nInflation rate 18%\n\nInflation, measured by the 12-month increase in the consumer price index, rose to 18 percent in March 2001 from 0.2 percent in December 1999.\n\nExchange rate N135.5k/$ (black market)\n\nExchange rate regime, which was a managed float with no pre-announced target, stood at N113.2k per dollar at the Inter-Bank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM) as of May 2001.\n\nAt the Nigeria Inter-Bank Foreign Exchange (NIFEX) or open interbank market, naira per dollar stood at N113.5k. The parallel market rate (naira per dollar) was N135.5k/$.\n\nIn response to the pressures in the exchange market stemming from expansionary fiscal policy, the CBN reverted to the pre-reform (i.e. pre-October 1999) system of selling foreign exchange in the Inter-bank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM) at a fixed rate, except for step adjustments in mid-December 2000 and early-April 2001 that devalued the naira by 10 percent.\n\nConsequently, the differential widened between the IFEM rate and the open inter-bank market \u2013 where banks trade among themselves at freely negotiated exchange rates \u2013 and with the parallel rate, and at the time of intensified pressures in April 2001 had reached 15 percent and 20 percent, respectively. In the parallel market, the naira lost about 30 percent of its value between December 1999 and May 2001. As very large amounts of foreign exchange were sold to deal with these pressures, foreign reserves have increased only modestly during the first five months of 2001, notwithstanding continued high foreign exchange inflows from oil.\n\n$25.5 per barrel oil price\n\nThe price of crude oil at the time was $25.5 per barrel, which was lower than $28.5 per barrel in 2000. Nigeria is the largest producer of sweet oil in OPEC.\n\nAccording to the IMF fiscal policy, management of the windfall gains from the substantial oil price increases, in particular, played a key role in economic developments in 2000 and 2001. These gains \u2013 defined as oil revenue in excess of $20 per barrel (so-called excess proceeds) \u2013 amounted to $4 billion (10% of GDP) in 2000 and are projected at $3.7 billion (9.6% of GDP) in 2001.\n\nOn account of the constitution adopted in 1999, that gave state and local governments full and automatic right to their shares of oil revenues, almost one half of the excess proceeds that accrued in 2000 was distributed to sub-federal governments in the second half of 2000, and the remainder in the first quarter of 2001.\n\nMRR 16.5%\n\nThe Monetary Rediscounted Rate (MRR), which is currently the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), was tightened by the CBN in early 2001. The MRR was raised in three steps by 2.5 percentage points to 16.5 percent (accompanied by increases in interest rates on treasury bills and CBN certificates).\n\nGross international reserves $9.87m\n\nNigeria\u2019s gross international reserves stood at $9.87 million in 2001, higher than $9.40 million in the corresponding year. Foreign reserves have increased only modestly during the first five months of 2001, notwithstanding continued high foreign exchange inflows from oil.\n\nCRR 21.5%\n\nThe Cash Reserve Requirement was raised by 2.5 percentage points to 21.5 percent, and the liquid asset ratio increased to 40 percent from 35 percent. As a result of these measures, market interest rates rose to between 30 and 40 percent in late April and May from about 17-20 percent in early 2001.\n\nGross domestic debt (21.5% of GDP)\n\nNigeria\u2019s gross domestic debt or debt-to-GDP ratio, the metric comparing a country\u2019s public debt to its GDP, fell to 21.5 percent of GDP in 2001 from 28.0 percent in the year 2000.\n\nTotal revenues and grants (47.8% of GDP)\n\nTotal revenues and grants rose to 47.8 percent of GDP in 2001 from 46.1 percent in 2000.\n\nGDP per capita ($294)\n\nNigeria\u2019s GDP per capita, which is a metric that breaks down a country\u2019s economic output per person and is calculated by dividing the GDP of a country by its population, dropped from $319 in 2000 to $294 in 2001.",

          "title": "Nigerians react to Sunday Igboho\u2019s house invasion by SSS",
          "text": "Many Nigerians and major groups in the Southwest region of the country have reacted to the admittance by the State Security Service (SSS) that its operatives invaded the home of a leader of a group clamouring for a Yoruba nation, Sunday Adeyemo (also known as Sunday Igboho), in a bid to effect his arrest.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reported how Mr Igboho\u2019s house, located in Soka, Ibadan, capital of Oyo State was invaded around 1:00 a.m. on Thursday.\n\nHis vehicles, including his G-wagon, Prado Jeep, and some valuable properties including furniture, and windows were reportedly destroyed.\n\nThe attack occurred barely 72 hours before the planned rally in Lagos by Mr Igboho and others to further canvas a Yoruba nation.\n\nThe spokesperson of SSS, Peter Afunaya, who confirmed the raid in a press conference in Abuja said a total of seven AK 47 rifles were recovered, alongside pump action guns and 5,000 rounds of ammunition including other weapons.\n\nHe said security operatives recovered the weapons after a \u201chot gun duel between them and Igboho\u2019s guards\u201d.\n\nThe SSS also admitted that two of Igboho\u2019s men were killed in the process while a security agent was shot on the right hand and is currently responding to treatment.\n\nReactions\n\nThis development has, however, triggered reactions from major groups and individuals in the Southwest. A Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, said the invasion of Mr Igboho\u2019s house \u201cis a sad indicator that we are fast returning to the era of the late Sani Abacha when anyone who expressed opinions contrary to the government\u2019s position would be fatally attacked.\u201d\n\nThe group, in a statement by its spokesperson, Jare Ajayi, said it found no wrong in canvassing for self-determination so long as such agitation is devoid of violence.\n\n\u201cThe constitution the country is running guarantees the right of every Nigerian to express an opinion and even carry out rallies as long as such is done without violence. To the best of our knowledge, none of the rallies that Sunday Igboho has led in his campaign for the Yoruba nation could be said to be violent nor was he implicated in illegal activities. Why then should he be subjected to the kind of treatment his household received on Thursday morning?\u201d\n\nAnother body of Yoruba self-determination groups, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO), in a statement by its leader, Banji Akintoye, said the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration has \u201cdeclared war against the peace-loving people of Yoruba Land.\n\n\u201cWe have been peaceful from the inception of this struggle. We have adhered with both the Nigerian and International Laws guiding the agitation for Self-Determination. All our agitations have been peaceful, orderly, and lawfully executed. We have commended the officers of the Nigerian Police many times for being professional in their modus of operations in relating to our protests and rallies for Self-Determination in Yoruba cities.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I say on behalf of the Yoruba people that this attack on Chief Ighoho\u2019s house was unnecessary, unfortunate, wicked, callous, cruel, irresponsible, illegal, and atrocious. We are holding the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration responsible for this barbaric attack. This is a declaration of war against peace-loving people.\u201d\n\nMr Akintoye said that despite the warning by the police in Lagos, the Yoruba nation rally would hold on Saturday.\n\nThe Afenifere Renewal Group (ARG) also condemned the invasion and described it as callous, barbaric, and worrisome.\n\nThe leader of the group, Wale Oshun, said: \u201cWe condemn it in a very strong term. There is no record that Igboho was invited by the police to report. The use of the military for (a) purely civil issue is bound to escalate tension.\n\n\u201cGovernment and security services should recall how Boko Haram started. It started, following the unlawful killing of their leader, who was under arrest by the police. He did not resist arrest. But, he was killed. It is improper to invade the house of Igboho.\n\n\u201cPolice should have gone to his house with a warrant. That was what was done under the military. The military are meant to protect the territorial integrity, and not to meddle in civil affairs. Their work is to fight terrorism and demonstrate effectiveness in restoring security. Even, during the military rule, under Gen. Sani Abacha, the military were not directly involved in civil matters. It was the police and SSS that were arresting people, not soldiers. This should end.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn its part, Odua Peoples Congress (OPC) leader, Gani Adams, said \u201ckilling Igboho could lead to another bloodbath and war akin to the Boko Haram insurgency in the Northeast.\n\n\u201cThe attack on Sunday Igboho\u2019s house is most unfortunate. It is a reflection of the fact that our lives as Nigerians are of no value to the government. And the truth is that nobody is safe in this country.\u201d\n\nOther reactions\n\nFormer aviation minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, said Mr Igboho is being trailed for protecting his people in the South-west.\n\n\u201cHe has also shown the greatest respect to all the Yoruba elders, traditional rulers and leaders and has refused to allow his supporters to terrorise and attack non-Yorubas. The only enemies he and the Yoruba people have are the foreign Fulani terrorists that are in our forests and that are kidnapping and killing our people.\n\n\u201cAnd whether Sunday is alive or dead, those terrorists will still be our enemies and we shall still resist them in our land with all our might. I consider all this and I ask myself whether all those that said we were wasting our time building bridges were right. Despite all, I do not believe they were right and I still believe we must tread that path. These efforts at establishing peace and unity will and must continue because we have no other choice. War is not an option for the Nigerian people and we must NEVER be pushed into it,\u201d he wrote in a statement sent to PREMIUM TIMES.\n\n\u201cIf he is wanted by the security agents all they need to do is to invite him. They do not need to raid his home in the middle of the night, kill his people, steal his things, terrorise his supporters and attempt to kill him. They do not need to invoke the wrath of the Yoruba nation and attempt to manage the consequences of such a reckless and unpredictable course.\u201d\n\nPREMIUM TIMES interviewed some citizens who expressed missed feelings over the invasion of Mr Igboho\u2019s residence.\n\nA taxi driver in Ibadan, Rotimi Olayemi, said the Yoruba nation agitator is a necessary evil in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI cannot support Sunday Igboho but I see him as contributing his part to secure his region. The federal and state governments have failed in their responsibilities of ensuring safety of lives and properties. The failure of those in power created the vacuum that people like Sunday are trying to fill. It is a bad thing to have people like him amidst citizens. Imagine the weapons in his house. That\u2019s barbaric.\n\n\u201cNow that he has been declared wanted, the government must be willing to secure lives of citizens. Let them declare leaders of bandits wanted too, so that we can have peaceful country.\u201d\n\nSuliat Lawani, a social commentator, urged the government to hold round table discussions with citizens considered to be aggrieved with the country.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that some people are aggrieved with authorities. Rather than going hard on them, it is better they call them for a round table discussion, retrieve their weapons, and agree to work for the progress of the nation. Igboho\u2019s death will be another war in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nA lecturer at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, Kehinde Ayoola said \u201cSunday is too naive to confront Federal Government. He has apparently been watching too much African magic movies. Why didn\u2019t they go ahead with their planned Saturday rally? The two testes of the Nigerian economy are in the Niger Delta and Lagos.\n\n\u201cJust as no man would allow its scrotum to secede, Nigeria will certainly not allow Yorubas to go away with Lagos. When it comes to violence, Yorubas are no match for the Fulanis. Why embark on ethnic suicide over nothing! Is it not the Yorubas that put Buhari there in 2015? If they play their cards right, will the North not cede power to them in 2023?\u201d\n\nYoruba nation agitations\n\nMr Igboho has led rallies in Ondo, Ekiti, Osun, Oyo, and Ogun states. He threatened to hold the rally in Lagos on July 3 but his home was invaded barely 72 hours to the planned date.\n\nHe has in the past also called for the eviction of Fulanis in South-west states, an action that was condemned by federal and state authorities.\n\nYoruba Nation agitation is a political ideology to realise the independence and sovereign country for the Yoruba race in Nigeria but many political leaders in the region have rejected and kicked against the idea.\n\nFormer Governor of Lagos, Bola Tinubu, alongside Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila, Bisi Akande, and all leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the South-West, in a meeting in Lagos last month, opposed the agitation.\n\nThey called for ethnic and religious unity instead of a divided nation.",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",

          "title": "Kanu will get fair deal he denied others, FG assures",
          "text": "The Nigerian government Thursday assured Nigerians and the international community that the rearrested leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, will be given fair trial.\n\nIt also alleged the IPOB leader orchestrated the killing of 60 persons and the destruction of property in 55 violent attacks across the South-east and South-south zones within four months.\n\nKanu is currently facing an 11-count charge bordering on treason, treasonable felony, terrorism and illegal possession of firearms among others.\n\nHe was rearrested Sunday following a collaborative effort between Nigeria\u2019s security agents and the Interpol.\n\nThe IPOB leader was arraigned Tuesday before a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja some four years after jumping bail, and consequently ordered detained at a Department of State Services (DSS) facility in Abuja. His trial continues July 26.\n\nAmong several others, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) and the Ohanaeze Ndigbo-the socio-cultural organisations of both the North and South-east respectively, called for fair trial.\n\nAssurance on fair trial\n\nAddressing journalists in Abuja, Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed assured the IPOB leader would be given fair trial while the case lasts.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is interesting that many are suddenly calling for a fair trial for Kanu as if he didn\u2019t get one before he decided to jump bail and flee. However, I can assure you that the fair deal that Kanu denied many of the victims of the violence which he wilfully instigated through his broadcasts and tweets will not be denied him.\u201d\n\nDescribing the arrest of the proscribed IPOB leader as one of the most classic operations of its type in the world, Mohammed commended \u201cthe professionalism, diligence, patriotism and painstaking efforts of our security and intelligence agencies. We also thank the sister international agencies that collaborated with us to pull off this arrest.\n\n\u201cIt will interest Nigerians to know that for over two years, our security and intelligence agencies were on the trail of the proscribed IPOB leader as he lived a five-star life across several countries, travelling on chartered private jets, living in luxury apartments and turning out in designing clothes and shoes. Of course, as we all saw, he was wearing an attire made by Fendi, a luxury Italian fashion brand, when he was arrested.\n\n\u201cWe can tell you that the forensic investigation carried out so far has revealed a treasure trove of information on the proscribed IPOB leader and his collaborators. While the investigation continues, we assure you that none of the collaborators, irrespective of their standing in the society, will be spared. They will all face the full wrath of the law for their activities that challenge our nation\u2019s sovereignty and threaten its unity. No one, no matter how highly placed, is bigger than the country.\u201d\n\nOn how and where he was arrested, the minister who did not entertain any question from reporters after the brief press conference, admitted there were \u201cspeculations on how this re-arrest was pulled off and in which country the hitherto fugitive leader of the proscribed IPOB was nabbed.\n\n\u201cWhat we can tell you, once again, is that the re-arrest was made possible by the diligent efforts of our security and intelligence agencies, in collaboration with countries with which we have obligations. We continue to respect and honour the obligations.\u201d\n\n\u2018He orchestrated killings\u2019\n\nAlso, the federal government alleged Kanu orchestrated the killing of 60 persons and the destruction of property in 55 violent attacks across the South-east and South-south zones within four months.\n\nThis was contained in a letter sent to western diplomats as reported by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).\n\nThe letter dated April 26, 2021 detailed the atrocities committed by members of IPOB on the alleged instruction of Kanu who was then in exile.\n\nNAN also reports that one of the attachments to the letter listed the attacks on lives and property by IPOB in some parts of the country between January and April 2021.\n\nWith several Kanu\u2019s broadcasts from Europe, there were concerns in official quarters that some western countries were justifying IPOB\u2019s violent acts under the guise of the group\u2019s pursuit of self-determination.\n\nAccording to the \u201cdemarche\u201d from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to some western countries, the federal government objected to a statement by an agency of a western nation whose government had noted and admitted that the creation of Eastern Security Network (ESN), based on its own understanding, was to combat insecurity.\n\nThe federal government, in its letter, however considered the statement (by the western nation) as \u201cjustifying the establishment of a militia by a non-state actor and glossing over the destructive and violent acts of IPOB and the ESN.\n\nIt told the western nation that its position may seem to have further emboldened Kanu, adding that this may explain the increased tempo of attacks carried out by members of his group.\n\n\u201cIn under four months this year, IPOB has carried out over fifty-five (55) violent acts in various parts of Southeast Nigeria killing scores of people and destroying many properties.\n\n\u201cIndeed it would seem that the position of the (western nation) seems to have further emboldened Nnamdi Kanu the self-confessed leader of IPOB.\n\n\u201cAs recently as 22nd April, 2021, broadcasting online from his base in London, Mr Kanu has issued series of instructions to his militia and other members of the outlawed organisation, on acts of violence to be carried out within the territory of Nigeria.\u201d .\n\nThe letter made copious references to some of the threats issued by Kanu thus: \u201cOur madness has just begun.\n\n\u201d Every night, young men will not sleep, you will come out, at the starting of every road that leads to every populated area under human habitation to make sure that appropriate road blocks are put in place to slow them down so we can catch them (Fulanis) and kill them.\n\n\u201cThat is what we want you to do. Obiano (Governor of Anambra State) from today onwards, anywhere you are seen in public you will be attacked \u2026. Obiano \u2026 you are a dead man walking.\n\n\u201cAny landlord that gives accommodation or rents his house or her house to a Fulani person, to army personnel, to somebody who works for the police or DSS \u2026.\n\n\u201cKill them. If you see the army and the police in your place, kill all of them\u2026 Kill them.\n\n\u201cFrom today I am announcing, there will be no election in Anambra State. Every edifice of election in Anambra State will be destroyed. I am warning you in advance. There will be no election.

          "text": "At a storming session Thursday, the Senate passed for third and final reading the much expected Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) 13 years after it was introduced.\n\nPassage of the bill for third reading by the upper legislative chamber was sequel to consideration of the 318 \u2013 clause report submitted to that effect by its joint Committee on Petroleum (Downstream), Petroleum (Upstream) and Gas.\n\nMoment of tension\n\nThere was however an uproar among senators from the North and Oil Producing States when the consideration process got to clause 240 which deals with percentage share for oil producing communities.\n\nThe joint committee had in the 540-page report, recommended 3% for Host Communities Development Trust Fund which the Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege in his earlier remarks, commended and thanked the Senate leadership for.\n\nThe position of the Senate on the Host Communities Development Fund however changed after about one hour closed door session with the Group Managing Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari.\n\nDuring the clause consideration, Senator Ahmed Babba Kaita (APC Katsina North), moved for amendment of 5% proposed in the clause to 3% as suggested by the NNPC GMD during the closed session which was put to voice votes with lawmakers in support having it.\n\nSaddened with the development, Deputy Senate President Omo-Agege quickly rose to his feet by suggesting for a caveat in the amendment which according to him, should put responsibility of security of oil facilities in the affected communities on the federal government if it is 3% and on the host communities if it is 5%.\n\nBut the suggested caveat by Omo-Agege was thrown out when put to voice votes with the nays having it.\n\nDissatisfied with the ruling of the Senate President Ahmad Lawan on Omo- Agege\u2019 s suggested caveat , Senator George Thompson Sekibo ( PDP Rivers East) angrily raised a point of order anchored on Order 73 of the Senate\u2019s standing rules to call for division.\n\nTroubleshooting effort\n\nBut in a trouble shooting effort, Senate Leader Yahaya Abdullahi quickly rose to appeal to Sekibo for withdrawal of the point of order.\n\nHe said: \u201cWith all sense of responsibility, my heart bleeds. The Senate has come a long way. We have never treated ourselves in the way that distinguished senator wants us to do today.\n\n\u201cWe are embarking on a very dangerous journey that will hurt the unity that we have cherished, the unity on the basis of which we have moved this Senate and moved this nation to come to this point, the unity that we have worked in this Senate to the envy of all our traducers, to the envy of those people who don\u2019t wish this nation well. They will now start embarking or dividing ourselves along certain fault lines that could cause division and disunity for this country.\n\n\u201cI think that is a path to Armageddon. So I appeal to my brother and friend, Senator Sekibo to please withdraw this point of order.\u201d\n\nMaking similar appeal, Senate President Lawan said: \u201cIt is the right of every senator here to call for division, it\u2019s your right. But I want to appeal that what we have been educated by the GMD gave us better ideas.\n\n\u201cThis 3 per cent I know will not be exactly what some of our colleagues want. But what is of consolidation is that movement. At least, the Senate did not pass 2.5 per cent proposed by the executive. We have passed something slightly higher than 2.5 per cent. But that is the reality and we are stuck with that.\n\n\u201cI want to appeal to Senator Sekibo as earlier done by the leader to withdraw his point of order.\u201d\n\nApparently overwhelmed with the appeals, Sekibo reluctantly withdrew the motion but still pleaded for upward review of the 3%.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs the Senate President, if you appeal to me on something that is personal and I did not take it, you will not be delighted, but no I will say something.\u201d\n\nReiterating the need to further jack up the equity share, Sekibo said: \u201cWhat I\u2019m asking for is not for me as a person but it is for the interest of the nation. Because when we pass a good law, we must also have a good environment to implement the law.\n\n\u201cIf the environment is not conducive for implementation, we all come back to redress. My appeal to you is that you increase the number a little bit. I have withdrawn the motion while appealing to you.\u201d\n\nThough the heated debates on the percentage share for Host Communities continued with Senators like Albert Bassey Akpan and Bala Ibn Na\u2019 Allah among others arguing for upward review or against , but the 3% was not changed.\n\nOther recommendations\n\nAside the 3% approved as Host Communities Development Trust Fund as against 5% earlier recommended by the Senate Joint Committee, other recommendations made in the report were adopted without any form of amendments.\n\nOne of such recommendations was the 30% proposed for Frontier Basins.\n\nThe 30%, as stated in the report, is to be taken from NNPC Limited\u2019s profit from oil and gas.\n\nThe bill also set machinery in motion for unbundling of NNPC by making it a public liability company as against government owned parastatal or corporation.\n\nRelevant section of the bill on unbundling of NNPC states: \u201cThe bill when passed into law, will strengthen the accountability and transparency of NNPC Limited as a full \u2013 fledged CAMA company under statutory / regulatory oversight with better returns to its shareholders \u2013 the Nigerian People.\u201d\n\nIn divesting NNPC of its regulatory powers, the bill created three different bodies, namely; Nigeria Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, Nigeria Upstream Regulatory Commission and Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited.\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

Six were armed with AK-47 guns and three others with pump-action rifles,\u201d the DSS spokesman said.\n\n\u201cIn the course of the exchange, two of the armed men were gunned down, while the rest were subdued and arrested. Only one operative, who was shot by the assailants in his right hand, sustained injury. He has, however, received medical attention and is very stable.\n\n\u201cThe gun duel, which lasted an hour, offered Igboho the chance to escape. Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, is now on the run.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that two of Igboho\u2019s men were killed, the secret service said DSS operative sustained injuries.\n\nIgboho was also said to have escaped during the gun battle and is currently on the run, with security operatives calling on him to turn himself in or be tracked down.\n\nThe 13 suspected armed agitators that were arrested consist of 12 males and 1 female. A large cache of arms and ammunition was also recovered by the operatives.\n\nREAD ALSO: DSS Confirms Raid On Igboho\u2019s House, Parades 13 Suspected Armed Yoruba Nation Agitators\n\nA Clampdown On Agitators\n\nIgboho rose to prominence earlier in the year after he issued a quit notice to herders in Oyo State accused of crimes.\n\nThe raid comes less than a week after the arrest of prominent pro-Biafran independence leader Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) group, which supports the secession of the south-east of Nigeria, Kanu was arrested abroad after four years on the run and brought to Nigeria, where he will go on trial for \u201cterrorism\u201d this month.",

          "text": "US President Joe Biden hailed the \u201cresilience\u201d Thursday of families of people killed or missing in a collapsed Florida beachfront apartment building, spending hours comforting grieving relatives as rescuers suspended their work for much of the day due to dangerous conditions.\n\nBiden said there was still hope that some survivors could be found in the rubble, and while \u201cthe families are very realistic,\u201d the president said he believed after talking with them that the rescue and recovery operations should continue.\n\n\u201cWhat amazed me about this group of people was their resilience, their absolute commitment\u2026 to do whatever it takes to find an answer,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur message today is that we\u2019re here for you, as one nation.\u201d\n\nThe search at the Surfside condominium building near Miami took a grim turn when authorities paused work amid fears the rest of the structure could also collapse.\n\nMiami-Dade Fire Rescue Chief Alan Cominsky warned that there was \u201ca large column hanging from the structure that could fall\u201d and that movements in the ruins \u201ccould cause additional failure of the building.\u201d\n\nThe search resumed in the late afternoon after a review by structural engineers, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said.\n\nThe 18 confirmed dead so far include two children, aged four and 10, she said late Wednesday. More than 140 others remain unaccounted for and hopes of finding any alive are evaporating.\n\nBiden and first lady Jill Biden left the White House early for Surfside, saying they wanted to support first responders and comfort grieving relatives.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing now is just hard as hell,\u201d Biden told emergency workers. \u201cI just want to say thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\u201d\n\nThe couple stopped at an improvised memorial wall one block from the mangled building, which rose above the fence covered with photos, homemade signs and flowers.\n\nThe Bidens walked slowly along it, and the first lady laid a bouquet of white irises on the curb. They stood for a moment as the president bowed his head, crossing himself before leaving the site.\n\n\u2013 Political spin \u2013\n\nWith Florida a crucial state on the US election map, there was considerable focus on interactions during the visit between Biden and state Governor Ron DeSantis \u2014 a rising Republican star who has been touted as a possible 2024 presidential candidate.\n\nIn another political twist to the aftermath of the catastrophic accident, former president Donald Trump was planning a rally in Sarasota, Florida, on Saturday.\n\nDeSantis has joined calls for postponing the event, which is part of Trump\u2019s attempt to remain the dominant force in Republican politics.\n\nBiden, who has made attempts at bipartisan unity a central theme of his presidency, made a point of publicly joining with DeSantis, who himself praised the president for having been \u201csupportive\u201d from \u201cday one.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re letting the nation know we can cooperate when it\u2019s really important,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no Democrat or Republican out there,\u201d he added later. \u201cJust people who wanted to do the right thing for their fellow Americans.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Low\u2019 chance of survival \u2013\n\nThe cave-in of the 12-story Champlain Towers South building has sparked a search-and-rescue effort involving engineers and specialists from across the United States and as far afield as Mexico and Israel.\n\nElad Edri, deputy commander of an Israeli search and rescue team, said rescuers had completed a map outlining bedrooms and other living spaces in the building where residents could be trapped.\n\nRescuers made it to an underground parking structure where it had been hoped they might discover people who had been trapped in cars, but found no one, Edri said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been more than six days from the collapsing,\u201d he cautioned, deeming the chances of finding any survivors \u201clow.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Earthquake\u2019 \u2013\n\nBiden, whose first wife and daughter were killed in a car crash in 1972, shared his own personal tragedy with the Surfside families, according to Daniel Hadar, a rabbi of Temple Moses congregation who was in the room.\n\nBiden \u201ccame with a lot of love and a lot of time,\u201d Hadar noted. \u201cHe said \u2018I know loss, I understand loss and I want to share with you where I\u2019ve been.'\u201d\n\nResidents in the part of Champlain Towers South that remained intact reported being awakened around 1:30 am (0530 GMT) Thursday by what sounded like cracks of thunder that shook their rooms.\n\n\u201cIt was like an earthquake,\u201d Janette Aguero, who escaped from the tower\u2019s 11th floor with her family, told AFP.\n\nRescuers who arrived in the moments after the tower came down helped evacuate dozens of residents, and pulled one teenage boy alive from the rubble.\n\nNo other survivors have been found, despite deployment of sniffer dogs and cranes for lifting debris.\n\nExperts are looking at possible pre-existing critical flaws in the building\u2019s structure.\n\nA 2018 report released by city officials revealed fears of \u201cmajor structural damage\u201d in the complex, from the concrete slab under the pool deck to columns and beams in the parking garage.\n\nIn a letter to residents in April, Jean Wodnicki, chair of the condo association, described \u201caccelerating\u201d damage to the 40-year-old building since then.\n\nRepairs had been set to begin soon.",

          "text": "Belgium and Italy will go head-to-head for a spot in the Euro 2020 semi-finals when they meet in Munich for their quarter-final tie on Friday.\n\nHowever, Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne are still doubtful. Both players were injured in the last-16 clash against Portugal \u2013 De Bruyne suffered an ankle injury, while Hazard pulled a hamstring \u2013 and they have not trained this week, including on Thursday morning before the team flew to Germany.\n\n\u201cIt will be difficult for Eden to play tomorrow because of a soft issue injury and maybe a little different for Kevin who\u2019s had a ligament problem,\u201d Belgium coach Roberto Martinez said.\n\n\u201cWe know that we are fighting against time but we are going to take until the last minute to take the decision. We have seen an improvement but we\u2019ll only see tomorrow whether they can be involved or not. Unfortunately, we cannot make a decision at the moment.\u201d\n\nAfter maintaining their winning record at Euro 2020 with a 1-0 victory over Portugal, Martinez also said it was a pity the two teams were meeting at this stage of the tournament.\n\n\u201cWe are the best two teams statistically at the tournament. Two teams that have each won a record 14 games in a row in the European Championship,\u201d Martinez added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame we have to face each other in the quarter-final. But it\u2019s the quality of this tournament I suppose and we need to be ready for it. There are not a lot of secrets, both sides look like club teams and tomorrow\u2019s game is going to be decided by small details.\u201d\n\nItaly, who conceded their first goal in 19 hours and 28 minutes against Austria in their 2-1 last-16 victory on Saturday, have also impressed in attack, scoring nine goals in four matches in the tournament.\n\nBut the prospect of facing Belgium, who have also won four out of four games at Euro 2020, does not mean Mancini will adopt more conservative tactics.\n\n\u201cWe will play our own game, well aware that we are up against the best team in the world at this moment of time,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cIf they have been top of the FIFA rankings for three years, it means they have been very good for a long time, but we will still play our way.\n\n\u201cWe could tweak a few things along the way if things do not go to plan, but we have a certain style of play and Belgium do too. I am sure it will be a wonderful game of football. The winner will be the team who makes the fewest errors.\u201d\n\nBelgium\u2019s main attacking threat is a familiar one for the Azzurri defence with Romelu Lukaku, who has scored three goals at Euro 2020, set to spearhead Martinez side\u2019s attack at the Allianz Arena.\n\nLukaku was voted Player of the Year in Serie A last season, as he fired Inter Milan to their first top-flight title in 11 years.\n\n\u201cWe have got a lot of respect for Lukaku because he had a great season for Inter, and this goes for our entire squad,\u201d said defender Giorgio Chiellini. \u201cAll season we witnessed what a match-winner and important player he has become.\n\n\u201cI think it would be doing a disservice to say Belgium are all about Romelu Lukaku, though, as they have quality players throughout the pitch. We will prepare as we always have done, keeping an eye on Lukaku and their other top players.\u201d\n\nWith De Bruyne and Hazard\u2019s involvement yet to be confirmed, Belgium are set to have the remainder of their squad available for the quarter-final.\n\nItaly have no new injury concerns, with Chiellini set to return after missing the last-16 fixture against Austria with a thigh injury.\n\nThis will be the fifth meeting between Belgium and Italy at a major tournament \u2013 all four previous meetings came in the group stages, in the 1954 World Cup and European Championship in 1980, 2000 and 2016. Italy avoided defeat in all four matches, winning three and drawing one.\n\nAgainst no side have Belgium played more games at major tournaments without winning than Italy (4, level with France and Germany) while the only European nations Italy have faced more often at the same tournaments without losing are Germany (9) and Austria (5).\n\nItaly have reached the quarter-final of the European Championship for a fourth consecutive tournament. Each of those previous three appearances at this stage have been decided by a penalty shootout, with the Italians eliminated by Spain in 2008 and Germany in 2016 while progressing past England in 2012. Indeed, that accounts for three of Italy\u2019s five European Championship penalty shootouts \u2013 more than any other nation prior to the 2020 edition.\n\nBelgium have won seven of their last eight matches at the European Championships \u2013 the exception in this run was at this stage at Euro 2016, when they lost 3-1 to Wales.\n\nItaly have won all four of their matches at EURO 2020; they have never won five consecutive games at the European Championship finals, while only twice previously have they won five or more in a row at any major tournament (World Cup/Euros), winning seven in a row at the World Cup from 1934 to 1938 and five in succession at the World Cup in 1990.",

          "text": "Australia will halve the number of international arrivals it accepts after Covid outbreaks put half the population in lockdown this week.\n\nThe country\u2019s strict border rules have only allowed Australians and people with exemptions to enter.\n\nFrom 14 July, Australia will accept just over 3,000 people a week \u2013 a measure likely to last until next year.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said the cuts would reduce pressure on the quarantine system.\n\nVirus leaks from hotel quarantine \u2013 which is mandatory for all arrivals \u2013 have been the source of numerous outbreaks across the country.\n\n\u201cSimply reducing the caps doesn\u2019t necessarily provide a fail safe but because of the particular virulency of the Delta strain, it is believed that is a prudent action while we remain in this suppression phase of the virus,\u201d Mr Morrison said.\n\nThe Australian government has faced criticism for its strict border policies and the new arrival caps will make it even more difficult for many to return home.\n\nTo mitigate some of the cuts, Mr Morrison said the number of repatriation flights for Australians wanting to fly home would be increased. It would also begin trialling home quarantine arrangements for vaccinated travellers.\n\nMr Morrison indicated that arrival limits would not be lifted again until most Australians have been vaccinated \u2013 a goal that won\u2019t be achieved until next year.\n\nThe new rules come after outbreaks of the highly infectious Delta variant plunged seven cities \u2013 including Sydney, Brisbane and Perth \u2013 into lockdowns over the past week.\n\nThe country has recorded about 250 cases, with most tied to a cluster in Sydney, its largest city. Sydney\u2019s five million residents are under a stay-at-home order until 9 July.\n\nThe outbreak there stemmed from an unvaccinated driver who transported international arrivals, and the virus then spread in the community.\n\n\u201cWe have seen breaches occur, predominantly as a result of infection control procedures and human error\u2026 those issues need to continue to be strengthened,\u201d Mr Morrison said.\n\nThe outbreaks in five states and territories marked the most widespread transmission of the virus in Australia this year.\n\nIt also highlighted the nation\u2019s slow vaccine rollout, with less than 8% of adults fully vaccinated.\n\nThe Delta outbreaks prompted emergency talks between the prime minister and state and territory governments.\n\nOn Friday, following a meeting of all government leaders, Mr Morrison announced a new timeline for Australians on \u201cthe pathway out of Covid\u201d which included the international arrival cuts.\n\nHe said while the country had focused on the suppression of the virus, it would ultimately move to manage Covid \u201cas an infectious disease like any other in our community\u201d.\n\nHowever, he said Australia remains in the first phase of suppressing Covid spread. A shift to later stages \u2013 including a move away from lockdowns \u2013 would require most Australians to be vaccinated.\n\nAustralia is relying on the AstraZeneca and the Pfizer vaccines to immunise its population.\n\nDelays in the rollout have largely been attributed to widespread hesitancy over the AstraZeneca shot, and a lack of Pfizer supplies.\n\nMr Morrison reiterated on Friday that all Australians would be able to receive their first dose by the end of 2021.",

          "text": "The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Thursday failed to agree on whether or not to keep crude oil output at current levels or open the taps for a further easing of production quotas by roughly two million barrels between now and December.\n\nEarlier, there were expectations that the cartel could boost production output by another 400,000 barrels beginning in August, an increase seen as likely to be easily absorbed by the market amid expectations for rising demand.\n\nIt was gathered that the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMCC) failed to come to a conclusion on the recommendations and will meet again today to iron out the rough edges.\n\nAt the inconclusive meeting, the OPEC+ ministerial committee had proposed the planned increase to the wider group, but a disagreement between Saudi Arabia and Russia, the biggest producers in the OPEC+ alliance, remained largely unresolved.\n\nLast year, following the death-blow, dealt on the oil market by the COVID-19 pandemic, OPEC+ resolved to cut output by almost 10 million bpd from May 2020, with plans to phase out the curbs by the end of April 2022.\n\nBefore the deferment of the meeting, oil prices reacted with Brent crude trading above $75 a barrel, close to a two-and-a-half-year high as the policy from August to December was being awaited.\n\nWhile the full house decided to shift a definitive decision on the matter till today, OPEC had earlier finished its meeting just before an OPEC+ ministerial committee met after that, before the inconclusive one by OPEC+ ministers.\n\nThe Joint Technical Committee (JTC) of OPEC had a day earlier stated that it expected oil demand to grow by six million bpd in 2021 but flagged risks of a glut in 2022, saying there were \u201csignificant uncertainties\u201d including an uneven global recovery and rising cases of the Delta variant of Coronavirus.\n\nSources close to the meeting said the idea of a gradual increase featured in both policy drafts put forward for the vote at the ministerial meeting, while one of the proposals suggested extending the coalition\u2019s output restraint deal until the end of 2022.\n\nRussia hinted that it viewed the current oil price of around $75 per barrel as a sign of overheating, prompting Moscow to support a further increase of production by the group, with Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Alexander Novak, saying that prices in a range of $45-$60/bbl would be optimal.\n\nOne of the factors that could shape the decision today is the status of talks between Iran and the U.S., which are seeking to revive their nuclear pact and potentially lift sanctions on the Islamic Republic\u2019s oil exports.\n\nSpeaking during one of the sessions, the Secretary-General of OPEC, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, had urged members to be watchful of the pace of the global vaccination rollout versus the speed of COVID-19 variants taking hold.\n\nHe, however, stated that OPEC still sees growth in the second half of the year.\n\nOn the supply side, Barkindo reiterated that non-OPEC liquids production in 2021 is forecast to grow by 0.8 mb/d, a drop of 0.1 mb/d from the number presented in November 2020.\n\nHe said OPEC member-countries and all Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) participants had contributed to the rebound and recovery since November last year, with overall conformity levels consistently over 100 per cent.\n\nHe added that the administering of three billion doses of vaccine against COVID-19 worldwide represents an unprecedented achievement in the history of medical science, combined with the effects of around $26 trillion in fiscal and monetary stimulus in some countries.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

Nothing offensive or that breaches the Nigerian laws should be entertained.\u201d\n\nMalami said the federal government had established a committee on the matter and the company had approached the government over the issue.\n\nOn PIB, the minister said steps had been taken to ensure pending bills were transmitted to President Muhammadu Buhari for assent.\n\nAccording to him, the fundamental interest and objective of the Buhari administration is to leverage on the bills to enhance value in terms of creating enabling environment for investment, protecting the public interest for the maximum benefit all.\n\nMalami said the essence of the amendment of the Electoral Act was to enhance the democratic system by addressing delays in judicial determination of pre-election matters as well as ensuring justice and fairness in the conduct of electoral processes, including party primaries.\n\nHe said to strengthen the fight against corruption, the government came up with the Proceeds of Crime Bill and Audit Bill, among others.\n\nMalami said public interest had been the uppermost consideration in the quest by the federal government for the regulation of freedom of expression, adding that restrictions to freedom of expression are locally and internationally recognised.\n\n\u201cOur government is not averse to freedom.

          "title": "US Hands Bagram Airfield to Afghans after Nearly 20 Years",
          "text": "After nearly 20 years, the U.S. military left Bagram Airfield, the epicenter of its war to oust the Taliban and hunt down the al-Qaida perpetrators of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on America, two U.S. officials said Friday.\n\nThe airfield was handed over to the Afghan National Security and Defense Force in its entirety, they said on condition they not be identified because they were not authorized to release the information to the media.\n\nOne of the officials also said the U.S. top commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Austin S. Miller, \u201cstill retains all the capabilities and authorities to protect the forces.\u201d\n\nThe withdrawal from Bagram Airfield is the clearest indication that the last of the 2,500-3,500 U.S. troops have left Afghanistan or are nearing a departure, months ahead of President Joe Biden\u2019s promise that they would be gone by Sept. 11.\n\nIt was clear soon after the mid-April announcement that the U.S. was ending its \u201cforever war,\u201d that the departure of U.S. soldiers and their estimated 7,000 NATO allies would be nearer to July 4, when America celebrates its Independence Day.\n\nMost NATO soldiers have already quietly exited as of this week. Announcements from several countries analyzed by The Associated Press show that a majority of European troops has now left with little ceremony \u2014 a stark contrast to the dramatic and public show of force and unity when NATO allies lined up to back the U.S. invasion in 2001.\n\nThe U.S. has refused to say when the last U.S. soldier would leave Afghanistan, citing security concerns, but also the protection of Kabul\u2019s Hamid Karzai International Airport is still being negotiated. Turkish and U.S. soldiers currently are protecting the airport. That protection is currently covered under the Resolute Support Mission, which is the military mission being wound down.\n\nUntil a new agreement for the airport\u2019s protection is negotiated between Turkey and the Afghan government, and possibly the United States, the Resolute Support mission would appear to have to continue in order to give international troops the legal authority.\n\nThe U.S. will also have about 650 troops in Afghanistan to protect its sprawling embassy in the capital. Their presence it is understood will be covered in a bilateral agreement with the Afghan government.\n\nThe U.S. and NATO leaving comes as Taliban insurgents make strides in several parts of the country, overrunning dozens of districts and overwhelming beleaguered Afghan security Forces.\n\nIn a worrying development, the government has resurrected militias with a history of brutal violence to assist the Afghan security forces. At what had all the hallmarks of a final press conference, Gen. Miller this week warned that continued violence risked a civil war in Afghanistan that should have the world worried.\n\nAt its peak around 2012, Bagram Airfield saw more than 100,000 U.S. troops pass through its sprawling compound barely an hour\u2019s drive north of the Afghan capital Kabul.\n\nThe departure is rife with symbolism. Not least, it\u2019s the second time that an invader of Afghanistan has come and gone through Bagram.\n\nThe Soviet Union built the airfield in the 1950s. When it invaded Afghanistan in 1979 to back a communist government, it turned it into its main base from which it would defend its occupation of the country. For 10 years, the Soviets fought the U.S.-backed mujahedeen, dubbed freedom fighters by President Ronald Reagan, who saw them as a front-line force in one of the last Cold War battles.\n\nWhen the U.S. and NATO inherited Bagram in 2001, they found it in ruins, a collection of crumbling buildings, gouged by rockets and shells, most of its perimeter fence wrecked. It had been abandoned after being battered in the battles between the Taliban and rival mujahedeen warlords fleeing to their northern enclaves.\n\nThe enormous base has two runways. The most recent, at 12,000 feet long, was built in 2006 at a cost of $96 million. There are 110 revetments, which are basically parking spots for aircraft, protected by blast walls. GlobalSecurity, a security think tank, says Bagram includes three large hangars, a control tower and numerous support buildings. The base has a 50-bed hospital with a trauma bay, three operating theaters and a modern dental clinic. Another section houses a prison, notorious and feared among Afghans.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Afghan officials as to the final withdrawal from Bagram Airfield by the U.S. and its NATO allies.",
