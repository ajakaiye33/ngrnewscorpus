          "text": "The Katsina State Police Command confirmed on Wednesday that its operatives, made up of mainly mobile police, on Tuesday evening repelled a terrorist attack at Mararabar-Kankara community, Kankara Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe Command said its operatives received a distressed call around 5pm on Tuesday that terrorists, in large numbers, were in the community and had, among others, rustled a large number of domestic animals.\n\nThe spokesman for the Command, SP Gambo Isah, who confirmed the development, said its mobile police team were subsequently mobilised to confront the terrorists and repel them.\n\nThe police Area Commander for Dutsin-ma was also said to have led a reinforcement team to ward off the terrorists.\n\nIsah added that although no death was recorded during the encounter, a man believed to have been initially abducted by the terrorists was rescued by the police team.\n\nThe spokesman also said that the police team was able to recover all the rustled animals from the terrorists.\n\nIsah said, \u201cOur operatives were able to repel the terrorists who were over one hundred in number and who divided themselves into two groups during the attack. They were seriously engaged. We repelled them, rescued a victim and recovered all the rustled animals. No death was recorded.\u201d\n\nThe residents, however, gave a contrary account of the incident.\n\nThe residents claimed that the terrorists attacked at least five communities including Gidan Dankunda, Kungiya, Gidan Kurty, Centan Dangera, and Gidan Malumfashi, all in the council.\n\nThe residents further claimed that the attack was carried out by some Fulani herdsmen from the forest who were on a reprisal mission over the recent rustling of their domestic animals by some fellow Fulani herdsmen residing in the town.\n\nThe residents alleged that at least five people were killed in the incident.\n\nOne of the residents who pleaded anonymity revealed, \u201cThe terrorists came in their numbers, armed with sophisticated weapons, with three persons each riding on one motorcycle.\n\n\u201cThey gathered together at Gidan Dankunda where they moved from community to community, killing and maiming people.\n\n\u201cThe five bodies we have discovered so far are non-herders. Right now, we don\u2019t know the actual number of people that have been killed, but they are many.\n\n\u201cPeople are still discovering bodies in the affected communities; we will get to know the figures later in the day.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Abba Kyari and Hushpuppi\n\nBy Ikechukwu Nnochiri\n\nThe Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Wednesday, deferred hearing on the application seeking to extradite the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, DCP, Abba Kyari to the United States of America, USA, to face trial over his alleged involvement with a notorious internet fraudster, Ramon Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi, till April 27.\n\nKyari is wanted in the U.S. to stand trial for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering, and identity theft.\n\nA grand jury had on April 29, 2021, filed an indictment against him with the approval of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, after which a warrant was issued for his arrest.\n\nThe application for his extradition was brought before the court by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN.\n\nMalami said the extradition application was based on a request by the Diplomatic Representative of the U.S. Embassy in Abuja for Kyari to be surrendered for trial.\n\nThe AGF, in an affidavit that was filed in support of the extradition application, said he was satisfied that the offence in respect of which Kyari\u2019s surrender was sought, is not political or trivial.\n\nHe said he was also satisfied that the request for Kyari to be surrendered, was not made to persecute or punish him on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions, but in good faith and the interest of justice.\n\nAccording to him, Kyari, \u201cif surrendered, will not be prejudiced at his trial and will not be punished, detained or restricted in his personal liberty, by reason of his race, nationality or political opinions\u201d, adding that having regard to all the circumstances in which the alleged offence was committed, it would not be unjust or oppressive, or severe a punishment, to surrender him.\n\nMalami, noted that there was no criminal proceeding pending against Kyari in Nigeria, bordering on the same offence for which he is wanted in the USA.\n\nMeanwhile, when the matter was called up on Wednesday, Kyari\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Nureni Jimoh, SAN, told the court that his client was yet to be served with any of the processes the AGF filed against him.\n\nNureni said there was no way his client would have been able to respond to the extradition request, since he was not served.\n\nResponding, counsel to the AGF, Mr. Pius Akutah, admitted that the Respondent was yet to be served with processes in the application marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/249/2022.\n\nHe said the inability of the office of the AGF to serve the Respondent was due to the drug trafficking charge the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, also entered against Kyari, before the court.\n\nAkutah, argued that he has 14 days within which he could still effect the service in accordance with the law.\n\nWhile adjourning the case, Justice Inyang Ekwo ordered the Applicant (AGF) to ensure that DCP Kyari was served before the next date.\n\nThe court held that upon service of the processes, Kyari, would be at liberty to file his response within 14 days.\n\nIt further gave an extra seven days for the parties to perfect the filing processes.\n\nKyari, who hitherto headed the Police Intelligence Response Team, IRT, is currently answering to an eight-count charge the NDLEA preferred against him a six others.\n\nThe other Defendants in the charge marked FHC/ABJ/57/2022, are four former members of the Police IRT, ACP Sunday J. Ubia, ASP Bawa James, Insp. Simon Agirigba and Insp. John Nuhu, as well as two drug traffickers that were arrested at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu, Chibunna Patrick Umeibe and Emeka Alphonsus Ezenwanne.\n\nIt will be recalled that Umeibe and Ezenwanne, who were cited as the 6th and 7th Defendants in the charge, had on March 7, when they were arraigned alongside DCP Kyari, pleaded guilty to the drug trafficking charge against them.\n\nFollowing an application by the NDLEA, trial Justice Emeka Nwite, slated March 28 to review the facts of the case so as to sentence the two Defendants (Umuibe and Ezenwanne), accordingly.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Court okays contempt charges against Amaechi in dispute over cargo tracking contract",
          "text": "A Federal High Court in Abuja on Wednesday directed the initiation of contempt proceedings against the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, following complaints that he flouted an earlier order made by the court.\n\nJustice Donatus Okorowo gave the directive after being informed that Amaechi allegedly violated an order for the maintenance of status quo issued on January 22, 2022, in a suit filed by a civil group, the Incorporated Trustees of Citizens Advocacy for Social and Economic Rights (CASER), challenging Amaechi\u2019s handling of the process of appointing operators of the International Cargo Tracking Note (ICTN) in Nigeria.\n\nIn the suit, CASER alleged among others, that Amaechi has manipulated the appointment process to the benefit of two local and inexperienced firms \u2013 Medtech Scientific Ltd and Rozi International Nigeria Ltd.\n\nListed with Amaechi as defendants in the suit are the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP), the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Medtech Ltd and Rozi Ltd.\n\nAt the resumed hearing of the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/1587/2021 on Wednesday, the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, Abdulhakeem Mustapha (SAN) told that court that Amaechi defied the order for the maintenance of status quo and continued with the appointment process and currently on the verge of completing the process of appointment.\n\nMustapha added: \u201cHe (Amaechi) has taken fundamental steps on the subject matter of this suit, and we have documents to be placed before the court to establish that he has ignored the order of the court completely.\n\n\u201cIn order to protect the sanctity of this honourable court, we have issued Form 48 against the Minister of Transportation. With the commencement of this committal process, which takes precedence over any other matter, we urge this court to suspend further proceedings in the substantive suit.\u201d\n\nMustapha said having issued Form 48 on the Minister, he was in the process of filing motion on notice to commit the minister to prison.\n\nIn response, Amaechi\u2019s lawyer, Omosanya Popoola admitted receiving a letter notifying him of the issuance of Form 48 on his client.\n\nPopoola said his client is a law abiding citizen and he was yet to be personally served with the Form 48.\n\nLawyer to BPP, Akin Olujinmi (SAN) said his client has also not been served with the Form 48 personally as required by law.\n\nOlujinmi argued that there was no motion for committal before the court, adding that the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer has to file affidavit to establish his allegations that the defendants, including Amaechi had violated the court\u2019s order.\n\nLawyer to the AGF, Mohammed Sheriff aligned himself with the submissions by lawyers to Amaechi and BPP that proceedings in the main suit should not be halted.\n\nJustice Okorowo agreed to suspend proceedings in the main suit, noting that: \u201cOnce the issue of contempt is raised, the court must suspend proceedings.\n\n\u201cThe court will not close its eyes when being told that its orders are being flouted. We have to suspend proceedings for the court to ascertain the veracity of the allegations.\u201d\n\nThe judge then directed the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer to proceed to file a motion on notice with an affidavit to establish the facts of the alleged violation of the court\u2019s orders, which must be filed and served before the next adjourned date.\n\nThe court has scheduled a ruling for May 9 on the application filed by a firm, Antaser Nigeria Limited to be made a party in the suit.\n\nAntaser\u2019s lawyer, James Ogwu Onoja (SAN) told the court that his client was a necessary party in the case because it sought to participate in the bidding process but was unlawfully excluded.\n\nPlaintiff in the suit, CASER, stated, in an affidavit supporting the substantive suit, that the purported procurement process, leading to the appointment of the fourth and fifth defendants (Medtech and Rozi) as companies providing ICTN services shows that it was riddled with non-compliance with the known procurement procedures as stipulated in the law.\n\nThe plaintiff claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari \u201cwas misguided in granting an anticipatory approval for a direct appointment of the fourth and fifth defendants\u2019 companies.\n\n\u201cThe approval by Mr. President cannot waive the procurement process stipulated under the Public Procurement Act.\n\n\u201cThe steps of the first and second defendants (Transport Minister and BPP) by opting for selective bidding and or direct procurement method amount to a wilful violation of due process and a desperate design to circumvent the provisions of the Procurement Act by abandoning the demands of fairness, competitiveness, accountability and transparency as envisaged by the Act.\n\n\u201cThe failure of the relevant agencies to follow due process and appoint qualified companies contributed immensely to the failure of the ICTN project in the year 2010 and 2015.\n\n\u201cThe appointment of the fourth and fifth defendants without due process will further worsen the already threatened security and fragile economy of this country.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff is praying the court for among others: A declaration that in view of the mandatory provisions of sections 40(1), 24 & 25 of the Public Procurement Act 2007, it is ultra vires the powers of the 1st defendant to seek Mr. President\u2019s anticipatory approval for due process \u201cno objection\u201d from the 2nd defendant for the appointment of the 4th defendant as technical partners to the 5th defendant to provide international cargo tracking note in the country.\n\nAn order nullifying the entire process of appointing the 4th and 5th defendant as operator of the international cargo tracking note in the country.\n\nAn order setting aside the due process \u2018no objection\u2019 issued by the 2nd defendant to the 1st defendant, for the restricted selection of the 4th and 5th defendants.\n\nAn order of this honourable court stopping the proposed and imminent appointment of the 4th and 5th defendants as the operators of the International Cargo Tracking Note (ICTN) in Nigeria in view of the clear breach of the provision of Public Procurement Act, 2007.\n\nAn order of mandamus directing the first and second defendants to conduct an international competitive bidding to ensure the proper selection of the service provider for the International Cargo Tracking Note (ICTN) in Nigeria.",

However, among the human family, we need not save only when there is surplus.\n\n\u201cIf, for example, one plans to buy a car next year, would one not start saving money for that? Savings is about planning and, as Obi always said, \u201cIf you do not plan, you have planned to fail.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs for those in the habit of arguing against what they do not understand, I hope you will commend the debt burden that will weigh Anambra down as revealed by Prof. Charles Soludo. May I present to you the rationale behind Obi\u2019s savings in the State as he himself explained.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we live in a system where people do not think about tomorrow and do not plan for future generations but would prefer to obliterate accumulated income and put the state in debt before exiting the office.\n\n\u201cThese are the reasons he is qualified for leadership at any level.

We have to suspend proceedings for the court to ascertain the veracity of the allegations.\u201d\n\nThe judge then directed plaintiff\u2019s lawyer to proceed to file a motion on notice, with an affidavit to establish the facts of the alleged violation of court\u2019s orders, which must be filed and served before the next adjourned date.\n\nThe court has scheduled ruling for May 9 on the application filed by a firm, Antaser Nigeria Limited to be made a party in the suit.\n\nAntaser\u2019s lawyer, James Ogwu Onoja (SAN) told the court that his client was a necessary party in the case because it sought to participate in the bidding process, but was unlawfully excluded.\n\nCASER stated, in an affidavit supporting the substantive suit, that the purported procurement process, leading to the appointment of the fourth and fifth defendants (Medtech and Rozi) as companies providing ICTN services shows that it was riddled with non-compliance with the known procurement procedures as stipulated in the law.\n\nThe plaintiff claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari \u201cwas misguided in granting an anticipatory approval for a direct appointment of the fourth and fifth defendants\u2019 companies.\n\n\u201cThe approval by Mr. President cannot waive the procurement process stipulated under the Public Procurement Act.\n\n\u201cThe steps of the first and second defendants (Transport Minister and BPP) by opting for selective bidding and or direct procurement method amount to a willful violation of due process and a desperate design to circumvent the provisions of the Procurement Act by abandoning the demands of fairness, competitiveness, accountability and transparency as envisaged by the Act.\n\n\u201cThe failure of the relevant agencies to follow due process and appoint qualified companies contributed immensely to the failure of the ICTN project in the year 2010 and 2015.\n\n\u201cThe appointment of the fourth and fifth defendants without due process will further worsen the already threatened security and fragile economy of this country.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff is praying the court for among others,\n\n*A a declaration that in view of the mandatory provisions of sections 40(1), 24 & 25 of the Public Procurement Act 2007, it is ultra vires the powers of the 1st defendant to seek Mr. President\u2019s anticipatory approval for due process \u201cno objection\u201d from the 2nd defendant for the appointment of the 4th defendant as technical partners to the 5th defendant to provide international cargo tracking note in the country.\n\n*A declaration that Mr. President was misled by the 1st defendant in granting the anticipatory approval dated 19th august, 2021 to enable the 1st defendant request for due process \u201cno objection\u201d from the 2nd defendant for the appointment of the 4th defendant as technical partners to the 5th defendant to provide international cargo tracking note contrary to the mandatory provisions of sections 40(1), 24 & 25 of the public procurement act, 2007.\n\n*An order nullifying the entire process of appointing the 4th and 5th defendant as operator of the international cargo tracking note in the country.\n\n*An order stopping the proposed and imminent appointment of the 4th and 5th defendants as the operators of the International Cargo Tracking Note (ICTN) in Nigeria in view of the clear breach of the provision of Public Procurement Act, 2007.\n\n*An order of mandamus directing the first and second defendants (Transportation Minister and BPP) to conduct an international competitive bidding to ensure the proper selection of the service provider for the International Cargo Tracking Note (ICTN) in Nigeria.",

          "title": "Who emerges as APC national chairman?",
          "text": "Barring any last-minute change, the stage is set for the emergence of a new National Working Committee (NWC) that will lead the All Progressives Congress (APC) to overcome its current challenges and inspire it to electoral victories in future elections. JIDE ORINTUNSIN examines the chances of aspirants for various positions when the party eventually elects new national officers during the convention on Saturday\n\nAt last, the much-awaited All Progressives Congress (APC) national convention is scheduled to hold in the next three days; after several postponements in the last 20 months by the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC). Expectations are high from both party members and the general public who are anxious to see the party elect a new National Working Committee (NWC) to lead the ruling party in the next couple of years because leadership is key to its effective delivery of dividend of democracy. Barring any last-minute change, the stage is set for the emergence of a new NWC that will drive the party from its current challenges to electoral victories in future elections, especially the next general election.\n\nAs at the last count, only seven of the 15 aspirants that initially threw their hats to the ring for the converted position of the national chairman will be on the ballot paper.\n\nAspirants from the preferred North Central zone that would be on the ballot on Saturday are Senator Mohammed Sani Musa (Niger State), Mohammed Saidu Etsu (Niger), Malam Saliu Mustapha (Kwara), Senator George Akume (Benue), Senator Tanko Umar Al-Makura (Nasarawa) and Senator Abdullahi Adamu (Nasarawa). It also includes the only aspirant from the Northwest, Alhaji Abdulaziz Abubakar Yari (Zamfara).\n\nAn assessment of these aspirants indicates that their pedigrees speak volumes. All have distinguished themselves in their chosen carriers and have paid varied prices in their human endeavour for relevance. Their campaigns have left no one in doubt of their readiness to take the party far beyond the next level.\n\nHowever, if the zoning arrangement is anything to go by, the former chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) and former Zamfara State governor may be swimming against the tide. Political observers believe that Yari\u2019s aspiration may not sail through because it is against the zoning arrangement. The reduction of political relevance in Zamfara, with the defection of Governor Bello Matawalle from the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP) to the ruling party, is another factor that would undermine his quest to occupy the party\u2019s chairmanship seat.\n\nConsensus:\n\nUnlike the use of consensus as a mode of choosing leaders, which was prevalent under the Mai Mala Buni-led CECPC, as the majority of the leaders that emerged from wards to the state levels were through consensus, many party members are pushing for an electioneering process that will engage all through an open election.\n\nDespite President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s purported endorsement of Abdullahi Adamu, six other aspirants are still in the race and will slug it out at the convention ground on Saturday. Though Adamu may enjoy presidential endorsement, he has a hurdle to clear in getting the support of the majority of the governors who are in firm control of the party. Many observers believe that Adamu\u2019s aspiration may pitch the governors against President Buhari.\n\nAnother major factor in contemporary politics in the country is religion. A cursory look at the aspirants shows that George Akume is the only Christian among the lot. This may be to his advantage in an attempt to balance the religious divide in the party and ensure inclusiveness of all.\n\nBookmakers and party members also rate high the chances of Sani Musa, Al-Makura and Mustapha in that order, while the 37-year old Mohammed Saidu Etsu is equally set to make history as the youngest leader of a national party by galvanising the support of the youths and the young at heart to vote for him as the next chairman of Africa\u2019s largest party.\n\nJettisoning of zoning:\n\nThe widespread disenchantment for consensus and zoning arrangements to fill both NWC and zonal positions has been growing. Most zones are yet to agree on their micro-zoning formula, while in some zones, the formula has been thrown open to all.\n\nIn the South-south zone, for instance, the presidential ambition of a serving minister and the need for sustained control by another minister is responsible for the jettisoning of zoning arrangements in the area. While former Deputy National Secretary, Victor Giadom is being sponsored by Rotimi Amaechi, the Minister of State Petroleum Resources, Timprye Silva is also alleged to be backing the aspiration of former Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena to become the party\u2019s national vice-chairman. The position is micro-zoned to Bayelsa and Rivers State.\n\nThe same power tussle and jettisoning of the zoning arrangement is rocking the Northwest. Former National Youth Leader, Ismaeel Ahmed and the former Northwest Youth Leader, Abubakar Sadiq Fakai have refused to embrace the micro-zoning arrangement. Though serious negotiations and horse-trading are going on between Kaduna and Kebbi states to swap allocated offices, deft moves are on by leaders of Kano and Jigawa states to reenact their old-time relationship in ensuring that the two states are in the conference room of the next NWC.\n\nThe memory and the goodwill of the former Minister of Women Affairs, Hajiya Aisha Alhassan, fondly called \u201cMama Taraba will be all Hajiya Zainab Ibrahim will need to clinch the position of Deputy National Women Leader. Zainab who is a cousin and one-time foot-soldier of the former strong woman of Taraba State politics will be home and dry for victory at the polls.\n\nFrom the Northeast, the fate of Jagaban Jimeta and one-time national chairmanship aspirant, Chief Sunny Sylvester Mondiafe now aspiring to be the Deputy National Chairman (North) is shaky. Mondiafe who claims to be from Adamawa State, having been born there by parents from Delta State, is being challenged by a serving federal lawmaker, Senator Abubakar Girei.\n\nIn the same vein, the Taraba State-born politician, Uba Maigari Ahmadu will be at the convention as the sole candidate for the post of National Vice Chairman, Northeast. Ahmadi emerged top at a pre-convention shadow election with three other aspirants.\n\nAnother notable face that may likely be in the new NWC from the Southwest is the former Deputy Governor of Osun State, Senator Iyiola Omisore who has been pencilled down to become the party\u2019s next National Secretary, while former Ondo State APC Chairman, Chief Isaac Kekemeke has also been tipped to emerge as National Vice Chairman, Southwest.\n\nBarring a last-minute change, former Senate President and member of CECPC, Senator Ken Nammani may be returning to the NWC as Deputy National Chairman (South)\n\nDefectors take over:\n\nOne interesting thing about the emerging NWC is the fact that former members of the PDP are set to occupy various positions in the party hierarchy. They include Senator Abdullahi Adamu, who is being tipped for the position of the National Chairman; Senator Ken Nnamani, Deputy National Chairman (South) and former House of Representatives Speaker, Yakubu Dogara, who may be coming on board as Deputy Chairman (North).\n\nOthers are Senator Iyiola Omisore, National Secretary; Victor Gaidom, National Vice Chairman South-south; and Osita Medener, National Vice Chairman, Southeast.\n\nImposition by CPC bloc:\n\nIf the warning by Salihu Lukman, the immediate past director-general of the Progressive Governors Forum ( PGF) is anything to go by, party leaders and delegates at the convention should avoid any action that can lead to the implosion due to the alleged inordinate ambition of some leaders of one of the defunct legacy parties \u2013 the Congress for Progressives Change (CPC) to foist leaders on the party by ensuring that CPC leaders are not \u2018marginalised\u2019 in the new leadership that would emerge at the convention.\n\nLukman said: \u201cThese are old opportunistic arguments, which was self-serving used by some few vested interests around the president to impose themselves as party leaders and candidates. Many instances were leading to the imposition of candidates during elections, which undermined the electoral viabilities of parties associated with the president. From the defunct All Nigeria Peoples\u2019 Party (ANPP) in 2003 and 2007 to the CPC in 2011, this has been the reality.\n\n\u201cOften, individual politicians with these self-serving agendas have used it to impose themselves on party members as candidates for elections. Although there are many instances whereby imposed candidates win elections, there are also many instances when acts of imposition destroyed the electoral advantages of the parties leading to the loss of elections. This was partly the reason for the large-scale defeat of the CPC in the 2011 election in Kano, Kaduna, Bauchi, Katsina and many states.\u201d\n\nCounselling the old CPC members, Lukman reminded them that, in their rights, they have what it takes to successfully negotiate their emergence as leaders and candidates without resorting to the undemocratic practices of imposition. He said: \u201cMany of them are highly respected leaders of the APC and, therefore, given free and fair environment for electoral contests within the APC, they can win elections to emerge as party leaders and candidates for elective offices. APC leaders and members should therefore appeal to these old CPC leaders to properly integrate themselves in the structures of the APC and develop the needed confidence to freely negotiate for leadership positions based on ability to mobilise support to win majority votes.\u201d\n\nNow that the coast is clear and the March 26 date for the national convention of self-acclaimed Africa\u2019s largest political party is real, political watchers wish the party will get it right by electing leaders that will ensure party supremacy, strict adherence to party constitution and rule of law.",

Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\n\u201cThe nation deserves an intelligent and competent individual with experience of operating a federal governance system and someone who has the knowledge of the complexities of Nigeria. I believe I possess such qualities. A president should be a Nigerian president and not a regional president. A president should come from somewhere and possess the capacity and the competence to fix Nigeria at the moment. The Nigeria of 1998 is different from the Nigeria of 2022.\u201d\n\nHowever, Chief George accused Tambuwal of beating the gun, as the party was yet to take a decision on zoning. \u201cListening to Governor Tambuwal laying out his suggestions, methodologies and proposals, I think in a nutshell, he has put the carts before the horse. How do you win an election first and then come back to zoning? That looks illogical. The founding fathers of this party sat back in 1998 and looked at the first republic to see the mitigating factors for the unnecessary friction in this country and that is how they divided Nigeria into six geopolitical zones. They also looked at the six top positions in the country because in the first Republic, majority had their way, minorities were onlookers which created so much tension and friction which led us to the first coup, civil war and all kinds of instability in the system. So, our founding-fathers having experienced that gave this country a model.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u201cThe constitution of our party, Section 3 (Page 5) sub-section 3D, states unequivocally that zoning and rotation must be the spinal cord of our party; and you know what that means. If your spinal cord is cut, the other parts of the body are paralysed or dead. So, people who are now saying, don\u2019t let us do that are kicking the cart down the road and it will be absolutely preposterous to do that. Let us call a spade a spade.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Governor Tambuwal had admonished PDP to focus more on winning the 2023 presidential poll rather than zoning\n\nSpeaking during a meeting with former members of the House of Representatives and former presiding officers of state Houses of Assembly in Abuja, he reminded the opposition party of how the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2015 ignored zoning and decided on retaining the presidential slot in Katsina State, from where the late president, Umar Yar\u2019Adua, hailed.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cYou can share tickets because you can tear it up, but you must plan to win. PDP must accept this reality. The ticket must be balanced, as zoning or any Muslim-Muslim ticket or Christian-Christian ticket would be dead on arrival and recipes for disaster, he further counseled, pledging not to be lopsided in the allocation of all offices if he is considered for nomination to run for the position of President by the party.\n\nLooking at how governorship and House of Representatives elections were contested and won in Anambra and Plateau states respectively, he analysed factors that the PDP should take into consideration if it wants to win the elections next year: demographics, intra-party wrangling rife in the APC, voter education and rigging; and, indicated that the PDP should be strategic in its nomination of who will bear its flag next year.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nHe said with the APC being stronger in the north with 14 governors; and the PDP sharing the same positions with it in the south, the PDP would have to \u201cthink well, plan well and win this election.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am coming with my pan-Nigerian content, competences in handling federal and governance issues, in addition to having references in all the 360 constituencies in the country who can vouch for me.\n\n\u201cIt has never been this bad for governance in this country, therefore, the President we need is one that understands the country, inclusive in his dealings and one that will allow the rule of law to flourish,\u201d Tambuwal said, explaining that he has all the qualities and what the other aspirants in the PDP lack.\n\n\u201cFrom the array of those running for President now, I dare say that I am closer to the youths,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cage is a factor for what we are doing today,\u201d just as he pointed to many of his achievements as Governor of Sokoto state despite the paucity of funds accruing to the state.\n\nTambuwal added: \u201cFor PDP, I have a question. Are we looking for zoning or winning? Now with due respect, what I\u2019m going to say, I do not mean any offence, see my leader Olisah Metuh I\u2019m going to use your state as a reference point. And with due respect to the people of a Plateau, I\u2019ll use your state as another reference point.\n\n\u201cWe had an election in Anambra State. The governor of Anambra State won the election with 112,000 votes. The person next to him, the PDP candidate, secured about 53,000 votes. The third the APC candidate, had 24,000 votes. The fourth YYP candidate had about 20,000 votes. Put together in that state election, governorship, we had about 220,000 votes in between four political parties.\n\n\u201cJos federal constituency in Plateau State where PDP won, the PDP candidate had about 40,000, PRP had 37,000 then APC 26,000. If you add this, it is close to a 100,000. Federal constituency elections. So democracy is an issue. That is why after the election, I appeal to PDP to look at these elections, and study elections, and by elections, as we progress towards 2023\u2026.\n\n\u201cYes. Atiku contested, Rabiu Musa contested. And Sam Nda Isaiah and Rochas Okorocha contested. But we knew where we\u2019re going because we were determined to win. Let me tell you had, if APC had given that ticket to someone from the south, in particular South South, we couldn\u2019t have won. Go and check the election results of 2007, Buhari had 11 million votes before in 2003. But in 2007, he got 7 million votes against Yar\u2019Adua because they are from the same Katsina. Now, this is for PDP. In the south, as of today, PDP is in eight government houses. APC is also in eight government houses, leaving one; Anambra. In the north, APC is in 14 government houses, PDP is in five government houses. And they have the president. So, I am giving you this analysis so that together, as leaders of our party, who are working towards winning election, not zoning, not winning tickets. Yes we can share ticket and everybody can take his piece and go to his zone. But you must plan to win election.\u201d",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the economy continues to bleed from the negative impact of crude oil theft, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) yesterday disclosed that it had set up a team of experts to carry out a thorough audit of the activities of operators in the sector in the upstream petroleum industry in the last two years.\n\nThe commission stated that the move was to ascertain the actual volume of crude oil stolen by vandals and saboteurs, against recent allegations by some industry operators regarding the volume of crude theft on a daily basis.\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, had on Monday lamented the unprecedented rate of oil theft recorded in recent times and its debilitating effect on government revenue and accretion to reserves.\n\nThe governor\u2019s comment came a day after THISDAY reported similar concerns expressed by the Co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Seplat Energy Plc, Mr. Austin Avuru, who called for a state of emergency in the Nigerian oil and gas sector.\n\nHe had revealed that up to 80 per cent of oil pumped in the country, particularly in the east, were stolen.\n\nAvuru spoke a few days after a businessman and Chairman Heirs Holdings, Mr. Tony Elumelu, also bemoaned the worsening state of the industry, stressing that about 95 per cent of oil production does not get to the terminal.\n\nEarlier, Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company (AEEPCO), operators of the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL) pipeline, had threatened to exit the facility due to incessant vandalism, perennial sabotage and outright theft.\n\nNigeria has not been able to meet its quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), losing close to 400,000 barrels of oil per day to lack of capacity.\n\nOwing to these concerns in the past few days, a statement signed by the Chief Executive of the Commission, Mr. Gbenga Komolafe, disclosed the latest move to unravel the facts behind the theft, stating that the panel would carry out a forensic investigation to cover the technical and commercial operations of oil companies involved in drilling and selling of crude oil.\n\nKomolafe stated that commission was not unaware of the, \u201ctragedy of oil theft\u201d which he noted has been a plague on the industry and had last year triggered an industry-wide initiative aimed at curbing it.\n\nThis, he said, was to help increase crude production levels; a development which he said followed an express presidential directive.\n\n\u201cWorried by incessant acts of sabotage by criminals and some unscrupulous persons within the industry, President Muhammadu Buhari had directed that all necessary mechanisms should be activated to curb oil theft in particular and immediately end other forms of economic sabotage in the oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cAction on the directive commenced immediately and is on-going,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe commission, he affirmed, thus considers worrisome, the crude loss figures recently being quoted in the media by some operators, given actions taken so far on the issue.\n\nTo ascertain the veracity of the claims, the commission, Komolafe explained, has activated all the necessary mechanisms to get to the root of the matter and establish the actual volume of crude stolen as against the volumes claimed.\n\nWhile stepping up efforts to deal with the issue of oil theft in collaboration with the military and other relevant agencies, the commission, he added, has mandated the newly constituted panel to investigate the claims regarding the volume of theft from the various oils fields.\n\nFurthermore, part of the points of reference was for the committee to establish the actual operational capacities of the operators; to find out if the volumes being touted are actual; and if so, what additional measures need to be put in place to effectively address the issue.\n\n\u201cWhile a stakeholders\u2019 meeting has been called to discuss the matter with a view to jointly address the situation, the commission, at a meeting of its management meeting on Monday 21, activated its technical and commercial mandate to demand for the statement of financial accounts of the operators and reservoir accounts of productive oil wells for the last two years.\n\n\u201cThis will entail both sales audit and reservoir audit to establish correlations between their technical and commercial activities vis-a-vis the monitoring and evaluation records available to regulatory agencies,\u201d Komolafe stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Inaugurates $2.5bn Dangote fertiliser plant, new airport terminal, inspects Lekki Deep Seaport\n\n\u2022Assures Nigerians of self-sufficiency in food production, increased forex\n\n\u2022Directs timely completion of seaport\n\n\u2022Emefiele: Investments glaring testament to the president\u2019s foresight, drive for domestic production\n\n\u2022Directs Zainab Ahmed to source special funding for Abuja airport second runway\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Chinedu Eze, Nume Ekeghe, Ugo Aliogo and Gilbert Ekugbe in Lagos\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari inaugurated the $2.5 billion Dangote fertiliser plant yesterday in Lagos, with an assurance that the country was poised to end its massive dependence on imported agricultural products soon.\n\nThe fertiliser plant, with installed capacity of three million metric tonnes of urea per annum, is located in Ibeju-Lekki, within the Lekki Free Trade Zone.\n\nBuhari, who was on a one-day visit to Lagos State, also inspected the Lekki Deep Seaport in the same axis. He directed the timely completion of the seaport.\n\nThe president, then, proceeded to Ikeja to inaugurate the newly built international terminal at the Murtala Muhammed Airport.\n\nEarlier, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, in his goodwill message, stressed that the fertiliser plant was well-timed considering recent developments on the global scene, where the prices of wheat, fertiliser, and crude oil had spiked by over 20 per cent, following the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nAt the Dangote fertiliser plant, the president declared that the plant would further advance his administration\u2019s drive towards self-sufficiency in food production in the country.\n\nAccording to the president, the country also stands to gain extensively in foreign exchange earnings from the fertiliser factory.\n\n\u201cI am informed that we have already started exporting to USA, Brazil, and India,\u201d an elated Buhari said.\n\nHe noted that the operation of the plant had created huge opportunities in the areas of employment, trade, warehousing, transport and logistics. \u201cThis would drastically create wealth, reduce poverty, and secure the future of our nation,\u201d the president stated.\n\nBuhari commended the management of the company for their courage in conceptualising and building the new plant to support his government\u2019s poverty alleviation drive, increase the inflow of foreign exchange, and reduce the country\u2019s dependence on importation of fertiliser.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn particular, I would like to commend the Central Bank of Nigeria, the Development Finance Institutions, and the local and foreign commercial banks that have supported the investor to make these projects a reality.\n\n\u201cDangote Cement holds the enviable record as our continent\u2019s largest cement producer, with footprints in 15 countries. Its integrated cement plants (quarry to bagging) have effectively ended Nigeria\u2019s dependence on imported cement products. \u201cAlong with the several other subsidiaries, Dangote Industries has created thousands of jobs across Nigeria. It is the second biggest employer of labour in this country, after the federal government.\n\n\u201cJob creation by private sector operators is vital to security, as it takes thousands of youths off the street. Dangote Group has been at the forefront of driving the nation\u2019s industrialisation efforts with huge investments in diverse sectors, such as sugarcane plantation and refining, rice, salt, and other allied products, vehicle assembly and logistics.\u201d\n\nThe president noted that in the agricultural sector, another focal point of his administration\u2019s economic policy was to ensure a boom in fertiliser production, saying fertiliser is now readily available.\n\nHe revealed that many Nigerians who hitherto practised subsistence farming because of non-availability of necessary inputs now have the opportunity to take up agriculture as a business.\n\nBuhari said his administration expected the rise of a new breed of agropreneurs, who would add value to farming and make the country self-sufficient in food production. He said the government was focused on providing an enabling environment for private sector investors to thrive.\n\nThe president pointed out that his administration would continue to deliver on infrastructure, power, and security, and enact relevant laws and regulations that would drive investment in the economy.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis new plant is a testament to the widely acknowledged patriotism of Alhaji Aliko Dangote and the leadership of Dangote Industries Limited. It also demonstrates their commitment to the socio-economic development of our country and the well-being of our people.\n\n\u201cWe are partnering with the private sector, via a tax credit scheme, in the rehabilitation of roads across Nigeria under the Presidential Order No. 7. As we all know, good roads contribute to easy movement of goods and services across the nation, thus, reducing cost of doing business and improving productivity.\n\n\u201cWe are also rehabilitating our railway lines and building new ones to lessen the burden on our roads and create more effective multi-model transportation networks.\n\n\u201cIt will be my pleasure to inspect the impressive 650,000 barrels per day refinery and 900,000 tons per annum petrochemical complex, which I look forward to coming back to inaugurate by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cOn a personal note, I commend Alhaji Aliko Dangote for helping to rebrand Nigeria through his mega investments across Africa. He has fuelled job-led growth and transformation of several African economies. I am proud of his contribution to affirming Nigeria\u2019s leadership status in the continent.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Emefiele stated that out that with lessons learnt from the protectionist actions of countries during the early days of COVID-19, the investment was also a glaring testament to the foresight and passion of the president for encouraging domestic production of goods that could be produced in Nigeria, especially agriculture.\n\nHe said this would not only stimulate greater productivity in the agricultural sector but also help in insulating Nigerian farmers from dependence on imported fertiliser.\n\nEmefiele added, \u201cI am delighted, extremely elated indeed, that a Nigerian in the person of Alhaji Aliko Dangote has taken not just this great initiative of helping to solve a perennial petrochemical imports problem, but has taken advantage of the emerging huge market opportunity presented by recent developments.\u201d\n\nEmefiele further described the event as a \u201cstellar\u201d realisation of Buhari\u2019s vision, saying it is timely in the light of the war in Europe.\n\nThe CBN governor applauded Buhari for his determination to support growth in the real sector, which according to him prompted the apex bank and private sector investors to invest in projects targeted at inclusive growth.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am delighted that a Nigerian has taken not just this great initiative of helping to solve our perennial problem of importing petrochemical products, including fertiliser, but has taken advantage of the emerging huge market opportunity presented by recent global developments.\n\n\u201cThis Dangote fertiliser plant with an installed capacity of over three million metric tons per annum is a very significant feat in the diversification agenda of Mr. President. This is because it will help to increase the value chain in the petrol-chemical and allied sector, create jobs for our youths and boost our agricultural productivity.\u201d\n\nEmefiele added, \u201cMr. President, in the early days of my stewardship under you, you made your vision for our country clear to me. This vision was wrapped around the broad theme of self-introspection for local resources and self-sufficiency in local consumption.\n\n\u201cIn summary, you told me that you would like to see urgent support for our farmers, small businesses, and large manufacturers. You wanted to see a Nigeria that produced what it consumed and reduce forex expenditure on agricultural imports.\n\n\u201cGiven our unflinching believe in you, we immediately set out to work at the CBN. We thoroughly studied, deeply assimilated, and enthusiastically implemented this vision from day one of your administration. It is based on the many nights and days of painstaking work in pursuit of this vision that today\u2019s ceremony is emotional for us at the CBN.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the completion of this plant is a stellar example of the realisation of your vision. It is only fitting, therefore, that this plant is being commissioned by Mr. President himself, the original owner and protector of this vision.\n\n\u201cFor your unparalleled leadership and timely vision, and on behalf of my grateful colleagues at the CBN, I say a heartfelt thank you. To avoid losing momentum and backtracking on these gains, we will work hard, every day to protect your legacy and ensure that posterity remembers you for all you have done for our country.\u201d\n\nEmefiele disclosed that prior to Buhari\u2019s assumption of office in 2015, Nigeria imported virtually all its fertiliser products to support the agricultural sector. To address the problem, Emefiele said the president inaugurated the Presidential Fertiliser Initiative, chaired by Jigawa State Governor, Alhaji Muhammad Abubakar and \u201ccharged us with resolving this perennial fertiliser shortage problem in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am delighted to note that their work and the continued support of Mr. President has resulted in a significant increase in our nation\u2019s blending capacity, from seven plants in 2015 to over 48 active fertiliser blending plants today.\n\n\u201cIndeed, during the past five years, over 35 million bags of blended fertiliser has been produced in Nigeria. Consequently, our import bill on fertiliser has not only declined significantly but we are also witnessing rising investment in the fertiliser industry, such as the one being commissioned today by the Dangote Group.\n\n\u201cToday, Nigeria is self-sufficient in the production of urea, and we are also the leading producer of urea in the African continent. There is no doubt that improving access to fertiliser will contribute to significant improvements in the productivity of our local farmers.\n\n\u201cBut probably more importantly, it will enhance our nation\u2019s drive to improve food security and ensure we consume what we produce in Nigeria, thereby fulfilling another key promise and vision of this administration.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWith sustained efforts, other indigenous companies like Indorama and Notore with a combined capacity of over 2.5 million tons per annum have tried to match the market demand, yet the country still faced a huge shortfall of fertiliser supply.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said the Lekki Free Trade Zone was conceived by former governor of the state, Senator Bola Tinubu, in 2003, to attract investments to the state.\n\nOn his part, Minister of Trade, Industry and Investment, Niyi Adebayo, said although the fertiliser complex was just one part of the Dangote Refinery project, \u201cthis part alone offers unquantifiable value\u201d to the economy.\u201d\n\nAdebayo added, \u201cI am aware that this facility has the potential to produce three million metric jobs per annum of urea fertiliser in phase one alone. This will go a long way in bridging the current fertiliser gap and improving soil and farm yields.\n\n\u201cOne of the federal government\u2019s key ambitions is for Nigeria to be both self-sufficient in food production, and also to be a net exporter of food and value added products. The Dangote Fertiliser Plant goes a long way in realising this vision not just for Nigeria, but for the entire continent.\n\n\u201cDangote fertiliser has the potential to meet not just Nigeria\u2019s needs, but at its current capacity, it will earn the country millions of dollars from exports. It will also help with the unemployment problem our current country is currently faced with.\u201d\n\nThe president of Dangote Group expressed delight over the success of the fertiliser plant. Dangote said the plant was the largest in Africa and the second-largest urea plant in the world.\n\nHe said products from plants have reached the African market, and across Brazil, India, and Mexico.\n\nAccording to Dangote, \u201cIt is an ambitious project that will reduce unemployment in Nigeria. Low fertiliser usages have been the reason for low yield of agriculture products in the sector.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make fertiliser available in quantity for our farmers. We are rolling out initiatives that will transform the agric sector for all. This will boost productivity and enhance output across the nation.\n\n\u201cWe believe that many new farmers will emerge in the nation, providing millions of jobs and ushering us into the era of agricultural entrepreneurs, (agroprenuers). These breed of agroprenuers will take to farming on large scales, providing food and raw materials for our industries.\n\n\u201cWe are rolling out innovations that will transform the agricultural sector in the form of extension services for small and medium scale farmers. We have acquired a well-equipped fertiliser soil-testing laboratory to enable us to analyse and identify a particular soil deficiency and the appropriate fertiliser blend. Applying the right fertiliser to the soil will boost productivity. This service is to cover all the geopolitical zones and has the capacity to transform farming into a lucrative profession.\n\n\u201cDangote Fertiliser works with farmer associations, corporate farms, NPK blenders, NGO/development partners and state governments all over Nigeria, and governments across Africa and beyond who are looking for sustainable approach to improve soil quality and farm yields.\u201d\n\nHe appreciated the CBN and other agencies of government for their support.\n\nBuhari Tours Lekki Deep Seaport\n\nBuhari also praised the efforts of the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, towards making the Lekki Deep Seaport in Lagos a reality.\n\nHe directed him to consult and bring up a memorandum to the Federal Executive Council (FEC) to link the facility with the railway network and also to ensure its timely completion.\n\nAs part of his engagements in Lagos, the president inspected the pace of work at the first Deep Seaport in Nigeria located in Lagos Free Zone, 65Km east of Lagos.\n\nIn the course of the inspection, Buhari received firm assurances that the port, which has a concession period of 45 years and sits in a land area of 90 hectares, would be completed on schedule by September.\n\nAmaechi while speaking during the tour, revealed that the Ibom Deep Seaport had gotten the federal government\u2019s approval to begin operations in the country. Besides, the minister stated that the federal government was also fast pursuing the Badagry seaport in its bid to decongest the Apapa and Tin Can ports.\n\nHe stated, \u201cBy the time we leave office, all those people who would have been granted approval are all private seaports. The only one that the government will participate in its ownership is the Bonny Seaport because the minster is from Rivers State.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said the president\u2019s inspection would publicise the seaport and put pressure on the owners to complete the port project in earnest\n\nThe minister said, \u201cThe port is almost ready, if not for the equipment, they can actually get this place ready before June, but they said the equipment are arriving by June and installation will take them till September and then it can be commissioned in September.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe miracle of bringing the president here, that is why it is important for a president to inspect projects, this will hasten the process of completion if there is money.\u201d\n\nReacting to a question over possible traffic congestion if the seaport begins operation, the minister stated that the country was broke and unable to build a rail network.\n\nDangote \u201cWe don\u2019t have money, if you give us money we will build railway here. As the Minister of Transport I do not do roads. These are private investment so they can get private investors. \u201cThis seaport is not our business; it is private investment. You should be asking for money for Bonny seaport and others where Government may be interested in putting their money,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThis is a private port, not a government port, so no agency will run here. The agencies will be present but they will not run here because it is a private port and here is heavily automated so we won\u2019t have too many staff working here.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t see it the way you see Apapa Port and all goods won\u2019t come to Lagos, goods will go to Warri, Port Harcourt and what the government needs to do is to either rehabilitate those ports or build new ones. I am convinced that we should commence work in Bonny deep seaport before we leave office,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Managing Director, Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Mohammed Bello-Koko, said the Lekki Deep Seaport would be ready for test run in September this year after which the first commercial visit would be received at the port.\n\nBello-Koko, who noted that the commencement of Lekki Port would reduce the rate of traffic at Apapa and Tin-Can Island Ports, said there would be Ship-to-Shore (STS) cranes that will enable faster processing of goods.\n\n\u201cSome of the businesses we have lost to other neighbouring West African countries due to draught limitation would be regained. There will be employment creation and increase revenue for government.\n\n\u201cIt will create competition and compel other terminal operators to up their games to reduce cargo dwell time at their terminals. Apapa and Tin-Can Island Ports have been operating far beyond their capacity which means that the excess cargoes that have been going there would be diverted to Lekki Port.\u201d\n\nExecutive Secretary, Nigerian Shippers\u2019 Council (NSC), Emmanuel Jime had lamented the method of evacuating cargoes in the country, saying that Nigeria is yet to put in place the necessary infrastructure that would allow for quick evacuation from the Lekki Deep Seaport.\n\nBuhari Pledges More Support in Infrastructure Development\n\nBuhari also said his administration had prioritised infrastructure development to spur the creation of jobs and boost the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nHe directed the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and Planning to make funds available for the building of a second runway at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. Buhari stated these when he unveiled the new terminal at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos yesterday.\n\nThe president said despite the lean resources at the disposal of the administration, especially in its first tenure, he sustained the infrastructural projects he inherited and initiated new ones.\n\nHe pointed out that because of the importance of having modern airport facilities, his administration had completed the four new terminals at the four major airports in the country.\n\nWith the inauguration of the new international terminal in Lagos, the completed terminal at the Mallam Aminu would International Airport, Kano, the four airport facilities started in 2013 by the Chinese and Nigerian government, collaboration would have come on stream.\n\n\u201cOur continuous investment in the building of long lasting infrastructure in the aviation, road and rail transportation, agriculture, telecommunications and other critical sectors is yielding massive results, and the people of Nigeria are now increasingly attesting to benefiting from the associated dividends.\n\n\u201cStarting from the year 2015 when we commenced our first tenure in office as a government, we have been deliberate and consistent in identifying and investing in critical projects that would improve the standard of living of our people, as well as contribute immensely to our growth and development as a nation,\u201d the president said.\n\nHe noted that despite obvious limitations in terms of availability of resources, \u201cour investments in inter-state rail connectivity, road networks, agriculture, power and telecommunications, just to mention a few, have been unprecedented.\u201d\n\nBuhari said taking into cognisance the importance of airport infrastructure as a catalyst for economic growth, enhancement of foreign direct investment and development globally, his administration decided to prioritise the completion and delivery of five brand new international terminals, which were at 11 per cent completion level when we came into power in 2015.\n\n\u201cGovernment is responding by further investments and partnerships in the sector to tend to this challenge. Consequently, the Minister of Aviation has been directed to fast track the airport concession programme.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the Abuja second runway is being fast tracked. The Minister of FB&NP has been directed to source special funding for the project while the MFCT is directed to conclude the titling of the approved 12,000 hectares of land to accommodate the runway and other developmental projects.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, called on the CBN to release the $283 million blocked funds for foreign airlines and subsequently pay them as they earn their revenue so that there would no more be blocked funds in Nigeria.\n\nSirika also urged the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) to import aviation fuel (Jet A-1) in large qualities to overcome the current scarcity and urged CBN to make forex available to major marketers to import the product.\n\nSirika also called for the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions to enhance seamless air travel, which is a catalyst to the development of any country. he said\n\nBello-Koko, \u201cMr. President is aware of the recent chaos in the sector caused by lack of Jet-A. Flights are unduly delayed and/or cancelled unpleasantly. While apologizing to our teaming passengers, I wish to use this medium to humbly request Mr. President to direct NNPC to import Jet-Al in good quantities and devise means to sustain supply as well as directing CBN to allocate Forex for the major marketers to sustain supply.\u201d\n\nThe minister assured that the airport concession project (including the newly commissioned terminals) had reached advanced stage and promised that his ministry would be issuing Request for Proposal (RFP) to the shortlisted firms before the end of March.\n\n\u201cWe expect to announce a partner in 2nd Quarter 2022 and handover by 4th Quarter 2022,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the new terminal he said, \u201cThis terminal you are about to commission has the capacity to process 14 million passengers per annum. There are 66Nos. check-in counters, 5Nos. baggage collection carousels, 16Nos. Immigration Desks at Arrival, 28 Nos. Desks at Departure, 8Nos. Security Screening Points, 6Nos. passenger boarding bridges with remote boarding and arrival. Other facilities include 2Nos. food courts, 4Nos. premium lounges, 22Nos. guest rooms and Spars, 16Nos, airline ticketing offices, visa on arrival and port health facility, praying areas, more than 3,000sqm duty free spaces and over 5,000sqm let-table utility spaces.\u201d\n\nThe highlight of the event was the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and the Lagos State government for the construction of access roads linking the airport from Ikotun, Sasha and Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway.\n\nThe Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, signed on behalf of the state government, while FAAN Managing Director, Captain Hamisu Yadudu signed on behalf of the agency.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Reveals state has about N109bn debt, N300m cash\n\n\u2022Says altercation between Bianca, Obiano\u2019s wife comic relief\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new governor of Anambra State, Professor Chukwuma Soludo, yesterday said although the problems confronting the state remained daunting, with the backing of the people, the new government was poised to record huge successes.\n\nThe governor, who spoke on ARISE Television, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, stated that he had in possession a blueprint and that with the various documents at his disposal, he fully understands where the state is headed in the coming years.\n\nHowever, asked about the state of the state\u2019s finances and where the funding for his numerous projects will come from, the former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), noted that although the resources were paltry and \u201calmost zero\u201d, he knew about the problems before applying for the job.\n\nSoludo explained that from the records at his disposal, Anambra had a debt of about N109 billion and between N300 million to N400 million in cash.\n\nHe stated, \u201cBut we are undaunted, as I said in my inaugural speech. We\u2019ll get water out of the stone, with the people working with us, mobilising with us, we will be able to get water out of stone. Anambra has all the potential, but also equally matched with the challenges.\u201d\n\nWithin the context of what he described as Nigeria\u2019s \u201cunitary federalism\u201d, the governor promised to govern creatively and collaborate with the federal government as well as development partners to maximise the limited resources available..\n\n\u201cAnd given the available resources that we have, we\u2019re going to explore all kinds of creative means of revenues beyond the usual, so to speak, to be able to collect revenues to do these things,\u201d he stressed.\n\nSoludo pledged that with on-going the discussions with all stakeholders, including the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), the weekly forced stay-at-home will be a thing of the past soon.\n\nWhile acknowledging that there will be resistance to the change the state was about to experience, the governor promised to meet those who will try to stop the job of \u201cliberating\u201d the Anambra people \u201cin the streets.\u201d\n\nSoludo said, \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to meet them in the streets and liberate the common man in the streets. This government is about the common man. Law and order are going to be the very first essence; it is at the foundation of everything, of every society. We must restore law and order,\u201d he stressed.\n\nPressured to disclose what he met in terms of the state\u2019s finances, Soludo said there was already an audited account, which he said was a public document at the end of December 1, 2021, but added that a lot of reconciliations will still need to be done.\n\nThe former CBN governor said, \u201cBut everybody knows that the state finances are not quite robust, to put it mildly. Debt is probably in the range of a hundred and something billion. Then cash a few hundred million. That\u2019s what I saw. That\u2019s the base.\n\n\u201cBut we are still going to have reconciliations and have all the accounts from January to the date that we took over. And I think it\u2019s best practise actually, when you ask this question. We intend to have a very transparent public finance management system where we will publish everything.\n\n\u201cEverybody will know what is there and what is not there, what penny comes in what and what it is used for, and that is the aspiration. That\u2019s part of what we promised in our manifesto. Very transparent public finance management.\n\n\u201cIf I remember correctly, the cash in various banks is about N300 million or N400 and then the audited accountants as at December would be debt of about N109 billion. That\u2019s what I saw.\n\n\u201cBut we will take it from there. For me, that\u2019s the baseline. When we do the other contingent liabilities, contractor debts and the other issues. It\u2019s not what happened, but it\u2019s where we draw the line and then move on, but that\u2019s the baseline.\u201d\n\nHe described his predecessor, Mr Willy Obiano, as a good man and honourable man, adding that he wasn\u2019t envisaging any friction with him and his (Soludo\u2019s) deputy in the future.\n\nPlaying down on the altercation between Bianca, the wife of the late Igbo leader, Odimegwu Ojukwu, during his inauguration, Soludo noted that it was some form of comic relief, explaining that to him, it never detracted from the event.\n\nSoludo said, \u201cWhen you were talking about the cat fight, I was just laughing and because of all the funny videos that have emerged from this, for me it\u2019s just a comic relief.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the comedy that has emerged from it all that I have enjoyed. There is no distraction whatsoever. I think it was meant to be. Sometime to come, there will even be some movies or comedies and even a song out of that.\n\n\u201cAs you saw, I didn\u2019t even notice much of what happened. I think it happened while I was going to sign the oath of allegiance. It was just like a one-second thing. I turned again and continued signing my thing and I have not had one minute discussing it, other than the comic relief you see posted. We are intensely focused on what we must deliver to our people.\u201d\n\nHe promised to hit the ground running, Soludo said that he has roughly four years to make good his plans, noting that there\u2019s no time to waste on frivolities.\n\n\u201cWe have four years to do this. And actually, it\u2019s three years and eight months, that\u2019s why we are not going to miss any one minute.\n\n\u201cBut for me, I\u2019m just waiting on the list of commissioners which will get to the Assembly and hopefully in the next two days will read the list and then we\u2019ll get to work. And once they give me an approval for the commissioners, we hit the road, but even in-between that, things will happen.\u201d\n\nHe promised to give priority to made in Anambra goods and Nigerian made products,\u201d because it is the way the world works.\u201d\n\nOn security, Soludo said, \u201cThe discussions are on-going. As I announced on my inaugural speech, my first meeting was on security. So I am fully briefed, the conversations are going on and I believe strongly that we\u2019ll get it cracked, probably not going to be done in one day, but we\u2019re going to crack it.\n\n\u201cThe sit-at-home thing will definitely end and we are having conversations with all the stakeholders, IPOB and everybody else, trying to engage everybody. It is the people\u2019s power that will prevail at the end of the day.\n\n\u201cAnd I know that that will definitely stop and we\u2019re working on that. Like I said, we are determined to restore law and order,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari says the 2.5 billion dollar Dangote Fertiliser Plant in Ibeju Lekki, Lagos, will boost Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange earnings and accelerate economic growth.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Buhari spoke on Tuesday while inaugurating the three million metric tonnes per annum urea production plant.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis fertiliser plant is further expected to enhance our administration\u2019s drive towards achieving self-sufficiency in food production in the country.\n\n\u201cI commend the Chairman, Board and Management of Dangote Industries Ltd., for their business initiative in establishing this plant.\n\n\u201cIt will reduce our dependence on importation of fertiliser, create jobs, increase the inflow of foreign exchange and accelerate economic growth.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the establishment of the plant demonstrates the commitment of Dangote Industries Ltd. to the socio-economic development of the country and the well-being of Nigerians.\n\nThe president expressed optimism that the investment in the plant would replicate the group\u2019s earlier experience in the cement sector where it had become a leading name in Nigeria and across the African continent.\n\nHe said: \u201cDangote Industries Ltd. has created thousands of jobs across Nigeria. It is the second biggest employer of labour in this country after the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThis is very pleasing because job creation by the private sector will help to improve security and take thousands of youths off the streets.\u201d\n\nThe president said the nation also stood to gain extensively in forex earnings through excess production and exports from the plant.\n\n\u201cI am informed that you have already started exporting to other countries including the United States, India and Brazil.\n\n\u201cThe coming on stream of the plant is creating huge opportunities in the area of job creation, trade, transport and logistics to earn significant wealth, reduce poverty and helping to secure the future of our nation,\u201d said Buhari.\n\nHe noted that the agricultural sector was a critical aspect of the economy and availability and affordability of fertiliser would lead to increased yields for farmers.\n\nBuhari added that he was expecting a rise of new breeds of \u2018agropreneurs\u2019 who would take to farming and make the nation self-sufficient in food production.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to assure all Nigerians that our government is focused on providing the enabling environment for the private sector to thrive.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to improve on infrastructure, power and security and other initiatives that will drive investments in our economy.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we are partnering with the private sector through a tax credit scheme for the rehabilitation of roads across Nigeria under the Executive Order Seven.\n\n\u201cWe know good roads contribute to easy movement of goods and services across the nation thus reducing the cost of doing business and improving productivity.\n\n\u201cWe are also rehabilitating our railway lines and building new ones to lessen the burden on our roads and create an effective modern transportation network.\u201d\n\nMr Godwin Emefiele, Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), lauded the Buhari-led administration for the support to end shortage of fertiliser in the country.\n\nEmefiele noted that this had led to a significant increase of active fertiliser blending plants in Nigeria from seven in 2015 to 48 in 2022.\n\nHe said the import bill on fertiliser had not only dropped significantly but the country was now earning forex through exportation of fertiliser.\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said the Lekki Free Trade Zone was conceived by former Governor Bola Tinubu in 2003 to attract investments to the state.\n\nHe said the free trade zone today was host to Dangote Fertiliser Plant, which was the largest fertiliser plant in Africa and the second largest in the world.\n\nThe governor said there was also the 650,000BPD Dangote Refinery and Petrochemical Plant and the Lekki Deep Sea Port within the same axis, making it a prime investment destination.\n\nOn their parts, Mr Niyi Adebayo, Minister of Trade, Industry and Investment and Dr Mohammad Abubakar, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, enjoined other companies to emulate the strides of Dangote Industries Ltd.\n\nEarlier, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, President, Dangote Industries Ltd., said the fertiliser plant would drastically reduce the level of unemployment and youth restiveness through generation of direct and indirect employments.\n\nDangote said: \u201cAgriculture accounts for over 20 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product, and the country is a leading producer of various agricultural commodities.\n\n\u201cThe sector has the potential of becoming the biggest source of income for our nation, providing employment and raw materials for industries.\n\n\u201cHowever, low fertiliser usage has been a major reason for low productivity in the sector.\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge that nonavailability of the product, in quantity and quality, rather than affordability, is the primary constraint to the use of fertiliser.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make fertiliser available in sufficient quantities and quality for our teeming farmers, assuring greater agricultural output.\u201d (NAN)\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Emefiele: Unprecedented Oil Theft Affecting Economy",
          "text": "\u2022CBN leaves MMR unchanged at 11.5%, predicts moderation in food prices\n\n\u2022Urges NNPC to ensure adequate fuel supply to check price arbitrage by marketers\n\n\u2022Says Infraco up and running, secures N250bn in bridge finance\n\nJames Emejo\n\n\n\nGovernor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday lamented the unprecedented rate of oil theft recorded in recent times and its debilitating effect on government revenue and accretion to reserves. Emefiele said this while briefing journalists at the end of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in Abuja.\n\nAfter MPC meeting, the second in 2022, the CBN resolved to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), otherwise known as the interest rate, at 11.5 per cent with the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR.\n\nBut Emefiele urged the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) to take urgent steps to ensure adequate supply of petroleum products in the country to reduce the rate of arbitrary increase in price of these petroleum products by oil marketers.\n\nThe CBN governor\u2019s comment came a day after THISDAY reported similar concern expressed by Co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Seplat Energy Plc, Mr. Austin Avuru, who called for a state of emergency in the Nigerian oil and gas sector, revealing that up to 80 per cent of oil pumped in the country, particularly in the East, is stolen. Avuru spoke few days after a businessman and Chairman Heirs Holdings, Mr. Tony Elumelu, also bemoaned the worsening state of the industry, stressing that about 95 per cent of oil production does not get to the terminal. Elumelu has his oil assets in the Niger Delta.\n\nJust about a week ago, Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company (AEEPCO), operators of the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL) pipeline, threatened to exit the facility due to incessant vandalism, perennial sabotage and outright theft.\n\nThe company sated, \u201cAEEPCO remains gravely concerned about the persistent heightened attack on our production facilities and the NCTL. These attacks appear to have escalated in intensity and effect.\n\n\u201cAll our current efforts to sustain and increase crude production are being aggressively undermined, even wiped out by the activities of economic saboteurs whose audacity continues to be growing by the day.\u201d\n\nAiteo disclosed that its NCTL had been targeted, with considerable success, for the sole and devastating objective of aiding crude theft.\n\nThe company stated that given the level of losses, occasioned by massive oil theft, it was experiencing, as joint operator of the NNPC/AITEO JV, it was now left with the unavoidable option of actualising a total exit from the NCTL.\n\n\u201cWe are giving active and urgent consideration to this course of action because the consequences of continuing to operate in this manner now represents an existential threat to our survival,\u201d the firm stated.\n\nThe CBN also left other monetary policy parameters unchanged, namely the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) at 27.5 per cent and Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nMPR is the rate at which the CBN lends to commercial banks and it often determines the cost of borrowing in the economy.\n\nThe MPC also voted to maintain CRR at 27.5 per cent as well as the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nThe CBN governor said six out of the 10 MPC members present voted to retain monetary parameters, adding that while loosening could trigger liquidity surfeit in the system, a tightening stance would impact the fragile recovery of the economy, reverse credit expansion and yet, fall short of taming inflation.\n\nEmefiele, who read the committee\u2019s communiqu\u00e9, however expressed worry that whereas global oil prices had gone up, this had been compounded by shortage of supply of petroleum products.\n\nThe CBN also expressed optimism that in the medium term, the proposed take-off of the Dangote refinery this year, would help to improve the supply of petroleum products in the country.\n\nEmefiele said the CBN remained optimistic that food prices would trend downwards in 2022 as security agencies sustain efforts to subdue the activities of bandits so as to allow farmers back to their farmers.\n\nHe said, \u201cAnd now what we are saying is that if farmers are able to access their farms, do they have the wherewithal to procure the inputs, seeds, fertilizer and other inputs with which they can go back to the farm and farm? We are making all those available. And that is why we still remain reasonably optimistic that food prices would moderate in 2022.\u201d\n\nHe said the MPC further noted with concern the effect, which the global price increase in petroleum and other products was having on all economies. He pointed out that this had resulted in imported inflation on the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe committee believed that specific actions were required to ensure that the trend did not continue, given the adverse consequences and aggressive rising price level could have on the cost of living and purchasing power of Nigerians.\n\nEmefiele noted that before the Russia-Ukraine war, the MPC was optimistic that the moderate decline in inflation was sustainable due to the positive impact of good harvest on price levels. But it expressed worry that, whereas global prices had gone up, this had been compounded by the shortage of supply of petroleum products.\n\nHe added that the rising price of diesel had been compounded by the inadequate electricity supply, which has adversely impacted domestic prices.\n\nThe MPC, however, advised the CBN and the fiscal authorities to take specific and urgent actions to avoid many power generating stations shutdown for turn-around maintenance, resulting in the current unwarranted shutdown of generating assets.\n\nThe CBN said the committee was, nonetheless, relieved that food inflation declined marginally due to good harvest.\n\nEmefiele added, \u201cAlthough some scarcity is expected as we approach the planting season, the committee is optimistic that with the high level of strategic grain reserves of the CBN, it is relieved that food prices would remain relatively moderated.\u201d\n\nThe committee further advised the apex bank to redouble its development finance initiatives aimed at boosting domestic food output, which would help in moderating food inflation. going forward, thereby moderating headline inflation.\n\nOn the global scene, the committee noted with concern the recent heightening of uncertainties confronting the recovery of the global economy as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and numerous sanctions against Russia, introduced a new dimension of risk to the tepid recovery of the global economy.\n\nAmong other things, the committee took into cognisance the lingering headwinds associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and global supply chain constraints, rising inflationary pressure, and more recently, the progression of an interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve Bank and Bank of England (BOE).\n\nMembers noted that the on-going war and the resultant sanctions against Russia will continue to have a considerable impact on the global supply chain as both countries are major players in the global commodities market.\n\nEmefiele said global financial conditions were thus, expected to tighten in the short-term as the investment horizon gradually becomes clearer, adding that this is expected to impact capital flows to emerging market economies as risk-averse portfolio investors adopt a wait-and-see approach.\n\nHe said the risks to the overall recovery of the global economy remained heightened and called for cautious policy manoeuvring to avoid a sharp downturn, such as experienced in 2020.\n\nProviding update on the N15 trillion Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria (Infraco), the CBN governor said the company had commenced operation in earnest, adding that it has secured about N250 billion bridged loans to finance three projects.\n\nHe told journalists, \u201cInfraco is set up, the board is running and the MD has been appointed, asset managers have been appointed. We have currently three assets that are under finance. We\u2019ve done bridge finance of almost about N250 billion for that purpose and the remaining sum, asset managers are going to be going into the data room to see the numbers, to determine viability of those roads\u2026Lagos- Ibadan, Abuja-Kano-Kaduna (AKK) project as well as the second Niger Bridge which is almost completed now.\n\n\u201cI am sure we are only meant to complete the funding that the federal government has put into it before now. And we will do it. And the Permanent Secretary, Finance, who also is assisting at least in terms of collaboration between fiscal and monetary authority also assured that there are pipelines of infrastructure to be looked at.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOf course, Infraco as an institution that looks at commercial viability, we will look at each of those projects, determine their commercial viability and determine particularly how would revenue be realised to repay the loans and from there it would be done.\n\n\u201cSo I believe we are on the fast mode and 2022 would be a very aggressive year in the tenure of Infraco.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "How Amnesty International Turns Blind Eye To Human Rights Abuses In Nigeria, Bullies Staff",
          "text": "Following allegations of a secret alliance between Amnesty International Nigeria (AIN) and the Department of State Services (DSS), The ICIR digs deeper, reaching out to the current and old staff of the AIN, board of directors, activists, security agents, lawyers and victims of human rights violations in Nigeria.\n\nA CIVIL servant, Desmond Nunugwo, 50, was arrested by EFCC operatives on June 9, 2016, over a fraudulent business transaction allegation. The following day, the man died.\n\nThe deceased\u2019s wife, Susan Nunugwo, said her husband was neither ill nor diagnosed with sickness before the EFCC took him away.\n\nShe then visited Amnesty International Nigeria, AIN, seeking help to get justice for her late husband.\n\nThe AIN interim Country Director, Makmid Kamara, a Sierra Leonean, instructed the staff to design a campaign plan since the Nigerian authorities had ignored calls to investigate Nunugwo\u2019s death.\n\nA renowned pathologist at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital was contacted, and he agreed to carry out an autopsy on the body.\n\nNunugwo\u2019s family was happy with AIN\u2019s plan and looking forward to getting justice.\n\nThen a change of guard at Amnesty Nigeria brought Osai Ojigho as the new Country Director. And that was when things began to fall apart.\n\n\u201cOsai started playing games with the family, giving them excuses and stopped them from seeing her on several occasions. One day, she calmly advised Desmond\u2019s widow to go home and bury her husband,\u201d a former staff of AIN who knew about the case told The ICIR.\n\nThe African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, in its decision dated November 10, 2019, also confirmed Amnesty\u2019s curious withdrawal from the case.\n\nSix years down the line, the family is yet to find closure to the mystery of Desmond\u2019s death.\n\nIn May 2018, a human rights lawyer and activist, Frank Tietie, wrote a dispiriting letter to Kamara, who had returned to work at Amnesty International Secretariat in London as Deputy Director Global Issues and Head of ESCR Team.\n\nIn the letter, Tietie, Executive Director, Citizens Advocacy for Social and Economic Rights, expressed disappointment at the state of human rights observation and enforcement in Nigeria and blamed Ojigho\u2019s management style at AIN.\n\n\u201cIt is more worrisome to me that the Director of Amnesty International, Nigeria, Osai Ojigho is more eager to find justifications for neither responding nor interfering in the grave but trending human rights issues of serious national concern, in Nigeria, on the grounds that such issues are outside the set thematic areas of Amnesty International for 2018,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOne of such cases Tietie complained about was that of married women sacked by GLOBACOM, a Nigerian telecom company. The women were fired because they were married and no longer looked \u201csexy\u201d to be effective marketers. Globacom refuted the claim though.\n\nEtitie believed such a decision by a corporate organisation is a gender-based human rights violation against the provision of Article 11 of CEDAW. The law forbids discrimination against women in the field of employment.\n\nHe wanted AIN to make a strong statement against such discrimination, but Ojigho was uninterested.\n\n\u201cShe literally snapped at me saying Amnesty International had its set issues already for the year and did not include issues of such,\u201d Tietie wrote in the mail.\n\nAn attempt for a meeting to explain why Amnesty should be interested in the case was rebuffed. Tietie said the incident rocked his relationship with Amnesty Nigeria.\n\nAnother human rights lawyer who severed a relationship with Amnesty Nigeria is Justus Ijeoma.\n\nThe lawyer reported to the AIN the case of Gift Oyinyechi, the widow of Collins Ezenwa. The latter was killed on the kidnapping allegation by the Intelligence Response Team, IRT, led by the disgraced police officer, Abba Kyari.\n\nAfter Ezenwa\u2019s death, Kyari and his team allegedly seized the deceased\u2019s properties and began to deplete them after warning the wife to stay away.\n\nThe lawyer, Ijeoma, reported the case to National Human Right Commission and Amnesty, Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor two weeks, the widow was detained in Lagos, despite losing her husband. We reached out to Amnesty, and they promised to help. They asked the widow to come to their office in Abuja, and after the engagement, they promised to get back to us, they never did. We presented our case at the panel raised by Vice President Osinbajo, but Amnesty backed out without explanation.,\u201d he told The ICIR during a phone conversation.\n\nIn a similar pattern, Ojigho allegedly turned a blind eye several times to the gross violation of human rights in northeast Nigeria.\n\nIn his letter of resignation, Malik Samuel, an AIN conflict researcher, noted that Amnesty International, despite all available information, kept silent as the Nigerian military forcibly displaced an entire Borno town of about 10,000 civilians on suspicion of aiding and abetting Boko Haram.\n\nAnd when the military shut down Daily Trust newspaper\u2019s offices in Abuja and Maiduguri a month to the presidential election in 2019 and arrested workers, Ojigho ignored the call of her staff members who advised that Amnesty should make a public statement.\n\n\u201cWe did not respond and only tweeted after the siege had ended, even though we had all the information about one hour after the attack started,\u201d Malik wrote in his goodbye letter, which was shared with other staff.\n\nAlso, when Amnesty Nigeria documented the Rann attack of January 27, 2019, by Boko Haram that left about 60 civilians dead, Ojigho allegedly removed a significant part of the report that questioned the role of the military even though the evidence of negligence has been established and carefully verified by LawPol, a department of the Amnesty International in London that vets report before publication.\n\nThose familiar with Amnesty\u2019s dithering, self-censorship and apparent aloofness have begun to wonder about what could have gone wrong.\n\n\u201cThis is not Amnesty International that we used to know,\u201d said Ijeoma, the Executive Director, International Human Rights and Equity Defense Foundation (I-REF).\n\nAmnesty International: A hypocritical global force for good?\n\nAmnesty International describes itself as a global movement that takes injustice personally.\n\n\u201cWe are campaigning for a world where human rights are enjoyed by all,\u201d Amnesty International declares on its website.\n\nThe organisation started in 1961 when two Portuguese students were jailed just for raising a toast to freedom. A British lawyer Peter Benenson was outraged and wrote an article that launched a global campaign and built solidarity for justice and freedom.\n\nMore than 60 years after, the movement has spread to 70 countries, including those in Africa.\n\nAmnesty International markets manifesto for a better world, but happenings in its Nigeria office contradicts the values it publicly espouses.\n\nInformation obtained from Amnesty\u2019s staff and human rights community in Nigeria show that AIN frequently dismisses and drops cases of human rights violations, bullies staff who hold the organisation accountable to its own principles, runs a poorly transparent accounting system and betrays hopes of victims of injustice who look up to it.\n\nThe situation in Amnesty International Nigeria is disappointing, \u201cespecially for those of us dealing with the Amnesty International before the Nigerian office was set up, said Ijeoma.\n\n\u201cWe know the amount of effort we put in before Amnesty Nigeria was set up in Nigeria. We think it is going to help the human rights community in Nigeria. Now the organisation has derailed. Amnesty has become a dog that barks without biting.\u201d\n\nA journalist, Peter Nkanga who anchored one of BBC\u2019s documentary holds a similar view about AIN.\n\nIn 2019, the journalist and activist wrote a letter to the Amnesty International Secretariat in London, complaining about how Ojigho-led Amnesty ignored calls to help a dying journalist, Olomofe, who was attacked by suspected smugglers aided by the Nigerian Custom officers.\n\nSenior ranking Customs officers had invited Olomofe to their offices at Seme to discuss allegations that customs officers were complicit in corruption and smuggling activities at the border. In the presence of Custom personnel, over a dozen men beat Olomofe into a coma, and he later became bed-ridden and has been in the death throes since then.\n\nNkanga reported the matter to Amnesty, but nothing was done.\n\nIn another instance, he recounted how Amnesty Nigeria jumped ship at the last hour from the peaceful protests planned with the Coalition of Nigerian Media and Civil Society Groups. The procession was scheduled to hold at the Saudi Arabia Embassy in Abuja over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\u201cWith no explanations given till date, AI-Nigeria did not show up for the protest,\u201d Ikanga wrote in the letter copied to the Secretary-General Amnesty International, Kumi Naidoo; former Director of People and Organisational Development, Debby Morrell; Senior Director of Global Operations at Amnesty International, Minar Pimple; Regional Director for West and Central Africa, Marie-Evelyne Petrus-Barry; and Africa Director, Research and Advocacy, Netsanet Belay.\n\nRights activists who spoke to The ICIR recall the days when Amnesty International was churning out powerful reports about human rights violations in Nigeria, such as \u201cWelcome to Hellfire,\u201d a September 2014 publication that revealed the experiences of former detainees who have been tortured in police and military custody and the failure of the Nigerian government to prevent such violations or to bring suspected perpetrators to justice.\n\n\u201cStars on their Shoulders: Blood on their Hands\u201d was also published in June 2015. The report documented how the Nigerian military forces have extrajudicially executed more than 1,200 people; arbitrarily arrested at least 20,000 people, primarily young men and boys; and committed countless acts of torture.\n\nThe following year, \u201cYou Have Signed Your Death Warrant\u201d was published. The report chronicled the cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).\n\nAll these reports were published before Ojigho became the country director.\n\n\u201cSince Osai took over, what reasonable work has the Amnesty Nigeria done,\u201d asked Ijeoma during a telephone interview with The ICIR.\n\nBefore he left in April 2019, Malik also expressed his frustration about the quality of work under Ojigho.\n\n\u201cI find our lack of urgency in responding to human rights abuses, especially in the northeast, in great contrast with the Amnesty International I knew, and this is very frustrating. There have been too several incidents where my research was not used, watered down, or I was told not strategic to speak out.\u201d\n\nMonths later, another former staff of AIN, Damian Ugwu, in his testimony recounted how Ojigho nearly revoked the status of prisoners of conscience earlier granted to Omoyele Sowore, Olawale Bakare and Agba Jalingo, who were then in detention.\n\nAmnesty Programme Director Seun Bakare, then acting as a country director while Ojigho was on leave, approved the public statement declaring the activists as prisoners of conscience. Osai returned from leave to stop the announcement, though her intervention came a little late. But, she succeeded in preventing AIN from undertaking further campaigns seeking the release of the activists.\n\nSowore, in messages sent to this reporter via Facebook messenger, confirmed that Amnesty Nigeria several times had worked against the interest of human rights activists in the country.\n\n\u201cThis is very true. They have done lots of harm to human rights causes. One of it was caught in the report. She [Ojigho] stalled all efforts to keep supporting our cause. It was her way of killing our cause,\u201d he said.\n\nMoles in Amnesty Nigeria\n\nAfter noticing frequent dithering and half-measured engagement with human rights issues, partners and other stakeholders began to raise questions about the commitment of the Amnesty office to the human rights struggle in Nigeria. Could it be that the Nigerian government has succeeded in cowering the leadership of Amnesty Nigeria after the embarrassment suffered due to the previous reports? Some have started to ask.\n\n\u201cAt the partners\u2019 meeting held in October 2020 in Lagos, I asked: \u2018Has the Nigerian bug caught up with the Amnesty International. That question has not been answered to date,\u201d Ijeoma said.\n\nSome of the Amnesty staff who spoke to The ICIR believed there is a mole in the Nigerian office of Amnesty International.\n\nThe first person to raise the alarm over the internal security in the Amnesty was Ugwu.\n\nIn a memo dated January 29, Ugwu, a researcher for the Amnesty for over a decade, long before the organisation was established in Nigeria, alleged that a senior management member is secretly in touch with the Department of State Services (DSS).\n\nSomeone who knew about the meeting between the AIN official and DSS warned Ugwu that the secret police are aware of the itinerary of every staff of AIN, including their travel schedule.\n\nIn addition, Ugwu alleged that a staff named Jubril Matins is one of the moles providing information to the secret police. He anchored his claim on the suspicious activities of Martins, a Front Office and Admin Officer employed in 2018.\n\nBefore his employment, Martins was seconded to AIN as security guard by Deep Cover Guards Limited, a security outfit owned by a retired General, Abdulkadir Shehu. But the management claimed he was a volunteer even though he was receiving N45,000 per month.\n\nNearly a year later, AIN gave him a full-time job. One of his colleagues was surprised that a former security officer was allowed to take an administrative position in an account/admin department where he has access to the office laptops, internet and password.\n\nNot long after he became full staff, colleagues began to suspect Martin\u2019s furtive behaviour.\n\n\u201cHe was always peeping at the keyhole to the programme\u2019s office and eavesdropping on conversations, especially when Amnesty International (AI) from the International Secretariat are in AI Nigeria\u2019s office for official assignment,\u201d Ugwu stated in a petition he later wrote against him.\n\nIn a letter dated September 10, 2020, Uloma Obike, a Research and Campaigns Assistant at AIN, confirmed the finding of Ugwu. \u201cI agree with Damian and any other colleague that shares the same concern; Jubril has a habit of eavesdropping on the programs staff conversations rather than coming into the office to discuss with us.\u201d\n\nAnother staff said the same thing: \u201cOn the first occasion, I was in the office when I decided to step out. I opened the door, and Jubril Martins was right in front of me. I dismissed the awkwardness because he immediately walked into the office and said something to Uloma. The second occasion was during my induction days. The programmes Manager had invited me to his office for a meeting. He was taking me through a list of HRE coordinators across the movement. In the middle of our conversation, he received a phone call, and I assumed it was private. I got up and signalled to him that I would return at a later time. As soon as I opened the door, I was startled to see Mr. Martins again, right in front of me. This time, he did not walk into Mr. Bakare\u2019s office. He went straight to the water dispenser. I remember mentioning this to Mr. Bakare when I returned to his office.\u201d\n\nThe ICIR interviewed other ex-staff of the Amnesty who confirmed Martins\u2019s penchant for eavesdropping on the discussion of programme staff.\n\n\u201cI am really scared of our security as it appears that he may be spying for someone. Recall that we have experienced several incidents in the office that suggested the presence of a mole in the office. This includes the disappearance of my external drive in early 2019 as well as the loss of the office\u2019s external drive, which contained very sensitive information,\u201d Ugwu told the panel set by Amnesty.\n\nBut in his letter of defence, Martins denied all allegations. \u201cI am not and can never be a spy.\u201d\n\nHe said there is no way he could have been peeping through the keyhole because he is visually impaired.\n\n\u201cI will only do more harm than good to my eyes I\u2019m managing,\u201d he wrote in his defence letter.\n\nUgwu also raised concern about the employment of Abba Aminu Jnr, a graduate of Bayero University, Kano, with a PhD in Strategic Studies from Universiti Utara, Malaysia.\n\nFirst, his official documents showed Abba Aminu, but his public name on Facebook is Aminu Hayatu, but that is not a problem. The red flag was his Facebook post of March 27 2018, where he thanked the DSS alongside his family and others for supporting him to complete his doctorate programme.\n\nSecond, AIN staff observed that though his work schedule is focused on the conflict in the north, he has a particular interest in IPOB.\n\nThird, his selection was suspicious, considering that he was not subjected to the usual competitive recruitment process stipulated by AIN policy compared to 350 other candidates who applied for the same position.\n\nThe ICIR reached out to Aminu to verify the claim and his true identity.\n\nHe denied the allegations and the issue of double identity, describing it as blackmail.\n\n\u201cActually, all those claims about me are false. I chose to ignore the calumny campaign, for it was sponsored by a liar who was desperate to blackmail others and score cheap political goals.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can never be a mole! I never was one,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ICIR contacted the spokesperson of the DSS, Peter Afunanya, who responded in a text message describing the allegations as gossip.\n\n\u201cThe DSS does not engage in rumours and gossips.\u201d\n\nMeeting with Kaduna state official ahead of publication\n\nThe report further indicted Ojigho of meeting with an official of the Kaduna state government Samuel Aruwan ahead of Amnesty International\u2019s publication on freedom of expression in Nigeria.\n\nAruwan was said to have visited the Amnesty International office in Abuja to seek the removal of Stephen Kefa\u2019s name from the publication.\n\nIn 2019, Kefa, a journalist and human rights activist, was arrested for sharing an article.\n\nThe ICIR\u2019s check shows that Kefa\u2019s name was not included in Amnesty International\u2019s report later released in October 2019.\n\nAlthough Kefa\u2019s situation attracted rights groups and the media attention, it did not make it into Amnesty International\u2019s publication released in October 2019.\n\nWhen The ICIR contacted Aruwan over his visit to Amnesty International on the day, he confirmed that it was true.\n\nHe, however, noted that the visit was not to influence or compromise the details of the intended publication by Amnesty International.\n\nHe explained that he visits media houses and human rights organisations as Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, either to disseminate security reports or present the Kaduna State government\u2019s position on human rights violation investigations.\n\nBully-in-chief\n\nAmnesty Nigeria is not the only country office notorious for toxic work culture. The practice spreads across Amnesty offices in several regions. In January 2019, KonTerra Group published a Staff Wellbeing Review for Amnesty International following suicide committed by some former staff in 2018.\n\nGa\u00ebtan Mootoo, Researcher for West Africa, died in May 2018, and Rosalind McGregor, an intern in the International Advocacy Programme in Geneva, died in July 2018. The report found that the management of Amnesty International routinely used bullying and public humiliation.\n\nThe staff of Amnesty Nigeria, who spoke to The ICIR, confirmed this trend in the local office. They said Ojigho also uses bullying as a way to stay in control. In fact, a former staff member described Osai as a \u2018bully \u2013in-chief\u2019.\n\nIn a goodbye letter sent by one of the former staff which The ICIR obtained, the letter reads: \u201cAfter working at AIN, I\u2019m just horrified and disappointed. The way AIN operates does not reflect what AI stands for at all, and that is sad. And the reality is that this is well understood by programs staff, other CSOs and even former interns from the American University Washington \u2013 African Justice Initiative (so much so that the African Justice Initiative have effectively ended its internship programme with AIN).\u201d\n\nThe American student referred to was Caroline McGroder, who was supposed to spend six months\u2019 internship at AIN Nigeria but left after three weeks citing security reasons.\n\nThe ex-staff said Caroline left because she was uncomfortable with the nature of AIN\u2019s relationship with the Nigerian government, which is different in America where she came from.\n\n\u201cGiven that relationship, she did not feel secure working at AIN on a tourist visa.\u201d\n\nIn another goodbye letter from another former staff, the person mentioned \u2018serious bullying\u2019 as her reason for leaving.\n\n\u201cI reported to the IS [International Secretariat], global HR and regional offices. The country director (Mrs Osai Ojigho) and FMO (Ms. Bededicta Ofili) both drove me to a sad state of mind. They made work really difficult and also compromised my security while in the field.\u201d\n\nThe ex-staff who quit her job in December 2021 said she left not because she had another employment elsewhere but because she could not see an end to the mistreatment of staff at AIN.\n\nAnother former staff in the accounting department has this to say in her letter to the London office:\n\n\u201cDuring my last meeting with Osai before my exit, she asked how I wanted my exit to be, whether I wanted to go quietly or if the staff should be informed that I was leaving because it was shameful and disgraceful. I wondered why she would say such a thing and asked if the auditors found anything wrong with my work. She said no, so I told her to inform staff why I was leaving. She said I could not complain to anybody because she had the backing of Colm and the IS [International Secretariat], and no one would believe me if I complained about my departure. She said Rachael and Makmid employed me wrongly, so I had to leave. The past five months have been really tough, both emotionally and psychologically, and I lost my mum in June. I was only able to see her after leaving Amnesty International.\u201d\n\nLow standard of financial propriety\n\nSome staff members have also raised concerns about untidy financial accounting processes at AIN.\n\nA former account officer had once complained about backdating of checks as a way of claiming unspent funds.\n\n\u201cIn January 2018, I was informed by the FOM [Elizabeth] to backdate cheques of all transactions for the month to December 2017. After backdating some and I realised that it was not supposed to be, I told her that it was wrong, and if she insisted on me backdating the cheques, she should send me a memo to that effect. She threatened that if I did not want to lose my job, I should do as she said. I decided to find a way of avoiding that by saying I was busy with some other work, so she decided to do it herself.\u201d\n\nMonths later, the staff lost her job because her contract was not renewed even though she got a positive review from colleagues. Employees said Ojigho prefers to give short-term tenured jobs so that she could kick out staff that are not \u2018loyal\u2019. Country directors are allowed to exercise such discretion to keep the independence of the regional office. But Osai uses that privilege to weed out staff who disagrees with her, said a former staff whom colleagues described as an asset to AIN. She fell out with Osai for being critical of her leadership style.\n\nAmnesty Denmark saw through the sloppy accounting system of its Nigerian counterpart and raised questions concerning the implementation of a project called the Civil Society in Development[CISU] project.\n\nIn a letter dated June 9, 2018, Ojigho\u2019s counterpart in Denmark, Michel Banz, noted that budget lines without approval are cleverly inserted in the project. And some reported spending does not fit with the agreed budget. Banz noted that such sharp practice could affect Amnesty\u2019s reputation.\n\nHere is part of his letter: \u201cDuring the first phase of the project, we can see that there have been challenges in relation to budgeting and in relation to the financial accounting processes. In some cases, new budget lines have been added without appropriate approval, and also costs have been reported that does not fit with the agreed budget. We are concerned about the accountability and transparency in the financial management and how this will affect Amnesty\u2019s reputation with donors, including CISU.\u201d\n\nBanz made it clear that AI Denmark would not continue with AIN on the project until a solution was found to the challenge.\n\n\u201cWe will need to postpone the planned phase 2 application until proper solutions have been found to secure a better workflow, better financial management and accountability, staff well-being, and proper and timely acknowledgement of the needs of the target groups.

We would like to discuss this further with you, and hopefully, we can continue the work, albeit on a smaller scale to begin with.\u201d\n\nThe AIN is headed by a three-member board consisting of the Executive Director of Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Auwal Ibrahim Musa (Rafsanjani), the board chairman, Director of Mother Health Foundation, a Reverend, Nnimmo Bassey and a lawyer, Adesina Oke.\n\nBut where were the board members when the complaints against AIN and the country directors were flying around?\n\nInsipid Board\n\nFormer staff said the board members were rather apathetic to happenings in the organisation. \u201cThey were good men though, but they were too distant from what happens in Amnesty,\u201d said an ex-staff.\n\nWhen AI Denmark flagged financial impropriety, Rafsanjani, in a letter obtained by The ICIR, said there is no evidence to substantiate claims of fraud or financial impropriety. So they did not do anything, the staff said.\n\nThe ICIR queried Rafsanjani about the alleged authoritarian regime of Ojigho and his lacklustre leadership as the Board of AIN; he denied it.\n\nFirst, he dismissed all claims in a report carried by a newsletter, the West Africa Weekly, and specifically faulted the inclusion of Anthony Ojigho, Osai\u2019s debarred husband, from the whole controversy. \u201cWhat has he got to do with the issue,\u201d he queried.\n\nHe also distanced himself from the accusations of engaging in actions capable of undermining cardinal principles of the AIN.\n\nThough he admitted knowing about the running battle between Osai and Ugwu that had lasted for nearly three years, he said all efforts to resolve the crisis failed.\n\nIn another breadth, he said the board was kept in the dark because Ugwu did not officially notify top executives of the organisation.\n\n\u201cThe organisation has response mechanisms. If you [Ugwu] have any issue with any staff of the organisation, there is an internal mechanism that can handle your complaint; you are not to communicate it to the media or outsiders. But he has decided to go to the media houses\u2026\n\n\u201cDamian [Ugwu] is so arrogant, full of himself and he is out there to destroy the image of the organisation and everybody.\u201d\n\nHe said every organisation has a standard. And if Ugwu felt he could not work under Ojigho\u2019s leadership due to whatever standard he holds, he could have resigned, or otherwise, comply with the AIN\u2019s instructions.\n\nThe ICIR asked if any claim by Ugwu was true, especially the unfortunate incident that led to the death of two undergraduates of the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE) students, involving Bisi Adeleye- Fayemi, the Ekiti State first lady, and the Amnesty\u2019s refusal to amplify the case.\n\nThe CISLAC boss waived off the question, saying the AIN plans to make an official statement soon.\n\nBassey did not respond to the text message sent to him, and Oke was unreachable.\n\nThe ICIR also reached out to Ojigho and the Amnesty Media Manager, Isa Sanusi, but the two of them did not respond to messages.\n\nAlso, The ICIR reporters visited Amnesty\u2019s office in Abuja; the receptionist said Ojigho and Sanusi were unavailable. A few days later, Amnesty Nigeria released a terse message, which failed to address issues of staff bullying, financial impropriety and secret alliance with the DSS.\n\nThe press release says, \u201cthe issues raised were entirely unfounded\u201d, then goes ahead to catalogue its achievements some of which the human rights community has described as pedestrian.",

          "text": "Following allegations of a secret alliance between Amnesty International Nigeria (AIN) and the Department of State Services (DSS), The ICIR digs deeper, reaching out to the current and old staff of the AIN, board of directors, activists, security agents, lawyers and victims of human rights violations in Nigeria.\n\nA CIVIL servant, Desmond Nunugwo, 50, was arrested by EFCC operatives on June 9, 2016, over a fraudulent business transaction allegation. The following day, the man died.\n\nThe deceased\u2019s wife, Susan Nunugwo, said her husband was neither ill nor diagnosed with sickness before the EFCC took him away.\n\nShe then visited Amnesty International Nigeria, AIN, seeking help to get justice for her late husband.\n\nThe AIN interim Country Director, Makmid Kamara, a Sierra Leonean, instructed the staff to design a campaign plan since the Nigerian authorities had ignored calls to investigate Nunugwo\u2019s death.\n\nA renowned pathologist at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital was contacted, and he agreed to carry out an autopsy on the body.\n\nNunugwo\u2019s family was happy with AIN\u2019s plan and looking forward to getting justice.\n\nThen a change of guard at Amnesty Nigeria brought Osai Ojigho as the new Country Director. And that was when things began to fall apart.\n\n\u201cOsai started playing games with the family, giving them excuses and stopped them from seeing her on several occasions. One day, she calmly advised Desmond\u2019s widow to go home and bury her husband,\u201d a former staff of AIN who knew about the case told The ICIR.\n\nThe African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, in its decision dated November 10, 2019, also confirmed Amnesty\u2019s curious withdrawal from the case.\n\nSix years down the line, the family is yet to find closure to the mystery of Desmond\u2019s death.\n\nIn May 2018, a human rights lawyer and activist, Frank Tietie, wrote a dispiriting letter to Kamara, who had returned to work at Amnesty International Secretariat in London as Deputy Director Global Issues and Head of ESCR Team.\n\nIn the letter, Tietie, Executive Director, Citizens Advocacy for Social and Economic Rights, expressed disappointment at the state of human rights observation and enforcement in Nigeria and blamed Ojigho\u2019s management style at AIN.\n\n\u201cIt is more worrisome to me that the Director of Amnesty International, Nigeria, Osai Ojigho is more eager to find justifications for neither responding nor interfering in the grave but trending human rights issues of serious national concern, in Nigeria, on the grounds that such issues are outside the set thematic areas of Amnesty International for 2018,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOne of such cases Tietie complained about was that of married women sacked by GLOBACOM, a Nigerian telecom company. The women were fired because they were married and no longer looked \u201csexy\u201d to be effective marketers. Globacom refuted the claim though.\n\nEtitie believed such a decision by a corporate organisation is a gender-based human rights violation against the provision of Article 11 of CEDAW. The law forbids discrimination against women in the field of employment.\n\nHe wanted AIN to make a strong statement against such discrimination, but Ojigho was uninterested.\n\n\u201cShe literally snapped at me saying Amnesty International had its set issues already for the year and did not include issues of such,\u201d Tietie wrote in the mail.\n\nAn attempt for a meeting to explain why Amnesty should be interested in the case was rebuffed. Tietie said the incident rocked his relationship with Amnesty Nigeria.\n\nAnother human rights lawyer who severed a relationship with Amnesty Nigeria is Justus Ijeoma.\n\nThe lawyer reported to the AIN the case of Gift Oyinyechi, the widow of Collins Ezenwa. The latter was killed on the kidnapping allegation by the Intelligence Response Team, IRT, led by the disgraced police officer, Abba Kyari.\n\nAfter Ezenwa\u2019s death, Kyari and his team allegedly seized the deceased\u2019s properties and began to deplete them after warning the wife to stay away.\n\nThe lawyer, Ijeoma, reported the case to National Human Right Commission and Amnesty, Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor two weeks, the widow was detained in Lagos, despite losing her husband. We reached out to Amnesty, and they promised to help. They asked the widow to come to their office in Abuja, and after the engagement, they promised to get back to us, they never did. We presented our case at the panel raised by Vice President Osinbajo, but Amnesty backed out without explanation.,\u201d he told The ICIR during a phone conversation.\n\nIn a similar pattern, Ojigho allegedly turned a blind eye several times to the gross violation of human rights in northeast Nigeria.\n\nIn his letter of resignation, Malik Samuel, an AIN conflict researcher, noted that Amnesty International, despite all available information, kept silent as the Nigerian military forcibly displaced an entire Borno town of about 10,000 civilians on suspicion of aiding and abetting Boko Haram.\n\nAnd when the military shut down Daily Trust newspaper\u2019s offices in Abuja and Maiduguri a month to the presidential election in 2019 and arrested workers, Ojigho ignored the call of her staff members who advised that Amnesty should make a public statement.\n\n\u201cWe did not respond and only tweeted after the siege had ended, even though we had all the information about one hour after the attack started,\u201d Malik wrote in his goodbye letter, which was shared with other staff.\n\nAlso, when Amnesty Nigeria documented the Rann attack of January 27, 2019, by Boko Haram that left about 60 civilians dead, Ojigho allegedly removed a significant part of the report that questioned the role of the military even though the evidence of negligence has been established and carefully verified by LawPol, a department of the Amnesty International in London that vets report before publication.\n\nThose familiar with Amnesty\u2019s dithering, self-censorship and apparent aloofness have begun to wonder about what could have gone wrong.\n\n\u201cThis is not Amnesty International that we used to know,\u201d said Ijeoma, the Executive Director, International Human Rights and Equity Defense Foundation (I-REF).\n\nAmnesty International: A hypocritical global force for good?\n\nAmnesty International describes itself as a global movement that takes injustice personally.\n\n\u201cWe are campaigning for a world where human rights are enjoyed by all,\u201d Amnesty International declares on its website.\n\nThe organisation started in 1961 when two Portuguese students were jailed just for raising a toast to freedom. A British lawyer Peter Benenson was outraged and wrote an article that launched a global campaign and built solidarity for justice and freedom.\n\nMore than 60 years after, the movement has spread to 70 countries, including those in Africa.\n\nAmnesty International markets manifesto for a better world, but happenings in its Nigeria office contradicts the values it publicly espouses.\n\nInformation obtained from Amnesty\u2019s staff and human rights community in Nigeria show that AIN frequently dismisses and drops cases of human rights violations, bullies staff who hold the organisation accountable to its own principles, runs a poorly transparent accounting system and betrays hopes of victims of injustice who look up to it.\n\nThe situation in Amnesty International Nigeria is disappointing, \u201cespecially for those of us dealing with the Amnesty International before the Nigerian office was set up, said Ijeoma.\n\n\u201cWe know the amount of effort we put in before Amnesty Nigeria was set up in Nigeria. We think it is going to help the human rights community in Nigeria. Now the organisation has derailed. Amnesty has become a dog that barks without biting.\u201d\n\nA journalist, Peter Nkanga who anchored one of BBC\u2019s documentary holds a similar view about AIN.\n\nIn 2019, the journalist and activist wrote a letter to the Amnesty International Secretariat in London, complaining about how Ojigho-led Amnesty ignored calls to help a dying journalist, Olomofe, who was attacked by suspected smugglers aided by the Nigerian Custom officers.\n\nSenior ranking Customs officers had invited Olomofe to their offices at Seme to discuss allegations that customs officers were complicit in corruption and smuggling activities at the border. In the presence of Custom personnel, over a dozen men beat Olomofe into a coma, and he later became bed-ridden and has been in the death throes since then.\n\nNkanga reported the matter to Amnesty, but nothing was done.\n\nIn another instance, he recounted how Amnesty Nigeria jumped ship at the last hour from the peaceful protests planned with the Coalition of Nigerian Media and Civil Society Groups. The procession was scheduled to hold at the Saudi Arabia Embassy in Abuja over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\u201cWith no explanations given till date, AI-Nigeria did not show up for the protest,\u201d Ikanga wrote in the letter copied to the Secretary-General Amnesty International, Kumi Naidoo; former Director of People and Organisational Development, Debby Morrell; Senior Director of Global Operations at Amnesty International, Minar Pimple; Regional Director for West and Central Africa, Marie-Evelyne Petrus-Barry; and Africa Director, Research and Advocacy, Netsanet Belay.\n\nRights activists who spoke to The ICIR recall the days when Amnesty International was churning out powerful reports about human rights violations in Nigeria, such as \u201cWelcome to Hellfire,\u201d a September 2014 publication that revealed the experiences of former detainees who have been tortured in police and military custody and the failure of the Nigerian government to prevent such violations or to bring suspected perpetrators to justice.\n\n\u201cStars on their Shoulders: Blood on their Hands\u201d was also published in June 2015. The report documented how the Nigerian military forces have extrajudicially executed more than 1,200 people; arbitrarily arrested at least 20,000 people, primarily young men and boys; and committed countless acts of torture.\n\nThe following year, \u201cYou Have Signed Your Death Warrant\u201d was published. The report chronicled the cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).\n\nAll these reports were published before Ojigho became the country director.\n\n\u201cSince Osai took over, what reasonable work has the Amnesty Nigeria done,\u201d asked Ijeoma during a telephone interview with The ICIR.\n\nBefore he left in April 2019, Malik also expressed his frustration about the quality of work under Ojigho.\n\n\u201cI find our lack of urgency in responding to human rights abuses, especially in the northeast, in great contrast with the Amnesty International I knew, and this is very frustrating. There have been too several incidents where my research was not used, watered down, or I was told not strategic to speak out.\u201d\n\nMonths later, another former staff of AIN, Damian Ugwu, in his testimony recounted how Ojigho nearly revoked the status of prisoners of conscience earlier granted to Omoyele Sowore, Olawale Bakare and Agba Jalingo, who were then in detention.\n\nAmnesty Programme Director Seun Bakare, then acting as a country director while Ojigho was on leave, approved the public statement declaring the activists as prisoners of conscience. Osai returned from leave to stop the announcement, though her intervention came a little late. But, she succeeded in preventing AIN from undertaking further campaigns seeking the release of the activists.\n\nSowore, in messages sent to this reporter via Facebook messenger, confirmed that Amnesty Nigeria several times had worked against the interest of human rights activists in the country.\n\n\u201cThis is very true. They have done lots of harm to human rights causes. One of it was caught in the report. She [Ojigho] stalled all efforts to keep supporting our cause. It was her way of killing our cause,\u201d he said.\n\nMoles in Amnesty Nigeria\n\nAfter noticing frequent dithering and half-measured engagement with human rights issues, partners and other stakeholders began to raise questions about the commitment of the Amnesty office to the human rights struggle in Nigeria. Could it be that the Nigerian government has succeeded in cowering the leadership of Amnesty Nigeria after the embarrassment suffered due to the previous reports? Some have started to ask.\n\n\u201cAt the partners\u2019 meeting held in October 2020 in Lagos, I asked: \u2018Has the Nigerian bug caught up with the Amnesty International. That question has not been answered to date,\u201d Ijeoma said.\n\nSome of the Amnesty staff who spoke to The ICIR believed there is a mole in the Nigerian office of Amnesty International.\n\nThe first person to raise the alarm over the internal security in the Amnesty was Ugwu.\n\nIn a memo dated January 29, Ugwu, a researcher for the Amnesty for over a decade, long before the organisation was established in Nigeria, alleged that a senior management member is secretly in touch with the Department of State Services (DSS).\n\nSomeone who knew about the meeting between the AIN official and DSS warned Ugwu that the secret police are aware of the itinerary of every staff of AIN, including their travel schedule.\n\nIn addition, Ugwu alleged that a staff named Jubril Matins is one of the moles providing information to the secret police. He anchored his claim on the suspicious activities of Martins, a Front Office and Admin Officer employed in 2018.\n\nBefore his employment, Martins was seconded to AIN as security guard by Deep Cover Guards Limited, a security outfit owned by a retired General, Abdulkadir Shehu. But the management claimed he was a volunteer even though he was receiving N45,000 per month.\n\nNearly a year later, AIN gave him a full-time job. One of his colleagues was surprised that a former security officer was allowed to take an administrative position in an account/admin department where he has access to the office laptops, internet and password.\n\nNot long after he became full staff, colleagues began to suspect Martin\u2019s furtive behaviour.\n\n\u201cHe was always peeping at the keyhole to the programme\u2019s office and eavesdropping on conversations, especially when Amnesty International (AI) from the International Secretariat are in AI Nigeria\u2019s office for official assignment,\u201d Ugwu stated in a petition he later wrote against him.\n\nIn a letter dated September 10, 2020, Uloma Obike, a Research and Campaigns Assistant at AIN, confirmed the finding of Ugwu. \u201cI agree with Damian and any other colleague that shares the same concern; Jubril has a habit of eavesdropping on the programs staff conversations rather than coming into the office to discuss with us.\u201d\n\nAnother staff said the same thing: \u201cOn the first occasion, I was in the office when I decided to step out. I opened the door, and Jubril Martins was right in front of me. I dismissed the awkwardness because he immediately walked into the office and said something to Uloma. The second occasion was during my induction days. The programmes Manager had invited me to his office for a meeting. He was taking me through a list of HRE coordinators across the movement. In the middle of our conversation, he received a phone call, and I assumed it was private. I got up and signalled to him that I would return at a later time. As soon as I opened the door, I was startled to see Mr. Martins again, right in front of me. This time, he did not walk into Mr. Bakare\u2019s office. He went straight to the water dispenser. I remember mentioning this to Mr. Bakare when I returned to his office.\u201d\n\nThe ICIR interviewed other ex-staff of the Amnesty who confirmed Martins\u2019s penchant for eavesdropping on the discussion of programme staff.\n\n\u201cI am really scared of our security as it appears that he may be spying for someone. Recall that we have experienced several incidents in the office that suggested the presence of a mole in the office. This includes the disappearance of my external drive in early 2019 as well as the loss of the office\u2019s external drive, which contained very sensitive information,\u201d Ugwu told the panel set by Amnesty.\n\nBut in his letter of defence, Martins denied all allegations. \u201cI am not and can never be a spy.\u201d\n\nHe said there is no way he could have been peeping through the keyhole because he is visually impaired.\n\n\u201cI will only do more harm than good to my eyes I\u2019m managing,\u201d he wrote in his defence letter.\n\nUgwu also raised concern about the employment of Abba Aminu Jnr, a graduate of Bayero University, Kano, with a PhD in Strategic Studies from Universiti Utara, Malaysia.\n\nFirst, his official documents showed Abba Aminu, but his public name on Facebook is Aminu Hayatu, but that is not a problem. The red flag was his Facebook post of March 27 2018, where he thanked the DSS alongside his family and others for supporting him to complete his doctorate programme.\n\nSecond, AIN staff observed that though his work schedule is focused on the conflict in the north, he has a particular interest in IPOB.\n\nThird, his selection was suspicious, considering that he was not subjected to the usual competitive recruitment process stipulated by AIN policy compared to 350 other candidates who applied for the same position.\n\nThe ICIR reached out to Aminu to verify the claim and his true identity.\n\nHe denied the allegations and the issue of double identity, describing it as blackmail.\n\n\u201cActually, all those claims about me are false. I chose to ignore the calumny campaign, for it was sponsored by a liar who was desperate to blackmail others and score cheap political goals.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can never be a mole! I never was one,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ICIR contacted the spokesperson of the DSS, Peter Afunanya, who responded in a text message describing the allegations as gossip.\n\n\u201cThe DSS does not engage in rumours and gossips.\u201d\n\nMeeting with Kaduna state official ahead of publication\n\nThe report further indicted Ojigho of meeting with an official of the Kaduna state government Samuel Aruwan ahead of Amnesty International\u2019s publication on freedom of expression in Nigeria.\n\nAruwan was said to have visited the Amnesty International office in Abuja to seek the removal of Stephen Kefa\u2019s name from the publication.\n\nIn 2019, Kefa, a journalist and human rights activist, was arrested for sharing an article.\n\nThe ICIR\u2019s check shows that Kefa\u2019s name was not included in Amnesty International\u2019s report later released in October 2019.\n\nAlthough Kefa\u2019s situation attracted rights groups and the media attention, it did not make it into Amnesty International\u2019s publication released in October 2019.\n\nWhen The ICIR contacted Aruwan over his visit to Amnesty International on the day, he confirmed that it was true.\n\nHe, however, noted that the visit was not to influence or compromise the details of the intended publication by Amnesty International.\n\nHe explained that he visits media houses and human rights organisations as Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, either to disseminate security reports or present the Kaduna State government\u2019s position on human rights violation investigations.\n\nBully-in-chief\n\nAmnesty Nigeria is not the only country office notorious for toxic work culture. The practice spreads across Amnesty offices in several regions. In January 2019, KonTerra Group published a Staff Wellbeing Review for Amnesty International following suicide committed by some former staff in 2018.\n\nGa\u00ebtan Mootoo, Researcher for West Africa, died in May 2018, and Rosalind McGregor, an intern in the International Advocacy Programme in Geneva, died in July 2018. The report found that the management of Amnesty International routinely used bullying and public humiliation.\n\nThe staff of Amnesty Nigeria, who spoke to The ICIR, confirmed this trend in the local office. They said Ojigho also uses bullying as a way to stay in control. In fact, a former staff member described Osai as a \u2018bully \u2013in-chief\u2019.\n\nIn a goodbye letter sent by one of the former staff which The ICIR obtained, the letter reads: \u201cAfter working at AIN, I\u2019m just horrified and disappointed. The way AIN operates does not reflect what AI stands for at all, and that is sad. And the reality is that this is well understood by programs staff, other CSOs and even former interns from the American University Washington \u2013 African Justice Initiative (so much so that the African Justice Initiative have effectively ended its internship programme with AIN).\u201d\n\nThe American student referred to was Caroline McGroder, who was supposed to spend six months\u2019 internship at AIN Nigeria but left after three weeks citing security reasons.\n\nThe ex-staff said Caroline left because she was uncomfortable with the nature of AIN\u2019s relationship with the Nigerian government, which is different in America where she came from.\n\n\u201cGiven that relationship, she did not feel secure working at AIN on a tourist visa.\u201d\n\nIn another goodbye letter from another former staff, the person mentioned \u2018serious bullying\u2019 as her reason for leaving.\n\n\u201cI reported to the IS [International Secretariat], global HR and regional offices. The country director (Mrs Osai Ojigho) and FMO (Ms. Bededicta Ofili) both drove me to a sad state of mind. They made work really difficult and also compromised my security while in the field.\u201d\n\nThe ex-staff who quit her job in December 2021 said she left not because she had another employment elsewhere but because she could not see an end to the mistreatment of staff at AIN.\n\nAnother former staff in the accounting department has this to say in her letter to the London office:\n\n\u201cDuring my last meeting with Osai before my exit, she asked how I wanted my exit to be, whether I wanted to go quietly or if the staff should be informed that I was leaving because it was shameful and disgraceful. I wondered why she would say such a thing and asked if the auditors found anything wrong with my work. She said no, so I told her to inform staff why I was leaving. She said I could not complain to anybody because she had the backing of Colm and the IS [International Secretariat], and no one would believe me if I complained about my departure. She said Rachael and Makmid employed me wrongly, so I had to leave. The past five months have been really tough, both emotionally and psychologically, and I lost my mum in June. I was only able to see her after leaving Amnesty International.\u201d\n\nLow standard of financial propriety\n\nSome staff members have also raised concerns about untidy financial accounting processes at AIN.\n\nA former account officer had once complained about backdating of checks as a way of claiming unspent funds.\n\n\u201cIn January 2018, I was informed by the FOM [Elizabeth] to backdate cheques of all transactions for the month to December 2017. After backdating some and I realised that it was not supposed to be, I told her that it was wrong, and if she insisted on me backdating the cheques, she should send me a memo to that effect. She threatened that if I did not want to lose my job, I should do as she said. I decided to find a way of avoiding that by saying I was busy with some other work, so she decided to do it herself.\u201d\n\nMonths later, the staff lost her job because her contract was not renewed even though she got a positive review from colleagues. Employees said Ojigho prefers to give short-term tenured jobs so that she could kick out staff that are not \u2018loyal\u2019. Country directors are allowed to exercise such discretion to keep the independence of the regional office. But Osai uses that privilege to weed out staff who disagrees with her, said a former staff whom colleagues described as an asset to AIN. She fell out with Osai for being critical of her leadership style.\n\nAmnesty Denmark saw through the sloppy accounting system of its Nigerian counterpart and raised questions concerning the implementation of a project called the Civil Society in Development[CISU] project.\n\nIn a letter dated June 9, 2018, Ojigho\u2019s counterpart in Denmark, Michel Banz, noted that budget lines without approval are cleverly inserted in the project. And some reported spending does not fit with the agreed budget. Banz noted that such sharp practice could affect Amnesty\u2019s reputation.\n\nHere is part of his letter: \u201cDuring the first phase of the project, we can see that there have been challenges in relation to budgeting and in relation to the financial accounting processes. In some cases, new budget lines have been added without appropriate approval, and also costs have been reported that does not fit with the agreed budget. We are concerned about the accountability and transparency in the financial management and how this will affect Amnesty\u2019s reputation with donors, including CISU.\u201d\n\nBanz made it clear that AI Denmark would not continue with AIN on the project until a solution was found to the challenge.\n\n\u201cWe will need to postpone the planned phase 2 application until proper solutions have been found to secure a better workflow, better financial management and accountability, staff well-being, and proper and timely acknowledgement of the needs of the target groups. Finding and agreeing on these solutions will need to be a condition for continuing the partnership. We would like to discuss this further with you, and hopefully, we can continue the work, albeit on a smaller scale to begin with.\u201d\n\nThe AIN is headed by a three-member board consisting of the Executive Director of Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Auwal Ibrahim Musa (Rafsanjani), the board chairman, Director of Mother Health Foundation, a Reverend, Nnimmo Bassey and a lawyer, Adesina Oke.\n\nBut where were the board members when the complaints against AIN and the country directors were flying around?\n\nInsipid Board\n\nFormer staff said the board members were rather apathetic to happenings in the organisation. \u201cThey were good men though, but they were too distant from what happens in Amnesty,\u201d said an ex-staff.\n\nWhen AI Denmark flagged financial impropriety, Rafsanjani, in a letter obtained by The ICIR, said there is no evidence to substantiate claims of fraud or financial impropriety. So they did not do anything, the staff said.\n\nThe ICIR queried Rafsanjani about the alleged authoritarian regime of Ojigho and his lacklustre leadership as the Board of AIN; he denied it.\n\nFirst, he dismissed all claims in a report carried by a newsletter, the West Africa Weekly, and specifically faulted the inclusion of Anthony Ojigho, Osai\u2019s debarred husband, from the whole controversy. \u201cWhat has he got to do with the issue,\u201d he queried.\n\nHe also distanced himself from the accusations of engaging in actions capable of undermining cardinal principles of the AIN.\n\nThough he admitted knowing about the running battle between Osai and Ugwu that had lasted for nearly three years, he said all efforts to resolve the crisis failed.\n\nIn another breadth, he said the board was kept in the dark because Ugwu did not officially notify top executives of the organisation.\n\n\u201cThe organisation has response mechanisms. If you [Ugwu] have any issue with any staff of the organisation, there is an internal mechanism that can handle your complaint; you are not to communicate it to the media or outsiders. But he has decided to go to the media houses\u2026\n\n\u201cDamian [Ugwu] is so arrogant, full of himself and he is out there to destroy the image of the organisation and everybody.\u201d\n\nHe said every organisation has a standard. And if Ugwu felt he could not work under Ojigho\u2019s leadership due to whatever standard he holds, he could have resigned, or otherwise, comply with the AIN\u2019s instructions.\n\nThe ICIR asked if any claim by Ugwu was true, especially the unfortunate incident that led to the death of two undergraduates of the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE) students, involving Bisi Adeleye- Fayemi, the Ekiti State first lady, and the Amnesty\u2019s refusal to amplify the case.\n\nThe CISLAC boss waived off the question, saying the AIN plans to make an official statement soon.\n\nBassey did not respond to the text message sent to him, and Oke was unreachable.\n\nThe ICIR also reached out to Ojigho and the Amnesty Media Manager, Isa Sanusi, but the two of them did not respond to messages.\n\nAlso, The ICIR reporters visited Amnesty\u2019s office in Abuja; the receptionist said Ojigho and Sanusi were unavailable. A few days later, Amnesty Nigeria released a terse message, which failed to address issues of staff bullying, financial impropriety and secret alliance with the DSS.\n\nThe press release says, \u201cthe issues raised were entirely unfounded\u201d, then goes ahead to catalogue its achievements some of which the human rights community has described as pedestrian.",
          "summary": "She then visited Amnesty International Nigeria, AIN, seeking help to get justice for her late husband.\n\u201cThis is not Amnesty International that we used to know,\u201d said Ijeoma, the Executive Director, International Human Rights and Equity Defense Foundation (I-REF).\n\u201cWe are campaigning for a world where human rights are enjoyed by all,\u201d Amnesty International declares on its website.\nThe situation in Amnesty International Nigeria is disappointing, \u201cespecially for those of us dealing with the Amnesty International before the Nigerian office was set up, said Ijeoma.\nHe explained that he visits media houses and human rights organisations as Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, either to disseminate security reports or present the Kaduna State government\u2019s position on human rights violation investigations.",

          "title": "INTERVIEW: Growing up in ghetto motivated me to work harder, says Azuh Arinze",
          "text": "For Azuh Arinze, the ace Nigerian journalist and author, where there is a will, there is always a way. Raised in Maroko, a low-income area of Lagos state, the publisher and editor-in-chief of Yes! International Magazine was determined to brace the odds to attain greatness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith sheer grit and zeal for excellence, Arinze has established himself as a prominent name in the Nigerian media landscape and has authored several books.\n\nHe is a member of the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), Guild of Corporate Online Publishers (GOCOP), and an associate member of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR).\n\nAhead of his 50th birthday on March 24, he reflects on his latest books \u2014 \u2018A Taste of Success\u2019 and Conversations with Showbiz Stars\u2019. He also opened up on his journalism career, losing his dad, and plans for the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCongratulations on turning 50. You have had a great career as a journalist, who would you say prepared you for this journey?\n\nI never wanted to be a journalist, my first love was law but back then, my father used to buy newspapers for reasons I still cannot tell. Sometimes, to keep me busy, or to keep me out of trouble, my father will ask me to read a page and summarise it. I think that was how the love started.\n\nWhen I was in secondary school, I represented my school in essay competitions, I think that got into my head because I overrated myself. I was an ajepako but I attended an ajebo school \u2014 Victoria Island Secondary School. Then, my school usually selects me to represent them in essay writing competitions, and most of the time, I\u2019d clinch the first position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt happened that I allowed that \u2018little success\u2019 to get into my head. When I wrote WAEC, I failed English. It was a big shock to me and everybody that their \u2018star\u2019 failed WAEC. It\u2019s just like asking Messi to take a penalty kick and he kicks it over the bar. I think that was a humbling experience for me.\n\nThen, my father \u2014 who was a businessman \u2014 put me in charge of one of his shops where I was able to make little money for myself. One Saturday, I bought a copy of Saturday Punch and read a column written by Azuka Jibose. I fell in love with his writing style and I started buying the paper. After a while, however, he relocated abroad and Femi Akintunde-Johnson took over the column.\n\nLater, I sat for WAEC again and eventually made my papers. When it was time for me to fill out my JAMB form, I went for mass communication instead of law. That was how I ended up going for mass communication. When I needed to do my internship then, I met Akintunde-Johnson.\n\nIt happened that the first five stories I wrote as an intern made it to the cover of FAME magazine, so they gave me automatic employment. That was how my journalism odyssey started.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey had a sister publication called Reel Stars magazine which I was made the editor at 26. However, the magazine came ahead of its time so much later I was recalled to Encomium magazine.\n\nAt 33, I became the editor of Encomium. I served as the editor of Encomium for eight years. After this, I felt I didn\u2019t have any point to prove again. I worked in Encomium for 14 years, and out of the 14 years, I was the editor for eight years. So, I felt there was nothing more for me to do there. I left in 2011 to set up Yes! International Magazine. This is our 11th year and we thank God.\n\nLooking back, do you regret not studying law which you referred to as your first love?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t have any regret. However, one of the biggest positions that I\u2019ll be taking up next year is the district secretary for the Rotary club. It\u2019s a major role and it will be for one year. My plan is that after that one year, I will go back to school, I am still young I still want to read law. I don\u2019t have any regret, all I know is that it has always been my desire to be a lawyer. Journalism overtook that one but I will still get a law degree to fulfill that dream and desire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s talk about your growing up and early days in journalism. What\u2019s the experience like?\n\nLike I said earlier, I was an ajepako but attended an ajebo school. When I was coming up as a journalist, and I\u2019m saying this with every sense of honesty and modesty, I knew I was going to be an editor. If you want to do or achieve something, all you have to do is find out how to get there. What I did was to discuss with editors and find out how they\u2019ve been able to do it and one of the things I learnt was that back then in Encomium and FAME, they were asking us to submit four stories per week, I was submitting eight. I had to go the extra mile, I was going beyond the call of duty, I was going beyond the things expected of me, I carried myself well, dressed well, improved myself, went back to school, read, did short courses, and things that those in that my position bracket considered difficult. Those were the things that made my editors notice me, and little by little I started climbing the ladder of success.\n\nAs a reporter, I wasn\u2019t even into this one kobo thing, it doesn\u2019t mean that people weren\u2019t showing appreciation but I respected and comported myself well and did my job well. It is one thing to respect yourself, and not be able to do your job well. One of the easiest passports that you can flaunt is what you have done and the good works that you\u2019re doing. I try to write well and also monitor other people\u2019s work. There are some people I read their works very well and one of them is Mr Simon Kolawole, he\u2019s one of my biggest sources of inspiration, he writes well, he is simple and carries himself well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll those that write well, I follow them religiously, people like Reuben Abati, Olusegun Adeniyi\u2026, once you write well, I follow you, I make it a point of duty to learn one or two things from the way you write. People like Femi Adesina, Mike Awoyinfa, Dele Momodu, Kunle Bakare, I read them religiously, which helped me. In my interactions with them, I was able to pick out one or two things and how to stand out in the profession.\n\nAs a budding journalist then, what would you describe as your major challenge\u2026 did you struggle at any point?\n\nWell, to be frank with you, it has never crossed my mind to leave journalism. Journalism has been very nice to me. I have never regretted being a journalist, there\u2019s no money to be made in journalism but the truth is that you can get by, I tell people that the things I want are very minimal and God has provided for me. I\u2019m happy, I have never regretted pitching my tent with journalism.\n\nYou have been in the media landscape for years, what can you say about journalism in Nigeria?\n\nThe truth is that the dynamics have changed. Journalism is no longer what it used to be, anyone who wants to get along must jog along because things are changing every day. You don\u2019t have to wait every morning to see what the papers have to say, now news breaks at the speed of light. In fact, sometimes even the unprofessionals break the news ahead of the professionals. The only difference is that most times, they cannot decipher what should be published and what should not be published, then most times too they go out of bounds, they go beyond the call of duty, they make a mess of the profession.\n\nHowever, when you read a story written by a professional, you\u2019ll know that this one is a professional. For instance, if you check a medium like TheCable, you can see the level of seriousness there. You cannot compare what they\u2019re doing to what most charlatans are doing. You have to be dynamic to survive in the profession, you have to go beyond the call of duty, and be distinct to stand out. You don\u2019t have to do what everyone else does, otherwise, you\u2019ll remain where they are, you won\u2019t stand out, you will be stagnant, so the best thing to do is to keep improving on yourself. The dynamics of journalism have changed compared to how it was when I started practising.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at Yes! International Magazine. What inspired the establishment of the magazine?\n\nThe first is that I felt I didn\u2019t have any point again to prove at Encomium. For Encomium and FAME, I had worked there for 17 years. Two, I needed to express myself more. You know when you publish your own paper, one of the advantages you have is, you can decide the length of the story, I wanted to improve on what I\u2019d seen or met on the ground, I wanted to do an interview-based magazine.\n\nA magazine that would be error-free, and one that people can take home. You know when someone mentions celebrity magazines, most times people are reluctant to take them home but I wanted to do a magazine that people can be proud to take home and even share with their children.\n\nThose are some of the things, I wanted a paper that you pick up and learn something from which is why our vision is to be the first choice of readers and advertisers. Then, our mission is to make the day of our readers with quality stories, interviews, gists, pictures among others.\n\nWe wanted to go beyond the call of duty. We did not want to do what others were doing at the time. We tried to step up the game from where we met it and I must say God has been nice to us and we thank him for everything.\n\nNot so many soft-sell magazines like Yes! have been in business for this long. You started in 2011 and still thriving, what is the secret? How have you been able to sustain it?\n\nThe secret is God. It is the grace of God. Everything medium mostly depends on readers and advertisers to survive. So, once you have the two by your side, you will succeed. Businesses thrive based on relationships. When you have people who believe in what you are doing, and who are ready to identify with it, you are bound to survive. But the greatest of them all is the Grace of God.\n\nI think as a person, I have enjoyed the grace of God and as a business, I have also enjoyed the grace of God. So, it\u2019s not because we are doing anything spectacular or fantastic, it\u2019s just that grace of God. I think God just loves me extraordinarily.\n\nOn March 24, you will be unveiling your two latest books \u2014 \u2018A Taste of Success\u2019 and \u2018Conversations with Showbiz Stars\u2019 \u2014 why did you choose to document your professional journey and encounters in these books?\n\nWell, from the beginning, I have always loved to read. In fact, reading is one of the things that brought me this far. I am from an average home and grew up in the ghetto, my mum used to sell Akara \u2014 which is known as bean cake. So, one of the things that propelled me was the fact that I made reading a daily habit.\n\nI have always enjoyed reading what other people are writing and in the course of doing that, it occurred to me that I can also write, that is one.\n\nSecondly, I felt it would be nice to do something for posterity. The third reason is that most times, people find it difficult to succeed or thrive in an environment and because journalism grants me access, I asked myself how I can harness that access? My first book \u2014 \u2018Tested and Trusted Success Secrets of the Rich and Famous \u2014 for instance, the foreword was written by Simon Kolawole. What did I do in the book? I identified some Nigerians who are doing well and I sat down with them to ask what is the secret of their success and what those who aspire to be like them must do and they shared with me. So what I am trying to do is to democratise success and to let people know that success is achievable. All you need to do is to find out those who have achieved it before and how they did it. If you are able to assimilate that, you will also be able to do that. In my other books \u2014 \u2018The CEO\u2019s Bible\u2019, \u2018Success is not Served A La Carte\u2019, \u2018Encounters: Lessons from Journalism Career\u2019 \u2014 I did a similar thing. In our society, we have more unsuccessful people than successful ones, so the whole idea is to ensure that we move more unsuccessful ones into the club of the successful.\n\nWhat informed \u2018Conversations with Showbiz Stars? People have the impression that once you go for an audition, you become a star, it doesn\u2019t work like that, there are other things that are required. So, what did I do? I sat down with RMD, Pete Edochie, Ali Baba, and most of the big names you can think of and asked them how they started and made it to the top. The idea is that anybody who reads it can see how they made it and if they are able to apply some of the things they did, they will also succeed.\n\nThe second one is \u2018A Taste of Success\u2019. Success is very sweet, don\u2019t let us deceive ourselves. Anyone that says success is bitter is lying. Genuine success is sweet and it is the desire of everyone to have a taste of it. So, what I did is to sit down with about 25 people including top journalists such as Olusegun Osoba, Dele Momodu, and Femi Adesina. So, on the whole, we have 60 such interviews cutting across various fields. The conversation is not prose, it is question and answer and each of them responded to between 20 to 30 questions on themselves. So my books are to provide inspiration to young ones in their areas of interest. \u2018Conversations with Showbiz Stars\u2019 for instance is for those who are interested in showbiz, acting, comedy among others.\n\nApart from democratising success as you mentioned, are there other things you want to draw the attention of readers to in the two books?\n\nThe other thing I want to teach people in the books is that it pays to read. I also want to emphasise the fact that if someone has done something, you don\u2019t need to waste your time making the mistakes they made. If you want to run an online newspaper for instance, and Simon Kolawole says this is how it is done, why waste your time doing trial and error? You should simply get the book and read about how he did it. You can thereafter think of one or two things to make yours slightly different. So, for me, I think people should read more.\n\nAt 50, you are a successful publisher, journalist, media consultant among others\u2026 what are your plans for the coming years?\n\nThe first thing I look forward to is writing more books. The second thing is that I pray for long life, I want to die when I clock 100 or 110. God has given me nearly everything that I want. I may not have so much but the little that I have, I am okay with it. God has given me a stable home, lovely kids, and younger ones. My mum is still alive, it is unfortunate that my dad is no longer there. All my younger ones and children are making me happy, my wife gives joy. So, God has been really nice to me, all I asked for is that God will continue to bless me and grant me longer life in good health. My desire is that when I clock 60, I would have written up to 20 books. Maybe then, I will calm down. I also pray God should bless everyone and our country with good leaders so that the suffering of the common man will be reduced.\n\nYours is like a grass-to-grace story. Would you say your background propelled you to greatness?\n\nOf course, it did. If you are in the ghetto, you want to leave there. The ghetto is not a nice place to be forever. Most people who are born and brought up in a ghetto want to leave after some period of time for a better area.\n\nGrowing up, I attended a school where we have kids from rich homes. Then I was coming from Maroko so I knew it would also be nice to have a taste of such good life. I don\u2019t have money but I am contented with what I have. God has always helped me to take care of my needs.\n\nLooking back, are there things you wished you could have done better?\n\nI would have loved to marry earlier. I got married at 32. Although they said God\u2019s time is the best. Secondly, I could have started Yes! International magazine earlier too, but again God\u2019s time is the best. Everything happens when God wants them to happen. The only thing I am not too happy about is that I wish my father did not die. I wish he lived to see me at 50. I also wished my closest friend, Ugochukwu is still alive. He died in a car accident. So, for me, losing my father and Ugo is the most painful to me at 50 because Ugo was more than a friend to me. You don\u2019t see such friends easily. I would have loved to see my dad pray for me at 50 too. But I thank God for everything.\n\nAre you considering going into politics in the future?\n\nWell, people keep saying I will make a good politician but I have never really thought about going into politics. If I have my way, I would encourage my younger brother, Azuh Amatus, to consider politics, I think he would make a better politician. Sometimes, I just want to be alone in my world, but my younger brother loves having people around him, so I think he would make a better politician than myself. But you never can tell.\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable. All rights reserved.

          "title": "INTERVIEW: Growing up in ghetto motivated me to work harder, says Azuh Arinze",
          "text": "For Azuh Arinze, the ace Nigerian journalist and author, where there is a will, there is always a way. Raised in Maroko, a low-income area of Lagos state, the publisher and editor-in-chief of Yes! International Magazine was determined to brace the odds to attain greatness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith sheer grit and zeal for excellence, Arinze has established himself as a prominent name in the Nigerian media landscape and has authored several books.\n\nHe is a member of the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), Guild of Corporate Online Publishers (GOCOP), and an associate member of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR).\n\nAhead of his 50th birthday on March 24, he reflects on his latest books \u2014 \u2018A Taste of Success\u2019 and Conversations with Showbiz Stars\u2019. He also opened up on his journalism career, losing his dad, and plans for the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCongratulations on turning 50. You have had a great career as a journalist, who would you say prepared you for this journey?\n\nI never wanted to be a journalist, my first love was law but back then, my father used to buy newspapers for reasons I still cannot tell. Sometimes, to keep me busy, or to keep me out of trouble, my father will ask me to read a page and summarise it. I think that was how the love started.\n\nWhen I was in secondary school, I represented my school in essay competitions, I think that got into my head because I overrated myself. I was an ajepako but I attended an ajebo school \u2014 Victoria Island Secondary School. Then, my school usually selects me to represent them in essay writing competitions, and most of the time, I\u2019d clinch the first position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt happened that I allowed that \u2018little success\u2019 to get into my head. When I wrote WAEC, I failed English. It was a big shock to me and everybody that their \u2018star\u2019 failed WAEC. It\u2019s just like asking Messi to take a penalty kick and he kicks it over the bar. I think that was a humbling experience for me.\n\nThen, my father \u2014 who was a businessman \u2014 put me in charge of one of his shops where I was able to make little money for myself. One Saturday, I bought a copy of Saturday Punch and read a column written by Azuka Jibose. I fell in love with his writing style and I started buying the paper. After a while, however, he relocated abroad and Femi Akintunde-Johnson took over the column.\n\nLater, I sat for WAEC again and eventually made my papers. When it was time for me to fill out my JAMB form, I went for mass communication instead of law. That was how I ended up going for mass communication. When I needed to do my internship then, I met Akintunde-Johnson.\n\nIt happened that the first five stories I wrote as an intern made it to the cover of FAME magazine, so they gave me automatic employment. That was how my journalism odyssey started.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey had a sister publication called Reel Stars magazine which I was made the editor at 26. However, the magazine came ahead of its time so much later I was recalled to Encomium magazine.\n\nAt 33, I became the editor of Encomium. I served as the editor of Encomium for eight years. After this, I felt I didn\u2019t have any point to prove again. I worked in Encomium for 14 years, and out of the 14 years, I was the editor for eight years. So, I felt there was nothing more for me to do there. I left in 2011 to set up Yes! International Magazine. This is our 11th year and we thank God.\n\nLooking back, do you regret not studying law which you referred to as your first love?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t have any regret. However, one of the biggest positions that I\u2019ll be taking up next year is the district secretary for the Rotary club. It\u2019s a major role and it will be for one year. My plan is that after that one year, I will go back to school, I am still young I still want to read law. I don\u2019t have any regret, all I know is that it has always been my desire to be a lawyer. Journalism overtook that one but I will still get a law degree to fulfill that dream and desire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s talk about your growing up and early days in journalism. What\u2019s the experience like?\n\nLike I said earlier, I was an ajepako but attended an ajebo school. When I was coming up as a journalist, and I\u2019m saying this with every sense of honesty and modesty, I knew I was going to be an editor. If you want to do or achieve something, all you have to do is find out how to get there. What I did was to discuss with editors and find out how they\u2019ve been able to do it and one of the things I learnt was that back then in Encomium and FAME, they were asking us to submit four stories per week, I was submitting eight. I had to go the extra mile, I was going beyond the call of duty, I was going beyond the things expected of me, I carried myself well, dressed well, improved myself, went back to school, read, did short courses, and things that those in that my position bracket considered difficult. Those were the things that made my editors notice me, and little by little I started climbing the ladder of success.\n\nAs a reporter, I wasn\u2019t even into this one kobo thing, it doesn\u2019t mean that people weren\u2019t showing appreciation but I respected and comported myself well and did my job well. It is one thing to respect yourself, and not be able to do your job well. One of the easiest passports that you can flaunt is what you have done and the good works that you\u2019re doing. I try to write well and also monitor other people\u2019s work. There are some people I read their works very well and one of them is Mr Simon Kolawole, he\u2019s one of my biggest sources of inspiration, he writes well, he is simple and carries himself well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll those that write well, I follow them religiously, people like Reuben Abati, Olusegun Adeniyi\u2026, once you write well, I follow you, I make it a point of duty to learn one or two things from the way you write. People like Femi Adesina, Mike Awoyinfa, Dele Momodu, Kunle Bakare, I read them religiously, which helped me. In my interactions with them, I was able to pick out one or two things and how to stand out in the profession.\n\nAs a budding journalist then, what would you describe as your major challenge\u2026 did you struggle at any point?\n\nWell, to be frank with you, it has never crossed my mind to leave journalism. Journalism has been very nice to me. I have never regretted being a journalist, there\u2019s no money to be made in journalism but the truth is that you can get by, I tell people that the things I want are very minimal and God has provided for me. I\u2019m happy, I have never regretted pitching my tent with journalism.\n\nYou have been in the media landscape for years, what can you say about journalism in Nigeria?\n\nThe truth is that the dynamics have changed. Journalism is no longer what it used to be, anyone who wants to get along must jog along because things are changing every day. You don\u2019t have to wait every morning to see what the papers have to say, now news breaks at the speed of light. In fact, sometimes even the unprofessionals break the news ahead of the professionals. The only difference is that most times, they cannot decipher what should be published and what should not be published, then most times too they go out of bounds, they go beyond the call of duty, they make a mess of the profession.\n\nHowever, when you read a story written by a professional, you\u2019ll know that this one is a professional. For instance, if you check a medium like TheCable, you can see the level of seriousness there. You cannot compare what they\u2019re doing to what most charlatans are doing. You have to be dynamic to survive in the profession, you have to go beyond the call of duty, and be distinct to stand out. You don\u2019t have to do what everyone else does, otherwise, you\u2019ll remain where they are, you won\u2019t stand out, you will be stagnant, so the best thing to do is to keep improving on yourself. The dynamics of journalism have changed compared to how it was when I started practising.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at Yes! International Magazine. What inspired the establishment of the magazine?\n\nThe first is that I felt I didn\u2019t have any point again to prove at Encomium. For Encomium and FAME, I had worked there for 17 years. Two, I needed to express myself more. You know when you publish your own paper, one of the advantages you have is, you can decide the length of the story, I wanted to improve on what I\u2019d seen or met on the ground, I wanted to do an interview-based magazine.\n\nA magazine that would be error-free, and one that people can take home.

When you have people who believe in what you are doing, and who are ready to identify with it, you are bound to survive.

So, it\u2019s not because we are doing anything spectacular or fantastic, it\u2019s just that grace of God.

          "title": "Tyranny in the workplace: The chaotic culture of Bento Africa",
          "text": "\u201cBento took everything from me\u2014my sense of humanity, sanity, confidence, and trust,\u201d Pascal*, an ex-sales executive at Nigerian payroll startup Bento Africa, said about his time working there. \u201cWe worked around the clock. Ebun [CEO and co-founder of the company] would send you messages by 2 AM and expect a response asap. No rest. We went to bed every night praying our jobs would still be there when we woke up the next morning.\u201d\n\nOn March 18, 2021, Pascal\u2019s prayer, which had seemed to work for over a year, stopped working. He was abruptly fired from his job. He fell into a depressive state, and everything stopped making sense. He stopped going out, and his relationships with friends and family suffered. Even though he said working at Bento for over a year had been torture, it was all he had at the time.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng) is the brainchild of Ebun Okubanjo and Chidozie Okonkwo, his friend, business partner, and Bento\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO). Headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria, Bento provides payroll management software to 900 businesses.\n\nOkubanjo and Okonkwo built, and still run, multiple businesses together. While both co-founders flock together, they aren\u2019t quite of the same feather. All ex-employees who spoke to us described Okubanjo as fire and Okonkwo as neither water nor fire; Okonkwo simply remains in the background, silent and rarely engaged in the company\u2019s day-to-day operations. These ex-employees therefore believe that Okonkwo\u2019s attitude outsources all authority to Okubanjo and enables his toxicity.\n\nIn Okubanjo\u2019s termination email to Pascal, he was fired because of a \u201clack of cultural fit and poor performance\u201d. But Pascal wondered: \u201cHow could I have been culturally unfit and incompetent after working for you for over a year? Why did it take you that long to clock my incompetence?\u201d\n\nOkubanjo\u2019s email terminating Pascal\u2019s contract\n\nThe termination letter\n\nHe said, despite the daily verbal assaults he endured in the hands of Okubanjo, all he wanted to do was to be the best salesperson in the company and make his employer proud. He hadn\u2019t done much work in sales prior to Bento, so he put in the work. Within 5 months, according to him, he had the second-highest number of clients on their sheets at the time. He closed some of the biggest clients\u2014some of them with over 1,000 employees and a monthly payroll worth \u20a615\u2013\u20a620 million (~$47,000).\n\nDespite his achievements, however, Pascal did not succeed in making his boss proud. \u201cThere was no free day from Ebun\u2019s verbal abuse. If he wasn\u2019t calling me a useless person, he was threatening to beat me up,\u201d Pascal said. At some point, while recounting his experience to TechCabal, he paused to catch his breath.\n\nPascal described his time at Bento as the darkest period of his life.\n\nPascal narrated how employees would weep during the sales team\u2019s check-in call at 8 AM every weekday. Okubanjo harshly criticised their work and threatened to fire them all at these meetings.\n\nEzekiel*, who had worked with the company\u2019s growth marketing team, shared his experience with TechCabal. He had joined one of the sales calls and heard Okubanjo calling them \u201cpussies and deadweights\u201d. He also heard Okubanjo tell the team that they smelled. \u201cEven though he never attacked me personally,\u201d Ezekiel said, \u201cI always wondered how anybody could go through that every morning and remain sane.\u201d\n\nBento Africa\u2019s cofounders: Ebun Okubanjo (left) and Chidozie Okonkwo (right)\n\nEx-employees also revealed gaps in Bento\u2019s employment contract, specifically where leave days and time off were concerned. Okubanjo promised employees that they could take time off when they needed it, but Bola*, another ex-employee from the company\u2019s sales team, dispelled that promise as a myth.\n\n\u201cI can count on one hand how many people took leave during my stay there. Ebun said breaks are for pussies and fuckers, and whoever takes time out of the office for a whole week is a weak member of the team and not needed in the organisation,\u201d said Bola.\n\n\u201cEbun scarred me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have spent money on therapy, yet, I still suffer from anxiety.\u201d\n\nIn her early days at the startup, Bola asked a lot of people to come work with her at Bento. At that time, she was ignorant of Okubanjo\u2019s \u201cterrifying personality\u201d. \u201cHad I known about it, I wouldn\u2019t have asked anybody to join Bento. Now, when a prospective Bento employee reaches out to me, I just tell them to run!\u201d\n\nAccording to the sources we spoke to, Okubanjo rarely welcomed alternative opinions and monopolised making key business decisions; the punishment for criticising his ideas was immediate termination of employment. For a number of Bento ex-employees, termination simply entailed deactivated Slack accounts and emails.\n\nTinu*, who had been poached from another company to come join Bento, woke up one day and found out she\u2019d been fired and logged out of her Slack and work email. She\u2019d only been with the company as Communication Lead for less than 3 weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was a nerve-wracking experience and the worst 5 months of my adult life,\u201d said Amaka*, who was excited to join a tech startup in Nigeria after finishing her studies in the US. She was fired after enduring Okubanjo\u2019s insults and unwarranted comments about her body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a plus-size woman and Okubanjo would always have opinions about my dressing. He once told me to stop wearing dresses, that I need to wear jackets, trouser and suit all the time (presumably to cover my breast) after his girlfriend Alice commented that she liked my breast. What did I wear? Regular dresses that even my mother approved of.\u201d\n\nAmaka likened the day she was fired to a scene out of a movie. \u201cWe were on a sales call, and Ebun kept saying I wasted company resources while bringing in zero value.\u201d Okubanjo accused her of charging her personal Bolt ride on the company\u2019s debit card, unaware that Amaka had stopped using the card entirely and even ran the company\u2019s errands with her own car.\n\nFollowing Okubanjo\u2019s accusation, Amaka asked that the card be audited to ascertain whether she had indeed been wasting the company\u2019s money. Okubanjo checked the card and discovered that she hadn\u2019t been using the card for personal expenses. Rather than apologise to her, he changed tack and started accusing her of not working.\n\n\u201cHe called me useless and told me to f*ck off from the call. Next thing I knew, my colleagues were texting to inform me that he\u2019d fired me after I dropped off the call.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, when Kunle*, a lead engineer who worked for the company for over 2 years, was fired last November, he only found out about it when he couldn\u2019t access his Slack and work email the next morning. \u201cEbun fired me because he felt like I was trying to wrest authority from him,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo announcing on the company\u2019s slack after firing Kunle\n\n\u201cLeave Ebun, that man can literally kill you and brag about it. He\u2019s that vindictive,\u201d Ezekiel had mentioned while speaking to TechCabal. Ada*, another ex-staff, had also specifically declined to speak to us because she was worried about her safety, fearing that her former employer, could hurt her.\n\nIn the images above, Okubanjo referred to himself as Marlo Stanfield on Bento\u2019s Slack. Who is that, you may ask?\n\nMarlo Stanfield is a fictional character on the HBO television drama The Wire. He is a young, ambitious, intelligent, and ruthless gangster. In the drama series, Stanfield demanded unconditional respect, which superseded all other concerns. He was murderously narcissistic, and frequently ordered the deaths of those who disrespected or undermined him. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked him number 2 on their list of \u201c40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\u201d.\n\nThe day before Kunle was fired, the company\u2019s CTO Lede Adeniyi was on leave, so Kunle stepped up to lead the engineering team. Kunle recalled that one of the account executives had told him that a customer wanted a feature that was not in Bento\u2019s product roadmap for the year. Kunle said he explained to the executive that the company had prioritised other fixes and features for the year and would include the requested feature on their first sprint in 2022. He, however, suggested that if the customer wanted the feature added quickly, he could talk to Okubanjo.\n\n\u201cI referred the executive to Ebun because Ebun had already accused me, previously, of setting priorities behind him. But even that was a crime,\u201d said Kunle. The executive went to Okubanjo with their request, as Kunle had suggested, and all hell broke loose.\n\n\u201cI remember how Ebun came to shout at me: \u2018Hey motherfucker, what did you say to a customer about their ask?\u2019 He shut me up before I could even answer and called me names, which was normal. I was his usual point of reference whenever he wanted to benchmark weaknesses and redundancy in the team. Imagine being disrespected in front of your team members every day.\u201d\n\nNow, before the November firing, Okubanjo had fired Kunle once before. It happened on a trip to Ghana. Kunle had asked Okubanjo to stop calling him a monkey. Okubanjo responded to that by firing him on the spot. \u201cHe told me to find my way back to Nigeria, and that he didn\u2019t care how I did it.\u201d But then, he called Kunle after a few hours to give him his job back, knowing he needed him to sort out the business operations they had come for in Ghana.\n\nOn November 22, when Okunbanjo fired Kunle for the second and final time, he refused to pay his November salary and severance pay. Kunle reached out to Adeniyi, the CTO, to help him speak to Okubanjo about his owed payments, but Adeniyi couldn\u2019t do anything about it. \u201cYou know Ebun does what he wants,\u201d Kunle recalled Adeniyi saying to him.\n\nWhen TechCabal reached out to Adeniyi for comment on the incident, he confirmed Kunle\u2019s report: \u201cYes, Kunle asked me to follow up with Ebun, which I did, and Ebun promised to pay him.\u201d It\u2019s been 4 months now and Okubanjo still hasn\u2019t paid Kunle.\n\nBut after Kunle got fired, it seemed his former boss wasn\u2019t done with him.\n\n\u201cLast month, just when my mental health was getting back in shape, Ebun popped up on my LinkedIn, offering me my old job back,\u201d Kunle said. \u201cI declined. Such effrontery! No form of apology. I haven\u2019t found a new job yet because I\u2019m scared of working in another Nigerian startup.\u201d\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo reached out to Kunle* 4 months after to offer him his job back\n\nKunle claimed that Ebun sacked his friend John*, a former member of Bento\u2019s design team, because John was talking a lot about web3 on social media. Okubanjo accused John of finding Bento \u201cless interesting\u201d. TechCabal reached out to John through Kunle but he hasn\u2019t replied.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give Okubanjo notice period when you\u2019re leaving the company. He\u2019d fire you and tell you off,\u201d Ezekiel said. \u201cWhen Ebun fires you, he tells you to watch how he\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t get a job anywhere else in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nTare Johnson, Bento\u2019s ex-accountant and financial analyst, believes this was why he couldn\u2019t find a job for 6 months after leaving Bento in August 2020. When Johnson joined Bento in February 2020, his contract stated that he was coming in to lead the finance team. He would later find out that there was no team, and that he would be leading himself while reporting to a \u201cnarcissistic boss\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was basically the only one handling all the company\u2019s finances. I was also doing clerical jobs and running errands like a personal assistant, which was confusing and not even remotely close to my job description,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cMy initial thought was, \u2018It\u2019s a startup and things move around a lot.\u2019 But I was wrong. This place was designed to break employees. Ebun abused me verbally, which is standard behaviour for him with employees. He\u2019d call me a motherfucker, dullard, and every vulgar word in the dictionary. He even insulted my family.\u201d\n\nJohnson, running a one-man finance team, was stuck in a mess he hadn\u2019t bargained for. The pandemic lockdown hit barely a month after he got the job, locking him into the job at a time when companies were laying people off and not hiring. So he stuck around and took all the verbal abuse Okubanjo hurled at him. After 5 months, he figured he was coping, until an event on Monday, August 17, 2020 made him resign without notice.\n\nThe WhatsApp conversation between Johnson and Okubanjo\n\nThat Monday, Johnson\u2014like he had done every morning\u2014shared the company\u2019s daily bank statements to Okubanjo and Okonkwo on WhatsApp. Upon receiving them, Okubanjo replied with: \u201cBro, are you drunk???\u201d Johnson thought he must have made a mistake somewhere on the statements, so he quickly double-checked before re-sharing the statements with Bento\u2019s founding team. Okubanjo was still not satisfied with the statements. Apparently, some recent transaction hadn\u2019t reflected yet in the company\u2019s account at the time Johnson compiled the statement; there was no way Johnson could have included it in his report. But Okubanjo, \u201cin his usual fashion\u201d, asked Johnson to fix the spreadsheet or he\u2019d fire him. Finally fed up, Johnson resigned with a simple message: \u201cNo need, I quit\u201d and exited the WhatsApp group. An hour later, he sent in his resignation letter.\n\nFor Johnson, joining Bento Africa was \u201ca bad idea\u201d and leaving \u201cthe best thing he\u2019d ever done for himself\u201d.\n\nWhy were Okubanjo\u2019s red flags ignored?\n\nSome of the ex-employees said Okubanjo\u2019s ruthless leadership style was obvious from the first day they met him. \u201cThe day I met him for my interview, he told me he could read poverty all over my face,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cOn the first day we met,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cI witnessed an altercation that ended with Ebun threatening to punch a stranger in the face.\u201d\n\nAmaka, on her part, said she recognised Okubanjo from a video that had gone viral a year before, where he was in a heated argument with a female customer of Fitness Central, a gym he co-founded with Okonkwo. In the video, Okunbanjo\u2019s threatening personality was evident and on full-display.\n\nSo, why did these former Bento staff accept to work for the company after seeing these red flags from the CEO?\n\n\u201cI felt bad, but what could I do? I needed the job. I was just coming off the HNG Internship,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cThe money was good, for someone who hadn\u2019t even done the mandatory, one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC),\u201d said Amaka.\n\n\u201cI had already stayed about 7 months without a job, after NYSC, and was even planning to go back home [which is outside Lagos] when the job came. So, it was my best option at the time,\u201d said Adanma*, a former employee of the company.\n\nCulture shock after leaving Bento\n\nFormer employees who spoke to TechCabal confessed to experiencing culture shock at their subsequent jobs.\n\nAdanma \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe it when my current boss asked for my opinion on things. \u201cFor the first few months [at my current job], I was too scared to voice an opinion at meetings, for fear of being called stupid.\u201d\n\nBola \u201cwas surprised when my current boss said switching off Slack notifications is good to reduce anxiety, and that we should all try it.\u201d\n\nAccording to McKinsey, hundreds of experiments show that encounters with rude, insulting, and demeaning people undermine workers\u2019 performance, including their decision-making skills, productivity, creativity, and willingness to work harder and help coworkers.\n\nOkubanjo often claims that Bento is \u201ca mission and not a company\u201d hence his iron-fist leadership.\n\nBento is still toxic\n\nThree current Bento employees contacted by TechCabal were diplomatic about their responses, but they agreed that everything this publication has unearthed about Bento Africa\u2019s work culture \u201cis not false\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne minute it\u2019s silence; the next it\u2019s chaos. It\u2019s unstable here, and the pressure is too much,\u201d one of them said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really bothered,\u201d the second employee said. \u201cMy former place of work was also toxic, so I\u2019m kinda used to it. At this point, I think all startups are the same.\u201d\n\nThe third employee wouldn\u2019t \u201cdeny that Bento can be toxic for some people but not in my personal experience. We work very hard, and we play harder. Most people on the team love their jobs. It\u2019s not for everyone, really.\u201d\n\nWhile several ex-Bento employees agree that the company has a great and important product, they believe both founders in charge of the startup are unfit for their roles. The company\u2019s Glassdoor reviews tell more stories of its unconducive work culture.\n\nIn December last year, Bento expanded into Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with plans to set up operations in 6 other markets\u2014Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Angola, and Ethiopia\u2014by the end of this year. The company also leveraged the influence of music veteran and record label boss Don Jazzy to push a campaign supporting the African entrepreneurship spirit\u2014a campaign that arguably boosted its pan-African brand equity. These strides mean that the company is growing to a stage where its apparent lack of structure, process, and attention to employee welfare can no longer be ignored.\n\nTechCabal reached out to Okubanjo and Okonkwo for comments. Okonkwo didn\u2019t respond, but Okubanjo did. In his response, he called our then-developing story \u201cfiction\u201d and posted our email request to Twitter, claiming our article was a \u201chit job\u201d. He has followed his tweets with a series of abusive personal messages to members of the TechCabal team.\n\nEbun Okubanjo posted our email request on Twitter, he has since deleted the tweet.\n\nWhile Johnson, Bola, Amaka, Kunle, Ezekiel, Adanma, and others still scared to speak up have licked their wounds and moved on, Pascal\u2019s family refuses to let the abuse he suffered at Bento slide. They have sued Okubanjo. \u201cI just want him to rescind the lies he told in the termination email to me, I have all the evidence to prove he lied,\u201d Pascal said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: * Besides Tare Johnson who specifically asked not to be anonymous, other names have been changed to protect the identities of those involved. Furthermore, two current members of Big Cabal Media\u2019s team were former employees at Bento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng).\n\nUpdate: Amaka\u2019s account on Okubanjo\u2019s comment about her dressing was updated at 12:30 AM on March 22, 2020\n\nTechCabal is working on a follow-up story exploring hostile work culture in African startups.

          "title": "Big Cabal Media raises $2.3m to expand its compelling line of digital products",
          "text": "Over decades, the news media landscape has changed dramatically. Checking for news online\u2014whether through Google, social network sites, major newspapers, or local media websites\u2014has become ubiquitous. The widespread use of smartphones also means the latest developments around the world are delivered to people instantaneously.\n\nWhile digital media has connected people in ways never before possible, enabling users to remain informed and maintain relationships across time and distance, companies in the space have attracted a paltry amount of funding. In 2021, venture capital invested $115 million in digital media globally, a tenth of the $1.1billion it funded in 2015, but not much came to Africa. Digital newsrooms in Africa are more likely to receive story grants than business funding, with a few exceptions.\n\nToday, one of such exceptions, Big Cabal Media (BCM), a leading African digital media company, has announced a $2.3 million Seed funding round, emphasising its commitment to keep building exciting and authoritative media products and brands. The new investment round saw participation from existing investors: Unicorn Capital Partners and Future Africa. New investors such as Mac Venture Capital and Luminate participated.\n\nPrior to this funding, with just over $600,000 raised in funding, BCM has grown to become one of the most exciting media and tech businesses in Africa. Its two major publications, TechCabal and Zikoko, reach over 30 million people monthly across platforms, with over 170,000 newsletter subscribers, and a 225% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2018 and 2021.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Bankole Oluwafemi, TechCabal started as a deliberate effort to cover the burgeoning Nigerian tech ecosystem. While the publication started out focusing just on the Nigerian startup space, it soon expanded its coverage to all of Africa. The publication covers startup fundraises, product launches, expansions, regulatory tussles, and stories of various players in the digital economy.\n\nA year after TechCabal launched Seyi Taylor joined the company as co-founder and CEO, while Oluwafemi continued in his role as Editor-in-Chief. They continued to expand TechCabal\u2019s coverage and scale up its operations. In 2016, the duo decided to try something different with the launch of Zikoko, a publication many likened to Buzzfeed at the time of its birth. Zikoko has grown from mostly publishing listicles and quizzes to sharing important stories on every aspect of Nigerians\u2019 lives, earning it \u201cNigeria\u2019s most viral publisher\u201d tagline.\n\nTwo years after the launch of Zikoko, Tomiwa Aladekomo joined the company, taking over as CEO. Aladekomo is an experienced media and marketing professional, who has worked in a range of businesses across different sectors in both North America and Africa.\n\nOver the next four years, Aladekomo focused on diversifying the company\u2019s revenue streams. BCM had derived its income mostly through native advertising, but Aladekomo oversaw the build-out of an extensive suite of advertising products across publications. The company built out a substantial events business; launched the Cabal Creative content studio, which has served multiple Fortune 500 clients ranging from Google to Coca-Cola; and launched TC Insights, a digital economy consultancy business.\n\nUnder Aladekomo\u2019s leadership, BCM has also embarked on ambitious projects like Jollof Road, an 80-day adventurous road trip across all mainland countries in West Africa; and Tech Women Lagos, a multi-sensory exhibition of 50 women in the Lagos technology ecosystem from different backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI joined BCM in 2018, brought on some really talented people, and we immediately kickstarted a period of experimentation,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cOur experiments encompassed editorial content and approaches, monetisation and even company culture.\u201d\n\nTomiwa Aladekomo, CEO of Big Cabal Media\n\nNine years after its launch, BCM which started as a tech blog has morphed into a media powerhouse. Its two publications, TechCabal and Zikoko are experts at creating content that hits the cultural nerve. They go beyond covering the scenes to creating agenda-setting editorial content, projects, and events. Cabal Creative and TC Insights are also supporting hundreds of companies within Africa.\n\nThe company also boasts of a laudable alumni network, which includes Odunayo Eweniyi, CEO and co-founder of Fintech startup Piggyvest and First Check, a female-led, female-focused, angel fund and investor community; Osarumen Osamuyi, Partner Manager at Meta; Jola Ayeye, scriptwriter and co-host of the I Said What I Said (ISWIS) podcast\u2014one of the most listened to podcasts in Africa\u2014and a host of others. An indication of its investment in its employees.\n\n\u201cFrom documented reports and experience, too, very few people who work for media organisations are offered a competitive salary and we\u2019d like to be the exception to the norm,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cThe BCM model has been tested and proven. In 2021, we quadrupled our 2020 revenue, and over the last 4 years our CAGR is 225%.\u201d\n\nWith this new funding, BCM plans to develop its product serving, staff, and audience. \u201cWe are expanding our video production by exploring docuseries and short films,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cWe will be transforming our studio into a community hub for creatives, and introducing 3 new tech products, including the Zikoko app and Zikoko Memes 2.0, which first launched in 2020. We will also be building out new audiences while offering competitive wages.\u201d\n\nIn the past 5 years, some notable fundraises by African digital media companies include Nigerian media company Stears Business\u2019 $600,000 seed round in 2020 and Ghana\u2019s OMG Digital $1.1m seed funding in 2017. BCM\u2019s progress over the years and recent fundraise is a noteworthy example of the possibilities and opportunities in Africa\u2019s digital media sector.\n\nOf the reported $4.3\u2013$5 billion raised by African startups in 2021 whereby fintech received 53\u201363% of the volume, digital media companies are one of many sectors that have traditionally been overlooked in the conversation of tangible ventures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to enter this chapter with Big Cabal Media, as we fully believe in its massive potential for further success, scale and global impact,\u201d said Marlon Nichols, co-Founder and Managing General Partner at MaC Venture Capital. \u201cInvesting in Africa\u2019s booming digital media sector aligns perfectly with MaC\u2019s mission of supporting exceptional entrepreneurs building valuable technology companies that leverage shifts in cultural trends and behaviours. I have no doubt that BCM will seize this unique opportunity to continue leading conversations in culture and helping digital consumers access the information that matters most to them.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "The untold story of how ThriveAgric survived a turbulent 2020",
          "text": "In September 2020, a few days after Muhammed Akinyemi didn\u2019t receive payment for a 6-month poultry cycle investment made in ThriveAgric, he informed his lawyer about this but didn\u2019t take legal action.\n\nHe was expecting the sum of \u20a6581,000 ($1,200) for the \u20a6510,000 he\u2019d invested in March. Akinyemi had also invested \u20a6200,000 in April, which was due (\u20a6224,000) in October.\n\n\u201cAt first, I just felt it\u2019s money, and it\u2019s with them. Whatever the problems are, within a week or two, they should resolve it,\u201d Akinyemi said. \u201cBut I found out that they hadn\u2019t addressed the issue to all their subscribers; rather they were explaining to individuals. And there was no specificity as to when it would be resolved.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, a few weeks later, Akinyemi\u2019s car broke down and he urgently needed money to fix it. ThriveAgric hadn\u2019t yet paid him and he was running out of patience. He was one out of hundreds of ThriveAgric\u2019s retail investors who hadn\u2019t received the payments.\n\nHis lawyer sent a warning notification to ThriveAgric, threatening to sue if the issue wasn\u2019t resolved. Akinyemi also put out a tweet calling out the company to fix the problem. He tried to rally around other retail investors who hadn\u2019t been paid, but a number of them didn\u2019t want any media attention.\n\n\u201cWe fought it from the legal and social aspect,\u201d said Akinyemi.\n\nOver 500km away, in Southwestern Nigeria Osun State, Esther*, a poultry farmer who partnered with ThriveAgric, had lost over 1,000 birds because there was little to no movement.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult period losing my birds in the middle of the pandemic,\u201d Esther said. She was one out of many farmers within ThriveAgric\u2019s network who suffered massive losses.\n\nWhile the losses incurred varied among the farmers, depending on the capacity of their pens, ThriveAgric shared that there were over 400,000 mature birds that had no buyers. Despite efforts made by ThriveAgric to rent more cold rooms for storage of processed chickens, the lack of buyers and difficulty in moving the birds during the pandemic meant that over 90% of the birds were lost. The losses started happening as early as April 2020, until the end of the year.\n\nWith hundreds of unpaid, angry retail investors dragging ThriveAgric online, asking for their money, and farmers recording millions of naira in losses, this was ThriveAgric\u2019s darkest hour.\n\nFounded by Uka Eje (CEO) and Ayodeji Arikawe (CTO) in 2017, ThriveAgric started as an agricultural technology startup that provided access to finance, premium markets, and data-driven advisory for smallholder farmers. It financed agriculture projects through crowdfunding. In the space of 3 years, ThriveAgric had grown to become a notable African Agritech startup, with backing from Y Combinator\u2014one of the world\u2019s most successful startup accelerators\u2014in 2019.\n\nHow did it get into this mess?\n\n\u201cIt was a mix of different events. The pandemic meant that offtakers couldn\u2019t pay for the goods we\u2019ve already supplied,\u201d Eje said. \u201cFarmers were also suffering losses in the farm, and we lost over 100 million naira worth of produce in transit because they were held up on the road. No movement during the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe dilemma for ThriveAgric was that its owing offtakers\u2014FMCGs and restaurant chains\u2014made repeated failed promises on when they\u2019d repay.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d promise to pay next week and, banking on their words because they hadn\u2019t defaulted before, we\u2019d in turn promise our retail investors that they\u2019ll be paid next week, only for the offtakers to go quiet,\u201d Eje said.\n\nThe offtakers too were anticipating that the pandemic would wind down and business activities would return, but it took longer than expected. This affected ThriveAgric\u2019s communication with its retail investors as it repeatedly failed to fulfil the promises it made to its retail investors. The fact that its large network of farmers were also experiencing losses also exacerbated the situation as ThriveAgric had invested in them by providing seeds and chicks, expecting to receive returns when they were sold. Many of those farmers haven\u2019t recovered from those losses till today.\n\nA popular question that came up during this period was whether ThriveAgric\u2019s claims to be covered by insurance were true. The company explained that the insurance covered the farming activities and not the retail investors\u2019 investment\u2014the logic being, if the farming process went well, the returns on the investment by the retail investors were guaranteed. Also, in this situation, the fact that farmers were unable to sell and the offtakers were owing weren\u2019t valid bases for requesting for insurance claims.\n\nAmerican serial entrepreneur Elon Musk once described the experience of running a startup as being similar to the act of chewing glass and staring into the abyss. \u201cAfter a while, you stop staring, but the glass chewing never ends,\u201d Musk said. ThriveAgric\u2019s experience validates this description.\n\nAll through this turbulent phase, the company maintains it didn\u2019t take its retail investors for granted.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we realised was that this money we were owing was important for these people; for some it was house rent or school fees,\u201d Eje said. \u201cIt was money that meant a lot to them. Regardless of how people reacted, it was their money, and they needed it back.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSalvaging the situation\n\nAs the situation escalated, different parties showed up to help out.\n\n\u201cWe stepped in as quickly as we got wind of the situation and did the best that we could at the time by guiding the team on the right approach to take, as well as by providing the practical support they needed in what was a very time-sensitive situation,\u201d said Kola Aina, General Partner, Ventures Platform, one of ThriveAgric\u2019s investors.\n\nVentures platform helped with recruiting an interim CEO, Adia Sowho, who was then VP of Growth and Managing Director, Nigeria, for credit platform Migo. It also restructured the finance and communications team.\n\nWhen ThriveAgric came knocking, the first question Sowho had to answer was \u201cDid she care enough?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big question for me was, do I care enough about ThriveAgric and what it\u2019s doing? And am I willing, because I wasn\u2019t bored,\u201c Sowho said.\n\nWith the answer to that question being yes, in October Sowho agreed to step in, with Eje stepping down to the role of chief operating officer (COO).\n\n\u201cFood security is an important part of our economy. It doesn\u2019t get enough love and support as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cIf every Nigerian were a farmer, we\u2019d be feeding ourselves and the continent, which is literally ThriveAgric\u2019s vision.\u201d\n\nSolving for Y\n\nTasked to initiate a turnaround in a new company and entirely different sector, the guiding principle Sowho turned to was first-principles thinking, a reverse engineering technique that has its origins from the teachings of Aristotle and has been made recently popular by leaders in Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cFor me, I tend to work with first principles. At the end of the day, whatever problem you\u2019re trying to solve, whether it\u2019s a startup, enterprise, or even conglomerate turnaround,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cThey all involve the two or more parties exchanging value. With ThriveAgric there was an equation and it was broken.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was this hazy chain of unfulfilled agreement that just ended up in a crisis. And, of course, when it hits the public sphere, it makes the news.\u201d\n\nTo fix the broken equation, Sowho deployed three things: structure, governance, and documentation, concepts she claims startups tend to be wary of. The different teams and processes were restructured in order for the company to solve existing problems and be \u201c10 steps ahead of any risk before it materialises\u201d.\n\n\u201cA lot of the things I did were an outcome of the experience that I have working in building organisations,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cThese things don\u2019t happen by accident. The success of any enterprise has to be by design.\u201d\n\nSowho and Eje worked on structuring the financing plan for the repayment of the retail investors and hiring for key roles. Alongside Sowho, a new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and a head of risk were hired. As the new hires got to work, stabilising the ship, co-founder and CTO Arikawe couldn\u2019t help but wonder why they joined the company at such a time.\n\n\u201cThese people joined us during the crisis. I was thinking, didn\u2019t you look up ThriveAgric online, a company that people are bashing, before joining,\u201d Arikawe said.\n\nThe typical response from the new hires was that they believed in what the company was doing and were willing to put their names on the line.\n\n\u201cOur CFO joined us and 2 days later he\u2019s on a call where investors were insulting him,\u201d Arikawe said. \u201cA similar incident happened with Sowho, who joined and 1 week later had 300 angry people on a Zoom call with her.\u201d\n\nIn a few months, the presence of additional hands, fresh ideas, and the \u201cbridge\u201d capital (temporary financing) provided by Ventures Platform helped stabilise ThriveAgric.\n\nTransparency\u2014the currency of trust\n\nDuring this period, members of the support team and other departments had to work overnight for many days.\n\n\u201cEveryone was stretched but we had a lot of empathy for the people and also a sense of responsibility to ensure that things don\u2019t go wrong again,\u201d Arikawe said.\n\nOn one of those nights, the engineering team in collaboration with the support team, decided to enhance transparency around the repayment schedule by creating a new payout dashboard\u2014Payout.thriveagric.com\u2014that reflected each retail investor\u2019s exact repayment date.\n\nThis was done to fix an issue with the initial payment dashboard which automatically indicated that the retail investors had been paid, as soon as it was due date. This feature caused retailer investors to be confused and angry, because they hadn\u2019t been paid.\n\n\u201cWhen we initially built the payout dashboard we didn\u2019t foresee a period like this where we wouldn\u2019t have been able to pay. People always got paid on or before payout day,\u201d Arikawe said.\n\nWith the new payout dashboard, the retail investors could also see how many other people have been paid. A feature which the engineering team hoped would provide extra comfort and ease tension.\n\nUtilising the bridge loan secured, over the span of 9 months ThriveAgric was able to pay back the hundreds of customers it was owing. Akinyemi was paid in November and December 2020. ThriveAgric also repaid the bridge loan in 2021.\n\nUnexpected support and lessons\n\nDuring the turbulent period, there was a lot of pushback from retail investors but also surprisingly a lot of support from investors, financiers, and friends.\n\n\u201cI remember people calling and asking, what\u2019s the challenge, what do you need?\u201d Arikawe said. \u201cFor example, one of the people we sold birds to but hadn\u2019t paid called to apologise that he\u2019s trying his best. He was owing us because someone else was owing him.\u201d\n\nAfter 6 months at the helm of ThriveAgric, Sowho left to join telecom giant MTN Nigeria as its first-ever female Chief Marketing Officer while Eje returned to the position of CEO. During his time as COO, Eje worked on ensuring that repayment and communications with different stakeholders happened seamlessly.\n\n\u201cEssentially, I ensured that the core business operations ran smoothly and built a system to ensure that the defaulting offtakers paid,\u201d Eje said. \u201cI also identified other funding opportunities outside crowdfunding.\u201d\n\nReminiscing on her experience, she said, \u201cYou often wonder whether you can hack it with a turnaround, and I did, so that\u2019s one thing I learned. Now people are calling me the queen of turnaround after one event.\u201d\n\nAnother valuable lesson for Sowho was how she was able to manage her productivity considering that she joined ThriveAgric during the pandemic and managed things virtually.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realise how focused I could be, because I\u2019m one of those people that like to do everything all the time, all at once,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cBut I think in this situation, the urgency required that I stay very focused.\u201d\n\nThere were ThriveAgric team members she didn\u2019t meet until about 2\u20133 months into the job, because she was very focused on talking to the people nearest to this issue.\n\nFor the team at ThriveAgric, the incident was a learning moment for them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning to scale with structure. Right now as we explore different opportunities, we look at the risks and how to scale sustainably,\u201d Eje said. \u201cFor us, we\u2019re still certain about what we want to do. It\u2019s still day one.\u201d\n\nKola Aina believes the incident was a reminder as an investor that \u201csupporting companies through difficult times is one of the truest forms of portfolio support.\u201d\n\nOpportunities ahead\n\nThriveAgric has since paused crowdfunding from retail investors to focus on institutional investors. Since the pivot, ThriveAgric has sealed investment partnerships with several commercial banks, the CBN, World Food Program, and USAID. Its landmark partnership came recently in the form of a one-year project in partnership with USAID-backed West Africa Trade & Investment Hub (Trade Hub).\n\nThe partnership, which aims to empower at least 50,000 farmers across Nigeria, will be supported with a $1.75 million co-investment grant from Trade Hub. The startup is also focusing on building out its farmer-centred technology solutions which currently serves over 200,000 farmers. The company\u2019s focus is to build the largest network of profitable farmers across Africa.\n\n\u201cAgritech is not just about having a website and asking people for money,\u201d Eje said. \u201cIt\u2019s about building the infrastructure that supports the food production value chain.\u201d\n\nSultan Quadri contributed to this story.\n\n*Name changed to protect source\u2019s identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

If you\u2019re still lost, I\u2019m referring to the World Cup qualifiers between Ghana and Nigeria on March 25 and 29, 2022. The first leg takes place in Kumasi, Ghana, with the second leg in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja.\n\nThe Nigerian tech space was abuzz on Monday, March 21, 2022, following the report on Bento\u2019s work culture. For over seven hours, thousands of Nigerians shared their experiences of toxic work environments.\n\nHowever, after the outrage has died down, what can be done to ensure employees have a conducive environment to work in? We discussed that and more on the Techpoint Africa podcast. Do listen and share with your friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn today\u2019s email:\n\nThriveAgric\u2019s debt funding\n\nFaster Internet for Oyo residents\n\nLessons from Egypt\n\nThriveAgric\u2019s debt funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY Combinator-backed ThriveAgric has raised $56.4 million in debt funding from institutional investors and local commercial banks. The raise also includes a grant of $1.75 million from the USAID-funded West Africa Trade & Investment Hub.\n\nFounded in 2017, ThriveAgric provides farmers with financing, access to premium markets, and tech-enabled solutions for their farms. At first, the startup used a crowdfunding model to raise capital which it deployed to the farmers.\n\nHowever, following disruptions to its supply chain by the coronavirus pandemic, the startup faced difficulties repaying its users and received backlash from angry users.\n\nConsequently, it moved away from its crowdfunding model to raise capital from institutional investors. About the same time, its Co-founder, Uka Eje, had to step down from his role as CEO temporarily, and Adia Sowho was brought in to steady the ship. Those decisions seem to have paid off, with the startup finally paying off its debt to investors in 2021.\n\nWith this raise, the startup intends to expand its operations to other African countries, starting with Ghana, Kenya, and Zambia. It also wants to add to its database of over 200,000 farmers.\n\nAccording to Eje, \u201cThe new investment takes us one step closer to fulfilling our mission of building the largest network of profitable African farmers using technology to ensure food security. We look ahead with renewed confidence knowing that our smallholder farmers will benefit financially even more from this new investment.\u201d\n\nFaster Internet for Oyo residents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidents of Oyo, a state in South-Western Nigeria, are about to witness improved Internet speeds following a partnership between Tizeti and Microsoft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThrough the Microsoft Airband Initiative, the two organisations will leverage low-cost wireless technology to make Internet connection easier and cheaper for state residents.\n\nIn a statement, Tizeti\u2019s CEO, Kendall Ananyi, said, \u201cWe are happy to work with Microsoft on the Airband Initiative as it extends our mission of bringing affordable and reliable internet to more Nigerians outside the digital envelope.\u201d\n\nDespite the giant strides made by Africans in technology, there are still many on the continent who cannot afford to access the Internet. Consequently, they cannot benefit from opportunities that come with an Internet connection.\n\nWith a high unemployment rate and a youthful population, connecting more Nigerians to the Internet could go a long way to access more job opportunities.\n\nFounded in 2012 by Ananyi and Ifeanyi Okonkwo, Tizeti provides low-cost Internet access to Africans. The 2017 Y Combinator alumni currently serve Nigeria and Ghana and have previously raised a $2.1 million seed funding and $3 million in a Series A round.\n\nLessons from Egypt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past year, the Egyptian startup ecosystem has received more attention as its startups attract multi-million dollar investments. This growth has been partially aided by policies that favoured the creation of startups.\n\nThis week, some of Egypt\u2019s largest banks have decided to throw their weight and money behind the country\u2019s fintech startups with the launch of Nclude, a fintech-focused fund. The banks include the National Bank of Egypt, Banque du Caire, eFinance Investment Group, Egyptian Banks Company, and Banque Misr.\n\nThe banks have partnered with Global Ventures in an $85 million investment. Already, the coalition has invested in four startups, including Lucky, Khazna, Paymob, and Mozare3.\n\nIn a statement, Governor of the Central Bank of Egypt, Tarek Amer, said, \u201cThis step is an implementation of the directives of President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to support innovative youth in the fintech and fintech-enabled sectors, as well as CBE\u2019s fintech and innovation strategy which aims to create an enabling environment for the fintech industry and adopt more innovative fintech solutions capable of delivering banking and financial services to all segments of society more easily and at less cost, as a crucial step to transform Egypt into a regional centre for the fintech industry in the Arab World and Africa.\u201d\n\nPoor financial services have meant Africa\u2019s predominantly youthful population slowly gravitating towards fintech startups. In response, traditional banks have launched similar services to stay competitive.\n\nOn the flip side, these startups have also been on the receiving end of harsh government policies. However, this approach by Egypt\u2019s biggest banks is a welcome development and could foster collaboration between banks and fintech startups in the country. Rather than stifle growth, other African countries will do well to borrow a leaf from Egypt.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nFantasy sports apps are driving a surge in gambling addiction in India.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello!\n\nIt was a black Monday in China yesterday following a crash of flight MU5735 in Guangxi province. According to reports, a 6-year-old Boeing 737-800 carrying 132 people crashed after it sharply dropped from an altitude of 29,100 feet to 3,225 feet in three minutes.\n\nMy reaction to the unfortunate news was, \u201cBoeing, not again!\u201d after I remembered a Netflix documentary, Downfall: The Case Against Boeing, detailing the Boeing MAX 737 scandal.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I mentioned how real-crime documentaries leave me upset and how I\u2019m, unfortunately, obsessed with them. If you\u2019re wondering what upsets me about these documentaries outside the crimes, it\u2019s how little justice is served if ever it gets done. There\u2019s only so much the heart can take, you know.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, let\u2019s get into what we\u2019re discussing this today:\n\nOf scandals and toxic work cultures\n\nLendsqr: Shopify for African lenders\n\nFund rain in Kenya\n\nOf toxic workplace cultures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigerian Tech Twitter came alive yesterday following an investigative piece by TechCabal\u2019s Damilare Dosumu about Nigerian payroll startup, Bento Africa\u2019s co-founder/CEO, Ebun Okubanjo, who was accused of verbal abuse, undeserved termination of employment, inappropriate behaviour, and overall toxicity at the workplace.\n\nThe article, which incited a lot of emotions, took a long time to put together before a break came in March, as revealed by the author. This was after initial efforts to be granted interviews by former employees failed. Eventually, some ex-staff and current workers at the startup contributed to the piece either anonymously or with full disclosure.\n\nGet the full gist: Tyranny in the workplace: The chaotic culture of Bento Africa\n\nThe central topic of discussion \u2014 toxic workplace cultures \u2014 has been escalated by different people who have either been recipients of such harsh conditions at other organisations or have had to come to the rescue of someone who was. Asides from that, there\u2019s been a lot of finger-pointing, too many to keep track of.\n\nIf anything, the attending reactions have encouraged more people to speak up; some legal personnel were seen promising support to anyone interested in litigation and health workers encouraged victims to consider therapy. Consequently, a Twitter Space with over 17,000 participants at its peak and ran for more than five hours had people sharing experiences.\n\nAll these leave some questions behind. When the initial rage wears out, what would be the long term implications of discoveries like this? Would it push employers to be deliberate about promoting a healthy workplace culture? Could it encourage more aggrieved employees to speak out in real-time to expose any infringement on rights? Does this mean Africans will give sincere reviews about companies without fear on platforms like Glassdoor?\n\nFor a moment, it appears we\u2019re moving away from the reality that protecting employee interest in the Nigerian tech space is harder than it looks. And, I think that\u2019s great. What do you think?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShopify for African lenders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdedeji Olowe, Founder, Lendsqr\n\nEfforts to help Africans build strong credit muscles didn\u2019t start today, and they are coming in different forms. From digital lending platforms to buy-now-pay-later models, to loan retrieval solutions.\n\nIn a recent development, Adedeji Olowe, Trustee, Open Banking Nigeria, came up with a solution to give credit access to Africans, a pretty tricky space to play, in my opinion. However, leaning on his neck-deep experience in the fintech space, he seems to have covered the basics.\n\nRead his story here: Adedeji Olowe is building a global reputation as Africa\u2019s open banking leader\n\nThe deets: Deciding not to go the conventional way, the resulting startup, Lendsqr\u2019s ultimate goal is to build a large-scale lending infrastructure in Africa.\n\nHow is it doing this? Lendsqr provides small to medium-sized lenders with a comprehensive technology and data stack to lend to customers at scale using the best of breed decision engine, integration to payments systems, and data for quality decisions.\n\nSo far, the founder claims that Lendsqr already has over 100 lenders offering credit to almost half a million users.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole lot of information to unpack, why don\u2019t you enjoy the full story as written by Emmanuel Paul.\n\nRead here: Lendsqr is building the Shopify for lending in Africa\n\nFund rain in Kenya: Powered by People, Apollo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R: Eli Pollak (Co-founder & CEO), Benjamin Njenga (Co-founder & CCO), and Earl St Sauver (Co-founder).

Doesn\u2019t it seem investors are seeing what many people aren\u2019t? Last week, it was Wasoko(formerly, Sokowatch) raising $125m series B led by Tiger Global. Months before that, five other eCommerce startups have raised $275m combined in VC fund and debt financing.\n\nYesterday, Kenya-based Powered by People raised a $5m seed led by Susa Ventures and Golden Ventures with participation from a number of investors including Flexport Ventures, J Ventures, and the founders of DraftKings and Fabric.\n\nThe startup powers a B2B eCommerce marketplace to connect small businesses with retailers while removing any supply chain inconveniences, thereby giving them visibility into both local and international retail markets.\n\nPowered by People also offers credit facilities to businesses to help speed up production so as to meet up with demand. The fund raised is to get more clients and increase the startup\u2019s reach across borders.\n\nConsidering its trajectory, the three-year-old startup expects to grow its annual run rate to $25m from $15m.\n\nRead more: Kenya-based Powered by People gets $5 million seed to scale operations of its wholesale e-commerce platform\n\nIn another news, Kenyan-founded agritech startup, Apollo raised $40m in a Series B round led by Softbank with participation from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Yara Growth Ventures, Endeavor Catalyst, CDC, among others. This is coming after a $6m Series A in 2020 and $1m in debt financing in 2021.\n\nListen to Apollo\u2019s story here.\n\nFounded in 2016, the startup provides small-scale farmers with all they need to boost their productivity, like credit facilities, product financing, and insurance.\n\nWith this raise, Apollo plans to spread its tentacles into West Africa and other parts of East Africa.\n\nRead more: Kenya-based agritech Apollo raises $40 million in Softbank-led round, joined by Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, CDC\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nAmazon\u2019s Africa headquarters may be put on hold over indigenous people\u2019s concerns.

Like a giant onion bulb, when one financial service issue is resolved, other layers reveal more issues to be solved.\n\nWhen businesses found it difficult to receive payments online, people hurt under ridiculous bank charges, but fintech companies have come to the rescue.\n\nToday, financial inclusion has improved considerably from previous years. For example, Nigeria\u2019s banked adult population has increased from 36 million in 2016 to 47.7 million in 2020. As of March 13, 2022, the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) places the number of Nigerian bank account holders at 53 million.\n\nHowever, the bulk of Nigeria\u2019s financial inclusion growth has come from savings and payments, leaving a considerable gap in the credit and insurance space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdedeji Olowe, Open Banking Nigeria Trustee, believes that unlocking credit access is a surer method of boosting financial inclusion in Africa. Tying into his ambition to democratise banking in Nigeria, he is currently building Lendsqr, a startup that would create large-scale lending infrastructure in Africa.\n\n\u201cI believe that without an evolving middle-class, we may not come out of our national morass. But without credit to help people stand up, the middle-class wouldn\u2019t emerge.\u201d\n\nWith over two decades of experience in banking, credit, technology, and venture capital, Olowe delved into lending in his two-year (2006 \u2013 2008) stint at First City Monument Bank (FCMB), one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks, where he built a lending system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdedeji Olowe\n\nOlowe, who is on the boards of Sparkle and Paystack, has been neck-deep in Nigeria\u2019s financial space, having previously been the chairman of TeamApt.\n\nOlowe is currently building a reputation as Africa\u2019s Open Banking leader, and our Senior Reporter, Oluwanifemi, went behind the scenes of his enviable LinkedIn profile. However, building any lending solution is tough, but what the fintech mogul has planned with Lendsqr is a different beast entirely.\n\nThe stubborn onion bulb\n\nNigeria\u2019s lending space could be likened to the difficult parts of the onion bulb that are not so straightforward to peel. Accessing credit in Nigeria is difficult, and for good reasons.\n\nA 2021 Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFInA) report reveals that in 2020, only 3% of Nigeria\u2019s 106 million adults had access to credit from a regulated financial institution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch a low percentage points to a considerable gap, and per Lendqr\u2019s analysis, the credit market is worth \u20a672 trillion ($173.5 billion) in Nigeria alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTraditional financial institutions should be jumping at the opportunity, right? Apparently not, and for a good reason.\n\nMost financial institutions across Africa are only willing to lend to the most creditworthy of borrowers like governments, large corporations, and high-net-worth individuals. The scenario is different for small businesses and regular individuals.\n\n\u201cSmall firms and individuals borrow at high rates because of the high risks involved as lenders do not have information on their credit behaviours,\u201d said Juma Reli, Bank of Tanzania Deputy Governor, at the launch of the country\u2019s official databank.\n\nIn recent years, several digital lending platforms have sprung up in Nigeria, but going by current events, most have been operating illegally and unethically. The few legal ones constantly deal with loan defaulters.\n\nIn 2009, just 15 million Kenyans had access to credit, but that number rose by 7.2 million in the next seven years.\n\nHowever, loan defaulters and rogue lenders are also increasing.\n\nAll things considered, Olowe believes it may be hard to blame institutional lenders. The average Nigerian\u2019s credit score has not improved considerably, and the low lending percentage says it all.\n\n\u201cThen came the light bulb moment \u2014 what if tech and data are combined, made available at bargain prices, to enable lenders to lend securely and responsibly? Wouldn\u2019t that make lenders expand? Wouldn\u2019t that curb chronic debtors and block them from abusing credits?\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t that make institutional investors make capital available to lenders? Wouldn\u2019t lenders be able to reach Africans at the point of need through BNPL?\u201d Olowe asks.\n\nProviding a solution\n\nTo tackle the issues with lending, Lendsqr provides small to medium-sized lenders with a comprehensive technology and data stack to lend to customers at scale using the best of breed decision engine, integration to payments systems, and data for quality decisions.\n\nAn excellent way to explain the startup\u2019s value offering would be Canadian tech giant, Shopify. The platform allows retailers to create and manage their online stores. If you have anything to sell online, Shopify takes the pains of creating your website and lets you customise the platform to attract visitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Lendsqr provides a platform for any company interested in entering the lending game.\n\n\u201cOur stack has 100% of everything a lender needs to lend. And they can register and issue their first loan in five minutes, running off one of the largest data repositories for credit in Nigeria. All for free.\u201d\n\nFor context, data on a business or an individual is critical for any lending decision. Your employment history, your income level, and your debt-to-income ratio all come into play. Behind the scenes, there are hundreds of data variables to choose from.\n\nOlowe explains that this data comes from lenders already on Lendsqr and from other established lenders, who he prefers to keep secret for now. Lendsqr is also plugged into the CRC Credit Bureau and Credit Registry.\n\nRecall that in 2020, a former OKash CEO went on to create a Blacklist, a platform for small digital lenders to access data on Nigerian borrowers.\n\nThe Blacklist creator, Darlington Onyeagoro, who\u2019s currently CEO of Aladdin, a digital bank, argued that such a platform would create little escape room for serial defaulters.\n\nOn the flip side, such a platform can be positively used by lenders to make decisions.\n\n\u201cWe plan to use this data to unleash credit for the underbanked. And we\u2019re powering our lenders to reach their customers via our Web app, Android app, iOS app, and Web SDK,\u201d Olowe explains.\n\nLendsqr has painstakingly assembled a team of engineers and data experts with experience in Nigeria\u2019s credit and tech space. However, there are players with similar value offerings.\n\nIn 2020, Evolve Credit went live as a marketplace for borrowers to review and choose the best lenders to borrow from. Since its launch, it has evolved into a platform offering a cloud-based solution for would-be lenders. It claims to help them set up in 24 hours.\n\nIndicina\u2019s product, Originate, helps lenders digitise identity verification, credit decision/analytics, and disbursements and collections.\n\nThough initially offering similar features to the other two, Creditclan, has pivoted to aid the process for buy now, pay later (BNPL) companies, a growing sensation in the eCommerce space.\n\nInterestingly, Lendsqr claims its customers can start lending in five mins with already configured products and domain names.\n\n\u201cOur cost of set up and user onboarding is as cheap as free (\u20a60). Our decision engine is very smart with over 300 data variables available for lenders to tweak as they wish, yet we provide them with simple start configurations, to begin with,\u201d Olowe submits.\n\nContinuing, he says, \u201cOur collections and recovery is relentless; it hunts down bad borrowers until the very end. We have one of the largest blacklists to protect lenders from predatory borrowers and chronic debtors.\n\n\u201cFor our APIs, unlike the credit bureau and others, we only charge if and only if it finds data.\u201d\n\nSolutions can be tearful\n\nLendsqr\u2019s aggressive approach certainly comes at a cost. Few people can boast of not tearing up when peeling an onion or trying to build a startup\n\nIf Lendsqr has zero costs for setup and user onboarding, how does it make money? The answer seemingly lies in playing an Amazon-esque long game.\n\n\u201cThe core of our revenue model is charging a fee when we help lenders collect their loans. And there is an alignment \u2014 we don\u2019t charge them before \u2014 our bread isn\u2019t buttered before theirs,\u201d Olowe insists.\n\nConsidering this, any keen observer can guess Lendsqr will earnestly chase growth and try to corner the lending market. So far, it is growing an enviable user base.\n\nThe CEO claims that Lendsqr already has over 100 lenders offering credit to almost half a million users.\n\n\u201cLendsqr will break even after two years. We follow the model of Amazon \u2014 amazing technology and data play at basement level pricing,\u201d Olowe maintains, and for emphasis, adds Jeff Bezos\u2019 famous words, \u201cYour margin is my opportunity.\u201d\n\nWhen building products for the African market, its peculiarities have to be addressed. For instance, the challenges involved with building a lending infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe cost of underwriting is high in Africa, which puts lenders in a bind. The technology is too expensive to build. Or the cost of data (Credit bureau and statement) is so expensive it is ruinous to small ticket loans.\u201d\n\nOlowe and his team at Lendsqr have had to draw on their wealth of experience and network to navigate the space.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to engage with different data providers, credit bureaus, and others. We successfully argued cases for cheaper and scalable lending with the likes of CRC and Mono, who are partners in this journey.\u201d\n\nThese were just some of the wins, though, as Lendsqr had to walk away from some data providers with unnecessarily high usage costs.\n\nThe rewards at the end\n\nWhen eating a well-prepared meal, few people remember the tear-filled eyes of the onion-slicing cook. The same applies to the founder of a unicorn. For a financial sector replete with lending-averse financial institutions, Olowe is adamant that Lendsqr is tailored to match the market\u2019s reality.\n\n\u201cWe are a scale company. We understand that the categories of lenders we are serving are super sensitive about pricing, and we offer propositions that are unmatched in value anywhere in Africa.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer Olowe, Lendsqr is using its scale to pass on cost savings to the lenders, which invariably leads to cheaper loans for Africans and Nigerians.\n\nSo far, Lendsqr\u2019s approach has won the hearts of investors as it has closed an undisclosed pre-seed round. On the strength of this, Lendsqr has some major upgrades in sight.\n\n\u201cIn four months, our lenders would have access to native mobile SDKs that allow them to lend even to the mass market, using their phone data for free instead of paying over $0.5 (\u20a6250) as offered by many lendtech providers.\u201d\n\nThe startup also plans to hit customers at their point of need by targeting BNPL players across different sectors.\n\nBeyond technology, it also plans to connect lenders with capital providers to help them scale their lending.\n\nOlowe encapsulates Lendsqr\u2019s immediate vision with the following words:\n\n\u201cWithin 18 months, 1 in 4 consumer credit in Nigeria would either be originated by lenders on Lendsqr or Lendsqr would have provided data comfort to other lenders.\u201d\n\nTo understand the full impact of Lendsqr\u2019s development, one only needs to look at the recent funding trends for BNPL startups, credit-led neobanks, and innovative companies like Indicina and Evolve Credit playing in the space. All things being equal, Africa\u2019s lending scene looks set to explode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator. Tech, business and policies fills my head. Looking to chat?

Nigeria is among the top 20 nations that contribute 83 percent of the total volume of land-based plastic waste that ends up in the oceans.\n\nA World Bank report estimates that at 0.51 kilogrammes of waste generated daily by each Nigerian, it is forecasted to rise to 107 million tonnes by 2050 \u2013 a development that presents both a threat and an opportunity.\n\nLandfills are overflowing in states like Borno, Aba, and Osun states.

          "text": "From creating local equipment to aid waste disposal to forming partnerships with the private sector, Lagos State is setting up a winning model on how to formalise waste management in Nigeria.\n\nThe Lagos State government under Babajide Sanwo-Olu seeks to turn Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital, home to over 24 million people, into a smart city and has identified proper management of over 13,000 metric tonnes of solid waste generated daily in the state as critical to achieving this ambition.\n\nThe overarching strategy behind Lagos State\u2019s waste disposal management system is enacting strong fiscal and regulatory frameworks that will stir private operators into the process.\n\nThis is implemented along with comprehensive advocacy campaigns that reach mass audiences while employing technology and local content strategy through the value chains.\n\nThe Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA), a parastatal under the Ministry of Environment, serves as regulator and is headed by an investment banker, Ibrahim Odumboni, who used to head the agency\u2019s business development drive.\n\nLAWMA has divided Lagos into a waste collection grid system to cover every nook and cranny of the city and enable quick processing of wastes where they occur rather than trucking them to landfills many miles away. They are eastern, central, western, south-east and northwest districts.\n\nInside these grids are solid waste processing centres including loading stations and material processing sites, which are managed by private operators. The peculiar type of waste generated around each district informs the recycling method and collection strategy.\n\nLAWMA has constructed new facilities to aid waste disposal across the districts. This includes new landfills, transfer loading stations, material recovery facilities, waste mechanical workshops, composite plants, medical waste incineration plants, recyclable waste collection hubs and recycling facilities.\n\nThe agency has created \u2018Adopt a Bin\u2019, a plan that encourages private organisations and individuals to support the acquisition of bins for those who are unable to afford it. There is also the Lagos Recycling initiative, which is aimed at encouraging the separation of waste from the point of generation for recycling purposes and encouraging waste to wealth.\n\nThe agency has set up the LAWMA Academy, which takes the advocacy of proper waste management to primary and secondary schools from age 3 to 18.\n\n\u201cAll the public primary schools in Lagos are now teaching proper waste management as part of their curriculum and private schools are joining as well,\u201d Odumboni told BusinessDay by phone.\n\nLast year, LAWMA launched the PAKAM App to residents to order a pickup of their recyclables including bottles, metal, tin and can. Residents have to bag it, request collection on the app, and a recycler will come to pick it up, mostly on Saturday morning. It is processed and reused to make pillows, plastics and other household materials. Residents are awarded N10,000 monthly for doing this.\n\nRead also: NGO urges concerted efforts to check dumping of plastic wastes in rivers\n\nThese reforms have led to the decentralisation of LAWMA\u2019s operation and contributed to the creation of 30,000 jobs from street sweepers to medical incinerator plant fabricators, according to Odumboni.\n\nThe state government recently acquired for LAWMA new 102 compactors, which were locally assembled, in addition to the over 900 trucks currently in operation by the various PSP contractors.\n\n\u201cWe have set minimum standards for our PSP and the number of operators has now gone from 327 to 450 operators; this means that all of the local governments or wards that were not covered previously are now covered,\u201d he said.\n\nIn public parks and marketplaces, LAWMA has added an additional 100 double Dino bins where waste can be stored for onward movement to landfills.\n\nLagos is encouraging investors to develop solutions that will harness methane gas from waste at landfills to generate electricity. It is driving waste to wealth initiatives, creating 728 new companies to take advantage of the reform initiatives.\n\nLAWMA is forging local solutions assembling trucks and equipment that are adapted for Lagos conditions and where replacement parts are locally sourced. The incinerators for medical waste used in the state were fabricated locally.\n\nAdvocacy activities towards proper waste management have been ramped up. But in a state that welcomes, on average, 77 new occupants every hour, it sometimes seems nothing is being done. In secondary schools, there are now recycling clubs and public information notices directing residents to recycle bins.\n\nOdumboni\u2019s private sector experience has been invaluable in raising financing to fund the agency\u2019s programme. The agency raised N3 billion from First City Monument Bank, with the support of the International Finance Corporation to improve the operations of waste managers in the state.\n\nTunji Bello, commissioner for environment, launched a recycle and reward programme last year to encourage participation in the state, saying the state had devised new modalities to encourage seamless movement of waste.\n\n\u201cWe started partnering with the Ogun State government on the use of our transfer loading stations. We are creating as many transfer loading stations as possible that can retain all the waste generated in Lagos and at night, transfer them to landfills in Ogun State,\u201d he said.\n\nDays when landfills are perpetually burning are gradually going away. At landfills, there is controlled burning, and heavy machines used for sorting wastes have become a feature of material recovery sites.\n\nOdumboni said from April this year, it would be mandatory for estates and businesses to separate waste from the source.\n\nTo sustain these reforms, he said the government had approved that all the decision managers attend courses on the circular economy. Each project also has a sustainable manager that charts the course for the sustainability of the project.\n\nThe state\u2019s ministry of environment has created the Lagos monitor app for residents to report those whose actions threaten the environment such as indiscriminate waste dumping, burning refuse and flooding drainage.\n\nFor Lagos, poor management of waste presents an existential crisis. The total economic loss due to flooding in Lagos is estimated at over $4 billion a year by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Rising sea levels and ocean surges present grave dangers.\n\nBy 2100, the UNDP expects that the population of the state would balloon to 88 million, becoming the largest city in the world, making it imperative for the government to make waste management systems sustainable.",

Take for example, going home after training as an athlete to drink garri and eat other carbohydrates for supper in comparison to another athlete who eats the right diet and vitamins.\n\n\u201cThe one with the right diet will definitely perform better than the other athlete who is eating the wrong food or diet.\n\n\u201d We also need to be provided with modern equipment.

Most of our strategy in terms of thinking of our future has been drastically changed as a result of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cFor us, our focus is on our culture; how to engage the world to preserve our ecosystem, which includes our forestry, and utilize technology to drive development, particularly in the area of education, skill development and security.\n\n\u201cOur aspiration is to plan our cities and take the opportunity of the post-COVID-19 era to build infrastructure.

We have designed a cultural district and would build a pavilion to hold the artefacts being returned to our state.\n\n\u201cWe have a technology park that would train young people to take advantage of the boom in the technology sector.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u2026 chides political elite for failing to engender devt\n\n\u2026 Edo attracts $500m investment into agric sector\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said Nigeria can adopt the novel interventions and radical changes implemented in Edo State in tackling the myriad of challenges and stem the country\u2019s current slide to economic and socio-political crisis.\n\nThe governor said this while delivering the 2022 Nigeria Institute of International Affairs (NIIA) Distinguished Lecture Series titled, \u201cMaking Politics Work for Citizens, Governance and Development: The Edo State Experience,\u201d at the Institute, in Victoria Island, Lagos.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cWe should also reflect on why we the political actors particularly those of us who are the political elite, who have the responsibility not only to institutionalize the democratic process but also to develop a political culture which should foster and enhance development, have so far failed to do so.\u201d\n\nThe governor noted that although politics and democracy have not dealt favourably with Nigeria, this does not deny the existence of the potential for democracy to be the vehicle for the delivery of development to the people.\n\nThe governor said some of his achievements include attracting $500m into the state\u2019s agriculture sector; creation of 300,000 jobs; the 95MW Ossiomo power project; improved basic education for over 400,000 pupils, and the 6000bpd-capacity Edo modular refinery, among others.\n\n\u201cIn Edo, we had to take deliberate and intentional steps to retool our politics to engender development. This has led to the introduction of people-centric policies and programmes which have won our administration significant public trust,\u201d he said.\n\nDecrying the failure of the political class, Obaseki added, \u201cAs we commence another political transition in our democratic journey, we must reflect on the challenges faced in this Republic, so that we can better understand why our democratic experience to date has not provided good governance and why our economic and socio-political development have remained stunted.\u201d\n\nSome of the defects of Nigeria\u2019s political system, according to him, include entry barriers to the political system such as age restriction and high cost of nomination and expression of interest; negative perception of politics and the attendant skirmishes including mudslinging, deliberate character assassination and blackmail, which make it unattractive to accomplished professionals to participate in; prohibitive cost of the electioneering process; proliferation of political parties with no clear ideology, and electoral malpractices which have instigated voter apathy.\n\nOn the reforms implemented in Edo State, he said his administration inherited a state that was essentially under the control of various non-state actors who served as enforcers for the old political order in the state, noting that in exchange for their loyalty and service, the pay off was the collection of revenue that should have accrued to the public purse.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFollowing this, we were able to open up the political space to a broad range of players to the chagrin of the godfathers. These patrons of the old order thrived in the exclusion of the majority from participating in the political process. For them, the fewer the actors in the system, the more relevant they were and the more they were able to take the process hostage.\n\n\u201cWith the opening up of the political system, we embarked on institutional reforms to enhance the capacity of the government to deliver public services. This was done by enhancing the work environment, ensuring regular payment of salaries and pensions, improving compensation packages, and creating better conditions of service for workers.\n\n\u201cWe also revamped the public service to cut back on waste and with this, we were able to deliver more projects with less resources than would have been required.\n\n\u201cHaving built public trust, we had to open up the business environment which led to robust partnership with the private sector and international development organisations. With their support, we have been able to substantially curb the menace of human trafficking and irregular migration, which once pillaged our most valuable resources \u2013 our young people.\u201d\n\nThe governor added: \u201cWe rolled out infrastructure projects in a fair and equitable manner that engenders a sense of inclusion among the people across the various sections of the state.\n\n\u201cWe were able to win the trust of the electorate in Edo State because we had focused on ideals that have come to define our politics and through which we have made the most impact in their lives.\n\n\u201cWe placed the people at the center of our politics, which led to huge investment in human capital development, particularly across all tiers of the state\u2019s education system, starting with the Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EdoBEST) programme, which has transformed the lives of over 400,000 pupils across the state and improved learning outcomes.\n\n\u201cThere has been a deliberate emphasis on strengthening partnership with the private sector, from which we have reaped immense benefit. We signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Ossiomo Power Company to provide stable power to government institutions and to also drive the state\u2019s industrial sector. Today, the company generates 95MW out of 550MW it has set out to provide, supported with a distribution infrastructure that has been developed to supply government offices, streetlights and the state\u2019s growing industrial sector with constant electricity.\u201d\n\nOn the Edo example, the governor said Edo presents a very striking example of how Nigeria can fix its intractable electricity problem, which has plagued the country since independence.\n\nHe said: \u201cWith robust partnership with the private sector, the state government has succeeded in encouraging generation by attracting firms like Azura (450Mw) and Ossiomo Power (95MW), and is now proceeding to create its own electricity markets to encourage investments in the distribution of power within the state. Currently, there is stable electricity to power public institutions and infrastructure in metropolitan Benin City.\n\n\u201cIn agriculture, we have attracted almost $500 million investment into palm oil cultivation, having allocated the first phase of 60,000 hectares of land under the Edo State Oil Palm Production Program (ESOPP). Nigeria has not witnessed this scale of oil palm cultivation since independence.\n\n\u201cFollowing the effort to change the paradigm in Edo State and the result it yielded, which highpoint was victory at the election, in which the people freely exercised their franchise and elected a leader of their choice, there is a need to scale this political achievement to the entire country.\n\n\u201cIf what happened in Edo can be replicated in the forthcoming Presidential and National Assembly elections, Nigeria would have taken a critical step to democratic consolidation.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Director General of NIIA, Prof. Eghosa Osaghae said the lecture is rich because the governor is stewed in the classical tradition with his background in classics, which is demonstrated with the achievements recorded in the state since his foray into politics.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman of the occasion, Prof. Bola Akinteriwa, said the lecture is a reminder that foreign policy is an extension of domestic policy, noting, \u201cWe do not have a good international image because of the way we govern ourselves.

          "text": "The House of Representatives has asked the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to enforce the use of coins as a legal tender in the country in bid to check inflation.\n\nAccording to the lawmakers, the use of coins will tackle price inflation and stabilise the economy.\n\nThe resolution was passed during plenary session on Tuesday following the adoption of a motion sponsored by Muda Umar from Bauchi state.\n\nAccording to Umar, the non-usage of coins has had a negative impact on daily business transactions in the country.\n\n\u201cDespite the huge budgetary sum that was expended by the federal government in the production of coins as part of the legal tender, the said coins seem to be extinct at the moment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe day to day business transactions of ordinary Nigerians have been significantly affected as the lack of coins and other lower denominations have resulted in prices being summed up to the nearest naira equivalent, a situation that can best be described as inflation in economic terms.\n\n\u201cWhile other countries make use of coins for their daily financial transactions, the Nigerian coins comprising 50 kobo, N1 and N2 have not been fully utilised in that regard. Injecting low denominations and coins into the economy will go a long way in curbing price inflation and stabilising the economy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to journalists after plenary, Umar said the masses are being shortchanged during daily transactions due to the absence of coins.\n\n\u201cThe coin should be brought back into circulation to be a legal tender like bank notes that we have in circulation. That will ease a lot of hardship and will improve the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe motion was adopted after it was put to a voice vote by Idris Wase, the presiding officer.\n\nSubsequently, the lawmakers asked the CBN to ensure that banks comply with the \u201cuse of coins to the fullest\u201d.\n\nThe house equally mandated the committee on banking and currency to ensure compliance",

Justice P.F. Olayiwola of the Federal High Court, Benin Judicial Division.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Itsekiri National Youth Council further presented a copy of a letter it wrote to the INEC chairman on January 4, 2019 asking INEC to revert to the earlier 10 electoral wards instead of the 12, but INEC has neither obeyed the court ruling nor honour a memorandum they both entered into ahead of 2019, in the interest of fairness, justice and equity.\n\nAgbateyiniro stated, \u201cThat since INEC is a creation of the law and expected at all times to totally obey all subsisting court judgements, we are, therefore, counting strongly on you to do the needful as you have always done since you took over as INEC chairman by using only materials recognising these 10-ward structures to conduct elections in Warri South Local Government Area.\n\n\u201cThis Council shall resist any attempt to use illegal wards to conduct elections in Warri South Local Government Area.\u201d\n\nHe said that there was protest going on simultaneous at INEC office in Warri, but they in Abuja could not protest at INEC premises because of security issues, but promised to continue at the Unity Fountain until the INEC leadership comes to address them or better still resolve the matter as earlier ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, a copy of the memorandum of understanding signed by INEC and INYC, which was witnessed by security agents reads: \u201cUpon the amicable resolution reached between the Resident Electoral Commission (REC) of INEC Asaba and the representatives of the Itsekiri National Youth Council (INYC), in respect of the implementation of the 10 wards judgment delivered by the Federal High Court and the Court of Appeal, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) hereby agrees to do needful in respect of the ward structure after the 2019 elections.\u201d\n\nThe Council added that it was worried that INEC has not respected the agreement, but is rather preparing to conduct the 2023 general elections using what it called a faulty template.",

          "text": "The Fourth Industrial Revolution(4IR) has been identified as crucial to the survival of Nigeria and other African countries which if utilized maximally will help to bridge the technology gap between Africa and the developed countries.\n\nThe African Socio Cultural Development Foundation in collaboration with the Federal Capital Territory Secondary Education Board made this known as efforts are being intensified to increase the knowledge of young Nigerians and Africans about the 4IR.\n\nThis development emerged during an event to showcase \u20184IR Education Africa\u2019 organised Abuja recently where students from four government secondary schools displayed their knowledge on the 4IR.\n\nThe event was in line with the Foundations\u2019 mission which is \u201cTo Keep implementing innovative socio-cultural and socio economic initiatives/interventions to transform African socio cultural values towards achieving a highly socio economically developed Africa. Our interventions, programs, projects and indeed all our activities are designed to make Africans cherish and adopt thinking and behavior that will lead to socio \u2013 economic development.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn line with its vision the foundation said \u201cVery many Africans are poor, most of Africa is underdeveloped, but Africa the continent is rich! Africa is rich in arable land, mineral resources, water, youth and human resources to mention a few. Transforming Africa from the underdeveloped of today to the developed continent of tomorrow entails transforming what Africans think and do with, for and about their resources. Transforming Africa\u2019s Culture that is the sum total of the learned behavior of Africans towards socio-economic development will achieve our vision of all Africans living in a highly socio-economically developed Africa.\u201d\n\nThe CEO of the Foundation, Dr. Christopher Anthony Chibo told reporters at the event that there is an urgent need to bridge the technology gap between the developed countries and developing countries, which is dangerously widening.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is a very dangerous gap because new technologies are being made for production and Africa is not taking advantage of the knowledge and technology. Africa is being left behind when it comes to this. Now, the world is in the Fourth Industrial Revolution and most countries in Africa seem not to know what is happening.\n\n\u201cThat is why we are here to find a way to breach the gap and to give our children the knowledge of the technology they need. African children are some of the brightest in the world and what we are doing now is grooming them in their own nation with the knowledge they need to take Africa forward.\n\n\u201cWe are raising funds and targeting the students because they have a new focus in life and they have new decisions to make. We are going to give the best of them the scholarship to go and acquire what they need to know so that they can come back and apply knowledge in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe said their target is every student in public schools and as of now, they have started with 280 schools using SS3 students in four schools in Abuja for the pilot phase. He added that the foundation is giving the children technology knowledge and that is being done free of charge.\n\nWhile speaking, the Secretary for Education FCT, Sani Dahir Elkatuzu, said he believes the first revolution brought serious problems in Africa while 4IR provides a level playing ground as it does not depend on the level of development but talents.\n\nIn his reaction, Assistant Director of Bilateral Relations, FCT Secondary Education Board, Yakubu Ibrahim, said with smart technology becoming more mainstream, there is a need to consider the impact 4IR will have on society and the workforce.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIf we need to be relevant and marketable, then we require human capacity in 4IR, so it becomes necessary for all and sundry to adopt it,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpeaking on the choice of secondary schools for 4IR knowledge, Ibrahim said with the number of young and upcoming generation, there is dire need to formulate policies that could harness the potentials of the energetic population for national development.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has inaugurated the new Terminal Building of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos.\n\nThe terminal has sixty-six check-in-counters, sixteen Immigration desks at arrival, twenty-eight Immigration desks at departure, and eight security screening points, among others.\n\nBuhari said it would go a long way in contributing to the socio-political and economic prosperity of the country,\n\nHe said the completion and delivery of five brand new international airport terminals since 2015, which were at 11% completion level then, aligns perfectly with the Aviation Roadmap.\n\nThe road map was developed in 2016, for the purposes of establishing critical infrastructure, including a National Carrier as well as maintenance, repairs and overhaul centre, and improved Airports Terminals through concession.\n\nThe President described as unprecedented the administration\u2019s investments in inter-state rail connectivity, road networks, agriculture, power and telecommunications.\n\nThis was done despite limitations in resources.\n\nHe the robust initiatives have been complemented with specific fiscal policies to drive aviation infrastructure renaissance.\n\n\u2018\u2018These include the designation of 4 airports, namely Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt as Free Trade Zones, in which customs duty is not applicable; removal of VAT on all forms of shared transportation, including air transportation; and exemption of commercial aircraft and spare parts from VAT payment.\n\n\u2018\u2018Similar projects at both the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport and Port Harcourt International Airport were completed and commissioned by this administration and our people have since been benefiting from the positive economic impacts of those magnificent terminals.\n\n\u2018\u2018The one in Kano has also been completed, and will be commissioned soon, while work continues apace to complete that of Enugu shortly,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe added that the improvement in Lagos terminal would increase airport operations and management services to about 14 million passengers per annum, create 3,000 direct and indirect jobs, increase inflow of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) and exponential growth in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nHe thanked the Government and People of the Republic of China, through the China Export-Import Bank and CCECC Nigeria Limited, (FAAN), for their commitment and support towards the completion of the project.\n\nThe President also commended the Federal Ministry of Aviation and its agencies, particularly, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, for working assiduously towards the realization of the project.\n\n\u2018\u2018With the delivery of this project, a new era of safety, security, and comfort has been ushered into the Nigerian aviation industry, and I am persuaded that it will get better with the passage of time,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe Governor of Lagos State Babajide Sanwo-Olu said it was instructive that Lagos State in one day had witnessed the evolution of three major infrastructure development projects that will change the Nigerian landscape while commending President Buhari for the infrastructural renewal and redevelopment necessary for a city like Lagos.\n\nHe lauded the private sector in the aviation industry for their continued contributions to the growth of the country despite the challenges.\n\nThe Governor informed the gathering that Lagos State Government was forming a partnership with FAAN towards ensuring that the new international terminal enjoys easy access which would be achieved by creating a bypass, the Airport \u2013 Alimosho Bypass Project, to create an alternative route to the airport.\n\nThe signing of the agreement for the partnership was later done by the officials of the Lagos State Government and FAAN.\n\nIn his remarks, Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika said aviation is the worldwide rapid transportation network that facilitates international trade, commerce and tourism, the only medium for achieving continental integration and interaction towards achieving the AU Agenda 2063.\n\nHe commended the administration of President Buhari for efforts towards resolving the problems inherited in the aviation industry in 2015 such as lack of professionalism, scarcity of foreign exchange, obsolete equipment, poor facilities, blocked funds for airlines among others, adding that more still needed to be done.\n\nThe Minister said the airport concession project including the new terminals has reached an advanced stage with the Ministry issuing requests for shortlisted firms before the end of March.\n\nAccording to the Minister, a study by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) on Nigeria in 2020, \u201cshowed that the sector created 241,000 jobs, direct and indirect, and contributed $1.7billion to the economy,\u201d with a hope to grow the contribution of the sector from the current 0.68% to 5% or approximately $14.16billion.\n\nSenator Sirika gave assurances that the new terminal will be linked to the railway system.",

          "text": "The Chairman Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors\u2019 Forum and Sokoto state Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal has said more than anything, the factor of demography would determine who becomes president in 2023.\n\nHe also declared that any thought about Muslim-Muslim or Christian \u2013 Christian ticket in the nation\u2019s political permutation in the next general elections \u201cis dead on arrival.\u201d\n\nBy the dictionary meaning, demography means \u201cthe study of statistics such as births, deaths, income, or the incidence of disease, which illustrate the changing structure of human populations.\u201d\n\nHe spoke Tuesday during a meeting with former Presiding Officers of State Assemblies and House of Representatives at Fraser Suit, Central Business District Abuja.\n\nRather than dwelling on zoning, Tambuwal, a former Speaker of the House of Representatives (2011-2015), charged the PDP to be concerned about winning election and sharing power thereafter.\n\nTambuwal, who described himself as the most qualified to lead Nigeria come 2023 said, \u201cfrom the array of those that are running now I don\u2019t know of tomorrow, all the names being mentioned that are at the forefront of this consideration for 2023, I am the youngest of them all. Go and check our bio data, check the genuine one.\u201d\n\nOn the choice of his party as it concerns zoning and its next candidate, the governor appealed to PDP to study previous election results ahead of next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs leaders of our party, who are working towards winning election, not zoning, not winning tickets. Yes we can share ticket and everybody can take his piece and go to his zone. But you must plan to win election. That\u2019s the reality of it. It\u2019s not anybody\u2019s making.\n\n\u201cSo we must accept these realities as a party and work with these realities to win election. After we win, we can then say okay, let\u2019s share power. Win election first, don\u2019t win zoning, win the election and then we\u2019ll come and share power, because the President and the Vice President cannot come from the same zone. They cannot even come from the same religion.\n\n\u201cIn fact, they can hardly be of the same faith. If you have president and vice president; Muslim-Muslim, dead on arrival. In the current Nigerian situation, if you have both of them as Christian-Christian, dead on arrival. So you must balance the ticket.\u201d\n\nTo be Nigeria\u2019s president, he said, requires a lot of energy and intellectual capacity.\n\nLooking at how governorship and House of Representatives elections were contested and won in Anambra and Plateau states respectively, he concluded that demographics, intra-party wrangling in the All Progressives Congress (APC), voter education and others would determine the 2023 general election.\n\nHe said: \u201cSo, demography is an issue that is why after the election, I appealed to PDP to study the outcome of previous elections as we proceed to 2023.\u201d\n\nOn Jonathan\u2019s emergence as president\n\nThe former lawmaker also recalled his role in the emergence of then Vice President Goodluck Jonathan as president following the demise of President Umar Musa Yar\u2019Adua.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen it was time for the House of Representatives to go along the Senate on the issue of Doctrine of Necessity that made Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan President, my brother and friend, Dimeji Bankole was not willing to do so. My brother and friend, Senator Dickson Seriake, who was leading the squad for ex-President Jonathan to be made acting president, was doing it the wrong way.\n\n\u201cThere was tension and almost chaos in the House of Representatives. And we called Dickson. I sat him down. I said Dickson, if you go through that route of raising sentiments, this thing will not fly. Let\u2019s look at it objectively, speak about Nigeria and how to save our country. If you agree, take the backseat. I am the principal officer from the North-west zone of President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua. We\u2019re very aware of the situation of the country. So let me drive it and let me see who that person is that will have more affinity and affiliation to President Yar\u2019Adua than myself- the principal officer from the zone.\n\n\u201cDickson now accepted to take the back seat. We had several meetings. We had with Nafada, Ihedioha, Austin Okpara, who was outside the House of Reps but still our leader at that time. I drafted the motion that made Jonathan acting president in the House of Reps. Speaker Dimeji was a bit lackadaisical, he was not too sure. I walked up to him, as he was presiding. I said, Mr. Speaker, \u2018I know that I and you have been supportive of President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua. It\u2019s not about an individual now; it\u2019s not about the President it is about this country. I must appeal to you to support this initiative.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe was a bit emotional. I said look Mr Speaker, it\u2019s about this country and we must do the right thing. I brought out the motion. I said this is the motion. I drafted it. So please, allow this to go. And that was how the motion for the Doctrine of Necessity was passed in the House.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered the speedy concession of four new airport terminals constructed by a Chinese company at the international airports in Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt.\n\nSpeaking at the commissioning of the new terminal at the international wing of the Murtala Muhammad Airport in Lagos, the president also ordered the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed to source for funds for the country to immediately commence the construction of a second runway at the Abuja airport.\n\nThe facilities were constructed by the China Civil Engineering and Construction Company (CCECC) with a $500 million loan secured from the China Exim Bank, while the Nigerian government provided a counterpart funding of $100 million.\n\nWhile affirming that the concession of the four terminals would propel development of the aviation sector and grow the Nigerian economy, the president directed the finance ministry to work with the aviation ministry in ensuring the delivery of the two projects.\n\n\u201cBearing in mind the importance of airport infrastructure as a catalyst for economic growth, Foreign Direct Investment and development globally, this administration decided to prioritize the completion and delivery of five brand new international terminals, which were at 11% completion level when we came into power in 2015.\n\n\u201cThis aligns perfectly with our Aviation Roadmap, which was developed in 2016, for the purposes of establishing critical infrastructure, including a National Carrier, Maintenance, Repairs and Overhaul Centre and improved Airports Terminals through concession, to boost aviation practice and take the industry to the next level, reflecting global standards,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nHe further said: \u201cGovernment is responding by further investments and partnerships in the sector to tend to this challenge. Consequently, the Minister of Aviation has been directed to fast track the airport concession programme. Similarly, the Abuja second runway is being fast tracked.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of FB&NP has been directed to source special funding for the project while the MFCT is directed to conclude the titling of the approved 12,000 hectares of land to accommodate the runway and other developmental projects.\u201d\n\nSirika\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Minister of Aviation Senator Hadi Sirika said the commissioning was a testament to the fact that President Buhari meant business for the aviation industry.\n\nSirika affirmed that the aviation industry remained the only way by which the 2063 agenda of the African Union (AU) could be realised.\n\nThe minister declared that one of the aims of the ministry was to grow aviation contributions to the GDP to 5 per cent at $4.7 billion from its present 0.06 per cent in the next few years.\n\nHe explained that there would be air-rail connectivity between the domestic and international airports to shorten the traffic time between both terminals.\n\nBesides, Sirika mentioned foreign exchange and Jet A1 as some of the challenges confronting the aviation industry, lamenting that these had led to numerous setbacks for the sector.\n\nHe appealed to President Buhari to direct the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to import Jet fuel in good quantity for operators in the industry.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to mention that we stand to gain significant benefits in restoring and maintaining connectivity within, to and from the country. Analysis from IATA shows that aviation sector provides N341bn GDP contribution, 160,000 local jobs created and N535bn expenditure from visitors will be solely generated from restoring and maintaining this connectivity.\n\n\u201cConsequently, Sir, these are the numbers at risk if that connectivity is threatened by the continuous travel restrictions due to current pandemic. Mr. President, aviation business suffers from issue of access to foreign exchange by local and foreign airlines and the ability to repatriate blocked funds.\n\n\u201cNigeria currently holds $283m of foreign airlines funds blocked in the country. I would like to humbly request the support of the Central Bank, through the directive of Mr. President, to prioritise access to forex for all carriers both local and foreign and to work out a mechanism to clear the existing backlog urgently and prevent subsequent build up,\u201d the minister said.\n\nSanwo-Olu\n\nAlso in his remarks, Lagos state Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu lauded Buhari for giving infrastructure priority in its government.\n\nHe noted that the three projects commissioned Tuesday namely; Fertiliser, Lekki refinery and the new terminal would change the country\u2019s status.\n\nThe governor said all of these would not only create jobs for the teeming populace, but also open up the country to foreign investments and opportunities.\n\nThe new Lagos terminal has the capacity to process 14 million passengers per annum and built on a land mass of approximately 56,000 square metres with 66 check-in counters.\n\nOther facilities in the terminal include five baggage collection carousels, 16 Immigration desks at arrival, 28 Immigration desks at departure, eight security screening points, six passenger boarding bridges (out of which two have already been installed), two food courts, four premium lounges and 22 guest rooms and spa.\n\nOther facilities are 16 airline ticketing offices, visa on arrival and port health facility, as well as praying area, more than 3,000 square metres of duty free space and approximately 5,000 square metres of lettable utility space.\n\nCCECC commenced construction of four new terminals at Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt airports in 2013 with completion period fixed for 20 months.\n\nIts president, Yuan Li, had told the government during the visit of Nigeria\u2019s high-powered delegation to China that the quality of the work to be done at the airports would be of the highest international standard comparable to similar projects executed by the company in other parts of the world.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has commissioned the Dangote Fertiliser Plant in the Ibeju-Lekki area of Lagos.\n\nHe inaugurated the multi-billion dollar facility on Tuesday at an event well attended by many political, traditional, and religious leaders, as well as key members of the private sector from various parts of the country.\n\nThey include the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Kayode Fayemi; as well as members of the forum including Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Darius Ishaku (Taraba), and Badaru Abubakar (Jigawa).\n\nRead Also: President Buhari Commissions New Airport Terminal In Lagos\n\nPresident of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote; Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations, Mrs Amina Mohammed; the Vice-Chairman of Channels Media Group, Mrs Olusola Momoh; Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele; as well as former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, were among the dignitaries present at the event.\n\nPresident Buhari inaugurated the facility as part of activities lined up for his working visit to Lagos. He was also billed to inaugurate the newly built terminal at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, as well as inspect the ongoing construction at the Dangote Refinery and the Lekki Deep Sea Port.\n\nThe Dangote Fertiliser Plant is Africa\u2019s largest granulated urea fertiliser complex. It occupies 500 hectares of land in the Lekki Free Trade Zone and was built at about $2.5 billion.\n\nIt is expected to help Nigeria retain $125 million in import substitution and provide $625 million from exports of products from the fertiliser plant.\n\nWhile Nigeria is estimated to need about five to seven million metric tonnes of fertiliser per annum amid its current level of fertiliser consumption which is 1.5 million metric tonnes, the Dangote fertiliser complex was established to produce three million metric tonnes of urea fertiliser per annum in its first phase.\n\nIn the course of its construction, the complex is said to have provided about 5,000 direct and indirect jobs in all categories, an additional 5,000 jobs within the community, as well as created 500 permanent jobs.\n\nSecured Future\n\nIn his speech before commissioning the facility, President Buhari was delighted that the plant would further advance his administration\u2019s drive towards achieving self-sufficiency in food production in the country.\n\n\u201cI commend the Chairman, Board, and Management of Dangote Industries Limited for their business initiative in building this plant to reduce our dependence on importation of fertiliser, create jobs on a massive scale, increase the inflow of foreign exchange and accelerate economic growth,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis new plant is a testament to the widely acknowledged patriotism of Aliko Dangote and the leadership of Dangote Industries Limited. It also demonstrates their commitment to the socio-economic development of our country and the wellbeing of our people.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\u201cI am confident that the investment in this plant will replicate the group\u2019s earlier exploit in the cement sector where Dangote Cement holds the enviable record as our continent\u2019s largest cement producer with footprints in 10 other African countries. The group\u2019s investment in integrated cement plants, spanning the value chain from quarry to bagging has effectively ended Nigeria\u2019s dependence on imported cement products.\u201d\n\nAccording to the President, Dangote Industries Limited, along with several other subsidiaries, has created thousands of jobs across the country.\n\nHe described the company as the second biggest employer of labour in Nigeria after the Federal Government, stressing the importance of job creation by private sector operators to national security.\n\nRise Of Agropreneurs\n\nNigeria, President Buhari stated, also stands to gain extensively in earnings of foreign exchange from the excess production and export from the plant.\n\n\u201cI am informed that you have already started exporting to other countries, including the United States, India, and Brazil,\u201d he said. \u201cThe coming on stream of the plant is creating huge opportunities in the areas of job creation, trade, warehousing, transport, and logistics.\n\n\u201cThis will create significant wealth, reduce poverty, and help in securing the future of our nation. In the agriculture sector, another focal point of our economic policy, we expect a boom as fertiliser is now readily available in greater quantities and better quality.\n\n\u201cMany Nigerians who hitherto practised subsistence farming because of the inability of necessary inputs can now take up agriculture as a business. We expect the rise of a new breed of agro-preneurs who will add value to farming and make the nation self-sufficient in food production.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari assured Nigerians that his government would remain focused on providing an enabling environment for the private sector to thrive.\n\nHe also promised that they would continue to improve on infrastructure, power, and security, as well as enact relevant laws and regulations that would drive investment in the economy.\n\nTackling Youth Restiveness\n\nIn his speech, the President of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote, believes the plant will make Nigeria self-sufficient in fertiliser production, with excess capacity to export to other African markets and the rest of the world.\n\nHe described its commissioning as very historic, saying it is the largest granulated urea plant in Africa and the second-largest in the world.\n\nAfrica\u2019s richest businessman hinted that the plant would help Nigeria retain about $125 million in import substitution and provide $625 million from exports of its products.\n\n\u201cIt is an ambitious developmental project which will drastically reduce the level of unemployment and youth restiveness in this country, through the direct and indirect employment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make fertiliser available in sufficient quantities and quality for our teeming farmers in achieving greater agricultural outputs and to help realise this potential, we are rolling out initiatives that will transform the agriculture sector including services for all small and medium-scale farmers.\u201d\n\nDangote informed the audience at the event that the plant has established well-equipped soil testing laboratories to ensure appropriate fertiliser blends were applied to specific soil and crop types.",

          "title": "Nigerian Lawmakers Lambast Power Minister Over Grid Collapse",
          "text": "Members of Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives Committee on Power on Tuesday criticised the Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu mandating him to take concrete actions aimed at solving the current nationwide blackout rather than always presenting theories that do not translate into power supply to Nigerians.\n\nThe Committee, led by Hon. Magaji Da\u2019u Aliyu at a meeting with the minister, expressed disappointment over the lackadaisical attitude of the ministry towards power issues whenever there was national emergency, saying there was nothing in his presentation to show that the ministry was solving the challenge of increased power outages being experienced by the country.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe minister, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Nebolisa Anoka, had enumerated the challenges facing the sector, ranging from low gas supply, low hydro levels, high cost of gas, as well as disequilibrium between power generation, transmission and distribution. This, he said had led to the collapse of the national grid and as well what the ministry was doing to salvage the situation.\n\nHe explained that in response to the challenges facing power generation, the ministry recently hosted an emergency meeting with key stakeholders in the gas-to-power value chain, during which far-reaching resolutions were arrived at on key measures needed to ameliorate the situation.\n\nReacting to the presentation, Aliyu, who earlier explained that the special interactive session was necessitated by the fact that Nigerians were facing the worst energy crisis in recent times, lamented that the situation had affected businesses, both small and large, which according to him had been attracting huge public outcry.\n\nHe called for the return of the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading Company (NBET), under the supervision of the Power Ministry, saying that there was not much both the Ministry and the Committee could do if the agency remained elsewhere.\n\nAccording to him, these were part of the sectoral problems affecting the country in terms of power, as the agency which was tasked with the responsibility of evacuating unused electricity and bridging the gap debit gap between Gencos and Discos is not properly supervised.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere is nothing on ground to show that there will be light or generation of up to 5000 megawatts, but we keep hearing about 30,000 megawatts of installed capacity across the power stations.\n\n\u201cIt may be recalled that Nigerians whom we represent experience one of the worst moment of electricity supply across the country. This development has caused variety of problems affecting peoples\u2019 welfare which makes social living condition very uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cIt has caused collapse of small businesses whose operations depend on stable electricity supply. The situation has also aggravated increased process in commodities and services especially those that require electricity supply.\n\n\u201cThe overheated socio-economic environment due to very poor electricity supply attracted huge public outcry for immediate solutions, especially given the contractual nature of provision of power and energy services in the post privatization era by the Nigerian Power Supply Industry.\n\n\u201cAgainst this background and acting as peoples\u2019 representatives, this interactive session is organised to request the Minister to among others: Explain the remote and immediate causes of the current deplorable power supply across the country; explain the technical, operational and administrative measures taken by the ministry to address the challenges and its devastating consequences against life, welfare and economy; and suggest in your highlight the areas which the House of Representatives or indeed the National Assembly can provide legislative support to overcome the challenges apparently disturbing all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nCorroborating Aliyu statement, members of the Committee, took turns to lament the unending projections by the Ministry that have never come to fruition.\n\nIn his contribution, Hon. Sada Soli (APC, Katsina), noted that the concern raised by Gencos as the major reason for the blackout, was the N1.4 trillion debt NBET was owing them as cost of generated but unused electricity.\n\nHe also noted three major concerns ranging from the quantity, quality and cost of gas delivered to them for their operations. Also, Hon. Aisha Dukku wondered if the ministry won\u2019t be able to resolve the problem till end of next year\n\nShe said: \u201cMr. Chairman, what the Permanent Secretary is telling us is end of next year. So, that means we will continue to be in darkness until end of 2023? Haba! No, no!\u201d\n\nOn his part, Hon. Muraino Ajibola, said, \u201cThese problems are not starting now. For instance, we know, every year, there will be shortage of water. We also know that most of time during the period of January to March, there is always this shutdown.\n\n\u201cWe have abundance of gas but we are not making use of it. What we do is fire brigade approach. Mr. Chairman, the summary of it is that we are not prepared to give our power and I think it\u2019s very sad. They also bring light when they want to send estimated bills to us.\u201d\n\nThereafter, the Chairman of the Committee ruled that the Permanent Secretary should return on Friday with more practical evidences of intended interventions.",

          "text": "The World Bank has identified sluggish growth, low human capital, labor market weaknesses and exposure to shocks as factors holding Nigeria\u2019s poverty reduction back.\n\nThe Washington-based institution stated this in its latest report titled: \u201cA Better Future for All Nigerians: Nigeria Poverty Assessment 2022,\u201d obtained Tuesday.\n\nThe report represented the culmination of the World Bank\u2019s engagement on poverty- and inequality-relevant data and analytics in Nigeria in the past two years.\n\nIt drew primarily on the 2018/19 Nigerian Living Standards Survey (NLSS), which provided Nigeria\u2019s first official poverty numbers in almost a decade, as well as the Nigeria COVID-19 National Longitudinal Phone Survey (NLPS).\n\nThe surveys were implemented by Nigeria\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in collaboration with the World Bank.\n\nAccording to the report, which brought together the latest evidence on the profile and drivers of poverty in Nigeria, as many as four in 10 Nigerians live below the national poverty line.\n\nIt noted that many Nigerians \u2013 especially in the country\u2019s north \u2013 also lacked education and access to basic infrastructure, such as electricity, safe drinking water, and improved sanitation.\n\nThe report further noted that jobs do not translate Nigerians\u2019 hard work into an exit from poverty, \u201cas most workers are engaged in small-scale household farm and non-farm enterprises; just 17 per cent of Nigerian workers hold the wage jobs best able to lift people out of poverty.\u201d\n\nThe report added that climate and conflict shocks \u2013 which disproportionately affect Nigeria\u2019s poor \u2013 were multiplying, and their effects had been compounded by COVID-19; \u201cyet government support for households was scant.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cHouseholds have adopted dangerous coping strategies, including reducing education and scaling back food consumption, which could have negative long-run consequences for their human capital.\n\n\u201cThese issues affect some parts of Nigeria more than others; the report captures this spatial inequality by providing statistics at the state level, which is crucial given Nigeria\u2019s federal structure.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that much needs to be done to help lift millions of Nigerians out of poverty, including boosting health and education, bolstering productive jobs, and expanding social protection,\u201d World Bank Country Director for Nigeria, Shubham Chaudhuri said.\n\nHe added: \u201cYet implementing pro-poor initiatives requires unlocking fiscal space; reforming expensive subsidies \u2013 including fuel subsidies \u2013 will be essential, alongside countervailing measures to protect the poor as reforms are effected.\u201d\n\nThe report suggested at least three types of deep, long-term reforms to foster and sustain pro-poor growth and raise Nigerians out of poverty. These included: Macroeconomic reforms (including fiscal, trade, and exchange rate policy); policies to boost the productivity of farm and non-farm household enterprises; and improving access to electricity, water, and sanitation while bolstering information and communication technologies.\n\n\u201cThese reforms together could help diversify the economy, invigorate structural transformation, create good, productive jobs, and support social protection programs as well as other redistributive government policies.\n\n\u201cThe report emphasises that these reforms are urgent as Nigeria\u2019s population continues to grow; now is the time to ensure that the country seizes the promise of its young people for economic prosperity.\n\n\u201cIt adds that shaping the specifics of Nigeria\u2019s poverty-reducing policies will depend strongly on redoubling efforts to gather and analyse data regularly.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, World Bank Lead Economist and co-author of the report, Tara Vishwanath said: \u201cConflict is spreading and intensifying across Nigeria, so it is important to implement programs to support poor and vulnerable Nigerians that are simple and flexible while also limiting the risk of exacerbating fragility and conflict.\u201d\n\n\u201cData can provide vital guidance on how to design, monitor, and evaluate pro-poor projects and programs, giving a voice to poor and vulnerable Nigerians,\u201d World Bank Economist and co-author of the report, Jonathan Lain added.\n\nThe report disclosed that new official household survey data, due to be collected later in 2022, would provide far more detailed insights into the dynamics of and the key constraints on poverty reduction, as well as new pro-poor policies.\n\nBy investing in data, Nigeria could build trust, accountability, and transparency, taking substantial strides on its pathway to poverty reduction.",

          "text": "The new governor of Anambra State, Professor Chukwuma Soludo, on Tuesday said although the problems confronting the state remained daunting, with the backing of the people, the new government was poised to record huge successes.\n\nThe governor, who spoke on ARISE Television, stated that he had in possession a blueprint and that with the various documents at his disposal, he fully understands where the state is headed in the coming years.\n\nHowever, asked about the state of the state\u2019s finances and where the funding for his numerous projects will come from, the former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), noted that although the resources were paltry and \u201calmost zero\u201d, he knew about the problems before applying for the job.\n\nSoludo explained that from the records at his disposal, Anambra had a debt of about N109 billion and between N300 million to N400 million in cash.\n\nHe stated, \u201cBut we are undaunted, as I said in my inaugural speech. We\u2019ll get water out of the stone, with the people working with us, mobilising with us, we will be able to get water out of stone. Anambra has all the potential, but also equally matched with the challenges.\u201d\n\nWithin the context of what he described as Nigeria\u2019s \u201cunitary federalism\u201d, the governor promised to govern creatively and collaborate with the federal government as well as development partners to maximise the limited resources available..\n\n\u201cAnd given the available resources that we have, we\u2019re going to explore all kinds of creative means of revenues beyond the usual, so to speak, to be able to collect revenues to do these things,\u201d he stressed.\n\nSoludo pledged that with on-going the discussions with all stakeholders, including the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), the weekly forced stay-at-home will be a thing of the past soon.\n\nWhile acknowledging that there will be resistance to the change the state was about to experience, the governor promised to meet those who will try to stop the job of \u201cliberating\u201d the Anambra people \u201cin the streets.\u201d\n\nSoludo said, \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to meet them in the streets and liberate the common man in the streets. This government is about the common man. Law and order are going to be the very first essence; it is at the foundation of everything, of every society. We must restore law and order,\u201d he stressed.\n\nPressured to disclose what he met in terms of the state\u2019s finances, Soludo said there was already an audited account, which he said was a public document at the end of December 1, 2021, but added that a lot of reconciliations will still need to be done.\n\nThe former CBN governor said, \u201cBut everybody knows that the state finances are not quite robust, to put it mildly. Debt is probably in the range of a hundred and something billion. Then cash a few hundred million. That\u2019s what I saw. That\u2019s the base.\n\n\u201cBut we are still going to have reconciliations and have all the accounts from January to the date that we took over. And I think it\u2019s best practise actually, when you ask this question. We intend to have a very transparent public finance management system where we will publish everything.\n\n\u201cEverybody will know what is there and what is not there, what penny comes in what and what it is used for, and that is the aspiration. That\u2019s part of what we promised in our manifesto. Very transparent public finance management.\n\n\u201cIf I remember correctly, the cash in various banks is about N300 million or N400 and then the audited accountants as at December would be debt of about N109 billion. That\u2019s what I saw.\n\n\u201cBut we will take it from there. For me, that\u2019s the baseline. When we do the other contingent liabilities, contractor debts and the other issues. It\u2019s not what happened, but it\u2019s where we draw the line and then move on, but that\u2019s the baseline.\u201d\n\nHe described his predecessor, Mr Willy Obiano, as a good man and honourable man, adding that he wasn\u2019t envisaging any friction with him and his (Soludo\u2019s) deputy in the future.\n\nPlaying down on the altercation between Bianca, the wife of the late Igbo leader, Odimegwu Ojukwu, during his inauguration, Soludo noted that it was some form of comic relief, explaining that to him, it never detracted from the event.\n\nSoludo said, \u201cWhen you were talking about the cat fight, I was just laughing and because of all the funny videos that have emerged from this, for me it\u2019s just a comic relief.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the comedy that has emerged from it all that I have enjoyed. There is no distraction whatsoever. I think it was meant to be. Sometime to come, there will even be some movies or comedies and even a song out of that.\n\n\u201cAs you saw, I didn\u2019t even notice much of what happened. I think it happened while I was going to sign the oath of allegiance. It was just like a one-second thing. I turned again and continued signing my thing and I have not had one minute discussing it, other than the comic relief you see posted. We are intensely focused on what we must deliver to our people.\u201d\n\nHe promised to hit the ground running, Soludo said that he has roughly four years to make good his plans, noting that there\u2019s no time to waste on frivolities.\n\n\u201cWe have four years to do this. And actually, it\u2019s three years and eight months, that\u2019s why we are not going to miss any one minute.\n\n\u201cBut for me, I\u2019m just waiting on the list of commissioners which will get to the Assembly and hopefully in the next two days will read the list and then we\u2019ll get to work. And once they give me an approval for the commissioners, we hit the road, but even in-between that, things will happen.\u201d\n\nHe promised to give priority to made in Anambra goods and Nigerian made products,\u201d because it is the way the world works.\u201d\n\nOn security, Soludo said, \u201cThe discussions are on-going. As I announced on my inaugural speech, my first meeting was on security. So I am fully briefed, the conversations are going on and I believe strongly that we\u2019ll get it cracked, probably not going to be done in one day, but we\u2019re going to crack it.\n\n\u201cThe sit-at-home thing will definitely end and we are having conversations with all the stakeholders, IPOB and everybody else, trying to engage everybody. It is the people\u2019s power that will prevail at the end of the day.\n\n\u201cAnd I know that that will definitely stop and we\u2019re working on that. Like I said, we are determined to restore law and order,\u201d he stated.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Chinedu Eze, Nume Ekeghe, Ugo Aliogo and Gilbert Ekugbe in Lagos, Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "title": "Buhari Says Nigeria\u2019s Huge Dependence on Imported Agricultural Products to End Soon",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari inaugurated the $2.5 billion Dangote fertiliser plant on Monday in Lagos, with an assurance that the country was poised to end its massive dependence on imported agricultural products soon.\n\nThe fertiliser plant, with installed capacity of three million metric tonnes of urea per annum, is located in Ibeju-Lekki, within the Lekki Free Trade Zone.\n\nBuhari, who was on a one-day visit to Lagos State, also inspected the Lekki Deep Seaport in the same axis. He directed the timely completion of the seaport.\n\nThe president, then, proceeded to Ikeja to inaugurate the newly built international terminal at the Murtala Muhammed Airport.\n\nEarlier, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, in his goodwill message, stressed that the fertiliser plant was well-timed considering recent developments on the global scene, where the prices of wheat, fertiliser, and crude oil had spiked by over 20 per cent, following the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nAt the Dangote fertiliser plant, the president declared that the plant would further advance his administration\u2019s drive towards self-sufficiency in food production in the country.\n\nAccording to the president, the country also stands to gain extensively in foreign exchange earnings from the fertiliser factory.\n\n\u201cI am informed that we have already started exporting to USA, Brazil, and India,\u201d an elated Buhari said.\n\nHe noted that the operation of the plant had created huge opportunities in the areas of employment, trade, warehousing, transport and logistics. \u201cThis would drastically create wealth, reduce poverty, and secure the future of our nation,\u201d the president stated.\n\nBuhari commended the management of the company for their courage in conceptualising and building the new plant to support his government\u2019s poverty alleviation drive, increase the inflow of foreign exchange, and reduce the country\u2019s dependence on importation of fertiliser.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn particular, I would like to commend the Central Bank of Nigeria, the Development Finance Institutions, and the local and foreign commercial banks that have supported the investor to make these projects a reality.\n\n\u201cDangote Cement holds the enviable record as our continent\u2019s largest cement producer, with footprints in 15 countries. Its integrated cement plants (quarry to bagging) have effectively ended Nigeria\u2019s dependence on imported cement products. \u201cAlong with the several other subsidiaries, Dangote Industries has created thousands of jobs across Nigeria. It is the second biggest employer of labour in this country, after the federal government.\n\n\u201cJob creation by private sector operators is vital to security, as it takes thousands of youths off the street. Dangote Group has been at the forefront of driving the nation\u2019s industrialisation efforts with huge investments in diverse sectors, such as sugarcane plantation and refining, rice, salt, and other allied products, vehicle assembly and logistics.\u201d\n\nThe president noted that in the agricultural sector, another focal point of his administration\u2019s economic policy was to ensure a boom in fertiliser production, saying fertiliser is now readily available.\n\nHe revealed that many Nigerians who hitherto practised subsistence farming because of non-availability of necessary inputs now have the opportunity to take up agriculture as a business.\n\nBuhari said his administration expected the rise of a new breed of agropreneurs, who would add value to farming and make the country self-sufficient in food production. He said the government was focused on providing an enabling environment for private sector investors to thrive.\n\nThe president pointed out that his administration would continue to deliver on infrastructure, power, and security, and enact relevant laws and regulations that would drive investment in the economy.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis new plant is a testament to the widely acknowledged patriotism of Alhaji Aliko Dangote and the leadership of Dangote Industries Limited. It also demonstrates their commitment to the socio-economic development of our country and the well-being of our people.\n\n\u201cWe are partnering with the private sector, via a tax credit scheme, in the rehabilitation of roads across Nigeria under the Presidential Order No. 7. As we all know, good roads contribute to easy movement of goods and services across the nation, thus, reducing cost of doing business and improving productivity.\n\n\u201cWe are also rehabilitating our railway lines and building new ones to lessen the burden on our roads and create more effective multi-model transportation networks.\n\n\u201cIt will be my pleasure to inspect the impressive 650,000 barrels per day refinery and 900,000 tons per annum petrochemical complex, which I look forward to coming back to inaugurate by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cOn a personal note, I commend Alhaji Aliko Dangote for helping to rebrand Nigeria through his mega investments across Africa. He has fuelled job-led growth and transformation of several African economies. I am proud of his contribution to affirming Nigeria\u2019s leadership status in the continent.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Emefiele stated that out that with lessons learnt from the protectionist actions of countries during the early days of COVID-19, the investment was also a glaring testament to the foresight and passion of the president for encouraging domestic production of goods that could be produced in Nigeria, especially agriculture.\n\nHe said this would not only stimulate greater productivity in the agricultural sector but also help in insulating Nigerian farmers from dependence on imported fertiliser.\n\nEmefiele added, \u201cI am delighted, extremely elated indeed, that a Nigerian in the person of Alhaji Aliko Dangote has taken not just this great initiative of helping to solve a perennial petrochemical imports problem, but has taken advantage of the emerging huge market opportunity presented by recent developments.\u201d\n\nEmefiele further described the event as a \u201cstellar\u201d realisation of Buhari\u2019s vision, saying it is timely in the light of the war in Europe.\n\nThe CBN governor applauded Buhari for his determination to support growth in the real sector, which according to him prompted the apex bank and private sector investors to invest in projects targeted at inclusive growth.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am delighted that a Nigerian has taken not just this great initiative of helping to solve our perennial problem of importing petrochemical products, including fertiliser, but has taken advantage of the emerging huge market opportunity presented by recent global developments.\n\n\u201cThis Dangote fertiliser plant with an installed capacity of over three million metric tons per annum is a very significant feat in the diversification agenda of Mr. President. This is because it will help to increase the value chain in the petrol-chemical and allied sector, create jobs for our youths and boost our agricultural productivity.\u201d\n\nEmefiele added, \u201cMr. President, in the early days of my stewardship under you, you made your vision for our country clear to me. This vision was wrapped around the broad theme of self-introspection for local resources and self-sufficiency in local consumption.\n\n\u201cIn summary, you told me that you would like to see urgent support for our farmers, small businesses, and large manufacturers. You wanted to see a Nigeria that produced what it consumed and reduce forex expenditure on agricultural imports.\n\n\u201cGiven our unflinching believe in you, we immediately set out to work at the CBN. We thoroughly studied, deeply assimilated, and enthusiastically implemented this vision from day one of your administration. It is based on the many nights and days of painstaking work in pursuit of this vision that today\u2019s ceremony is emotional for us at the CBN.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the completion of this plant is a stellar example of the realisation of your vision. It is only fitting, therefore, that this plant is being commissioned by Mr. President himself, the original owner and protector of this vision.\n\n\u201cFor your unparalleled leadership and timely vision, and on behalf of my grateful colleagues at the CBN, I say a heartfelt thank you. To avoid losing momentum and backtracking on these gains, we will work hard, every day to protect your legacy and ensure that posterity remembers you for all you have done for our country.\u201d\n\nEmefiele disclosed that prior to Buhari\u2019s assumption of office in 2015, Nigeria imported virtually all its fertiliser products to support the agricultural sector. To address the problem, Emefiele said the president inaugurated the Presidential Fertiliser Initiative, chaired by Jigawa State Governor, Alhaji Muhammad Abubakar and \u201ccharged us with resolving this perennial fertiliser shortage problem in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am delighted to note that their work and the continued support of Mr. President has resulted in a significant increase in our nation\u2019s blending capacity, from seven plants in 2015 to over 48 active fertiliser blending plants today.\n\n\u201cIndeed, during the past five years, over 35 million bags of blended fertiliser has been produced in Nigeria. Consequently, our import bill on fertiliser has not only declined significantly but we are also witnessing rising investment in the fertiliser industry, such as the one being commissioned today by the Dangote Group.\n\n\u201cToday, Nigeria is self-sufficient in the production of urea, and we are also the leading producer of urea in the African continent. There is no doubt that improving access to fertiliser will contribute to significant improvements in the productivity of our local farmers.\n\n\u201cBut probably more importantly, it will enhance our nation\u2019s drive to improve food security and ensure we consume what we produce in Nigeria, thereby fulfilling another key promise and vision of this administration.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWith sustained efforts, other indigenous companies like Indorama and Notore with a combined capacity of over 2.5 million tons per annum have tried to match the market demand, yet the country still faced a huge shortfall of fertiliser supply.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said the Lekki Free Trade Zone was conceived by former governor of the state, Senator Bola Tinubu, in 2003, to attract investments to the state.\n\nOn his part, Minister of Trade, Industry and Investment, Niyi Adebayo, said although the fertiliser complex was just one part of the Dangote Refinery project, \u201cthis part alone offers unquantifiable value\u201d to the economy.\u201d\n\nAdebayo added, \u201cI am aware that this facility has the potential to produce three million metric jobs per annum of urea fertiliser in phase one alone. This will go a long way in bridging the current fertiliser gap and improving soil and farm yields.\n\n\u201cOne of the federal government\u2019s key ambitions is for Nigeria to be both self-sufficient in food production, and also to be a net exporter of food and value added products. The Dangote Fertiliser Plant goes a long way in realising this vision not just for Nigeria, but for the entire continent.\n\n\u201cDangote fertiliser has the potential to meet not just Nigeria\u2019s needs, but at its current capacity, it will earn the country millions of dollars from exports. It will also help with the unemployment problem our current country is currently faced with.\u201d\n\nThe president of Dangote Group expressed delight over the success of the fertiliser plant. Dangote said the plant was the largest in Africa and the second-largest urea plant in the world.\n\nHe said products from plants have reached the African market, and across Brazil, India, and Mexico.\n\nAccording to Dangote, \u201cIt is an ambitious project that will reduce unemployment in Nigeria. Low fertiliser usages have been the reason for low yield of agriculture products in the sector.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make fertiliser available in quantity for our farmers. We are rolling out initiatives that will transform the agric sector for all. This will boost productivity and enhance output across the nation.\n\n\u201cWe believe that many new farmers will emerge in the nation, providing millions of jobs and ushering us into the era of agricultural entrepreneurs, (agroprenuers). These breed of agroprenuers will take to farming on large scales, providing food and raw materials for our industries.\n\n\u201cWe are rolling out innovations that will transform the agricultural sector in the form of extension services for small and medium scale farmers. We have acquired a well-equipped fertiliser soil-testing laboratory to enable us to analyse and identify a particular soil deficiency and the appropriate fertiliser blend. Applying the right fertiliser to the soil will boost productivity. This service is to cover all the geopolitical zones and has the capacity to transform farming into a lucrative profession.\n\n\u201cDangote Fertiliser works with farmer associations, corporate farms, NPK blenders, NGO/development partners and state governments all over Nigeria, and governments across Africa and beyond who are looking for sustainable approach to improve soil quality and farm yields.\u201d\n\nHe appreciated the CBN and other agencies of government for their support.\n\nBuhari Tours Lekki Deep Seaport\n\nBuhari also praised the efforts of the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, towards making the Lekki Deep Seaport in Lagos a reality.\n\nHe directed him to consult and bring up a memorandum to the Federal Executive Council (FEC) to link the facility with the railway network and also to ensure its timely completion.\n\nAs part of his engagements in Lagos, the president inspected the pace of work at the first Deep Seaport in Nigeria located in Lagos Free Zone, 65Km east of Lagos.\n\nIn the course of the inspection, Buhari received firm assurances that the port, which has a concession period of 45 years and sits in a land area of 90 hectares, would be completed on schedule by September.\n\nAmaechi while speaking during the tour, revealed that the Ibom Deep Seaport had gotten the federal government\u2019s approval to begin operations in the country. Besides, the minister stated that the federal government was also fast pursuing the Badagry seaport in its bid to decongest the Apapa and Tin Can ports.\n\nHe stated, \u201cBy the time we leave office, all those people who would have been granted approval are all private seaports. The only one that the government will participate in its ownership is the Bonny Seaport because the minster is from Rivers State.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said the president\u2019s inspection would publicise the seaport and put pressure on the owners to complete the port project in earnest\n\nThe minister said, \u201cThe port is almost ready, if not for the equipment, they can actually get this place ready before June, but they said the equipment are arriving by June and installation will take them till September and then it can be commissioned in September.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe miracle of bringing the president here, that is why it is important for a president to inspect projects, this will hasten the process of completion if there is money.\u201d\n\nReacting to a question over possible traffic congestion if the seaport begins operation, the minister stated that the country was broke and unable to build a rail network.\n\nDangote \u201cWe don\u2019t have money, if you give us money we will build railway here. As the Minister of Transport I do not do roads. These are private investment so they can get private investors. \u201cThis seaport is not our business; it is private investment. You should be asking for money for Bonny seaport and others where Government may be interested in putting their money,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThis is a private port, not a government port, so no agency will run here. The agencies will be present but they will not run here because it is a private port and here is heavily automated so we won\u2019t have too many staff working here.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t see it the way you see Apapa Port and all goods won\u2019t come to Lagos, goods will go to Warri, Port Harcourt and what the government needs to do is to either rehabilitate those ports or build new ones. I am convinced that we should commence work in Bonny deep seaport before we leave office,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Managing Director, Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Mohammed Bello-Koko, said the Lekki Deep Seaport would be ready for test run in September this year after which the first commercial visit would be received at the port.\n\nBello-Koko, who noted that the commencement of Lekki Port would reduce the rate of traffic at Apapa and Tin-Can Island Ports, said there would be Ship-to-Shore (STS) cranes that will enable faster processing of goods.\n\n\u201cSome of the businesses we have lost to other neighbouring West African countries due to draught limitation would be regained. There will be employment creation and increase revenue for government.\n\n\u201cIt will create competition and compel other terminal operators to up their games to reduce cargo dwell time at their terminals. Apapa and Tin-Can Island Ports have been operating far beyond their capacity which means that the excess cargoes that have been going there would be diverted to Lekki Port.\u201d\n\nExecutive Secretary, Nigerian Shippers\u2019 Council (NSC), Emmanuel Jime had lamented the method of evacuating cargoes in the country, saying that Nigeria is yet to put in place the necessary infrastructure that would allow for quick evacuation from the Lekki Deep Seaport.\n\nBuhari Pledges More Support in Infrastructure Development\n\nBuhari also said his administration had prioritised infrastructure development to spur the creation of jobs and boost the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nHe directed the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and Planning to make funds available for the building of a second runway at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. Buhari stated these when he unveiled the new terminal at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos yesterday.\n\nThe president said despite the lean resources at the disposal of the administration, especially in its first tenure, he sustained the infrastructural projects he inherited and initiated new ones.\n\nHe pointed out that because of the importance of having modern airport facilities, his administration had completed the four new terminals at the four major airports in the country.\n\nWith the inauguration of the new international terminal in Lagos, the completed terminal at the Mallam Aminu would International Airport, Kano, the four airport facilities started in 2013 by the Chinese and Nigerian government, collaboration would have come on stream.\n\n\u201cOur continuous investment in the building of long lasting infrastructure in the aviation, road and rail transportation, agriculture, telecommunications and other critical sectors is yielding massive results, and the people of Nigeria are now increasingly attesting to benefiting from the associated dividends.\n\n\u201cStarting from the year 2015 when we commenced our first tenure in office as a government, we have been deliberate and consistent in identifying and investing in critical projects that would improve the standard of living of our people, as well as contribute immensely to our growth and development as a nation,\u201d the president said.\n\nHe noted that despite obvious limitations in terms of availability of resources, \u201cour investments in inter-state rail connectivity, road networks, agriculture, power and telecommunications, just to mention a few, have been unprecedented.\u201d\n\nBuhari said taking into cognisance the importance of airport infrastructure as a catalyst for economic growth, enhancement of foreign direct investment and development globally, his administration decided to prioritise the completion and delivery of five brand new international terminals, which were at 11 per cent completion level when we came into power in 2015.\n\n\u201cGovernment is responding by further investments and partnerships in the sector to tend to this challenge. Consequently, the Minister of Aviation has been directed to fast track the airport concession programme.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the Abuja second runway is being fast tracked. The Minister of FB&NP has been directed to source special funding for the project while the MFCT is directed to conclude the titling of the approved 12,000 hectares of land to accommodate the runway and other developmental projects.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, called on the CBN to release the $283 million blocked funds for foreign airlines and subsequently pay them as they earn their revenue so that there would no more be blocked funds in Nigeria.\n\nSirika also urged the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) to import aviation fuel (Jet A-1) in large qualities to overcome the current scarcity and urged CBN to make forex available to major marketers to import the product.\n\nSirika also called for the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions to enhance seamless air travel, which is a catalyst to the development of any country. he said\n\nBello-Koko, \u201cMr. President is aware of the recent chaos in the sector caused by lack of Jet-A. Flights are unduly delayed and/or cancelled unpleasantly. While apologizing to our teaming passengers, I wish to use this medium to humbly request Mr. President to direct NNPC to import Jet-Al in good quantities and devise means to sustain supply as well as directing CBN to allocate Forex for the major marketers to sustain supply.\u201d\n\nThe minister assured that the airport concession project (including the newly commissioned terminals) had reached advanced stage and promised that his ministry would be issuing Request for Proposal (RFP) to the shortlisted firms before the end of March.\n\n\u201cWe expect to announce a partner in 2nd Quarter 2022 and handover by 4th Quarter 2022,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the new terminal he said, \u201cThis terminal you are about to commission has the capacity to process 14 million passengers per annum. There are 66Nos. check-in counters, 5Nos. baggage collection carousels, 16Nos. Immigration Desks at Arrival, 28 Nos. Desks at Departure, 8Nos. Security Screening Points, 6Nos. passenger boarding bridges with remote boarding and arrival. Other facilities include 2Nos. food courts, 4Nos. premium lounges, 22Nos. guest rooms and Spars, 16Nos, airline ticketing offices, visa on arrival and port health facility, praying areas, more than 3,000sqm duty free spaces and over 5,000sqm let-table utility spaces.\u201d\n\nThe highlight of the event was the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and the Lagos State government for the construction of access roads linking the airport from Ikotun, Sasha and Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway.\n\nThe Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, signed on behalf of the state government, while FAAN Managing Director, Captain Hamisu Yadudu signed on behalf of the agency.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Chinedu Eze, Nume Ekeghe, Ugo Aliogo and Gilbert Ekugbe in Lagos",

          "text": "As Nigeria\u2019s economy continues to bleed from the negative impact of crude oil theft, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) on Tuesday disclosed that it had set up a team of experts to carry out a thorough audit of the activities of operators in the sector in the upstream petroleum industry in the last two years.\n\nThe commission stated that the move was to ascertain the actual volume of crude oil stolen by vandals and saboteurs, against recent allegations by some industry operators regarding the volume of crude theft on a daily basis.\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, had on Monday lamented the unprecedented rate of oil theft recorded in recent times and its debilitating effect on government revenue and accretion to reserves.\n\nThe governor\u2019s comment came a day after THISDAY reported similar concerns expressed by the Co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Seplat Energy Plc, Mr. Austin Avuru, who called for a state of emergency in the Nigerian oil and gas sector.\n\nHe had revealed that up to 80 per cent of oil pumped in the country, particularly in the east, were stolen.\n\nAvuru spoke a few days after a businessman and Chairman Heirs Holdings, Mr. Tony Elumelu, also bemoaned the worsening state of the industry, stressing that about 95 per cent of oil production does not get to the terminal.\n\nEarlier, Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company (AEEPCO), operators of the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL) pipeline, had threatened to exit the facility due to incessant vandalism, perennial sabotage and outright theft.\n\nNigeria has not been able to meet its quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), losing close to 400,000 barrels of oil per day to lack of capacity.\n\nOwing to these concerns in the past few days, a statement signed by the Chief Executive of the Commission, Mr. Gbenga Komolafe, disclosed the latest move to unravel the facts behind the theft, stating that the panel would carry out a forensic investigation to cover the technical and commercial operations of oil companies involved in drilling and selling of crude oil.\n\nKomolafe stated that commission was not unaware of the, \u201ctragedy of oil theft\u201d which he noted has been a plague on the industry and had last year triggered an industry-wide initiative aimed at curbing it.\n\nThis, he said, was to help increase crude production levels; a development which he said followed an express presidential directive.\n\n\u201cWorried by incessant acts of sabotage by criminals and some unscrupulous persons within the industry, President Muhammadu Buhari had directed that all necessary mechanisms should be activated to curb oil theft in particular and immediately end other forms of economic sabotage in the oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cAction on the directive commenced immediately and is on-going,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe commission, he affirmed, thus considers worrisome, the crude loss figures recently being quoted in the media by some operators, given actions taken so far on the issue.\n\nTo ascertain the veracity of the claims, the commission, Komolafe explained, has activated all the necessary mechanisms to get to the root of the matter and establish the actual volume of crude stolen as against the volumes claimed.\n\nWhile stepping up efforts to deal with the issue of oil theft in collaboration with the military and other relevant agencies, the commission, he added, has mandated the newly constituted panel to investigate the claims regarding the volume of theft from the various oils fields.\n\nFurthermore, part of the points of reference was for the committee to establish the actual operational capacities of the operators; to find out if the volumes being touted are actual; and if so, what additional measures need to be put in place to effectively address the issue.\n\n\u201cWhile a stakeholders\u2019 meeting has been called to discuss the matter with a view to jointly address the situation, the commission, at a meeting of its management meeting on Monday 21, activated its technical and commercial mandate to demand for the statement of financial accounts of the operators and reservoir accounts of productive oil wells for the last two years.\n\n\u201cThis will entail both sales audit and reservoir audit to establish correlations between their technical and commercial activities vis-a-vis the monitoring and evaluation records available to regulatory agencies,\u201d Komolafe stated.",
