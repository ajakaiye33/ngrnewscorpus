          "title": "Lola Olaopa @60: The celebration of womanhood",
          "text": "ByTunji Olaopa\n\nThe Book of Proverbs, chapter 31 and verse 10 began with a fundamental question: \u201cwho can find a virtuous woman?\u201d and after asking this fundamental sociological question, the scripture immediately takes the search out of the realm of materialism: \u201cfor her price is far above rubies.\u201d And in the rest of the twenty-one verses, the Bible then delivers a heuristic treatise to accommodate any and all cultural peculiarities of the type of woman that will fit this scriptural designation. I can say, with the clarity delivered by experience and hindsight, that I found that virtuous woman, and I found her in this lady and my wife of about thirty-four years, Olufunlola Modupe Olaopa (nee Ogunmoyela). So, in celebrating her and our marriage, I am equally adding a specific cultural and experiential configuration of a unique woman who essentially embodies the very values that defines the virtuosity of the woman in Proverbs, chapter 31. In this woman, who is not without her own peculiar weaknesses, as with all humans, I mean to celebrate Christian womanhood.\n\nAnd I seem to have a very drab way of giving vent to my loving feelings. For instance, a number of friends, including her, have tried to inculcate in me, their considered sense of the romantic means by which one ought to pay loving compliments to one\u2019s wife. Indeed, many consider my attempt at intellectual narratives of issues of the heart like this as \u201cunromantic.\u201d Unfortunately, I do not think I have the capacity to affect loving in the ways that my friends have attempted to tutor me at different times. I suspect my wife has accepted me as I am. I am therefore free to pursue my sense of the romantic or, if you will, the intellectual need for understanding.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt is however important that I state my bias on marriage given my upbringing, values and Christian orientation upfront. For me, every testimony and gratitude on marital success or seeming bliss, is concession to the grace of God; to significant commitment of both parties that the union is of value and deserve their sacrifice and investment thereto; to luck that the unthinkable don\u2019t feature in the union; and to positive mental attitude to whatever ingrained \u2018imperfections\u2019 in the marriage. In other words, every marriage contends with some \u2018demons\u2019 or what apostle Paul calls the thorn in the flesh. So, marriages that succeed have some thorns in what many perceive to be beds of roses. I would therefore not recommend my marriage as the model to anyone nor brag that it\u2019s succeeded. As it\u2019s said, the road to perfection is always under construction. But I have a grateful heart, that recognizes what it all would have been like for us, but for grace, mercy and the force of the never shaking foundation of upbringing, character, molding and of the shower of grace from He that is able to keep from falling.\n\nWhen two individuals therefore commence the marital journey, it is often, as what Soren Kierkegaard, the Danish philosopher, regarded as a leap of faith. This simply means that both do not have the epistemic idea of where they would land when the journey commenced. I can only thank Providence that, in retrospect, my marriage has turned out the way it is, molded by the furnace of fiery experience, existential agonies and the joy of the Lord that passeth all understanding. As my wife has now turned out, I see in her the very essence of womanhood and of virtue. She is my own representation of the good women from the bible and all through history; from Sarah to Mother Theresa.\n\nA son is supposed to be the sociocultural reflection of what he has learnt from his father. In spite irreducible virtues my father impacted in me, I had been extremely determined, from my formative years, not to replicate his being a polygamist, which indeed was a defining tradition of his time. He of course did his best to manage all the unsavory experiences that often characterize a polygamous family. Nonetheless, there were so many missing links that not only made polygamy culturally approved but psychologically unpalatable, but also led to my resolve early in life to forge a different path. I consider myself an African, but I concede that my cultural leanings have been qualitatively affected by my Christian and western affectations.\n\nI had very grand theories and imaginations about marriage before I met Funlola. I have read of great marriages in the bible and in history. I have read biographies and autobiographies of successful and failed marriages. I have also been experientially involved in the marriage examples of those very close to me. Thus, I gave serious considerations to the idea of who I want my wife to be, and how I want her trajectory to unravel. However, when we eventually met and the marriage became a reality, I had to revise a lot of my future aspiration for her. I have a very good example handy. When we met, my wife was about earning a bachelor degree in education. Such a degree resonates with my very high regard for the wife of my late uncle, Chief Alfred Olaopa, who was a renowned teacher at St. Anne\u2019s, Ibadan. I shared my deep fascination with Funlola, and how I certainly desired that her career path will replicate the great successes of my uncle\u2019s wife, especially as I saw in her a professional teacher in the making. My wife\u2019s retort carried the rationalization of existing reality, and especially the reality of a teacher\u2019s wage and reputation at that point in Nigerian history. That led to our joint resolve to let God determine how that future will turn out.\n\nAnd that was a wise resolve because the structural adjustment programmes of the 1980s not only undermined the institutional and structural resilience of the Nigerian state, but also equally recalibrated individuals\u2019 future prospects. My wife and I, as well as million others, were left to yield to the existential imperative of making ends meet. Both of us finally found ourselves in the federal civil service, which we thought would be only a stopgap while we await our true career calling. But by some providential dynamic, the civil service was to become our lifelong career and professional vocation. Funlola ended up as an educational administrator, rather than a teacher, with the allowance to also monitor the growth and development of the children at the home front.\n\nMarriage for us was the collision and collusion of similar background and cultural knowledge that instigated some measure of chemistry. This was what further enabled the functional success of the relationship even in the face of daunting challenges that confront most homes too. Our parents infused in us the omol\u00faw\u00e0b\u00ed values that was founded on the strength of the good name and reputation on which our training and education was grounded\u2014\u201dremember the child of whom you are.\u201d Our marriage, and the upbringing of our children, was therefore (and still is) circumscribed by the values of tolerance and forbearance, even of each other\u2019s excesses and weaknesses. So, our relationship from the beginning was marked by our readiness to make critical sacrifices and to eschew the Christian virtue of longsuffering in order to keep our good names and to inculcate some significant values in our children while earning their respect.\n\nOur relationship constitutes, as far as I am concerned, a strong framework of how iron can sharpen iron, in scriptural terms. For instance, I rate my wife to be a better Christian, in its religiosity, than I am. In other words, I am more of an intellectually-minded Christian whose faith is rooted more in the knowledge and experience of the faithfulness of God. Her strong disciplinarian character, matching her fastidious orderliness eventually came to complement my own relatively disorganized nature. The children therefore were given the opportunity of learning from the utility of two complementary forces.\n\nWould I in any sense consider my wife a feminist? Now, this is an interesting question that enables me to draw deep into the essence of the woman that my wife has turned out to be. The feminist ideals seem to now define the fundamental nature of the contemporary woman. Social discourses ring with the outspoken voices of women who speak out against patriarchal oppression and the urgency of achieving gender equality. I doubt that my wife fits into this feminist mold. James Faust once said, and I suspect my wife will agree, that \u201cFemininity is part of the God-given divinity within each of you. It is your incomparable power and influence to do good. You can, through your supernal gifts, bless the lives of children, women, and men.\u201d My wife\u2019s femininity has blossom in ways\u2014emotional, intellectual, biological, spiritual, relational and professional\u2014that yield a rounded womanhood which I and my children, as well as others, have benefitted from. Within the privileges and challenges she was confronted with, that womanhood has unraveled to define her as a unique woman molded by existential suffering but girded by Christian faith and cultural knowledge. I even surmise that all patriarchal arrogance will tremble before the sturdy oak of womanhood that Funlola represents.\n\nOlufunlola Modupe Olaopa\u2014my wonderful wife of more than thirty-four years of marriage\u2014is a wonder of a woman. She is a woman of uncompromising integrity founded on the fear of God and unstinting respect for others. She is a woman who will undergo the meanest of sacrifices, indeed someone who will give up everything, to gain her home. She has over and again shunned the compromises and the lures of status and of her professional office in order that the name of Christ, and those of her family, be not denigrated. You can only regard Funlola as being foolish only in her unquestioning devotion to the Christian faith, her home and the need to stay focused on the only achievement that matters, after all earthly successes have been accounted for: a place in eternity with the Almighty.\n\nThat is the woman I celebrate and project as model of a woman to emulate. I am very proud to be the husband of a woman whose very resilience I can count as a foundational element in the making of my life and our children.\n\nOlaopa is a Retired Federal Permanent Secretary & Directing Staff, National Institute For Policy and Strategic Studies\n\n(NIPSS), Kuru, Jos [email protected]",

          "title": "Why I write simultaneously for the Left and, in a manner of speaking, for the Non-left",
          "text": "By Biodun Jeyifo\n\nIn the tribute to Edwin Madunagu @75 that appeared in this column last week, among other very important observations, I stated that while Eddie writes almost exclusively for the Left, I write simultaneously for the Left and a more general, \u201cNon-left\u201d national community. This has not always been the case. In the earliest period of my practice of newspaper journalism in the early 1970s, the things I wrote about had no direct or distinct correlation with either the Left or the Non-left. But after that somewhat non-ideological beginning, I then went through a phase of an intensely ideological period in which I wrote, exclusively and clamantly, only for the Left. But then in the early to mid-1980s, shortly after my term as National President of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), I began to write, deliberately and programmatically, for both the Left and the Non-left. This is not a statement of mere historical happenstance; it was the result of a decision of great strategic and tactical importance. As a Yoruba-language adage puts it, there is an abundance of words in a pennyworth newspaper! Let me explain.\n\nWe can deal succinctly with the beginnings in my \u201cnon-ideological\u201d period of journalistic writing. I had graduated from UI in mid-1970. After a short stint of secondary school teaching of about four months, I returned to UI to begin my postgraduate studies. In late 1971, I proceeded to the US to continue my postgraduate studies at New York University. It was in this period when I was in the PG Hall in UI that I began to write for the newspapers, almost exclusively on the subject of what we might call \u201ccultural journalism\u201d \u2013 theatre reviews, cultural festivals, emerging playwrights, etc., etc. Although I was already what you might call a \u201cradical\u201d or a \u201cprogressive\u201d, I was not yet a Marxist and I rarely referred to myself as a \u201csocialist\u201d. All that changed when I arrived in America for the continuation of my postgraduate studies. And from that moment, the stories I am telling here took on a dimension that was much larger than a tale with only an individual protagonist. What I am saying here can be grasped by the following paradox: in my generation, a good number of those who went to study in the US became Marxists and socialists while many of those who went to the Soviet Union to study became diehard defenders of capitalism!\n\nThe \u201cLeft\u201d and the \u201cNon-left\u201d; Marxists\u201d and \u201csocialists\u201d on the one hand, and \u201cliberals and \u201cconservatives\u201d on the other hand: these may seem like mere labels or tags, but they are far more than that. This is one of the main points that I was trying to convey in my tribute to Eddie Madunagu in this column last week: beyond any ideological or political label that anyone gives himself or herself, what each man or woman feels, genuinely and passionately, about human equality and inequality is what really matters. This is because it is almost impossible for any woman or man not to have any views, any position concerning human equality and inequality. Those of us who ascribe ideological labels to ourselves are merely making it clear to the whole world where we stand on this all-important issue, knowing very well that others will judge us on who or what we claim to be. And also, the world judges us on what we achieve, what changes we bring about in our societies. And on what struggles we wage and how we wage them. This leads me to the most crucial point in this discussion, this being how in early to mid-1980s shortly after the end of my tenure as ASUU National President, I began to write simultaneously for the Left and the Non-left where previously all my journalism had been exclusively Leftist. I repeat: although I am writing here of personal or individual experiences, as we shall see, what pertains to me in this matter actually corresponded to an entire generational experience.\n\nSince I have written before in this column on how and why I became ASUU National President in 1980, I shall relate only the most pertinent details in this discussion. Having previously been known as NAUT \u2013 National Association of University Teachers \u2013 ASUU had just changed its name. But in spirit and organizational capacity, the old NAUT still prevailed in the new ASUU. The national leadership of the \u201cassociation\u201d was known to be inept, conservative and barely known at the branches of the \u201cunion\u201d. Neither the government nor the general public thought much of the NAUT\u2019s effectiveness as an association of the country\u2019s university dons. All these shortcomings were aggravated by the repressiveness of military dictatorship which waged perpetual and humiliating wars on the universities, grinding academic autonomy and adequate funding of tertiary education to the dust. And most germane of all, the military was waging a war for total expulsion of the Left, faculty and students, from the universities. It was in this context that I became ASUU National President, a known, nationally prominent Leftist!\n\nI confess that at the beginning of my tenure, neither myself nor the national body of academic Leftists in the universities had a ready and coherent strategy of how to deal successfully with the challenge of running an \u201cassociation\u201d in which not only were Leftists as a group marked for destruction by the government but they also constituted a tiny demographic minority within the university communities. For this reason, \u201cwe\u201d, the Left, quickly learned what we had to do. Among the myriad of strategies and tactics we had to devise, one strategy was key: we had to stop talking exclusively only within and amongst ourselves and start talking to and with those we had previously disdained and savaged as \u201cbourgeois\u201d, \u201cconservative\u201d lackeys of the ruling class. Naturally, as National President of ASUU, I could no longer talk to my Non-leftist colleagues as if they were my ideological enemies. On the contrary, I had to now act on the presumption that they were my actual or potential allies and collaborators. That is how it came to pass that in my mandatory reorganizing visits to the branches, I would meet first with dedicated Leftists in a given branch and thereafter meet with the Non-leftist majority of the members of the branch. If the reader can already see in this profile the practice of writing simultaneously for the Left and the Non-left that is indicated in the title of this article, I confess that this is an intentional move on my part in this discussion.\n\nAlmost four decades later, I am still astonished by how we made ASUU seem like a national union of academic dons the majority of who were/are Leftists, Marxists or socialists. Nothing could be further from the truth! What is the truth? The truth was/is the fact that Leftists in our universities, then and now, constitute only a small demographic and ideological minority, just as we have it in the national community. What then was/is the secret of this success? Well, this \u201csecret\u201d is no secret at all, since everyone knows exactly what is going on: in any or all branches of ASUU in which the Marxists, socialists and Leftists are successful in securing for the members rights and benefits denied them by government or governing boards, they are allowed to lead the Union indefinitely; but where they, the \u201cleftists\u201d, either fail or succumb to their own moral, ideological and political lapses, they are unceremoniously kicked out of office. Even in my brief, two-year presidency of ASUU \u2013 the typical or standard tenure is now made up of two terms of two years for a term, making an incumbency of four years \u2013 we had a major crisis concerning grave ideological and moral lapses that led to a permanent ban on ASUU ever again having an appointive, non-elective General Secretary. At any rate, the takeaway here is clear: when Leftists took over the leadership of ASUU, we discovered that because we were a demographic and ideological minority, we had to stop regarding all others of the \u201cNon-left\u201d as our natural enemies. We had to begin to assume that there were actual or potential allies and collaborators in this Non-left, and side by side with ideological and intellectual practices of self-clarification amongst ourselves, we had to also expend our energies on conversations and discourses with members of that Non-left majority of our branches.\n\nTime is not separated into stretches of experience that are locked in completely distinct blocks or temporalities. The period when I practiced newspaper journalism exclusively to and for the Left was/is not completely separated from the time when I began to write simultaneously for the Left and non-left. One period, one temporality segued to another, almost seamlessly. This much I know: in the period in which I wrote exclusively to and for the Left, Marxism and socialism were in a sort of high tide in Nigeria and Africa. But then, I also confess that I look back now to that time with nostalgia. I say to myself: don\u2019t be too harsh on yourself; you have not diluted or vulgarly popularized Marxism and socialism. Indeed, I ask myself, \u201cIsn\u2019t it because you have refused to bow to commonplace ideological and intellectual denominators that many readers speak positively of the challenges that your column always poses to lazy or complacent readers? I think, perhaps in self-consolation: it is because I have refused to condescend to or patronize my readers that I have constantly dared to take on the most perplexing issues, issues that take up the greatest challenges to the surfeit of suffering and oppression in our country, our age.\n\nIn a way, the example of Eddie that I discussed in my tribute to him in this column last week is apposite here as a sort of touchstone. In that piece, I asserted, I insisted that Eddie writes almost exclusively to and for the Left. I admit that this seems an exceptional statement to make. But then I add that this observation seems exceptional only in the context of one of the great cultural and institutional failures of the Nigerian Left: we had hoped, we had tried to have mass circulation newspapers and newsmagazines of the Left in our country; but we have utterly failed in that aspiration. In countries in which such publications of the left flourish, when one writes only for and to the Left, it does not seem that one is doing so exclusively. True, we have had Left-leaning newspapers and newsmagazines, but none of them have had the distinct ideological and intellectual sophistication of such publications in other parts of the developing world, like India, Brazil, Chile and Mexico. As a matter of fact, apart from the brilliance and relevance of his journalism, part of the reason why Eddie stands out so sharply is because The Guardian in which he writes is now generally centre-right, where it had once been distinctly left-of-centre. With the myth that fueled Milton\u2019s Samson Agonistes in mind, I think of Eddie, in his insistence on writing exclusively to and for the Left, battling heroically to ensure that Marxism and socialism will survive and thrive in our society and not be consigned to the status of a vestigial body of knowledge and a tradition of praxis that once held great promise in our country, our world.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn conclusion of this mostly reflective piece, I briefly wish to relate the discussion to the issue of vanguardism, especially in a prerevolutionary period of widespread insecurity, poverty and suffering that seem to have no end in sight, such as the period that we are going through now in Nigeria and many other parts of the world. With regard to this issue of vanguardism, the duty of all revolutionary individuals and organizations in such periods is clear. Without turning away from the necessity of formation of large groups, parties and movements, together with coalitions between them, the urge to self-constitute vanguard elements whose numerical strength can be as small as half a dozen, two, or even one person(s) must be consummated. A vanguard formation of three, two, or even one person(s)? Yes, why not, as long as we keep in mind how vanguard formations really work. Indeed, what could be more vanguardist than Eddie writing vigorous Marxist and socialist analyses in a center-right newspaper like The Guardian?\n\nBiodun Jeyifo",

The nation is gripped with crippling insecurity; terrorism, banditry and outright criminalities. Boko Haram terrorists and bandits are running amok in the entire swathe of the north; while kidnappers, cultists, armed robbers, and \u201cunknown gunmen\u201d have gone gaga in the south. There are agitations by indigenous people for self determination north and south of the divide which is getting louder in the southeast and a little bit subdued in the south west for failure of the federal government to provide basic security of lives and property. Insecurity is enveloping the entire country while the President, General Muhammadu Buhari remains aloof at the Presidential Villa, Aso Rock. The little semblance of relative safety can only be enjoyed in Abuja City Centre of the Federal Capital territory, and probably at the State capitals.\n\nEven at that, the insurgents are just few miles away from the capital city of Abuja, the nation\u2019s seat of power as the Boko Haram terrorists have invaded the neighbouring Niger State where they have hoisted their Caliphate flags in some villages. Banditry and kidnappings are no longer isolated cases on the highways but everywhere with wholesale abductions and the prime targets are institutions of learning without discrimination, from nursery schools to tertiary institutions and huge ransoms paid by hapless victims. Places of worships are desecrated and homes and places of business are not spared either. All the Nnamdi Kanus and Sunday Igbohos of this world are created by poor governance and lack of inclusiveness. They have avid followers because they have raised basic questions of governance whether or not we agree with them or their method.\n\nNigeria is suffering from debilitating genetic disorder fuelled by ethnicity and religious intolerance, made worse by an incompetent clannish leadership that prefers to promote sectarianism and nepotism. Institutions and organs of government can no longer support the decrepit federal structure which appears to be on life support because of lack of trust and confidence on the government.\n\nAnarchy and death are common place with horrifying savagery as human beings are butchered in barbaric manners and shown off on social media. Farm lands are destroyed by marauding armed herdsmen while women are raped with brazen audacity as if there is no law and government in place while imminent famine stares us in the face. In all the deaths and killings, the President and Commander-in-Chief and his government officials never paid visit to any of the communities to empathize and commiserate with victims other than to tell grieving families and communities offensively that they should learn how to live and accommodate their neighbours. Who are their neighbours one may ask, murderous herdsmen? Lives of Nigerians appear not to matter much to our leaders.\n\nGuess what, Nigeria has reached an advanced stage of a failed state just before an implosion. It is the stage of campaign of terror, fear and intimidation which the government needs to handle with dexterity before the country breaks up through the force of arms. This is the stage where uniform men and security forces are targeted and killed at their duty posts as it is happening in the southeast and south-south. This is the final stage to a full blown arms campaign and insurrection. Federal and State infrastructure are torched and destroyed including Correctional Centres (prisons). Police stations are sacked and looted and police officers killed. If the intensity of the campaign of fear and intimidation is badly managed, it will get to a stage that the military men and police officers would soon drop their uniforms and abandon their duty post. The country continues to bleed and I ask myself, have we not shed enough blood already?\n\nThe APC led government has allowed bandits to become important and equal stakeholders as non state actors in government. The bandits have a prominent Islamic cleric, Sheik Gumi proselytizing for them while some politicians are bankrolling them being their ambassadors.\n\nAfter every wholesale abduction, the same good old Islamic cleric would visit the bandits in their colony and discuss with them in their hide-out with full media coverage displaying weapons in their arsenal in a show of force whereas the security forces give the impression they do not know where the bandits are. The cleric is permitted to indoctrinate and brainwash the bandits or so it appears, telling the bandits that the security forces attacking them are those who do not share the same faith with them. The government does not see anything wrong with that. The same treatment is not meted to criminal elements in other geo-political zones as the government often bare its fangs like attack dogs to crush the dissidents.\n\nA sitting State governor would rise up in defence of herdsmen using military assault rifle because to him, they have to protect their cattle; as if the farmers have no right to protect their crops and their indigenous land and means of livelihood. A serving Minister of the federal Republic, Mr Isa Ibrahim Pantami who is notorious for religious extremism and a bigot noted for incitement and hate speech that have caused religious riots and deaths of scores of people remained in his post as a Minister after calls and protestation for his sacking. This is the type of leadership that we have in the country where divisive and controversial elements are in charge of the day to day running of the government. In all these, the President remains tight-lip, saying nothing like a medieval king and emperor probably hoping the problems would go away. The political elites and religious clerics remain the masterminds and purveyors of the festering security problems in this country. They promote insecurity through inflammatory rhetoric of ethnic hatred and resentment.\n\nSuddenly, the politicians have gone into a frenzy in panic mode dramatizing on the floor of the National Assembly soliciting for foreign support and aid to fight insecurity.\n\nIf you have to tackle the problem of insecurity, we have to attack it from the root and go after those behind it and not treating the symptoms as we are pretending to do now. The Boko Haram terrorist group started as a militia vanguard for advancement of political interest of some politicians from Borno State that is now the epicentre of terrorism and insurgency in Nigeria. Those behind it remain active participants in government today and nobody would call them to account for their roles. We created the problems and we are looking for someone to clear the mess for us. We want France, America and Europe to come and help us fight our own wars; we want to engage mercenaries; common!\n\nDr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\u2019s government experimented with mercenaries and it turned out not to be much of a game changer. For free, mercenaries don\u2019t win wars, they are merchants plying their trade for profit. For free, foreign fighters don\u2019t win wars. You may want to confirm this from experience of countries like Afghanistan which proved a complete disaster for the Soviet troops who had to withdraw in humiliation. Presently, American troops are pulling out after over a decade with NATO forces in the same Afghanistan. Guess what, the Talibans have remained the dominant force and deciding issues on their own terms. Irag has remained in ruins and battle grounds for the Iranian proxy Hezbollah to contest for the soul of the country. In Syria, the Russian forces have turned the country into a mass graveyard and a wasteland in the last one decade since the Arab Spring that challenged the hegemony of the Assaad dynasty with huge Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). Nearer home in Libya, the allied Forces under France and America have left the country struggling with warlords who see the country as war booty.\n\nIt is laughable that the National Assembly is now asking the President to declare a state of emergency on security on the one hand, while the President is asking the American government to relocate its African Command (AFRICOM) from Stuttgart in Germany to Africa. We created the problems and we are looking for people to clear the mess for us. We cannot even gather basic intelligence on our own soil and we want America, Israel, France to send Special Forces to assist our Armed Forces. The arguments of our dear honourables and government officials sometimes makes one feel that their brains must be using Target or Ever ready batteries instead of grey matters. Nigerians from all works of life have become despondent.\n\nThose who may have call the military to intervene or such like insinuation would have done so out of frustration, they are not by any means less patriotic. Unfortunately for us, the military has ceased to be what it used to be; discipline, patriotic professional and apolitical. Late General Victor Malu, former Chief of Army Staff arguably was the last of the core professional soldier to lead the Nigerian Army. The Command structure and system after him have declined and the military high command has become highly politicised. The current Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and Service Chiefs have a lot of work to do to retool, recalibrate and rejig the Nigerian Armed Forces as an effective fighting force to reckon with. They have to reclaim their soul and professionalism of the armed forces and demonstrate loyalty to the nation and the constitution and not to any individual.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA broken and dismembered Nigeria is a greater disincentive to the elites who leech on our common patrimony than the ordinary citizens who have always been beast of burden and at the receiving end.\n\nJust before the fall as the nation tilts on the brinks, what is left of Nigeria can still be salvaged but certainly, the country may never remain the same again as the present government has done incalculable damage to the psyche of the nation and mismanaged our diversity.\n\nMike Kebonkwu Esq\n\n08055065075",

          "title": "Economic dimensions to the national crisis",
          "text": "Tatalo Alamu\n\nNigeria is beset by a deep and fundamental crisis of nationhood. This crisis has various components: political, social, cultural, spiritual and economic. Each of the dimensions when they act in their full baleful potential can bring a nation to heel. But when they act in concert and synchrony with mutually reinforcing synergy, it is a perfect storm.\n\nThere are those who believe that many people are merely raising alarm about the dire prospects of Nigeria in the short and long term. But the fact remains that the nation is in a bad way in all indices of modern and civilized nationhood. As we have advanced last week, nations are there to serve human interest and the need for self-actualization even when and where this differs from the original calculations of their imperial founders.\n\nLast week, despite the subsisting political crisis in the nation, it was the economic dimension to the national meltdown that reared its head. A cursory glance at the newspaper headlines will suffice. In a banner headline, this newspaper announced: \u201cWhy petrol subsidy will be removed now, by minister\u201d.\n\nThe paper only needed to have added \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d to further reinforce the military-like urgency of the moment. Yet this was the same subsidy we erroneously thought we had done away with forever. To an American and any denizen of Western European countries, the whole idea of \u201cpetrol subsidy removal\u201d must sound like postcolonial gibberish. Why do we keep going round in circles, doing the same thing all over again and expecting a different result?\n\nWhile this was going on, Kaduna State was completely embroiled in labour crisis with the governor once again giving vent to despotic fury, firing striking nurses, lecturers and declaring the labour leaders as fugitives from law. In anger, the Labour lobby rechristened the diminutive but feisty governor as HELL RUFAI.\n\nSince this was happening in Kaduna, all the Labour leaders needed to do was to take a look at the carcass of the textile industry which threw up one of their own notable leaders and weep for the beloved country. In 1976, the Federal Government College, Malali, Kaduna boasted of better infrastructure than most contemporary higher institutions.\n\nFor once and in a long time, the labour leaders, whose public perception is nothing to write home about as a result of serial perfidy, saw an opportunity to flex their shrivelled muscles. It did not occur to either of the contending factions that the crisis is symptomatic of a more fundamental economic malaise which required a comprehensive and holistic solution.\n\nLet it be noted that el-Rufai is right to insist that he cannot afford to be spending virtually all his government resources on workers\u2019 salary, leaving nothing to capital development. In most cases, the workers are unproductive, merely idling away in the crevices and burrows of bureaucracy.\n\nBut the solution to the problem does not lie in the right wing economic castration of the Bretton Woods lobby famously beloved by el-Rufai but in creative disengagement of workers and their retooling for better productive purposes. In a comatose economy, the workers are actually performing a key Keynesian function.\n\nIn a situation of widespread pan-national profligacy and the plundering of resources, the workers may feel entitled to their own share of the national cake. This is why a deep-seated economic malaise often requires national resolve and political solution rather than executive high-handedness and local tyranny.\n\nThe same crisis of development framed by political instability is at play but on another level in Lagos state this past week. In a move that was widely expected, the long-suffering Lagos State authorities announced a ban on Okada motorcycle as a means of transportation in the ever-expanding megalopolis.\n\nLet it be said right away again that the Lagos authorities are right. The security nightmare represented by the large scale influx of undocumented aliens into the city cannot be traded for ease of transportation. There is no point playing a Good Samaritan in a condition of dire demographic emergency.\n\nBut having said that, the palliative of medium capacity buses will simply not do. Lagos has become an urban nightmare in terms of transportation. What is required is a mass transit system that will move huge populations at once from one point to the other. If it aspires to make a dent on the ailment, the state government will do well to study the underlying conditions or comorbidities.\n\nThe transportation crisis in Lagos is caused by rapid and unrelenting urban migration. Urban migration is a natural phenomenon. The city is a magnetic lodestar for the agrarian populace. All governments try to modulate this relentless mass movement by making agrarian living conditions more conducive and agricultural rewards more competitive and worthy of the toil.\n\nFailing this, they must try to alleviate the horrid living conditions in the metropolis. In most circumstances, satellite hubs are needed to drain the megalopolis of excess population. In recent times, succeeding Lagos administrations have tried to grapple with this developmental conundrum.\n\nYet as both the outlying areas and the rest of the country empty their desperate and traumatized citizenry on the Lagos metropolis, the struggle for scarce resources begin to assume a desperate feral urgency. In some of the ghettoes, human beings are reduced to the level of foraging animals without any hope of secular redemption.\n\nThe heedless rush to Lagos in recent times is accentuated by two developments and both are traceable to defective governance. First, the rapid decline in the farming culture as a result of loss of motivation and lack of official incentives. The marketing boards of yore have become extinct and so is the official mechanism for cushioning the farmers against the vagaries of market forces. Consequently, no one wants to farm again and city labour is preferable to toiling on the farm.\n\nThe second reason is the herders\u2019 crisis and the increasing Sahelization of the northern fringes which has led to the Southward migration of vast populace with majority of the uprooted populace ending up in the Lagos metropolis as part of a vast pool of urban alienated and d\u00e9class\u00e9 migrants ready to be used as lighting rods for social upheavals and political mayhems such as witnessed during the EndSARS uprising.\n\nThis agrarian nightmare has now been compounded by the huge spike in countrywide cases of banditry and kidnapping and the rising cases of security breaches which has seen the entire eastern region of the country placed on virtual war-footing. The failure to deal with the Boko Haram menace, the gradual alienation of the Eastern section of the country and the resurgence of forces of radical revanchism in the western parts of the country have led to demographic instability in the nation.\n\nFrom the above analysis, it can be seen why and how economic crisis is always embedded in a greater political crisis. As it has been famously observed, first seek the political kingdom and every other thing would follow. Although the two can be mutually reinforcing and dialectically intertwined, the primacy belongs to the political. Whenever a political situation is explained away by an economic category, we can be sure the explanation is false.\n\nIn 1992 at the height of a major economic crisis, Nigeria\u2019s military president, Ibrahim Babangida, wondered aloud why the economy had not collapsed in spite of the manifest failure of the government to find a cure for its ailment. Although obviously an admission of economic frustration, it was also a covert sign that General Babangida\u2019s political design was finally unravelling. The oceanic supply of time for political jiggery-pokery had evaporated in the face of growing restiveness in the country.\n\nIn a famous retort, Sam Aluko, the notable professor of Economics, asked how the economy was expected to collapse when the people could easily bypass the formal economy and head for the bush to uproot primitive tuber and hunt down wild animals for meal. In essence what Aluko was broadly hinting at was that the failure of politics and economic policies could lead to de-civilization and a steady regression to the hunter-gatherer phase of human existence.\n\nThirty years after, the political brutalization and economic dehumanization of Nigerians have proceeded apace. As a result of a lack of visionary and purposeful leadership at the centre, the social condition of Nigerians has worsened in the intervening decades. Homo Nigerianus has finally arrived on the scene.\n\nLooking back down the line to fifty years ago or even further down to the First Republic, it could have been another country entirely. From being at parity with the dollar in the early eighties, the much weakened and abused national currency is almost five hundred to single green back this past week.\n\nSome international comparison is in order. About the same time Professor Aluko was making his dire prognosis of the Nigerian economy, post-Soviet Russia was playing hosts to a plague of local oligarchs. Like locusts, they had arrived on the scene at the appointed time. It was time for a feeding frenzy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter the IMF and western-inspired devaluation of the rouble, the Russian economy took a nosedive with the home-grown economic predators known as oligarchs making a killing. In informed circles, the consensus was that by the time the west finished with this post-Soviet Russian rump, it would only be marginally better than a Burkina Faso with a nuclear weapon.\n\nBut the land of Peter the Great and Lenin rallied. Through a purposeful and visionary leadership, the Russians routed the oligarchs and put them to flight with a few of them ending up in prison. Some paid the supreme price for their crime against the fatherland. The nation and the economy were put back on an even keel. The Russians drew on the inner reserve and steely resolve of an abjured and affronted civilization that dates back to the thirteenth century.\n\nSome of Vladimir Putin\u2019s despotic excesses and authoritarian severity might be regretted. But there can be no doubt that his abiding patriotism and bouncing swagger resonated with the vast majority of his people. Russia\u2019s economic recovery and political resurgence particularly on the international scene are no doubt the handiwork of the former KGB operative.\n\nUntil recently, Nigerians remained a credulous lot which made the task of political engineering very easy. Hope sprang eternally in the Nigerian heart. Despite the havoc wreaked on their collective psyche by a succeeding generation of inept and visionless rulers, Nigerians were always willing to give the latest messiahs a free hand until they proved their worth or worthlessness as the case may be.\n\nGeneral Mohammadu Buhari had earned his reputation for fiscal prudence and stern probity and integrity. When he began his initial drive for the infrastructural revamp of the nation accompanied by a zero tolerance for corruption and official malfeasance, many sections of the country applauded. This was despite the widespread murmurs in some quarters about bias and favouritism.\n\nThere were many hitherto vociferous people who were willing to trade the economic redemption of the country for political quietude. It is a scary trade off. But as it has happened in many countries from different and countervailing ideological spectrums, sometimes you have to choose between political freedom and economic liberation.\n\nUnfortunately in Buhari\u2019s Nigeria, the whole thing lost steam even before midway. In fragile multi-ethnic nations riven by bitter divisions and ancestral memory of persecution, you have to be seen to be above board or you will invite the wrath of the people. Now we seem to be back to square one with ethnic animosity and despondency on a scale that has never been witnessed in the history of the country.\n\nWhy does the country ever so often come up with the wrong type of leadership at the very time it ought to put its right foot forward? Surely, there must be something fundamentally askew about a country perpetually unable to throw up the right leadership material.\n\nIt appears that the Nigerian populace have reached the end of their historic tether and are no longer willing to put up with explanations of leadership failure. It is this combined failure of politics and economic policies that is fuelling the shrill cries of secession and the rumblings of disintegration.\n\nDriven by heartfelt economic and political grievances, the multiple siege of the Nigerian postcolonial state has never been this ferocious. Those who are adept at reading the rustling tea leaves must know that it is past the time for political palliatives. And that is assuming that the horse has not already bolted from the stable.",

He was buried at exactly 4:45 pm local time Saturday.\n\nGen Attahiru died in the plane crash after the aircraft skidded off the runway after a successful landing at the Kaduna International Airport on Friday. He was in Kaduna to attend the Passing Out Parade (POP) of members of 80 Regular Intake at the Depot Nigerian Army, scheduled to take place on Saturday, when he and some of his principal officers met their untimely death.\n\nHe died along with three Brigadier Generals, two Majors, two Flight Lieutenants, two Sergeants and one Aircraft Man.\n\nThe deceased are Brigadier Generals Ahmed Kuliya, OL Olayinka and MI Abdulkadir, Majors N Hamza, LA Hayat, Sergeants O Adesina, Umar and Air Craft Man OM Oyedepo.\n\nThe last ceremony Gen Attahiru attended was the 57 years anniversary celebrations of the Nigerian Air Force, held at Makurdi, the Benue State Capital, to celebrate with the NAF, whose Chief happens to be his coursemate.\n\nGen Attahiru, who has been on tour of army formations across the country, was also at the 2nd Division Nigerian Army, Ibadan, before heading to Makurdi.\n\nNews about the death of the Army Chief began to filter in the news late Friday night.\n\nA statement by the Media Adviser to the President, Femi Adesina, soon made a statement about the death of the COAS. After the statement from the Presidency, the Defence Headquarters and Army Headquarters issued a statement confirming their death late Friday night.\n\nAs soon as the Army confirmed the death of their COAS, it immediately mobilised members of the Nigerian Army Officers Wives Association(NAOWA) to the flag house to condole with his widow, who happens to the the national president.\n\nThe flag house, located at the Niger barracks, soon became a Mecca of sorts, as serving and retired military officers trooped in in large numbers to pay their condolences to Mrs Attahiru.\n\nA similar crowd was witnessed at the homes of the other officers who died alongside the COAS in the crash, while arrangements to convey those not resident in Abuja were made to fly them in to witness and pay their last respects to their loved ones.\n\nThe burial ceremony started after the bodies of the deceased officers arrived at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in a C-130 aircraft, and were received by service chiefs and top military officers, from where they were conveyed to the church and mosque, respectively, for the Christian and Muslims deceased officers for funeral services and prayers.\n\nThe funeral service for the Christian officers was held at the Protestant Church at the NAF base, Abuja.\n\nWith the prayers over, the bodies were then moved to the National Military Cemetery.\n\nMilitary officers in ceremonial dress with black band tied around their arms trooped into the cemetery to pay their last respects. Grave diggers arrived the cemetery as early as 6 am to dig the graves under the supervision of the Guards Brigade of the Nigerian Army, led by its commander, Brigadier General Takuti Usman.\n\nPall bearers who assembled at the cemetery as early as 6 am began to take their position for the ceremony at exactly 12:40 pm for a dress rehearsal awaiting the arrival of the bodies.\n\nThe pall bearers comprised eleven soldiers and eighteen members of the firing party from the Guards Brigade of the Nigerian Army.\n\nThe brial ceremony started with the arrival of very senior retired and serving officers, former Chief of Army Staff Lieutenant General Azubuike Ihejirika, Chief of Defence Staff General Lucky Irabor, Minister of Information Lai Mohammed, President of the Defence and Police Pfficers Wives Association (DEPOWA) NAFOWA president, NOWA president. Others are former Chief of Army Ataff Lieutenant General Dambazau, Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufal, Senate President Ahmed Lawan, Inspector General of Police, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Chief of Staff to the President Ibrahim Gambari, members of the diplomatic corps, among other top dignitaries.\n\nPresident Mohammad Buhari was represented by the Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (retd).\n\nThe bodies of the deceased officers were conveyed in eleven ambulance vehicles, with the staff vehicle of the late COAS decorated with three stars leading the convoy arriving at the cemetery at exactly 14:22 hours.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe ambulance bearing the body of Gen Attahiru was the first to be carried out of the ambulance when the ambulance drove into the burial site at exactly 14:40 hours, and pallbearers, mostly in the ranks of Major General, marched the body to the gravesite.\n\nThe Chief Imam of the Nigerian Army offered the burial prayers for the late Gen Attahiru, after which he made an appeal that the family would prefer a private burial.\n\nThe burial of the other officers started at about 16:30 hours, when senior officers in the ranks of Brigadier General marched in their bodies. Brigadier General JH Abdulasalam read the funeral oration for Brigadier Generals Ahmed Kuliya, OL Olayinka and MI Abdulkadir while Colonel AS Saleh, read the funeral oration of Majors N Hamza, LA Hayat, Sergeants O Adesina, Umar and Air Craft Man OM Oyedepo; while Flight lieutenant UV Edem and Flying Officer C Odili, read that of Flight Lieutenant LT Asaniyi and Olufade, respectively.\n\nAfter the reading of the funeral oration, the next-of-kin for the deceased officers were then called upon for the presentation of the national flag to them, which was done by the Minister of Defence Bashir Magashi, who represented the President.\n\nChaplains and Imams of the Nigerian Air Force and Army offered prayers for the repose of the souls of the deceased officers.\n\nIn his address at the occasion, the Chief of Defence Staff General Lucky Irabor, who said the officers died as a result of their love for the country, said their deaths would not be in vain. General Irabor, who said he received the news of the death of the COAS and the eleven officers with shock, assured that the war on insecurity must be won and called on Nigerians to continue to pray for the Nigerian Armed Forces. He described the late COAS as not just a fine officer but one with passion, professionalism, love for the job and a very dependable colleague.\n\nHe said the death of the officers was painful but would last only for a moment as the Armed Forces would come out stronger.\n\nHe assured the families of the deceased that the Armed Forces, the Federal Government and the country as a whole would not abandon them.\n\nAlso speaking, the Minister of Magashi described the deaths as a huge blow to the country, but assured of the government\u2019s continuing support for the military and their families.",

          "text": "Two weeks after the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) said it had issued 54 million people their national identity numbers, it is in the process of deploying a Device Management System (DMS).\n\nThe NCC said in a statement, \u201cTo curtail the counterfeit mobile phone market, discourage mobile phone theft, enhance national security, protect consumer interest, increase revenue generation for the government, reduce the rate of kidnapping, mitigate the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitate blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices, one of the means to achieve this is through the deployment of Device Management System.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implementation of a Centralised Equipment Identity Register otherwise known as Device Management System will serve as a repository for keeping records of all registered mobile phones\u2019 International Mobile Equipment Identity and owners of such devices.\u201d\n\nDespite the government hinging the policy on fighting insecurity, there are privacy concerns that the government can easily abuse access to such data.\n\nDoes this new requirement infringe on privacy?\n\nAs of March 2020, Nigeria was one of eleven countries with mandatory biometric SIM registration laws. One of the arguments against compulsory registration is that it allows the government to track SIM card owners and makes it easier to track calls and messages.\n\nA Device Management System will take this step even further, allowing the government even more access to what should be private information. While the argument from the government is that it improves security, there\u2019s the risk that the government can spy on its citizens.\n\nGeneralized surveillance in countries like Nigeria with weak security agencies controlled by the executive can become police states where opposition leaders can be tracked and arrested. But with the rise in crime in Nigeria in the past year, it is easy to understand the government\u2019s argument.\n\nDoes the government\u2019s argument make sense?\n\nIn a 2016 paper, \u201ccomplete mobile phone registration has many generalised benefits to the society especially in combating crime.\u201d\n\nWith increasing reports of kidnappings taking place around the country, a centralised registry may help to find bad actors even quicker, and it could help combat the sale of stolen phones. When there\u2019s a central registry for IMEI, the police could identify the owners of lost and stolen phones thousands of times daily.\n\nA critical part of this paper argues for a central database of mobile phones that law enforcement agencies presumably can access. Yet, it is this central assumption that still provides a problem.\n\nWhether Nigerians trust that the government will not abuse access to such critical information remains to be seen.\n\n*An earlier version of this report stated that the NCC asked telcos to register the IMEI numbers of their subscribers; the NCC has now clarified its position",

Before starting Black Ops, Seni helped scale Andela\u2019s operations from series B to series D with over 1,000 team members across US and Africa offices.\n\nChichi Offodile is the COO of Helium Health. She has over 15 years of experience working at EMC/Dell and Deloitte.\n\nTheir Journey at Helium Health and Andela\n\nThe conversation begins with Chichi and Seni talking about their journeys at Helium Health and Andela respectively. They both stepped in when each company had a viable product/service, some traction, and funding.\n\nFor Chichi, she was brought in when Helium Health had figured out what it was doing but was uncertain about how to move forward. Her strength lies in figuring out how to build a sustainable company and that\u2019s what she set out to do via a transformation plan.\n\nSeni joined Andela in 2016 when the company was in only two markets \u2013 Nigeria and Kenya. At that time there had been a few leadership exits and the general employee morale was low. His mandate was to stabilize the ship. Which he did before focusing on operational expansion.\n\nHow do you begin the transformation process?\n\nFor Seni, he believes the transformation process should start with the why\u2014 otherwise known as communicating a vision that galvanises everything. At Andela, he had to create a modified version of the vision that was more compelling to the team.\n\nAfter clearly articulating the vision, decide on the steps to take to achieve the vision. This involves setting performance indicators and reviews, so it\u2019s clear what the goals are and whether people are hitting them.\n\nHow does a high achiever culture permeate a company?\n\nBoth Seni and Chichi believe that it starts with hiring people with the potential to be high achievers and then setting a good example as a leader.\n\nGiving people room to execute the tasks they\u2019ve set out to do is also an important factor.\n\n\u201cI make sure that leadership allows people to be creative. Allow people to execute. If you don\u2019t give people the opportunity to succeed, you\u2019ll be stifling them. I motivate people by allowing them to set their goals and fix a timeline to achieve it,\u201d Chichi said.\n\nBuilding cohesiveness within the team\n\nGreat things are rarely ever done by one person. How do we ensure that the team sticks together?\n\nSeni believes the people have to align on the why. This alignment has to start from the top, there has to be a unified strategy at the top level.\n\n\u201cStrategy is a lot more of what you\u2019re saying No to than what you\u2019re saying Yes to,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting an example of when he had to build cohesiveness within a team, he said that during his time at Bristow he noticed that two senior executives weren\u2019t aligned on the company\u2019s direction. One person wanted a high-end airline, while the other person wanted a low-cost airline.\n\nTo resolve this issue, he had to call both of them together to iron out their differences before the company could move forward.\n\nHow do you get teams to keep going without burning out\n\nA common challenge high-performance teams face is that they experience burnout due to the intense and fast-paced nature of work.\n\nSeni responded to this question by stating that he thinks that the issue with the pandemic and people experiencing burnout is that a lot of people were thrown into remote work without warning.\n\nThe solution to this is to encourage people to take time off work since the line between work and rest can be blurry. As a leader, you have to practice what you preach.\n\nIn order to encourage people to take some time off work, he often schedules his emails sent in the middle of the night to go out by the next morning to avoid creating unnecessary work or a sense of urgency.\n\nAnother activity that helps is social gatherings, it\u2019s important for companies to have occasional fun hours. One-on-one sessions are also helpful. These are open-ended meetings with employees, where the manager finds out how they\u2019re doing as human beings and what\u2019s going on in their lives.\n\nHe ends with a caveat \u2013 it\u2019s a little difficult to build a high-performing team without working really hard.\n\n\u201cYou cannot work 80 hours a week every week, you\u2019ll burn. You also can\u2019t work 40 hours every week and materially change the world.\u201d\n\nYou have to be thoughtful and deliberate in getting work done.\n\nChichi adds that she believes companies also need to do two things.\n\nThey have to be deliberate with capacity planning. If you\u2019re growing as a company, you can\u2019t expect to have the same set of people working at the same level while the company is expanding. You need to hire more people or adjust people\u2019s roles.\n\nBe open about flex working. The output is the most important thing, let people work in ways that work for them.\n\nAt what point should a company hire an operations lead?\n\nChichi\u2019s response to this question is that the first thing to do is to have a thought process to manage operations but as soon as you have funds for it, please hire.\n\nWatch the full conversation here",

          "title": "Stax wants you to enjoy USSD with better design, without ever dialling codes again",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nMost people who started using mobile phones in the 2000s became familiar with USSD through loading and checking airtime balance. With time, mobile banking became a major use case; again for airtime transactions, but also for buying internet data, sending money and paying bills.\n\nUnlike mobile apps that need to be downloaded and installed, USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, if you insist) is lightweight and straightforward to use.\n\nDial the code for the desired service, follow the instructions e.g. \u201cpress 1 to Check Balance\u201d on each page and, provided there isn\u2019t some \u201cconnection failure\u201d or \u201centry error\u201d, your wishes will come true.\n\nA misconception is that USSD is for people who use basic phones but the feature has become mainstream even among smartphone users in Africa. A study of smartphone users in Bangladesh, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa showed that 87% of all financial-related transactions were conducted via USSD, with only 13% via mobile app.\n\nSo, USSD works well. But it still has its fair share of frustrating glitches that you normally wouldn\u2019t encounter on an app. For one, you need to memorise the code for each service you want to access. You could minimise an app to get information from, say, your notes app. But you mostly can\u2019t minimise a USSD session once it\u2019s started.\n\nUSSD\u2019s original design did not foresee \u201chow the introduction of smartphones would bridge the worlds of computing and telecommunications to form an entirely new industry,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi explains.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say we should throw it away. On the contrary, some companies recognise that USSD is here to stay in Africa. As such, they are merging the best of both worlds: stacking the visual appeal and interactivity of smartphones on top of USSD\u2019s simple and efficient backend.\n\nOne such company is Hover, a US-based company, and their solution is called Stax.\n\nMaking USSD smart\n\nStax is a mobile app currently available only to Android users in 10 countries, including Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. It has three use cases: buy airtime, send money, and request money. All without ever dialling any USSD code.\n\nStax\u2019s main promise is that users never have to dial a code again\u2026 while enjoying USSD.\n\nIt\u2019s not a digital wallet or account, so it doesn\u2019t ask for an email address or phone number. But \u2013 and this is an important but \u2013 Stax needs certain phone permissions.\n\nWhat permissions? Three precisely: to make and manage phone calls; send and view messages; and access your contacts.\n\nWith those enabled, you can input how much airtime you want to buy, choose the bank or fintech-powered account you want to debit and input the phone number to credit or select from your phonebook.\n\nIt would be great if this is where it ends but \u2013 somewhat unfortunately \u2013 Stax asks for two other permissions to complete this task of buying airtime. Permission to display on top of other apps on your phone and another to connect with mobile money and telecom services on your behalf.\n\nThis gave me pause and maybe it is because of the copy: \u201cAllow Stax to have full control of your device?\u201d\n\nThree paragraphs beneath that question describe why the permission is needed. But all the bad news I have absorbed about privacy risks over the past four years flashed before my eyes, discouraging me from clicking \u201cAllow.\u201d\n\nJess Shorland, co-founder of Hover, agrees that some work needs to be done to make users more comfortable with the permissions. But she has an explanation for why they are necessary:\n\n\u201cIt allows us to automate the USSD session on behalf of the user. We\u2019ve basically built a different interface for USSD. The user interacts with that interface in a way that is a lot more screen-reader friendly.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one big permission request\n\nIn other words, the accessibility permission is what enables Stax to do these things on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\nWhen a user gives Stax access, the app activates a screen reading functionality and acts as a web browser. USSD is still happening in the background but instead of presenting those USSD screens, Stax\u2019s SDK reads the USSD dialog, runs the functions and shows the user a familiar app interface.\n\nBut what are the risks? Because there is no way to convince a user that giving up control doesn\u2019t somehow make them a little vulnerable. Shorland says Stax only takes the information needed to enable the user complete their transaction.\n\n\u201cEverything happens client side, not on our servers. It\u2019s also what enables us to be offline,\u201d she says, emphasizing that the app is open-source as a sign of transparency.\n\nWho in Africa needs Stax?\n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of cool that Stax, a fintech app, works offline like regular USSD. But with the internet being more central to the digital and financial services space today, why should we cheer for Stax?\n\nHover CEO and co-founder Ben Lyon says they are \u201cbuilding for the world as it is today so that we can bridge it to where it ought to go.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, there were 159 million monthly active mobile money accounts in Africa, according to the GSM Association. Africa represents more than half of the global mobile money usage.\n\nLyon thinks such numbers and smartphone usage \u2013 expected to double to 678 million by the end of 2025 \u2013 will make USSD even more mainstream. \u201cIt is a standard view of the tech industry that USSD is a bygone thing. It is actually just categorically wrong.\u201d\n\nIf that view is wrong as he insists and if USSD\u2019s user experience needs to be modernised for the smartphone age, then solutions like Stax would seem right on time.\n\nStax wants the app to be under 10MB so that it will work easily on every (Android) phone. Average transaction time is supposed to be 12 seconds.\n\nMy airtime purchase this morning took a bit longer. It showed a transaction failure message at the end and my bank debited me two seconds later. But I got the airtime.\n\nStax is\u2026 a work in progress\n\nAs of today, Stax currently supports transactions for eight banks (Access, First, Guaranty, Keystone, Sterling, UBA, Wema, Zenith), OPay and Paga.\n\nBeing in the USSD business in Nigeria means getting into the CBN (banks) vs NCC (telcos) scuffle around who pays for USSD services. What does Hover think about this debate?\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that USSD is about accessibility and inclusion, I believe strongly that consumers should not pay to access the channel,\u201d Lyon says.\n\n\u201cI hope NCC and other players come around to this view that consumers should not pay.\u201d\n\nOutside of that and other potential headaches, Stax\u2019s focus will be on convincing individuals and businesses that the app is reliable for all seasons and geographies, regardless of internet connection, says Peace Itimi, who leads growth for the product.\n\n\u201cWe are not monetizing Stax yet and it\u2019s not on the near term roadmap to monetize it,\u201d Lyon says. \u201cThere is a WhatsApp sized opportunity here and our first priority is to make sure we can seize the opportunity at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBen also name-drops WeChat as a possible inspiration for monetization. With a large user base, Stax could begin enabling discovery and access to third party services, in what could make Stax a super app of sorts.\n\n\u201cWhen people understand what the product can do, they will fall in love with it,\u201d Itimi says.\n\nThat depends: on how they fix those curious accessibility permissions, and if people really feel the need to switch from basic USSD \u2013 which works okay \u2013 to a shinier, app-enabled life.",

          "text": "This might be it!\n\nFinally, a financial app that considers the lifestyle of regular people, the harsh economic situation in the country, and everyday financial challenges that influence how people borrow, save or invest.\n\nCan we pique your interest?\n\nLet\u2019s start with savings. Some of us have been saving from when we were kids and it was cool to have a piggybank. Beyond piggybanks and other traditional ways of saving like Esusu, it has become common to save with banks and almost everyone has a savings account. Some even have up to three. But what value do you get from those savings accounts or the Esusu contribution? How much interest do you earn from them in a month?. Probably nothing. In most cases, you even pay more on annoying charges. The good news is that savings has evolved. It\u2019s no longer enough to just keep money anywhere and call it savings. Financial apps like Branch, PiggyVest and Kuda have shown that your savings can be an investment which allows you to earn actual interest, no matter how small. People hardly have enough to money to meet their financial needs and this clearly influences the service features on majority of these financial apps.\n\nHowever, they all differ in the interest they offer on their platforms. If you\u2019re familiar with all the top ones, a quick research will show you that while several savings and investment apps offer sumptuous interest rates with up to 15% per annum being the highest, Branch sets the pace with 20% interest rate per annum. Branch is also the only financial app so far that offers flexible withdrawals, which means your money doesn\u2019t have to be locked for any minimum duration. Afterall, we save for rainy days, don\u2019t we? So if the rainy day comes you should have access to your money.\n\nAll the things your bank won\u2019t do.\n\nHere are a few more things that sets Branch apart from both your regular banking and other financial apps.\n\nAt your beck and call, for a cost: Trust your bank to be on top of their game when they send you notifications but obviously at a cost. Branch has no such thing as SMS alert fees.\n\nPay, to pay bills: Every month, you pay all sorts of bills like DSTV and PHCN on your regular financial apps and banking apps. But of course, it always comes at a cost \u2013 N100 here, N50 there. Some banks even say this cost is negligible, but everyone knows if you stack up enough N100 notes, you\u2019ll eventually have enough to do something that is not negligible. Again, with Branch, this service is free!\n\nTransfer fees: How many transfers have you made in the last month alone? How many did you make last year? If you add up all the charges you pay for making transfers in a month, you can at least buy airtime or data with it. If you add up all the cost for a year, who knows what you can buy with it. The point is, in the end, all these costs and charges add up to something. So if you can make unlimited transfers for free, why would you rather pay for it? Branch doesn\u2019t think you should pay for it though.\n\nAnybody home? \u2013 Customer service with most banks would leave a sour taste in your mouth. They will put you hold. They will tell you the problem can\u2019t be solved remotely and you should go to a branch near you. When you get to the bank branch, you\u2019ll be in a queue, then you\u2019ll fill forms. Finally, they\u2019ll tell you to go wait at home that it will be done in a few days. That doesn\u2019t happen with Branch. Branch customer service team is available 24/7 and all problems are resolved in-app.\n\nBonus programs: Most financial apps have some form of bonus program but none of them is like Branch. Branch has a second-generation referral system that makes referrals a win-win for all parties. Whereas other financial apps pay one-time bonuses for referrals, Branch pays you N500 when friends you refer pay up their first loan. The friends you invited also earn N500. In addition, you earn N50 for every deposit of N300 and above. How cool is that?\n\nThe money part: Branch gives you up to N500,000 in loans within seconds of applying on the app. No collateral or paperwork required. Start with small loan amounts and get higher amounts the more you repay.\n\nClearly, Branch offers you more flexibility and a lot more profit than other financial apps. So if you\u2019ve been suffering from poor financial services, it\u2019s time to make a switch. Branch can be downloaded on the Google Play Store",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nBitnob is a Nigerian startup that lets users buy, save and invest in bitcoin. Users can access these features and much more through the mobile app that\u2019s available for Android iOS.\n\nBitnob offers a ton of other options, like loans, Dollar-Cost-Averaging plans, and many much more. At first glance, the Bitnob app feels fantastic, with a simple UI and easy-to-find functions. But how does it handle the functions that truly matter, like buying BTC and saving?\n\nWe\u2019re about to find out.\n\nGetting started with Bitnob\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the onboarding process\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a new account on Bitnob\n\nSetting up your Bitnob app begins with installing it from your app store. When you open it for the first time, you\u2019ll need to create an account. Unlike many other apps, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you just sign up with an email and get on with it.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll need to supply your first name and last name. Your first name will be used to create a username that\u2019s unique to you (more on the username later.)\n\nYou\u2019ll also provide your phone number and receive an OTP for verification. Once that\u2019s clear, you can create a secure password and five-number transaction pin.\n\nI love this part because the app makes you choose something secure and up to 8 characters. Once you have all this dialed-in, you can get to the fun part.\n\nDepositing money on Bitnob\n\nAs an app for savings and investment, I expected Bitnob\u2019s deposit system to be as simple as inputting debit card information. Unfortunately, I was wrong.\n\nIf you remember, the topic has been complicated in Nigeria since the CBN has ordered banks to close accounts of crypto traders back in February. To protect its users, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you buy BTC straight from your bank account.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll first buy a recharge voucher from Ovarr. One thing I love is that the cards are sold in bundles ranging from $10 to $500. This way, users can buy within their financial limits.\n\nTo buy the voucher, you have to fill in your user information and then pay using a debit card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter buying the voucher, you\u2019ll get a pin that you can paste into Bitnob to activate your purchase.\n\nSo while the process is slightly longer than I expected, it works all the same.\n\nWithdrawals on Bitnob\n\nWithdrawals aren\u2019t quite as tedious, and you can complete them in a few short steps.\n\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need to select \u2018withdraw\u2019 in the plan of your choice. You can withdraw to a BTC wallet or a USD wallet. To get cash in my local bank account, I had to first select a USD wallet and then send the cash to my local account.\n\nYou can send BTC to your blockchain wallet by selecting \u2018send\u2019 and pasting the BTC address in the provided field. You can also use the QR code scanner instead of pasting the BTC address.\n\nSending BTC to another user follows this same procedure. You simply paste their address or scan their Bitnob BTC wallet address.\n\nCustomization options\n\nYou can make changes to your Bitnob account through the \u2018account\u2019 icon. From here, you can change your name and user name, and fill in next of kin details,\n\nYou can also add your bank accounts and mobile money accounts here. I love that you get to choose between the two options.\n\nBitnob Features\n\nNow we get into the staple features of Bitnob\n\nAccessing loans\n\nBitnob offers Nobcredit, which is an awesome way for users to get quick cash while still HODLing their BTC. You can access Nobcredit from the app\u2019s home page, and the process is quite quick.\n\nThe loan amount you get depends on how much BTC you have as collateral. You can then pay back before the tenure expires to reclaim your BTC.\n\nYour interest rate is calculated based on your loan-to-value ratio, or the amount of collateral you have. Average rates are between 16 and 17.2%, and loan tenures range between 3 and 12 months.\n\nI love that you can check your interest rate and collateral volume using the in-app loan calculator. This makes sure that you have all the information you need before moving forward.\n\nPlans\n\nOne of Bitnob\u2019s main features is that you can create a savings plan for your BTC. You can name the plan, choose the amount you want to save in USD, and pick the frequency of savings. The available options are daily, weekly, and monthly.\n\nYou can also select a maximum duration for the lock. WIthdrawing before the maturity date will earn you a 3% penalty. The penalty is one more reason to keep saving.\n\nThe plans work based on the concept of Dollar-Cost-Averaging, which simply allows you to invest large sums over a period. The longer your investment tenure and the more often you make deposits, the bigger your overall portfolio.\n\nUnfortunately, you can only fund your plan with money from your USD wallet, which means you\u2019ll have to buy vouchers that cover your savings amount.\n\nUsers can create as many plans as they need, and adjust the deposit amount, frequency, and maturity date for a bigger payout.\n\nReferrals\n\nBitnob allows you to earn up to $1,000 via referrals alone. And it\u2019s quite easy to get started because you get a referral code immediately when you sign up. You can copy the code right from the home screen.\n\nWhen a new user signs up with your referral code, you get a small USD reward based on how much your referral deposits. I love the referral system because it\u2019s as easy as sending your code to whoever you invite.\n\nSecurity and Support\n\nHow does Bitnob handle security and customer care?\n\nReaching customer care\n\nHave you ever tried to reach customer care only to be kept on hold for an unreasonable amount of time? I loved that Bitnob went a different route by allowing you to live chat with customer care right in the app.\n\nI got a response within 2 minutes (I actually checked) of sending the message which was quite impressive. You can also access the FAQs section from within the app.\n\nSecurity features\n\nIf you have trouble remembering your passwords don\u2019t worry. Bitnob automatically activates fingerprint login for every user with a biometric-enabled device. If you\u2019d rather log in old school, you can turn this feature off in the accounts tab.\n\nOne cool but annoying security feature is that the app logs you out every time your screen goes to sleep. I found this quite irritating because I use the app a lot and I have to log in every few seconds.\n\nBut I also can\u2019t stay mad because it protects my BTC even more. Once my screen turns off, no one can access or even see my funds, which makes me feel good.\n\nOther standard security features also apply. For example, you can\u2019t change passwords unless you provide the old password.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nOverall, the Bitnob app delivers an impressive performance. My only reservation is the convoluted process associated with depositing. However, it\u2019s completely understandable given the current financial laws.\n\nBefore you go, I wanted to tell you one quirky thing I found about the app. It displays these short but interesting messages on the login page and your dashboard, and they really add character to the app. Two of my favourite are \u2018we care about you,\u2019 and \u2018my favorite human, cheer up.\u2019 Be sure to look out for these when you download the app.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "Does the Nigerian government want safety or surveillance with its new IMEI policy?",
          "text": "From July 2021, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) will require Nigerians to submit their IMEI numbers to a Centralised Equipment Identity Register.\n\nIn May 2021, the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy released a Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Registration (PDF) that requires Nigerians to submit their IMEI numbers to a Centralized Equipment Identity Register (CEIR), otherwise known as Device Management System (DMS), which the NCC would manage.\n\nSome of the reasons given for the Ministry\u2019s action include curtailing the counterfeit mobile phone market, discouraging mobile phone theft, enhancing national security, protecting consumer interest, increasing revenue generation for the government, reducing the rate of kidnapping, mitigating the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitating the blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices.\n\nThis move follows the Nigerian government\u2019s previous initiatives for digital identities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecall that in December 2020, the Nigerian government released a statement mandating all Nigerians to obtain their National Identification Number (NIN). Predictably, there was a rush as Nigerians all over the country attempted to get their NIN before the deadline at the end of 2020.\n\nThe directive caused a massive uproar among Nigerians because it was given in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic. Perhaps as a result of that, the deadline was moved to February 2021. Since then, it has been moved thrice, with the new deadline now June 30, 2021.\n\nThe NCC\u2019s IMEI policy will definitely have major implications for the entire nation if implemented.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nThe International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique number used to identify a mobile phone. It is usually found inside the battery compartment of most phones but can also be gotten by dialling *#06#. With an IMEI number, a phone can be tracked, but more than that, it can also be used for identity theft and even cloning a phone.\n\nEver since the news broke, there has been an understandable outcry, with IMEI and Isa Pantami trending on Twitter.\n\nHowever, while the government requires Nigerians to share this data, they do not have to, as your IMEI is part of the data transmitted to your network operator as soon as you make a call, use data, or send a text.\n\nThis information is rarely ever used beyond providing the details that your phone needs to work. However, security operatives can use it in the case of theft or while tracking terrorist activity.\n\nA few countries, including Azerbaijan, India, Cambodia, Chile, Columbia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Thailand, Turkey, and Lebanon, already have some form of this database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf a phone owner possesses their IMEI number, they could provide law enforcement agencies with this information to track these phones if they are stolen.\n\nWhile the reasons given by the government for this new policy appear genuine at first glance, Nigerians are bothered about the possible ways the government can exploit this data.\n\nAn article on The Insider details how the Saudi government uses IMEI numbers to track the location of women who have run away from abusive partners. Most of the doubts expressed regarding the use of this information for surveillance.\n\nIt has not always been used negatively. The ITU reports that implementing this in Great Britain and Turkey resulted in a reduction in mobile phone theft while it increased the number of legally imported mobile devices in Ukraine by 95%, as well as increasing revenues from the import of mobile devices\n\nAccording to a data privacy expert, some of the questions that should be asked include whether there are sufficient safeguards in the absence of a comprehensive data protection law. Also, is the government going to be transparent about its use of this data and what happens in the case of a violation?\n\nOne must remember that with the government mandating Nigerians to link their SIM cards to the NIN, the government already has rich insights into the activities of its citizens. Adding IMEI data to this would mean that they can also get real-time location data on anyone.\n\nWith Nigeria\u2019s poor human rights history, Nigerians may be right to be suspicious about the motives behind this policy.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "Weakest link in cybersecurity chain is people, here\u2019s what SMEs can do\n\nAt the recent Franco Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) virtual conference on cybersecurity and process automation in today\u2019s business environment, experts reveal how small businesses can protect themselves against cybersecurity threats within and outside the business writes ISAAC ANYAOGU.\n\nWith over 3 billion users connected globally, the internet has brought the world together enabling instant communication, remote work, and business facilitation.\n\n\u201cIt is also come embedded with a multitude of vulnerabilities which poses a significant security threat to users and has led to the emergence of a cybersecurity threat,\u201d said Moses Umoru, the director-general of the FNCCI during a recent webinar held May 19.\n\nRead Also: Why cybersecurity lessons are required for Nigerian children\n\nIn Nigeria, it is estimated that the annual financial loss due to cybersecurity breaches was N250billion in 2017, N280 billion in 2018, N288billion in 2019 and 2020, it increased to over N1trillion in damages.\n\nWhat is even more disconcerting is that experts say that 95 percent of security threats are not reported. So if the figures reported are are these huge, it indicates how much threat to businesses, to profits and operations, cybersecurity presents, Umoru said.\n\nIt is getting even more dangerous, as the coronavirus pandemic has shifted many businesses online, with remote working becoming a common trend, it is bringing the threat of malicious intrusion into the networks of businesses closer to home.\n\nThis is why taking control of the human element which constitutes the weakest link in the security chain is vital, analysts at the virtual conference said.\n\nFunmilola Odumuboni, senior manager, risk advisory at Delloite and Touche, in her presentation said cybersecurity encompasses three main things, confidentiality, integrity, and availability, all factors vulnerable to human errors.\n\nConfidentiality implies that customers\u2019 records, phone numbers, account balances, and other sensitive information do not get into the wrong hands.\n\nIntegrity entails an ability to prevent someone from manipulating a customer\u2019s information. It is the correctness of the information a business is processing and relying on to make decisions.\n\nThen availability speaks to systems and processes not failing, being available so as to prevent an outrage because the business cannot render a service. These are the pain points for businesses when cybersecurity is compromised.\n\nThreat landscape\n\nWith many businesses going online, the threat landscape in Nigeria is evolving. COVID-19 has forced many businesses online faster than they normally would. Many struggling to deal with the impact of the virus are making the right investments to protect themselves online making them vulnerable to new threats.\n\n\u201cIf your business needs to grow, you need technology, now we have remote working, remote customers, so you cannot afford to do business without leveraging technology but also the risks increases,\u201d said Odumuboni.\n\nThis has led to the proliferation of bad actors in cyberspace. \u201cSome people go into cyber crimes as a business and they are looking for low hanging fruits like small businesses to attack and there has been a phenomenal increase in attacks on them. Many have shifted to remote work without the facilities to harden their systems,\u201d said Odumuboni.\n\nThe threat landscape includes hacktivists who in the name of a social cause hack into systems of public and private institutions. During the #EndSARS protests in Nigeria last year, some hacktivists hacked into the website of the Nigerian police.\n\nNation-states are investing in cybersecurity both from a defensive and offensive standpoint.\n\nMalicious insiders, according to some experts constitute over 80 percent of attacks. These are people a business has given some level of access through their network and they want to cause harm.\n\nThreats can also come from rogue suppliers and even competitors.\n\nThese bad actors are after sensitive data including corporate information, board reports, financial information, and investor confidential details.\n\nSome cybercriminals also seek to commit financial fraud such as wire transfers and payments. Some seek to disrupt a business or threaten the health and safety of a community.\n\nAccording to Odumuboni, business email compromise has become rife. It is where the attackers take over an email communication between two organisations for financial gain.\n\nOdumuboni explains that in this situation, a company is talking to another on a financial transaction, cybercriminals intercept that communication and change their account detail.\n\nThe parties, oblivious to this intrusion, continue their interaction and when one party pays, they will pay into the attacker\u2019s account instead of paying into the correct organisation\u2019s account.\n\nThis is becoming rampant now because a lot of organisations are using cloud-based systems for their emails and other processes, many on shared cloud service.\n\nTactics\n\nObukohwo Obukonise, senior systems and cybersecurity engineer at Schneider Electric, in his presentation said there are so many hacking tools available online and most do not require a special skill set.\n\nOne common method used in cyber crimes is phishing in which a target or targets are contacted by email, telephone, or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data.\n\nRansomeware is another method that is a type of malicious software that is designed to block access to a computer system until a ransom is paid.\n\nThere are also cloud data breaches that describe incidents that have the potential to disclose sensitive information to an unauthorized party.\n\nAnother common attack is a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack)in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.\n\nIn Zero-day attacks, a computer-software vulnerability unknown to those who should be interested in its mitigation is introduced and until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect programs, data, additional computers, or a network.\n\nMalware, short for malicious software, consists of code developed by cyber attackers, designed to cause extensive damage to data and systems or to gain unauthorized access to a network.\n\nThere has been an exponential increase in the creation of malware. Experts estimate that in the last seven years malware has grown from 470million created in 2015 to over 1.2 trillion on the internet today.\n\nOther forms of attacks include negative social media coverage and impersonation, supply chain attacks, and stolen credentials.\n\nMany companies, even if they have smart cybersecurity systems are still susceptible to attacks due to third-party compromise.\n\nBusinesses have relationships with organisations and share information, sometimes their network is even extended to other organisations because of the kinds of businesses they do and if their partners are not implementing the same security procedures, they could become the weak link.\n\nDevelop a strategy\n\nIn many organisations, cybersecurity threats are issues considered at the board level highlighting how important it has become to the well being of a business.\n\nOdumuboni said that organisations need to have a strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have firewalls, but you need a strategy, based on what my organisation does, this is how I will protect my business.\u201d\n\nShe further recommended that business owners need to be aware of the cybersecurity threat landscape, routinely access their networks for vulnerability, maintain visibility across the system to detect threats before they fester, and develop capabilities to respond quickly to attacks.\n\nAccording to Babatunde Abagun, channel manager, West, East, and Central Africa at \u200eNutanix, said research has shown that defensive capabilities of businesses such as antimalware are being eroded by machine learning and artificial intelligence employed by cybercriminals.\n\nOne organisation in the UK that was recently scammed of over $230,000 in phishing attacks, approved payment based on voice approval from the CEO. It turns out that it was AI software that mimicked the voice of the CEO.\n\nAbagun said businesses should protect their people from themselves. \u201cIf you have a child, you will child-proof the house, similarly you need to security-proof your infrastructure not just for threats available now but for those that will come in the future,\u201d said Abagun.\n\nOne way to do this is to establish technologies that actually automate certain processes. Some concepts like list privilege which means giving every individual the minimum amount of capability they require to perform their job function was highly recommended.\n\nA few years ago, the Twitter account of former US President Donald Trump was briefly deactivated by a disgruntled Twitter staff on his last day on the job. This could be prevented with list privilege.\n\nThe experts also recommend maintaining a zero-trust security process, limiting devices that could be intrusive, effectively training personnel, and writing adequate cybersecurity policies for the business.",

          "text": "The Nigerian economy, which is in dire straits at the moment, is still waiting for the federal government with its intervention in the housing sector as provided for in the economic sustainability plan (ESP) more than 12 months after that plan was inaugurated.\n\nESP is part of the government\u2019s responses to the COVID-19 pandemic aimed to provide stimulus package to businesses and critical sectors. Housing was listed among growth sectors and the strategy was to provide 300,000 housing units yearly.\n\nThe expectation was that the construction of these houses would generate activities in the economy. The strategy envisaged the creation of 1.8 million jobs, starting in 12 months and subsequently creating 1.5 million homes for families across the country.\n\n12 months after, it remains to be seen or heard where these houses, which target low-income earners, are being built. As a result, jobs are not being created, leading to more Nigerians falling into poverty.\n\nAbout 82.9 million Nigerians were in poverty before COVID-19, according to the World Bank. On October 7, 2020, the Bank said that Nigeria, with a poverty rate of 39.1 percent, has the largest poor population (79 million extreme poor) in Sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for 20 percent of the total poor in the region.\n\nRead Also: How Sanwo-Olu is bridging housing deficit in Lagos\n\nThe bank says 10 million Nigerians were forced into poverty as a result of COVID-19, adding that the country\u2019s poor population is set to rise from 82.9 million in 2019 to 90.0 million in 2022 due to natural population growth.\n\nBut with the economic effects of the COVID-19 crisis, the national poverty rate is instead forecast to jump from 40.1 percent in 2019 to 45.2 percent in 2022, implying that 100.9 million Nigerians will be living in poverty by 2022.\n\nThis is an unfortunate and worrisome situation which, in part, would have been solved by the ESP strategy on housing and other growth sectors if it had been followed through as planned.\n\nThe strategy which got a N200 billion lifeline from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is an ambitious one which was why it was hailed by housing sector stakeholders even though the 300,000 housing units, according to them, was like a drop of water in an ocean given a 20-million housing deficit.\n\n\u201cFederal government\u2019s decision to build 300,000 houses across the country and also to spend N2 trillion on rural roads construction is a welcome development that will positively impact the economy in various ways,\u201d Femi Akintunde, GMD, Alpha Mead Group, noted.\n\n\u201cFirst, it is a form of reflationary measure that will stimulate economic output through increased spending in housing and infrastructure development. Such investment will create large-scale employment, increase the stock of housing and the provision of additional road infrastructure will help to improve connectivity and ease our logistics challenges,\u201d he added.\n\nAmong other things, the ESP strategy aims at easing bottlenecks in the delivery of social housing and delivering affordable homes through direct government interventions in housing construction.\n\nIt involves working with state governments to identify land for housing construction in all Local Government Areas and targets 100 percent local input for the construction of 400 homes in each Local Government Area.\n\nThe project elements include standardising the design of homes for cost management and industrialisation of the construction process, identifying and selecting delivery partners formed by groups of professionals and artisanal builders as primary delivery channels as well as creating a \u2018homes warehouse\u2019 to buy completed homes from delivery partners, in the absence of ready off-takers.\n\nSimilarly, there were also plans for encouraging private sector involvement and facilitating maturity of the mortgage market that will cater to the needs of middle-class Nigerians while government addresses the needs of low-income earners and the poor.\n\nAll these underpin the concerns raised so far by housing industry stakeholders on the government\u2019s delay and/or slow take-off of the intervention scheme.\n\nAnalyst\u2019s views on possible causes of this delay are varied. While an economist who did not want to be named explained to BusinessDay that government did not have the needed money to build the projected houses, Akintunde blames structural dislocations in the housing sector financing structure.\n\nVictor Onukwugha, President, Association of Housing Corporations of Nigeria (AHCN), was quoted recently as commending the inclusion of the housing sector in the ESP but faulted the actual execution strategies of the project elements which, he noted, were vague without a clear cut plan and roles for executions.\n\n\u201cIt is a year now that the plan was rolled out and from what we can all see, not much has been achieved in easing bottlenecks in the delivery of social housing aside from the purported release of N200 billion by Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for the project. The second track, which proposes to deliver affordable homes through direct government intervention is still hanging,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) senator representing Cross River South District, Gershom Bassey, has said he would not defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC) after the governor of his state, Ben Ayade\u2019s defection to the ruling party.\n\n\u201cI am not moving to APC, I am a founding member of the PDP, I will continue to remain in PDP,\u201d Mr Bassey told PREMIUM TIMES on Thursday shortly after Mr Ayade publicly dumbed the platform that brought him to power in 2015.\n\nMr Bassey, who said the governor\u2019s defection did not come as a surprise \u201cbecause it\u2019s been a long time coming\u201d, said the Cross River State Caucus in the National Assembly which he chairs would issue a statement soon on the development.\n\nThe senator said the PDP was beyond the control of any particular person.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the PDP is a very unique party, it belongs to everybody. It doesn\u2019t belong to one person. And that is the nature of the PDP right from inception.\n\n\u201cSo when you have a situation where one person may want to own the party, he may run into problems. The PDP does not belong to anybody, it belongs to the men and women of Nigeria. It\u2019s a national party,\u201d he said.\n\nThe senator said Cross River was \u201cfully PDP\u201d despite Mr Ayade\u2019s defection.\n\nMeanwhile, a political ally of Mr Ayade, Stephen Odey, who was spotted at the brief defection ceremony, said on Thursday that he remained a member of the PDP.\n\nMr Odey, a former Chairman of the Cross River State Universal Education Board, was quoted by an online newspaper, CrossRiverWatch, as saying, \u201cI did not defect, I was only there because he (Ayade) is my boss so I have to attend, I did not defect\u201d.\n\nMr. Odey had served as Mr Ayade\u2019s aide when the latter was a senator.\n\nPDP sacks caretaker committee in the state\n\nThe PDP, in apparent reaction to Mr Ayade\u2019s defection, has announced the dissolution of the party\u2019s caretaker committee in Cross River State.\n\nThe national spokesperson of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan who disclosed this in a statement in Abuja on Friday said the dissolution has been approved by the National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP.\n\nThe caretaker committee is now headed by Efiok Cobham.\n\nThe new secretary and spokesperson for the PDP in the state are Eko Atu and Rita Ayim respectively, Mr Ologbondiyan said in the statement.\n\nOther members of the caretaker committee are Attah Ochinke, Uke Enun, Walter Mboto, Mike Usibe, Christopher Ekpo, Victor Effiom Okon and Prince K.J. Agba.\n\nThe party structure at the local government and ward levels, however, remained unchanged, Mr Ologbondiyan said.\n\nWith his defection, Mr Ayade becomes the only APC governor from the South-South geopolitical zone.\n\nThe ruling party had lost its only governor in the zone last year when Godwin Obaseki of Edo crossed to the PDP months to the governorship election in that state. He won reelection on that platform.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith Mr Ayade in the kitty, the APC now has 21 governors, the PDP 14 and the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) one.\n\nMr Ayade\u2019s defection came six months after his Ebonyi State counterpart, David Umahi, also left the PDP.\n\nMr Umahi left the PDP last November citing \u201cinjustice\u201d meted out to the South-east by the party as the reason for his departure.",

We see that has greatly subsided and students are more focused on their academic activities and I think that is very impressive.\n\n\u201cThat is what will explain for the higher level of interest that is displayed by the number of students that are seeking admission, because nobody will want his or her children in a university where there is a high rate of cultism and bad behaviour.\n\n\u201cSo, I will like to congratulate the Governing Council on your particular achievement of curbing the rate of insecurity which is one challenge that we are now currently dealing with along the length and breadth of not just this state, but the country at large,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nAbiodun who disclosed that his administration has acquired buses for the smooth transportation of students on campuses, added that the buses would soon be handed over to the institutions as soon as issues on the management of the buses are sorted out with respective institutions.\n\nWhile appreciating the Governing Council for the changes it has made in the curricular of the institution, the governor also commended the Council members for what they were able to achieve in terms of students\u2019 welfare.\n\n\u201cI want to appreciate some of the changes that you\u2019ve made in curricular; you have mentioned that you have introduced Nursing, Music and Linguistics and that it is doing very well.

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nLeader of apex Yoruba sociopolitical organisation, Afenifere, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, has expressed concern over what he called undemocratic and reckless shoot-on-sight order against agitators in the Southeast zone of the country by the Acting Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba Alkali, noting that it\u2019s an indication that people of the zone are no longer safe.\n\nThe Acting IGP had on Tuesday last week, declared war on pro Biafra agitators and gunmen attacking and destroying police infrastructure in the Southeast and South-South regions and ordered their complete extermination.\n\nThe police boss who spoke on the sideline while addressing the Police Mobile Force and Special Tactical Squad of the Force in Enugu shortly after he launched Operation Restore Peace, directed policemen in the region not to adhere to the rules of engagement while dealing with Biafra secessionist groups, adding that his job was to protect them.\n\nHe went ahead to threaten police officers who fail to carry out his orders and gets killed in the process.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind the media shout; do the job I command you. If anyone accuses you of human rights violation, the report will come to my table and you know what I will do. So, take the battle to them wherever they are and kill them all. Don\u2019t wait for an order,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat another order are you waiting for when Mr. President had ordered you to shoot anybody carrying AK-47 rifle? Quote me, even a dead policeman can be tried and dismissed from the force and his family will not get his benefits.\n\n\u201cSo, don\u2019t seat and wait for them to come; take attack to them and don\u2019t lose your arms to criminals.\u201d\n\nHowever, condemning the order, Adebanjo pointed out that the move is a further escalation of President Muhammadu Buhari government\u2019s hostility towards the Southeast since he took power in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe rising hostility against the South-East Zone since the beginning of the Buhari administration has now become a matter of great concern to Afenifere, as this reality should also become a major concern to other stakeholders in the Nigerian project,\u201d Adebanjo said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe Afenifere leader, who decried the situation where two sets of laws exist in the country; a set of laws where the Fulani go scot free and another, that the lives of others, especially that of the Igbo, do not matter.\n\n\u201cTaking a look at the Security Council, no Igbo man is a member of Buhari\u2019s security architecture. Is that how to run a multi-ethnic multi-religious country like Nigeria?\u201d he queried.\n\n\u201cOne will assume that Nigeria is now a theatre of bloodshed as the streets are now lined with the blood of innocent Nigerians. With this draconian order, no opposition member is safe.\n\nHe said that if the President had no hidden agenda, there were more civilised and democratic ways to beef up security in the South East.\n\nHe urged other leaders in the zones to condemn the shoot-on-sight order to prevent another looming massacre in the South-East zone, saying: \u201cTo prevent yet another looming massacre in the South-East Zone, leaders in other zones should condemn the shoot-on-sight order. The President must be told that if he is sincere about peace and unity of this country, the order should be revoked forthwith. Certainly, if the President has no hidden agenda, there are more civilised and democratic ways to beef up security in the South-East.\u201d",

The risk of death and injury reduces considerably when speeds are lowered.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, people have devised a means to work from home which has decreased their mobility; however the fatality numbers still remain as people still drive at higher speeds.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThese calls for an urgent action to ensure people enjoy a safe road travel as well as have a healthy and green city.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason that GreenLight Initiative is calling on road management agencies such as the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) to enact and implement a 30km speed limit policy in high risks areas such as school zones, streets, and market corridors.\n\n\u201cThe theme for the 6th UN Global Road Safety Week is Street for Life \u2013 \u201cLove30\u201d.The Week is designed to advocate for 30km speed reduction as well as strengthen the efforts to secure political involvement, commitment and policy change for low-speed and liveable communities where people walk, play and live.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a call for an urgent action on the speeds on our streets, worldwide. This call for action is urgent because it saves lives. It promotes healthy lifestyle as it helps reduce carbon emission. It is also urgent for the sake of children and youths as research over the years have shown that they are the most vulnerable to road traffic crashes.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cIt is also pertinent to note that the World Health Organization (WHO) document on managing speed in line with the Stockholm Declaration and the Global Plan for the new Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021-2030 suggests five actions to be carried out to ensure a safe and liveable street for people worldwide.\n\n\u201cThese includes establishing speed limits appropriate to the function of each road, enforcing speed limits, building or modifying roads to include features that calm traffic, Installation of in-vehicle technologies and raising awareness about the dangers of speeding.\n\n\u201cTo mark this year\u2019s 6th UN Global Road Safety Week 2021 in Nigeria, GreenLight Initiative has partnered different organization to implement advocacy campaign programs.\u201d\n\nHe added the programmes seek to highlight the benefits of low-speed streets in urban areas as well as call on policy-makers to limit speeds to 30 km/h on streets where pedestrians, cyclists and others vulnerable road users mix with traffic.\n\n\u201cThe program further strives to support the attainment of the second Decade of Action 2021-2030 and the Global Road Safety agenda.\n\n\u201cGreenLight Initiative (GLI) is a non-profit that strives to improve transportation safety and sustainable development. GreenLight Initiative (GLI) is keen on saving lives through prevention of violent deaths and injury.\n\n\u201cThe organisation employs evidence-based interventions and advocacy campaigns to reduce death rates and injuries on the roads,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Human rights lawyer, Femi Falana, SAN, says governors in the country lack the powers to fix petroleum prices.\n\nHe stated this on Friday evening while featuring on a PUNCH Live interview programme.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that a committee set up by the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum led by Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, recommended a petrol price of between N408.5 per litre and N380 per litre. It also called for immediate removal of fuel subsidy.\n\nThe proposed price which is over 200 per cent of the current pump price of petrol had been greeted with outrage as Nigerians took to the social media to reject it while they also lamented the hardship in the country.\n\nSpeaking on the issue on The PUNCH programme, Falana said, \u201cWith profound respect, the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum as an entity, Nigerian governors in their individual capacities lack the powers to interfere in the fixing of the prices of petroleum products.\n\n\u201cSection 6 of the Petroleum Act which has not been amended provides that the Minister of Petroleum Resources shall fix the prices of petroleum in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo, when you are told that the PPPRA , DPR, NNPC or Governors\u2019 Forum or market forces are fixing the prices of petroleum products, they have abandoned the law.\n\n\u201cWe have a situation where President (Muhammadu) Buhari has made himself the Minister of Petroleum Resources, illegally though. As usual, he doesn\u2019t want to take responsibility for punishing the Nigerian people. So, he steps back and allow all manners of forces to fix petroleum products.\u201d Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

We saw a lot of promises in the first half\u2026 The second half we lost it when we started noticing a lot of tiredness. They started playing out of shape and exposed exposed themselves a lot.\n\n\u201cWe have to let them (the players) know that it\u2019s not over yet. We have to play and score and not concede; if we can do that we have a hope. A situation where we can score one or two goals, that brings hope and we have to work on their pysche\u201d, Osho said.\n\nGoals by Ramadan Sobhy and Ibrahim Adel came gift-wrapped from hesitant and careless defenders as 2020 runners-up Pyramids established a 4-1 quarter-final first-leg advantage.\n\nEnyimba have won all four home matches in the Confederation Cup, but each victory has been by a one-goal margin with the team from southeastern city Aba averaging only 1.5 goals per match.\n\nCaptain Augustine Oladapo, Victor Mbaoma and Cyril Olisema have claimed seven of the eight goals Enyimba notched in the African equivalent of the UEFA Europa League, so much will hinge on their performances.\n\nPyramids have their sights on the semi-finals and a probable meeting with Raja, who beat the expensively assembled Cairo club twice in the group stage.\n\nThe other quarter final ties are as follows:\n\nRaja v Pirates\n\nRaja take a perfect four-victory home record this season into a clash of former CAF Champions League winners against famed Soweto club Orlando Pirates.\n\nAlthough the odds have tilted toward a Moroccan victory after they forced a 1-1 draw in South Africa, Pirates\u2019 coach Josef Zinnbauer is upbeat despite his side failing to score in their last three away games.\n\n\u201cWe respect Raja because they are one of the most successful clubs in Africa, but we travelled to Casablanca without fear. Ben Malango is a dangerous forward and needs to be constantly policed.\u201d\n\nJaraaf v Coton\n\nJaraaf and Coton, who take a 1-0 lead to Thies near Dakar, represent countries desperate for African club glory.\n\nNo Senegalese club has lifted a African trophy with Jeanne d\u2019Arc coming closest by reaching the 1998 final of the now-defunct CAF Cup.\n\nCameroon last celebrated success 40 years ago when Union Douala lifted the African Cup Winners Cup, another competition that was discontinued after the 2003 final.\n\nKabylie v Sfaxien\n\nThis north African showdown has taken a surprise turn with Kabylie building a 1-0 advantage in Tunisia over record three-time Confederation Cup title-holders Sfaxien.\n\nThe first meeting was a tale of two penalties with leading Sfaxien scorer Firas Chaouat missing and Kabylie captain Redha Bensayah converting.\n\nKabylie boast an unbeaten home record in Africa this season, winning four matches and drawing one, and are expected to progress given they need only draw to do so",

          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Friday gave a hint on how the country can get out of its current insecurity challenges.\n\nAccording to him, for the country to get out of all the challenges of insecurity including, banditry, Boko Haram, kidnapping among other crimes and criminalities, a long gestation period of training and educating all Nigerian children must be established .\n\nAlthough he did not give how long or short the gestation period should be, Obasanjo underlined that all Nigerian students irrespective of language, region, tribe or creed must get quality education.\n\nHe made the statement while giving a remark at the commissioning of the Professor Abayomi Oluwatosin Jiboku Building and Entrepreneur Centre at Lariken International College, Ologuneru, Ibadan.\n\nThe former president who retained that there must not be any alternative for quality education as a cure-all also harped on the place of not allowing our culture and values to be deteriorated by other preferences.\n\nObasanjo said \u201cLet me now talk about education. If we are going to get out of the morales of insecurity, banditry, Boko Haram, kidnapping and other criminalities, we will have a long gestation period of training and educating all Nigerian children.\n\n\u201cAnd I underlined, all Nigerian children. Education is the beginning of a life well-lived.\n\n\u201cGod has given each and every one of us the innate ability. It is when those innate abilities are developed that you can be of best in your own self-service, in the service of our nuclear and extended family, in the service of our community and in the service of our nation and the world.\n\n\u201cEducation, and there is no substitute for education. If you don\u2019t give it, then those you should have given it to don\u2019t have it and if they don\u2019t have it, then you don\u2019t get the best out of them and whatever you get out of them, if you start to complain, you will have yourself to blame. Education and quality education is important.\u201d\n\nHe stressed further \u201cThe second thing that I will want to mention is culture. I define culture as the totality of the way of living of a particular people. Our food, our hair, make-up, fashion, dance, songs and even the way we carry our marriage and even our burials are all our culture from cradle to grave.\n\n\u201cWhat makes us different as a people is that totality of our ways of life. Yes, I do agree that culture is dynamic and of course if there is any part of our culture that must be removed, yes, we may have to remove it, but don\u2019t let us forget our culture.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let us have our culture to be overtaken by cultures that are not ours.\n\n\u201cAlso, I want to tell us about values. One of the ways where we have problems in our society today is the worth or the value that we cherish.\n\n\u201cToday, money-making is something else. In Yoruba land, money-making is not one of our values but the Omoluabi ethos; truthfulness, integrity, truth, industry and hard work- where are all those now? Where have they gone? Why have we put them aside and all we are striving for is money?\n\nDirector, Lariken International College, Mr Idowu Jiboku, in his opening remarks, stated that education today has changed a lot and it will continue to change depending on societall need saying \u201cIn today\u2019s world, education has gone beyond memorization of facts and figures only.\n\n\u201cIt now includes the teaching of life skills that can promote innovation reasoning and turn students into entrepreneurs and problem solvers.\n\n\u201cSequel to the introduction of trade/entrepreneurship subjects by the federal government, we decided in 2017 to have an entrepreneurship centre that will teach these skills in the most immersive and practical way.\u201d\n\nHe said, catering and confectionaries, cosmetology, robotics and artificial intelligence, fashion designing, leather works, graphics and web-designing, interior decoration, photography and cinematography are some of the courses that will be taught in the commissioned centre.\n\nHe added that the inauguration of the facility is part of the effort of Lariken International College to play a part by explaining what complete education is in Oyo State.\n\nMr Olasunkanmi Olaleye, Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology,in his remark praised the institution and charged them to put the facility to good use.",
          "summary": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Friday gave a hint on how the country can get out of its current insecurity challenges.\nAlthough he did not give how long or short the gestation period should be, Obasanjo underlined that all Nigerian students irrespective of language, region, tribe or creed must get quality education.\nObasanjo said \u201cLet me now talk about education.\nEducation and quality education is important.\u201dHe stressed further \u201cThe second thing that I will want to mention is culture.\n\u201cIt now includes the teaching of life skills that can promote innovation reasoning and turn students into entrepreneurs and problem solvers.",

          "text": "Pro-democracy group, Coalition For Defence Of Democracy In Nigeria, CDDN, has called for caution over the southern governor\u2019s resolution on open grazing and the statement of the attorneys-general of the federation and minister of justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN).\n\nAccording to the group, the AGF is the chief law officer of the country and must have spoken strictly on the lawfulness of cattle rearing in the country.\n\nThe AGF had in an interview on Channels Television compared cattle rearing in the southern part of the country to spare parts business in the north.\n\nHe spoke following the ban of open graze ng by southern governors after a meeting in Asaba.\n\nChief Isaac Ikpa, National Convener, CDDN, at a press conference in Abuja, said it is illogical to act in that regard and urged the governors to revisit their stand in the overall interest of unity and peaceful coexistence among all Nigerians.\n\nChief Ikpa said, \u201dWe therefore, as a Coalition seek to make the following clarifications on the interview because we noticed from the comments since the interview was granted that so many Nigerians misconstrued the point the AGF was trying to drive home by comparing cattle business with spare parts traders in the north.\n\n\u201dThe context of the use of \u201cspare parts\u201d is about freedom of movement of goods and ownership. Does it not violate the respective rights of the Fulani and Ibo people if you restrict their rights to movement of their possessed goods that are not legally outlawed?\n\n\u201dFulanis own cattle which they move around in possessive sense. Spare part dealers move spare parts in ownership and possessive sense. We submit that it is the encroachment of the right of others that has ever been punishable and not the act of lawful grazing. Identifying encroachment with an ethnic toga is dangerous and mischievous and it has ever been. A spare parts dealer that encroaches into other peoples land to store his wares has committed an act of trespass not because he is an Igbo man but because of his unlawful act.\n\n\u201dAs AGF, his role is to set out the law in precise terms and if we must understand, he is not the one that made these laws because it is not his duty to do so.\n\n\u201dWe also make bold to say that the Southern Governors\u2019 declaration is a blanket statement lacking in precision and legally wrong. The statement of the AGF in the interview was aimed at showing this.\n\n\u201dWe believe the AGF spoke strictly on the lawfulness of cattle rearing. Based on our laws, every lawful business is free and guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution. We are not also unmindful of the fact that in the course of doing business an act of criminality may occur and if that happens, it can be dealt with according to the extant law. We believe it is wrong from for the Southern Governors to throw a blanket ban because criminals have infiltrated a business. It is illogical to act in that regard and we urge the Governors to revisit their stand in the overall interest of unity and peaceful coexistence among all Nigerians.\n\n\u201dAt this stage of our national life when tackling insecurity is at the front burner of governance, the Governors should not distract citizens with the issue of open grazing. They should rather focus their energy on granting autonomy to States Legislature, Judiciary and Local Governments . By this we mean that the Governors should immediately implement the provisions of Executive Order 10 as signed by President Muhammadu Buhari. They should respect the democratic principles of independence of State Legislature and Judiciary in line with Section 121 (3) of the Constitution. Nigerians seek nothing less. The divisionary and diversionary techniques should be over.\n\n\u201dWe believe the AGF spoke strictly on the lawfulness of cattle rearing. Based on our laws, every lawful business is free and guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution. We are not also unmindful of the fact that in the course of doing business an act of criminality may occur and if that happens, it can be dealt with according to the extant law. We believe it is wrong from for the Southern Governors to throw a blanket ban because criminals have infiltrated a business. It is illogical to act in that regard and we urge the Governors to revisit their stand in the overall interest of unity and peaceful coexistence among all Nigerians.\u201d",

          "text": "An emotional Luis Suarez has said he was \u201cunderestimated\u201d by Barcelona after winning La Liga with Atletico Madrid.\n\nSuarez \u2014 who was allowed to leave Camp Nou eight months ago \u2014 scored the winning goal on Saturday as Atletico pulled off a 2-1 comeback victory away at Real Valladolid to clinch the league title on the final day of the season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of things. It was difficult, the situation I had to go through,\u201d a visibly tearful Suarez told Movistar.\n\n\u201cAt the start of the season, with the way I was underestimated\u2026 Atletico Madrid opened the door for me, to keep showing that I\u2019m still valid. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll always be grateful to this great club for trusting in me.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have suffered with me. My wife, my kids, they\u2019re with me day-to-day. I\u2019ve been in football for many years and this is the year they\u2019ve suffered the most.\u201d\n\nSuarez, 34, scored 21 league goals this season for Atletico, firing them to their first title in seven years after being deemed surplus to requirements by Barca last summer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve shown again that Atletico had a great year, despite the difficulties we had at some stages of the season,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown we were the best team, the most consistent, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re champions.\u201d\n\nAtletico had led the La Liga table since December, but a dip in form saw the title race go to the final weekend when the 2-1 win at Valladolid saw them finish two points clear of rivals Real Madrid and seven points ahead of Barcelona.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s special, because of everything I had to suffer,\u201d Suarez said, when asked how this title compared to the four he won with Barca.\n\n\u201cMy statistics are there. Five out of seven league titles. That is Luis Suarez.\u201d\n\nCoach Diego Simeone had backed the Uruguay international to make the difference this week, saying they were entering the Suarez zone.\n\n\u201cThe Suarez Zone, man\u2026 I said it two days ago,\u201d Simeone said on Saturday. \u201cMaybe I was lucky, but it\u2019s Suarez. Suarez. The name speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nSuarez had been pictured having lunch with former Barca teammate and close friend Lionel Messi in Madrid earlier this week.\n\n\u201c[Messi] will be happy, we\u2019re friends, that\u2019s the most important thing,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cHe wished me luck.\u201d",

          "text": "Atletico Madrid pipped city rivals Real Madrid to the La Liga title on Saturday after Luis Suarez fired them to a 2-1 comeback win at Real Valladolid.\n\nValladolid took a shock lead in the 18th minute when Oscar Plano slotted past Jan Oblak to complete a sweeping counter-attack after Yannick Carrasco had lost control of the ball following an Atletico corner.\n\nJust as they had done in last week\u2019s comeback win over Osasuna, Atletico missed a series of clear opportunities but they drew level after a moment of magic from Angel Correa, who danced his way through the defence before arrowing into the bottom corner in the 57th minute.\n\nSuarez then pounced on a giveaway by the Valladolid defence to score in the 67th and put Atletico on their way to a victory that would secure the title no matter what happened in Real Madrid\u2019s game at home to Villarreal.\n\nValladolid missed a couple of glaring opportunities down the other end while Geoffrey Kondogbia wasted a chance that would have given Atletico a more relaxing finish when he blasted into the side-netting.\n\nReal Madrid ended up fighting their way back from a goal down to beat Villarreal 2-1 which meant they would have swiped the title from Atletico\u2019s hands if Valladolid had equalised thanks to a better head-to-head record.\n\nHowever, Diego Simeone\u2019s side saw out the victory and wildly celebrated on the pitch.\n\n\u201cAtletico have had an incredible season despite all the difficulties we\u2019ve had. We\u2019ve been the most consistent team and we are champions,\u201d said Suarez.\n\nAtletico finished top of the standings on 86 points while Real, who snatched a late 2-1 win over Villarreal, came second on 84. Valladolid finished 19th and were relegated to Spain\u2019s second division.\n\nHundreds of fans celebrated in central Madrid after the match, while the police drafted in extra officers and drones to monitor the situation.",

          "text": "A Palestinian official says an initial assessment shows at least 2,000 housing units were destroyed in the fighting between Israel and Palestinian militant groups in Gaza.\n\nNaji Sarhan, deputy of Gaza\u2019s works and housing ministry, said on Saturday that more than 15,000 other units were partly destroyed in the 11-day war.\n\nIsrael launched hundreds of airstrikes on the overcrowded strip, targeting residential, commercial and government buildings. It said it was going after locations where Hamas had offices and resources.\n\nSarhan said four mosques were destroyed along with dozens of police offices in Gaza. He said most of the factories in Gaza\u2019s industrial zone were destroyed or damaged.\n\nMeanwhile, police inspected unexploded Israeli ordinance collected during the campaign. Police chief Mahmoud Salah said nearly 300 Israeli rockets and shells did not explode.\n\nSarhan put the estimated financial losses from the fighting at $150 million. Assessment is still ongoing, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations says approximately 800,000 people in Gaza do not have regular access to clean piped water, as nearly 50% of the water network was damaged in the recent fighting.\n\nQuoting Gaza\u2019s public works and housing ministry, the UN \u2019s office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said nearly 17,000 residential and commercial units have been damaged or destroyed in the 11-day campaign.\n\nThese include 769 housing and commercial units that have been rendered uninhabitable, at least 1,042 units in some 258 buildings which have been destroyed and another 14,538 units that have suffered minor damage.\n\nA cease-fire took effect Friday after an 11-day campaign that left more than 250 dead \u2014 the vast majority Palestinians \u2014 and brought widespread devastation to the already impoverished Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip\n\nThe UN said 53 education facilities, six hospitals and 11 primary health care centers have been damaged since May 10. One health center was severely damaged, the UN said, while one hospital is not operational because of lack of electricity. Schools in Gaza remain closed, affecting almost 600,000 children.",
