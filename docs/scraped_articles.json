          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nThe Okobaba Destitute Home, located in Ebute Metta, Lagos, was established in the early \u201990s by a former military administrator of Lagos State, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (Retd.) The home popularly known as \u2018beggars colony\u2019 was established to provide shelter and succour to the needy, majority of whom are living with health and physical deformities. Among the inmates are lepers, the blind and the crippled. The Okobaba Destitute Home has, however, become not just a filthy overcrowded squalor but also a haven for infections. LARA ADEJORO reports:\n\nDebris, pet bottles, metals, papers, takeaway plates litter the compound with offensive stenches oozing out\u2014all in piles, mountains-high at times. Those are the features that jump at any first-timer at the Okobaba Destitute Home, in Nigeria\u2019s megacity, Lagos.\n\nThe home established alongside three other rehabilitation settlements in the early \u201990s by the Lagos State Government is now in deplorable condition with many of the inmates equally in a poor state.\n\nAlso, almost permanently etched on the faces of the inmates is worry. No first-time visitors to the home will miss this. Looking at the inmates, you can almost feel how palpably affected and worried they are by their conditions.\n\nAnother thing that stares the first-time visitor in the face is the level of overcrowding. The congestion of humans in the small abode will instantly heighten the prospect of the rapid spread of respiratory infections, cholera, diarrhoea\u2014for the visitors and the residents.\n\nFilth lurks around from the compound and the shanties that dot the camp. The gutters are clogged with dark, thick, dirty water, leftover foods, and floating human feaces.\n\nThe residents have become accustomed to breathing in the smelly putrid and deadly air as most of them grew up in the environment. They now see the offensive odour as a normal part of life as they seat under canopies in the scorching sun, though most of them are not oblivious of their plight in Africa\u2019s economic hub.\n\nHowever, for daily survival, their expectation is that Non-Governmental Organisations and humanitarian bodies will visit to support them, give them food, and clothes.\n\nLocated in the heart of Lagos in Ebute Metta, a neighbourhood of Lagos Mainland, Okobaba Destitute Home houses over 2,000 vulnerable people, including the blind, the crippled, the lepers.\n\nThere appears no reason to call it home. Flies from open defecation and over-flowing latrines buzz about, perching on their food. Or, rather, the food brought to them\u2014because they can\u2019t afford cooking. And if they cook, they do it in the open.\n\nAs the state population grows, so does the number of destitute in the small corners they cram into. And as the population grows, so too does the demand for more rooms, comfort, good living conditions, and sanitation.\n\nThe residents at the destitute home are among the most vulnerable in Nigeria and the most neglected\u2014in one swoop. Even among the destitute homes, Okobaba Destitute Home is a glaring victim of inequality. Their counterparts at Majidun fare much better. Yet they both caught the government\u2019s attention once in the past. The Okobaba Destitute Home is surely not feeling the impact of government.\n\nYet, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had pledged to double up interventions to take care of orphans, children with special needs, the elders, the mentally challenged, and other vulnerable groups in the state.\n\nIt could be recalled that the governor, while speaking during the inauguration of the Social Welfare Integrated Programme Initiative in Ikeja recently, had said, \u201cAs a Government, we are not going to give excuses, there\u2019s a lot that we can do for the children and vulnerable people out there. And I will personally take the lead and see that we double up our interventions through Ministries of Youth and Social Development, Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, and other MDAs.\u201d\n\nHowever, his promises seem far-fetched as the conditions of the inmates spell otherwise.\n\nTruncated comfort\n\nWith a population of over 2000, five or more people are crammed in each of the 174 rooms in the home.\n\nMost occupants in the rooms tie up their mattresses and mats once they are awake to allow for passage, while clothes are heaped on the floor in the rooms.\n\nOutside the rooms are benches laid with cartons for some to lay their heads because of the lack of ventilation in the rooms.\n\n\u201cI stay here,\u201d a middle-aged man who sells sponges for a living said in Hausa language, pointing at the bench he sleeps on.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, there is no ventilation in the rooms and it is always jam-packed, there is no air circulation.\n\n\u201cSome of the rooms here are for the married and some are for singles and you can have from four to six people in a room.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the only one who sleeps outside, you need to come here in the night to see what the situation looks like,\u201d the Zamfara state indigene said.\n\nSome jostle for space beside the block of buildings to build shanties with woods and zincs. However, most of those shanties are prone to flood and often collapse during heavy rainfall.\n\nOur correspondent also learnt that the inmates usually open their shelter to others who can\u2019t afford rent in the megacity. This could be contributing to the high level of overcrowding.\n\nTo worsen the hygiene situation in the home, just a pit latrine and one bathroom are attached to eleven rooms.\n\nThe toilets and bathrooms are in poor shape. Virtually all of them have dirty, soggy floors and broken doors. They are no doubt serious hotbeds of diseases, with an overwhelming stench of feaces, maggots, and flies buzzing around irritatingly. But as irritating as they look, residents of the home were seen going in to answer the call of nature.\n\nAccording to experts, the poor sanitary conditions of the home pose serious health challenges to residents.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise about the situation in the home, a Professor of Public Health and former National Chairman of the Association of Public Health Physicians of Nigeria, Tanimola Akande, lamented that the overcrowding of the home is a serious health risk.\n\n\u201cIt makes people susceptible to respiratory infections that are easily transmitted from one person to the other like Tuberculosis and skin diseases.\n\n\u201cAn unhygienic environment like dirty toilets and bathrooms easily provide room for transmission of infectious diseases caused by viruses and bacteria as well as fungal infections.\n\n\u201cDiarrhoea diseases and some sexually transmitted infections (not as common as often mentioned by people) can result from dirty, unkempt toilets,\u201d Akande said.\n\nAlso, a report by the World Health Organisation, stated that poor sanitation is linked to the transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio and exacerbates stunting.\n\n\u201cPoor sanitation reduces human well-being, social and economic development due to impacts such as anxiety, risk of sexual assault, and lost educational opportunities.\n\n\u201cInadequate sanitation is estimated to cause 432,000 diarrhoeal deaths annually and is a major factor in several neglected tropical diseases, including intestinal worms, schistosomiasis, and trachoma. Poor sanitation also contributes to malnutrition,\u201d the global health body noted.\n\nBleak hope\n\nWhile the majority of the inmates may have adjusted to the harsh reality of their existence, some of them are, however, protesting against the unacceptable condition and lamenting their plight even though they feel helpless about their situation.\n\nIt is, however, not in doubt that the majority of them are grappling with dreariness, with the regretful way they speak, especially about the lack of comfort, food, and help.\n\nOne of such is Hajia Hawau, who seems to have lost touch with reality. She neither knows her age nor how long she has stayed in the home.\n\nSpeaking in the Hausa language, she said she would appreciate any help the government can offer to make life more comfortable for her.\n\n\u201cI need help. I need money. I just want to be fine, anything that the government can do to help me, I will be happy,\u201d she said.\n\nAisha Nasiru, a mother of five children, is another resident of the home.\n\nThe 38-year-old Kano indigene says she would accept any gift that may come her way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m crippled and I\u2019m from Kano state. I need money to start something, feed my children and take care of myself,\u201d she said.\n\nAlleged tribalism\n\nThe General Secretary of the home identified as Mohammed Baba alleged that tribalism discourages the young ones from going to school.\n\nBaba, who is a graduate of the University of Maiduguri said, \u201cMost of the children born here go to primary school but one thing that discourages them from furthering their education is tribalism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been asked by the government that we should train our children in school but tribalism from your people always discourage the children.\n\n\u201cLagos state offers a free primary school for the pupils. If there is nothing like tribalism, our children would have benefited from it and gone to the university.\n\n\u201cThere are some people and even NGOs who are coming to support our children, even to the university; but they cant take care of all the children and we can\u2019t put all the responsibilities on the NGOs. The government should do something,\u201d he said.\n\nDearth of drugs\n\nHowever, a visit to the Majidun Rehabilitation and Training Centre located on Isawo Road, Agric, Ikorodu, by PUNCH HealthWise revealed a different narrative compared to the poor state of the Okobaba home.\n\nThe environment at the Majidun centre is well-kept, and the place looked organised. Also, the inmates look orderly. Two officials man the gate of the home.\n\nOur correspondent sighted some inmates who were seated at the health facility waiting to receive medical care.\n\nOur correspondent learnt that there are doctors and nurses at the centre who attend to the inmates\u2019 medical needs.\n\nPUNCH HealthWise, however, learnt that some drugs needed by inmates are out of stock at the pharmacy department of the centre.\n\nA list of out-of-stock drugs obtained by our correspondent showed that there are over 20 drugs needed at the centre that are presently not available. They include: Trifluoperazine, Risperidone 2mg, Olanzapine 10mg, Sodium valproate 200mg.\n\nNevertheless, inmates of the Oko Baba destitute will bless their stars if they enjoyed half of what the Majidun destitute have.\n\nBut the Director of Programmes for Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa, Mr. Philip Jakpor, says the government should be held responsible for the poor state of rehabilitation homes in the state.\n\nHe insisted that it is the responsibility of the Lagos government to make the environment livable for the inmates.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the government which has set up those places to rehabilitate citizens undergoing specific challenges. It is the responsibility of the government to make the conditions of those places livable so that the individuals supposedly rehabilitated do not suffer double jeopardy.\n\n\u201cIf the conditions are not made conducive or responsive to the challenges of those they are housed there, these centers may end up churning out broken people who will not only be worse than they got there but also become a menace to the society,\u201d Jakpor said.\n\nPUNCH HealthWise contacted the Lagos State Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Segun Dawodu, for comments regarding the state of living of the destitute, but he did not respond to calls or the text message sent to him as of the time of filing this report.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Dr. Goodluck Jonathan\n\nBy Omeiza Ajayi, Abuja\n\nAhead of next year\u2019s general election, an Abuja-based pro-democracy and good governance advocacy group has asked former President Goodluck Jonathan to close ranks with President Muhammadu Buhari and join the ruling All Progressives Congress APC with a view to getting the party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nThe Citizens Network for Peace and Development gave the charge Sunday in Abuja at a media parley on the state of the nation.\n\nNational Coordinator of the network, Okorie \u2018Ohamadike\u2019 Raphael who spoke on behalf of the group noted that Nigeria deserves a leader who is respected even beyond her borders and who is convinced that his ambition is not worth the blood of any Nigerian.\n\nAccording to him, Jonathan\u2019s bloodless ambition puts him in a vantage position over and above those who see politics as a do or die affair.\n\nHe said; \u201cThe 2023 elections in our opinion, is not about the politicians. It is about the citizenry, the Nigerian people! It is about us and our desire for continuity and sustainability of the democratic gains.\n\n\u201cThis briefing is not for lamentations, nor is it centred on disparaging the image of any Nigerian. However, in the past few days, a few personages have indicated interest in running for the Office of the President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria come 2023.\n\n[ALSO READ] 2023: Buhari, Jonathan tip Anyim for higher responsibilities\n\n\u201cOver the years, it has been an all-comers affair. The process of election or is it \u2018selection\u2019 of our leaders past has glaringly never really been based on the will of the people; rather it has been mostly predicated on the design of the elites whose motive is targeted at manipulating the system personal benefit or that of their minions. Such though is the game of politics but I dare say that we have all had enough of that.\n\n\u201cHaving carefully scanned the political firmament in search of a credible, knowledgeable, selfless, trusted and patriotic candidate to occupy the exalted position of President of Nigeria. It is not in doubt that Nigeria is at a crossroads between discontent, fear and suspicion and the propensity for peace, reconciliation and hope. Our searchlight has fallen on none other than former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan GCFR. His antecedents speak volumes. His compassion and passion for peace and Nigeria\u2019s development cannot be overlooked.\n\n\u201cThose who vigorously criticized his administration and misunderstood his conciliatory and transformative approach to governance have soon realized that his patriotism and love for Nigeria is unflinching. For President Goodluck Jonathan he has shown that the interest of the Nigeria comes first. This was demonstrated by his actions during and in the aftermath of the 2015 Elections, specifically the historic phone call he made to President Mohammadu Buhari. He has indeed proven to be a peace maker and patriotic. He epitomises a true defender of democracy. His exemplary display of political solidarity and commitment to the progress of Nigeria has earned him crucial international roles as special envoy, mediator and resource person in global governance and security. He has also represented the African Union, ECOWAS and other global organizations in political matters especially election monitoring, reconciliation and peacemaking across the continent. This can be attributed to his sterling leadership qualities and character.\n\n\u201cLooking closer home, Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s track record as an achiever, nationalist and visionary leader are clearly evident around us. A good number of megaprojects initiated by his administration litter the horizon and though quite a number stand today in credit to the present administration in the spirit of continuity, the fact remains that he has left indelible footprints in the sands of time.\n\n\u201cPresently, the distrust in the polity requires a tested Nigerian like Jonathan to bridge the gap and foreclose any suspicion as is the case with some of those that have indicated interest in occupying Aso Rock come 2023. We do not need a leader who is coming onboard with hangers-on who at best will constitute themselves into a nuisance and unwanted distraction. We do not need a leader whose history is chequered with more questions than answers and we certainly do not need a leader whose ambition is just to be President and nothing more\u201d, he added.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Hushpuppi, for charges bordering on Business Email Compromise (BEC) and money laundering.\n\nIn August 2021, the FBI asked Nigeria to hand Kyari over to them.\n\nLast Monday, Kyari and others were arrested by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) for alleged links with an international narcotics cartel.\n\nOn Thursday, the Police Service Commission (PSC) suspended the officers indicted for links with the international drug cartel.\n\n\u201cDCP Abba Kyari, who prior to this allegation was on suspension, shall remain so,\u201d the PSC wrote.\n\nEarlier, the anti-narcotics agency revealed the statements Kyari made to undercover operatives investigating the cocaine seizure.\n\nReacting to the development, Ohanaeze, in a statement forwarded to DAILY POST on Sunday by its Secretary-General, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, advised the FG not to let Kyari remain in Nigeria with his recent arrest by the NDLEA.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo worldwide has warned that the suspended head of IRT, DCP Abba Kyari should never be allowed to remain in Nigeria with his recent arrest by NDLEA, with overwhelming evidence of complicity in drugs-related cases.\n\n\u201cRather than keeping him here in Nigeria, he should be extradited to the United States to face the allegations from FBI over the hushpuppi scandal and criminal activities.\n\n\u201cDCP Abba Kyari should be allowed to face his crimes in the United States. This will serve as a deterrent to others; this will bolster the fight against corruption.\n\n\u201cThe activities of suspended DCP Abba Kyari in Imo State and the Southeast was dubious and controversial based on the fact that those who were allegedly killed by Abba Kyari, should have been allowed to face the consequences of their actions in any competent court of jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cThe overflow of corpses of Igbo youths at the FMC Owerri and other places in the South-East was the alleged handiwork of IRT team, led by Kyari; no wonder that nemesis caught up with Abba Kyari so quickly. His appetite for the looting of his suspect\u2019s belongings and cash is second to none; that\u2019s why he was obsessed with covetousness and greed to the point of being unaware of the video recording that was used by the NDLEA against him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that IPOB was after Abba Kyari.

          "text": "By Yusuf Alli, Managing Editor, Northern Operation and Jide Orintunsin, Abuja\n\nConfusion over aspirants\u2019 letter demanding postponement\n\nParty fails to set up convention sub-committees\n\nState chairmen go underground over moves to replace coordinator\n\nThe cloud over the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) scheduled for February 26 hung still last night with the party\u2019s governors split into two camps.\n\nThe issues in contention are whether the convention should proceed as scheduled and which of the six geo-political zones should produce the party\u2019s next national chairman.\n\nAdding to the uncertainties was the emergence of a letter yesterday by some party members seeking offices at the convention to propose the postponement of the meeting.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSome party office holders dissociated themselves from the letter.\n\nIt was also gathered that many state chairmen of the party have gone underground to resist an attempt to coerce them to sign a document on convention shift.\n\nThis development, sources told The Nation, prompted the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to conclude plans to replace the Chairman of State APC Chairmen Forum, Hon. Ali Bukar Dalori (Borno) with his Taraba State counterpart to force others in line to endorse postponement.\n\nThe pro-shift governors are said to have proposed that the CECPC should keep running the affairs of the party until after the conduct of the primaries for the 2023 polls.\n\nThe same forces have been trying in the last 72 hours to force the state chairmen of APC chapters to sign a communiqu\u00e9 to demand the postponement of the convention.\n\nMost of the chairmen have gone underground to resist the coercion to sign a document on convention shift.\n\nThe governors also remain divided over the zone that will produce the next national chairman of the party.\n\nAlthough the governors had conceded the slot to the North-Central, some governors reneged and opted to prevail on a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara, from the North-East.\n\nMost of the governors have however rejected the Dogara option by insisting on conceding the office to North-Central.\n\nInvestigation by our correspondent revealed that most members of the Caretaker Committee led by Governor Mai Mala Buni subscribed to the postponement of the convention, but it has been difficult for the committee to table it before the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF).\n\nIt was learnt that the committee was afraid of a \u2018likely revolt\u2019 against the Buni-led committee.\n\nAttempts by some governors to prevail on state APC chairmen to call for the postponement of the convention have also failed.\n\nMost of the party chairmen at the state level are said to have \u201cgone underground.\u201d\n\nSome governors supporting the retention of the Caretaker Committee and the postponement of the convention have not been able to gain the control of the PGF to achieve their aim.\n\nA governor, who spoke in confidence, said: \u201cThe battle at hand is for the soul of the party. The CECPC members including Buni are in support of the postponement of the convention. It is emerging to all of us that Buni appears interested in the presidency in 2023.\n\n\u201cBuni\u2019s personal, vaulting ambition is what\u2019s driving him, but he doesn\u2019t know how to even discuss this with us \u2013 his supposed allies who put him on the job\n\n\u201cAll the governors are opposed to convention shift except Yahaya Bello (Kogi), who is a presidential aspirant, Hope Uzodinma (Imo) and Ben Ayade (Cross River).\n\n\u201cThese anti-convention governors cannot constitute themselves into Progressive Governors Forum (PGF). They are in the minority and they don\u2019t even want the same thing.\n\n\u201cOne wants to be President, the other (Uzodinma) wants to be vice president to a Northern candidate. What unites them is that they are not keen on the unity of APC but they will eventually lose out.\n\n\u201cWe are 22 and they are either three or four. We know the President will go by the position of the majority because he is democratic.\n\n\u201cUp till now, they cannot officially announce a postponement because they know the President\u2019s position. Instead, they are using sleight of hand. They are in charge. If they want a postponement, why hide behind one finger?\u201d\n\nResponding to a question, the governor said Buni and the CECPC were in a fix.\n\nThe governor added: \u201cMai Mala cannot do it (postponement) because he knows the views of the majority of governors including first term governors. They were trying to play a divide and rule card between first and second term governors but we insisted that the right thing must be done.\u201d\n\nA party source claimed that most state APC chairmen have gone underground to avoid being forced to sign any communiqu\u00e9 for the postponement of the convention.\n\nIt was also confirmed by another governor that all his colleagues have directed their party chairmen \u201cnot to endorse any document on postponement of the convention.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think those who may have signed are those from Taraba, Yobe, Kogi and Imo states. Others have gone underground, having been directed by their governors to ignore convention postponement drive.\n\n\u201cIn frustration, the CECPC has concluded plans to replace the Chairman of State APC Chairmen Forum, Hon. Ali Bukar Dalori (Borno) with his counterpart from Taraba State, Tukur El-Sudi Ibrahim, to pave the way for the postponement of the convention to March 12 or indefinitely.\n\n\u201cYet all the state APC chairmen came together to elect their leaders through a democratic process. Why will the CECPC be making moves to remove Dalori if they have nothing to hide?\u201d\n\nFindings confirmed that governors were divided over zoning of the office of the national chairman of APC.\n\nIt was gathered that before President Muhammadu Buhari travelled to Brussels, he had built consensus among the governors to concede the office to the North-Central.\n\nSome governors however reneged on the pact by shopping for a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara, as the next APC national chairman.\n\nAn APC governor simply said: \u201cMark my words; our next Chairman is from the North-Central.\n\n\u201cMai Mala should go back home and concentrate on his job as governor.\u201d\n\nAspirants in letter to CECPC, seek shift of convention\n\nA forum of aspirants for offices at the convention yesterday sparked a fresh confusion in the party when they wrote an open letter to the CECPC to shift the Congress.\n\nThe shift, according to them, is for the sake of peace, unity and success of the party in next year\u2019s elections.\n\nIn the letter signed by Maxwell Yakubu Gowon, an aspirant for National Youth Leader and Chairman of All Aspirants Forum, and Hon. Mohammed Bala Mohammed, an aspirant for National Secretary who also doubles as Secretary for the Forum, the forum claimed that the Abdullahi Adamu led Reconciliatory Committee failed in its assignment, leaving the party divided down the line.\n\nThe forum said the committee \u201ccomplicated the issues at stake by refusing to look at issues holistically and relied on rumours and hearsays in coming to a conclusion in its report.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cThe implication of the above statement is that those that were meant to be reconciled ended up infuriated by the actions of the reconciliatory committee.\n\n\u201cThe signs in this regard are evident for every well-meaning member of the APC to see. But they have elected in their wisdom to downplay these contentious issues in the report submitted.\n\n\u201cThis, in our opinion, is a great disservice to your efforts at positioning the APC for electoral success. As you may be aware, the public space has been flooded with narratives that paint the APC as a party of strange bedfellows whose interests are propelled primarily for self-aggrandizement.\n\n\u201cMr Chairman may wish to critically examine the various agitations in the different states in the country. The feelers are not pleasant, and with the benefit of hindsight, it would indeed spell doom if the party goes ahead with the national convention under such circumstances.\n\n\u201cAs a party, we must be mindful of the burden of expectation placed on our shoulders in providing credible leadership to the country.\n\n\u201cSuppose we can\u2019t put our house in order. In that case, we do not have any moral justification for promising the country credible leadership because charity must begin from home.\u201d\n\nChairmanship aspirants distance themselves from letter\n\nSome national chairmanship aspirants however distanced themselves from the letter.\n\nContacted on the phone, one of the chairmanship aspirants, Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, said: \u201cI am not aware of any forum, neither am I aware of any letter advising the Caretaker Committee Chairman to postpone the convention.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting to our correspondent\u2019s enquiry, another chairmanship hopeful, Malam Saliu Mustapha, who spoke through the Media Coordinator of his Campaign Organisation, Dapo Okubanjo, said: \u201cWe are not aware of the existence of the so-called All Aspirants Forum headed by an aspirant for the position of National Youth leader. So they can\u2019t claim to be speaking for all aspirants, especially as we have never been invited to any meeting where such a decision was said to have been reached.\n\n\u201cWe respect and trust the capacity of the leadership of the party to deal with the issues at stake,\u201d Mustapha maintained.\n\nChief Sunny Sylvester Moniedafe, another chairmanship aspirant, said: \u201cWhile conceding to the fact that we are in a democracy and everyone is entitled to his or her opinion, I make bold to say that problems will always exist and healing them is a process.\n\n\u201cLeadership at all levels is a continuum, and if anyone claims that we must clear everything, reconcile every difference before proceeding, we will be making a big error.\n\n\u201cThe idea of continuity is to state all pending issues in your handover note.\n\n\u201cI want to appeal to the Gov Mai Mala Buni led CECPC to have that in their minds and decide on the next line of action which I believe should be by tomorrow evening, Sunday the 20th of February.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, we must remember that our word should be our bond; they (CECPC) chose the date of 26th February on their own and should not lose their sense of integrity by doing something that will bring their integrity to question.\u201d\n\nConvention sub-committees yet to be constituted\n\nMembers of the party waited in vain again yesterday for the constitution of the sub-committees for the convention.\n\nThe Caretaker Committee at its 19th regular meeting of 19th January 2022 had fixed Saturday 19th February for the release of the membership of the sub-committees and their inauguration.\n\nThe caretaker committee also fixed the same day as the last day for the submission of nomination forms by all aspirants.\n\nThere were no activities suggestive of an upcoming convention at party\u2019s national secretariat in Abuja yesterday.\n\nNo member of the Caretaker Committee was even seen at the secretariat.",

          "title": "2023 presidency: Why move to lure Jonathan into APC will fail \u2013 Aminu Wali, former Foreign Affairs minister",
          "text": "From Desmond Mgboh, Kano\n\nAmbassador Aminu Wali is Nigeria\u2019s former minister of Foreign Affairs and a founding father of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nIn this chat with Sunday Sun in his home in Kano, he speaks about the challenges and fortunes of his party, the PDP.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nSpecifically, he talked about the party\u2019s Northwest congress, which has been shifted twice as a result of disruption in the first instance and recently, as a result of an injunction against a rather popular candidate in the race, Bello Hayaitu Gwarzo.\n\nHe also lamented over the negative impacts of the Kwankwasiyya Movement \u2013 a Movement led by Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso \u2013 on the party, the overarching pressure brought by strong governors on the PDP, the moves to lure Jonathan to APC as well as the dilemma of the PDP regarding which zone, North or South, should produce its 2023 presidential candidate. Excerpts:\n\nLet\u2019s start the interview with the efforts of your party to hold a congress in the Northwest zone. What is your impression of what has happened so far, with two postponement of the congress already?\n\nIt is unfortunate about what has happened, that has led to the postponement of the scheduled congress. I think luckily, what we have in place today in terms of the national leadership of our party is a leadership that looks at things fairly, that is fair to everybody. It is unfortunate that some people went and got an injunction against one of the candidates, for which they know that they cannot expel or they cannot suspend him. Legally, they don\u2019t have the authority under the Constitution of the party to suspend or expel a member of the BOT. The constitution is very clear. Even the National Executive Committee of the party cannot suspend or expel a member of the BOT of the party.\n\nAre you referring to Bello Hayaitu Gwarzo, the candidate that was barred by their injunction?\n\nYes, Bello Hayaitu Gwarzo. As you know, Gwarzo is a member of the BOT and the Constitution of the PDP is very clear and by the end of the day, it is only the convention that can expel or suspend him or the BOT itself that can suspend him. And if it is expulsion, it is the convention that can expel him. So, this is a Kangaroo thing that was done. But then, when a court gave an injunction to stop Gwarzo from contesting, the party felt that the premise upon which the injunction was secured may not have taken into consideration the Constitution of the party and the party said well, to be fair to everybody, the congress is postponed, so that the legal issues would be sorted out and thereafter, we can go back to have a zonal congress. That is what happened.\n\nWhat I worry here is time. Does your party have all the time?\n\nWell, yes! Don\u2019t forget that there is already a caretaker executive in place at the zone, which has been handling all the issues. But of course, that is not satisfactory. We certainly want an elected body to do it, but since the current leadership is very much aware of the legal implications, it decided to say okay we cannot just go and support what we know is not legal \u2013 that is to support one of the candidates. But since the court has made a pronouncement, we have to obey the court. But for that purpose, they said okay, let\u2019s just suspend the zonal congress so that everybody would be given a fair and level playing ground.\n\nStill on the aborted Northwest zonal congress of your party, there are two candidates from Kano State vying for the deputy chairman. Why is it that almost all of you, the major stakeholders of the party in the zone are opposed the Kwankwassiya candidate?\n\nDon\u2019t forget that I am one of the founding fathers of this party. I was the first deputy national chairman of the PDP. Solomon Lar was chairman and I was his deputy. For me, it is the party that I know. Any other identification within the party, to me, is unacceptable. Our loyalties should be to the party. So, you can see, even without me giving any explanation, you can see why we are running at parallel lines with that movement you just mentioned. I don\u2019t belong to any movement. I belong to the PDP. And any other body that identifies with me, it is not me as a person, It is the party that he identifies. So, somehow, somehow, there is a movement that sprang up around a particular personality, but they still claim to be a part of the PDP.\n\nSir, from your rich experiences in party politics, what is your take on movements loyal to a particular individual emerging within parties? I mean a movement like Kwankwasiyya Movement, whose loyalty is first to a particular personality?\n\nWell, you see once we have the right leadership leading any political party, this kind of thing would not happen or would not be allowed to happen. This is because there would be limit, a red line which every member of the party cannot cross. But unfortunately, we have not been that cohesive at the national level of the party for some time now. But thank God, for the first time since the departure of Solomon Lar, this current leadership of the PDP, the national leader of the party, happens to be one of the founding fathers of the party. And so, he knows the principles and the basic philosophy of the party and also what really brought people together to form the PDP. At least, he has a perception of what the PDP should be. And I don\u2019t think he would tolerate this movement stuff, I don\u2019t think he would tolerate anything meddling into the administration of the party- like having a different movement whose loyalty is not to the party leadership. For us, the national party leader is our sole leader. No more, no less! Nobody who is not elected within the hierarchy of the party can be a leader to me. Whatever movement it is, regardless, should not arrogate itself the authority that can compete or disregard the party national leadership- because this is what is happening.\n\nYou don\u2019t like talking about the Kwankwasiyya Movement, but it is real. How would you access their impact on the PDP in Kano State and beyond? Have they added value to the party or have been a cross for the party to bear?\n\nI think that, initially, when they started, some people took them in good faith. They saw them as members of the party. And felt innocently that it was not really built around a particular individual. They saw it like another brand to bring people into the PDP and they were somehow okay with it, but unfortunately as it turned out, it turned out like a cult within the PDP. And that has not augured well for the PDP in the state and beyond. Initially when it was looked at as nothing harmless, yes, it added value. Kids, one way or the other, wanted to be identified with the PDP if they wear one thing or the other. But as it is, it seems that it is now built around a particular individual as opposed to around the party. If it is around the party, by now everybody who is a member of the PDP would be wearing or would be identified with the colours. But no! It got to a point where it is operating like worshipping the leader of the movement. Number two, it contradicts every democratic norm, all the democratic norms of running, not even a party, but any society of people. If there is democracy, then everybody will and should have a voice. At whatever level, there cannot be only one person that can determine everything. So, that is the difference. So, for Kano today, if things go the way it is going, I will be very, very sorry for our young people that are now coming up. The political culture that is being nurtured in the party would not augur well in the future because number one, discipline is broken down. I have been a victim. I am sure you know what happened to me. In a society, no matter what, respect for elders is always inculcated in the youth. And they have always respected that. That is how our society was and any society in Nigeria is built around that culture. But eventually that culture of respect in Kano is being eroded arising from the emergence of this sort of movements.\n\nThere is a new PDP national leadership today. Do you see this team of leadership as the type that can fight APC and their incumbency to a standstill by 2023?\n\nAbsolutely, absolutely. Like I said earlier, the spirit of the founding fathers of the PDP is now brought to the fore. The founding fathers of the party fought the military and succeeded, let alone fighting a rival democratic institution like the APC and its incumbency. We were there before and we know how the game is played. The current leadership was part and parcel of the first PDP government. Iyorchia Ayu was a minister in that government. So, he knows the values and the programmes and the achievements of the PDP within that 16 years of governance and today, he is at the helm of affairs of the party. And I believe that very soon, we would start seeing a lot of people, a lot of Nigerians trooping back to the PDP because a lot of people have a lot of confidence in Ayu\u2019s emergence. Like I said, I have absolute confidence in Ayu- because we worked with him in the national secretariat, he was a member of the 34, he was first Chairman\u2019s Political Adviser when I was Deputy Chairman to Solomon Lar. He was his Principle Political Adviser. And most of the political thinking of that era owe itself to Ayu\u2019s input. So he is very much conversant, in fact, he is the most qualified person within the PDP to really drive the new vision of the party. The previous leadership of the PDP led by Secondus.\n\nThey are still around, they are still agitating and they still feel that they should not have been removed they way they were removed. Don\u2019t you see them as a threat to all these goals and new vision?\n\nWhether we like it or not, I was party to the emergence of that administration. Secondus was at my house where he was interviewed by all the stakeholders of my zone (Northwest zone) before we agreed to go along with him. At that time, we all believed that things would work out well. But I think that somehow, along the way, there was a derailment. PDP is people\u2019s democratic party. It is not owned by any individual or organization. It is our own, all of us, all Nigerians, and whoever wants to identify with the PDP, owns a piece of the party. And there is a constitution which was carefully crafted by people who are well qualified and with amendments here and there as we go on. For the PDP to succeed, we have to adhere strictly to the constitution of the party. But unfortunately, the last administration vied away from the basic principles of the constitution of the party. In fact, if they had adhered strictly to the constitution of the party, then, movements like Kwankwasiyya could not been tolerated. The constitution does not provide for any movement within the party. But somehow, it was tolerated and encouraged. When Kwankwassiyya movement came out from the APC to the PDP in Kano State, they came in as Kwankwassiyya Movement. That would not have happened under the current leadership. If you come in, you come in as a member of the PDP and your movement is something that is totally outside the party structure. So, my vision of the current leadership or my confidence in the current leadership is to the effect that I know that the driver is a good driver and would take us safely to our destination. My only appeal is to those aspirants for political offices, particularly aspirants to the number one position to please tread carefully, for the party to come up with the right kind of person that is generally accepted, both within the party and across the country.\n\nThere is the assumption that the PDP is now under the control of some strong governors, strong governors like Wike and his friend in Sokoto, Tambuwal, and that these governors dictate the tune and not the elected leadership. May we have your view on this?\n\nThis is a very sad situation. But it evolved over the years. It would be unfair to blame the last administration alone. PDP started stumbling within the first administration. If I could remember, a lot of the provisions within the constitution and the way that the PDP was being run were taken from the former parties, particularly the NPN of which I was part of. The party, from what I know of the NPN, the party is supreme. Whether you are the governor or the president, you have to go with what the party dictates, when I say the party, I mean everybody, not a certain group of individuals sitting down to decide. But unfortunately, over the years \u2013 maybe it is as a result of lack of resources or the party was unable to create ways of raising its own resources and it was depending on the largesse that was coming from the governors and even from the presidency as it was when we were in power. Eventually, through the process, the party began to lose its grips. Because when we came into office in 1999, as a member of the national caucus, we used to meet every week when we first started, every week with the president and his ministers and his nominees, BOT, every week and get reports of what the government was doing. It eventually went to bi-weekly and then somehow along the line, it just fizzled out. That is where I think the party lost track. It didn\u2019t lose track now as in today or yesterday. This problem took time to evolve to what it is today.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nThe solution is strong leadership.\n\nAnd what is your appeal?\n\nLet us now learn to be fair to one another, whether you are the governor or the chairman of the PDP or whatever. Let us be fair to the party and the only way to be fair to each other is to allow the party and constitution to be referee to all the players. They must give the party the chance to be the referee. Just like in a football game, the referee is the sole authority in the game. And the party should be given the authority to make sure that there is fairness in whatever that is being done. And at the same time, the party should think of how to independently generate funds \u2013 I think Ayu has started. I saw him going to visit the national secretariat that we started building some years ago. When that structure in the center of Abuja is completed, I think the party would depend less on any individual for funds.\n\nOnly recently, the PDP national chairman paid a visit to Obasanjo to canvas his blessings and invite him to the party, but I think the signal in the media was that Obasanjo turned down the offer to return to the PDP. How do you see this?\n\nNo! He did not turn down the offer, it was not a question of turning down. Obasanjo has already made his position clear a long time ago, that he is no longer, I mean, he is now a statesman, not only in Nigeria but in Africa, in fact, in the world. And I worked very closely with Obasanjo when I was in the United Nations and I know the kind of respect that the man commanded at the international level. So, I think that he had realized that at his age, he should not be drawn into party politics and all these things. But deep down, he still cannot acquit himself of his preference. If we sit down , me and him sit down, talking, I still can see the flicker of his preference to PDP than any other party in Nigeria! But for him to now come out and say that I am going to be partisan, some of the assignments and some of the activities that he is undertaking at the moment cannot continue. He has had recognition in Africa, recognition internationally. So, I think he is trying to protect what he has going for him now. His position as a statesman may not be accommodated by the narrowness of a particular political party, but deep inside him, his thinking is definitely PDP.\n\nThe PDP appears to be in a dilemma in terms of whose region should produce its presidential candidate, North or South, for the 2023 elections. What is your position?\n\nWell, you see for me, my antecedents are very clear. When we went to the party\u2019s convention in Jos, I was an Ekwueme\u2019s man. I supported him to the end and up to the time the man died, I still maintained that relationship with him. For me, my solution for the Nigeria\u2019s problem at that time was to get an Igbo man to become the president after the civil war, to get an Igbo man to take over the country. My belief was and is still is that if Ekwueme had become the president of Nigeria, all these Biafra stuff would have been long forgotten. All these things would have been put to rest, if only we had allowed an Igbo presidency at that time. If we had Ekwueme then as president, nobody would come and agitate for Biafra today. Yes, maybe the Yourba was shortchanged when Abiola was not sworn in, but that is one thing you and me cannot be accused of. But today what we need, from my point of view, what I believe is that we need a change of government in Nigeria, we need the PDP back to power to take us back to eight years ago, where the APC took over because things have really gone bad, things have become so bad in this country in every aspect.\n\nWe are talking about that we need\u2026?\n\nYes, we need to win 2023 general elections and for me, I don\u2019t care where the person comes from so long as the person is capable and can win elections for our party. It should be somebody that can break the barriers of all the zones in this country to be able to emerge as a presidential candidate. There is demand for Igbo president, Yoruba president or a Northern president or whatever president. Yes it is a legitimate right for everybody to voice out his preference, but I hope that within the PDP, we are going to come back to our senses and really look at the aspirants, sit down to look at them and in the same spirit that we were able to produce the chairman of the party, that same spirit should guide us to produce a winner candidate for the presidency of this country, regardless of where the person comes from.\n\nIf I get you right now, the emphasis is how to get a winner kind of candidate?\n\nExactly, because we we have to do something to get rid of where we are today and then we can now return back to our zoning. I want a winnable candidate from whichever part of the country. Let us accept the candidate so that we can go ahead and win the elections and once we win the elections, then we can now sit down within the PDP and within the larger society also to see how do we now satisfy the aspiration of every Nigerian from every part of the country, maybe come up with a new formula like the initial thinking .Yes the initial thinking was to move rotation to all the six zones and after that , there should be no more rotation. But unfortunately, Obasanjo finished and Yar\u2019dua died. That was what brought about the complications. The people are crying that the North has ruled. Yes, it has ruled. But they had APC and we have PDP. We have ruled for 16 years as PDP, but those 16 years were not from the North. I am trying to justify anything , no ! For now, forget about where the candidate would come from , let us get a winnable candidate.\n\nThere is a suggestion that to ease this form of challenge, let\u2019s cut down the tenure to one \u2013tenure stuff, so that the presidency can go easily round to the zones. What is your view on this?\n\nThis is something that can be visited and be accepted. Because you see this two term business, once somebody gets to the Villa, he does not want to hear anything that would curtail his tenure. We would now have to have a national consensus across all parties that it should be one term presidency. I am totally in agreement with that. Maybe we make one term \u2013 five-year presidency, so that another zone will come and take charge so that this question of \u201cwe have been left out\u201d would be over. After that, it is going to be purely on merit. We really have to learn to be Nigerians and to be our brother\u2019s keepers regardless of from whichever part anybody comes from. Like I was saying, I never regretted supporting Ekwueme. I remember Obasanjo came to this house to seek my support and I told him Sir, I have known you before EKwueme, but Ekwueme has been my political soul mate.\n\nThere is still this speculation that somehow former President Goodluck Jonathan is still being lured back to the political field and APC may field him as their presidential candidate.\n\nJonathan is my boss and I served as his minister and I respect him and Jonathan is his own man, his own person. No matter how close we are with him, at the end of the day, that decision is his, not mine , not that of anybody. But as far as I know, he is still a member of the PDP. Yes, he has not been happy, apparently, from the way things were going and that is why he has not been too much involved in the affairs of the PDP. And maybe secondly, he\u2019s got an alternative by being engaged in a lot of these African affairs, moving all over Africa, trying to sort out democratic issues\u2026You want my opinion on what?\n\nShould he move on with the offer or should he not?\n\nI doubt it very much, knowing the man and what he is. I doubt if he would take that offer. I doubt it because I think he is already enjoying tremendous amount of respect, nationally and internationally, that going back, trying to go and start fighting against his own party that brought him up, that I think would be a tall order. I don\u2019t think so, and in particular, for him to go and contest in the APC. For me, I will never forget the vitriolic attacks that we got from the APC, particular on him as a person. They even termed him the sponsor of Boko Haram. Some of us were vilified in our won states. They said that we have recanted our religion because we were supporting Jonathan. My house nearly got burnt at a time. So, he knows all these things that happened and it was not anybody\u2019s doing at that time, but the APC\u2019s doing. So, I don\u2019t think that he would succumb to any pressure from the APC. That is number one. This is all rumour! It is rumour!! But how about the stalwarts of the All Progressives Congress that are gunning for that same position? Are they going to sit down and say okay we accept somebody from outside to come and take it? Does it make sense to you that those gunning for the presidency in APC would come and say okay we are settled for an outsider to come and take over?\n\nIt is not your party, but what is your take about the current struggle between Vice President Osinbajo and Bola Tinubu for their party\u2019s presidential ticket?\n\nThe truth is that I know less or little about these people, to be honest with you. To some extent, yes I know Bola Tinubu, but Osinbajo, I have never met him since he became the vice president. Even since he became the vice president, I have never met him officially, not even once. So, I am not too much attached to the politics of the Southwest and most of the people that I am attached to in the region are not from the APC and even though some of them had moved to the APC from the PDP, when they move, they cut off automatically.\n\nSeven years down the line, how would access President Buhari\u2019s leadership bearing in mind the three major promises that he made to Nigerians when he was canvassing votes?\n\nThis administration took over from us and I know how far we went\u2026 all those projects that they are now claiming that they have done. Yes, we initiated them. Even the institution fighting corruption, it is our making. On security, what will I say? Let you or any other Nigerian compare between then and now. I don\u2019t have to comment. This is something which is known to all Nigerians. Today, no part of Nigeria is spared. At least in our days, maybe we can say that it was limited to the Northeast But today, no part of Nigeria as far as security is related is secured. People dare not travel by road today to any part of Nigeria. Talking about security, I don\u2019t want to comment. In those days, we all travel by road. But today the roads have all gone bad and secondly you dare not because the roads are not safe. So, what security are you talking about?",

Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nBy Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nThe recent importation of adulterated Premium Motor Spirit(PMS) popularly called petrol said to be high in methanol content has continued to spark outrage across the country over its attendant socio-economic effect on the citizenry.\n\nThe development has led to acute shortage of petrol with the majority of depots and filling stations running out of stock.\n\nMotorists now have to keep vigil at filling stations as the price of a litre of petrol has skyrocked to N200 and N400 respectively in Lagos and Abuja.\n\nCommeneting on the development, the Independent Petroleum Marketers\n\nAssociation of Nigeria (IPMAN)\n\ndisclosed that no inland depot has received clean petrol that would boost supply to filling stations.\n\nIPMAN Public Relations Officer, Chinedu Ukadike, said the Federal Government was yet to improve supply, warning that it would take another two\n\nweeks for supply to normalize.\n\nIn Abuja, there was no sign of let-up in the shortage of petrol as fewer stations were opened to motorists with black marketers selling at N400 per litre.\n\nUkadike said that the challenges facing the downstream sector were\n\nenormously, urging the government to begin the process of compensating marketers who have lost a lot of money during the period.\n\nHe explained: \u201cNothing much has changed in the last few days, the issue is that up till now we have not seen the intervention of the NNPC based on evacuating these products (bad fuel) from some of our stations. Some marketers are trying to see if they can get new products and blend it to see if they can move.\n\n\u201cMarketers\u2019 capitals have been tied down and the bad product is also occupying their storage tank and that is why you are seeing some skeletal services. Some also have their tanks quarantined, so it is not easy.\n\n\u201cWe have been expecting products in the inland depots like the Port Harcourt Refinery depot but up till now, no product has been received. These things happen. Once there is a break in the supply chain it will take some time to fix. Forget what people are saying, it will take one-two to three weeks to fill in the gaps. It is talking about evacuating and replacing, it is not just about the shortage, it is also about evacuating and replacing.\u201d\n\nHe noted that while Port Harcourt where he is based has not witnessed the acute shortage being experienced in many parts of the country, he said most of the marketers who have placed orders have not received the supply.\n\nWhile urging consumers to be patient, he observed that many motorists have engaged in racketeering where they \u201cfill up their tanks, go to sell to black marketers and return to the queues. I want to advise our people to stop patronizing black marketers, this will help also in solving the problem\u201d, he added.\n\nHowever, the claim of IPMAN contradicted the position of NNPC which said that it has over one billion litres of certified petrol stock that is safe for use in vehicles and machinery.\n\nThe NNPC in a statement released on Tuesday equally said that it has commenced 24-hour operations in NNPC depots and retails outlets to restore normal supply and distribution of petrol across the country.\n\nBut, a Twitter user, Anthony Unegbu, while responding to the NNPC statement said that the reality on ground does not support the content of the press statement.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u2018\u2018Why did NNPC depot at Aba not sell even one litre of petrol yesterday (February 15, 2022)? People have payments made since over two months and the tickets have not been released. Prove me wrong by showing pictures,\u2019\u2019 he queried.\n\nThere have equally been widespread reported cases of damage to vehicle engines occasioned by the adulterated fuel.\n\nAn online video which surfaced recently shows a petrol attendant complaining about how the adulterated petrol dispensed at the station damaged cars and motorcycle engines.\n\nWhile pointing at some of the grounded vehicles, he said many motorists have reported the matter to the police.\n\nSome of the motorists who spoke to Sunday Sun in separate interviews said, if not urgently addressed, the situation was capable of further pushing more Nigerians below the poverty net.\n\n\u2018\u2018Should my vehicle be damaged as a result of this contaminated fuel, who will bail me out? How do I feed my family and other family members that depend on me for survival,\u201d Mufu Akande, a transporter who plies CMS to Ajah queried.\n\nIn a telephone interview with Sunday Sun, Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), Mr. Babatunde Irukera, while sympatising with those whose vehicles may have been damaged due to the adulterated petrol said that the FCCPC was already in talks with NMDPRA, NNPC, Standards Organisation of Nigeria(SON) on the way forward.\n\nHe said that FCCPC will collate data on those affected and develop a methodology on how best to resolve the issue.\n\nHe admitted that the issue remained a complicated one, but that the FCCPC will not rest on its oars in order to ensure that consumers are not left in the cold.\n\nThe adulterated petrol according to the regulator-Nigerian Midstream Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority(NMDPRA) has proved to be high in methanol concentration.\n\nUpon the discovery of the adulterated fuel, NMDPRA in conjunction with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited commenced moves to recall the bad product in order to save Nigerians, especially motorists untold hardship.\n\nBut prior to its recall, the adulterated fuel had already found its way into the Nigerian petroleum retail products market.\n\nThe outcome of the penetration of the bad product into the Nigerian market was a monumental damage to motor vehicle engines, generators and other mechanical devices that use petrol as its source of energy.\n\nAddressing the media on the adulterated imported petrol, Chief Executive Officer(CEO) of NNPC Limited, Mr Mele Kyari, made a shocking revelation when he admitted that a subsidiary of NNPC, Duke Oil Limited and three other private Nigerian company operating in the downstream sector imported four PMS cargoes which contained methanol.\n\nHe listed the three other companies to include; MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium and Oando.\n\nHe said that NNPC investigation revealed the presence of Methanol in four PMS cargoes imported by MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium, Oando, and Duke Oil.\n\nKyari added that the adulterated fuel was imported into the country from Antwerp in Belgium with quality inspectors failing to detect the high level of Methanol contained in it, first at the point of import in Belgium and later at the point of arrival in Nigeria.\n\nThe NNPC boss who did not give the date of import, however, disclosed that the NNPC found out about the situation late in January following a report received from their quality inspector on the presence of emulsion particles in PMS cargoes shipped to Nigeria from Antwerp-Belgium.\n\nMRS used the vessel, MT Bow Pioneer; Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium imported the product via the vessel MT Tom Hilde; Oando used the vessel MT Elka Apollon, while Duke Oil imported its PMS using MT Nord Gainer.\n\nKyari explained that the PMS contained methanol was not detected by checks because the quality checks do not include checks for Methanol percentage, adding that cargoes quality certificates issued at load port (Antwerp-Belgium) by AmSpec Belgium indicated that the gasoline complied with Nigerian specification.\n\nHe also said that the NNPC quality inspectors, including GMO, SGS, GeoChem and G&G as well as inspection agents appointed by the Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority certified that the cargoes met Nigerian specification.",

          "text": "By Christian Agadibe\n\nStar actress, Chinenye Uyanna always looks stunning acting pregnant woman even though she\u2019s still single.\n\nRecently, Uyanna took to her Instagram page to showcase a baby bump, a role she played in her new movie, Jackie\u2019s Baby Bump. Ironically, in this rare interview, the actress cum movie producer opens up on why she cannot act romantic or sexual roles. Here are excerpts:\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nWhat are you currently working on?\n\nI am working on having my own production outfit. And I am supposed to start a job on February 12, and I will also be producing a lot of films this year.\n\n\n\nWhat was the first movie you produced?\n\nIt\u2019s called Time, starring Mike Ezuronye and a lot of other popular acts. The second one is titled Mended Heart. I also acted in it. Both movies are on TV and YouTube channels. So, I have done three movies. The other one, Baby Bump will come out this month.\n\nWhich among these movies is your favourite?\n\nAll of them are doing great, even though Mended Heart is doing wonderfully well on YouTube. Of course, all my babies are doing great. My movies are my babies.\n\nWhich of the characters gave you a tough time?\n\nI think it is Baby Bump; it is not easy to be pregnant in movies. Carrying that belle for long was really challenging, and the same thing happened in Jackie`s Baby Bump, which would be out in February.\n\nHow can you describe the acceptance of the movie?\n\nTime and even Mended Heart are doing great. A lot of people love the storyline as it is all about \u2018for better for worse\u2019 between partners, and there are lessons to be learnt. So, I will advise you to go watch it.\n\nHow challenging was it producing movies after recovering from the COVID-19 saga?\n\nReally, everything was okay; we kept to the rules, we used hand sanitizer and facemasks.\n\n\n\nHow do you manage to combine both roles as producer and actor?\n\nIt is not that difficult if you have able hands. Uche Ibunabu, my producer really helped. I think people that complain are those that want to carry everything on their heads, there should be people assisting you. So, for me, all I do is bring out the money for the production, then relax and shoot.\n\nWhat can you say has changed in the industry?\n\nWe are growing; it is not how you were as a baby that you are now as an adult. As for me, I\u2019m not sentimental; everyone that comes for my shoot must behave him or herself, even if we are friends or colleagues or family members.\n\nCan you say that young actresses constitute a sort of threat to you?\n\nNobody is a threat to me. The earth is too big for everybody, and knowing that you cannot be in every movie, but can only do what you can do. What I bring to the table is different from what you bring to the table, so we all have different talents and ideas. Nobody is a threat to me and I am equally not a threat to anybody. I do my thing and focus on myself and work.\n\n\n\nWhat can you say about comedy skits that seem to be taking over Nollywood?\n\nLet\u2019s call a spade a spade. Comedy is comedy. When it comes to comedy, it\u2019s not even up to 10 minutes, it is something to laugh at and move on. But when you want something to learn from, obviously, it\u2019s a movie. Even people no longer pay for cables but go on YouTube to watch their movies. So, we cannot say social media is taking over Nollywood, as it can only take a few minutes of skits. However, both are two different things. I do cartoon skits myself and I know a lot of people don\u2019t know that.\n\nHave you ever done any movie involving romantic or sexual scenes?\n\nI always tell producers not to bother involving me in such movies, because I cannot do it. And I think everybody around me is used to it. If there is no lesson that people can take home from a movie, then there is no need doing it. You know, a lot of people keep complaining about Nollywood films.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nCan you say Nollywood films are making an impact in Nigerian politics?\n\nYes, a lot of things are happening, and thank God for social media, especially during the #EndSARS protest of October 2020. A lot of people came out to lend their voices, including celebrities who used their platforms in terms of speaking out.\n\nHas acting denied you of anything?\n\nNot at all, acting cannot deny me of anything, because my fame came with favours.\n\nWould you encourage any of your children to join the movie industry?\n\nOf course, I would like my daughter to feature in Nollywood if that is what she wants.\n\nWhat can you say about female celebrities flaunting their big cars, houses on social media?\n\nHow do you know I don\u2019t have big cars? That I don\u2019t post things on social media does not mean I do not have something. I don\u2019t need anybody to congratulate me on anything. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just me, I think a lot of the male celebrities are also buying big cars, even if they don\u2019t post them. I can even say the actors are doing far better than the female ones; it\u2019s just that we ladies like to show off.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on cheating husbands and their wives retaliating by also indulging in extra-marital affairs?\n\nWell, I don\u2019t know about that. For me, I would not do such. We just have to come to terms with whatever situation we find ourselves and have forgiven spirit, realising that nobody is perfect. But if you cannot do that, you move on; marriage is not a do-or-die affair.\n\nGoing forward, what should your fans expect from you?\n\nThey should expect more films, more endorsements, and more everything good. With God on my side, a lot of good things will happen this year.\n\nWhat other projects are you into?\n\nI started my Foundation last year and there would be more outreaches this year. My Foundation is about reaching out to children, the young ones and the less privileged. So, you guys should watch out.\n\nWe don\u2019t see you nowadays acting the bad girl character, any reason for this?\n\nI do both. I started with the bad girl character. Sometimes I think they just look at your face and know what kind of person you are. I feel I do better when I\u2019m acting the bad girl character, like a nagging wife, a troublesome sister etc.\n\nCan you recall the experience of your first kiss in movies?\n\nNo, I can\u2019t remember. How would you even remember something that is just an act?",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThere is indeed uncertainty over the much-awaited National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) scheduled to hold on February 26.\n\nCurrently, the convention is shrouded in confusion, intrigues and anomie, amidst speculations of its possible postponement from February 26 to the first or second week of March.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nIn line with the timetable and schedule of activities released last month January, the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) tactically raised a red flag of possible postponement of the convention when it failed to meet up with its deadline for sale and submission of nomination forms scheduled to hold between February 14 to 19.\n\nBesides the failure to meet up with the deadline for the sale of forms, the national leadership of the ruling party could not equally constitute convention sub-committees, especially the zoning committee, which will swing the pendulum to decide, firstly, the members of the National Working Committee (NWC) and ultimately the trajectory for the party\u2019s 2023 presidential ticket.\n\nAlthough the APC Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) may have temporarily resolved the lingering zoning controversy by giving the national chairmanship ticket to the North-central geopolitical zone, the zoning of the National Secretary to the South-south has been causing serious ripples between the Southeast and South-south.\n\nExplaining the bone of contention to Sunday Sun, a reliable source who declined identity on print, described it as a decision taken in error by a critical stake of the party\u2019s leaders.\n\nQuestioning the basis for such decision, he argued that having produced the two previous national chairmen of the party in addition to occupation of the current position as Secretary Caretaker Committee, equity, fairness and natural justice demand that South-south should allow Southeast to produce the next chief scribe of the party in the about-to-be constituted NWC.\n\n\u201cThere is likelihood that the convention might be postponed not because of any other thing, but probably because we want to avoid any possible clash with the bye-elections fixed by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) coming on the same February 26 date.\n\n\u201cYes the party has been under immense pressure to shift the date and without ruling out the possibility of the convention still holding as scheduled, I want to say that if there is going to be postponement of the date, the INEC bye-elections might be responsible for it.\n\n\u201cAgain, the planned postponement has nothing to do with the lingering controversial issue of zoning or delay in setting up of sub-committees for the convention. For your information, the progressive governors have concluded the zoning arrangement, after their meeting in Abuja last week, by confirming that while the North-central will produce the National Chairman, the Southeast will take the National Secretary.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cThey also reconfirmed that all the previous positions in the NWC held by the South should return to the North and vice-versa. However, I must tell you that there has been serious disagreement between South-south and Southeast over which zone should produce the next National Secretary.\n\n\u201cBut, having produced two national chairmen of the party previously and currently occupies the Caretaker Committee secretaryship position, South-south should, in the spirit of fairness and equity, allow the Southeast to have the position.\n\n\u201cWhat it means is that should the North-central produce the party\u2019s national chairman and the South-south the secretary, the Southeast would have lost out in everything should the party also fail to zone the presidential ticket to the Southeast\u201d our source explained.\n\nOn why the party\u2019s national leadership reneged in the implementation of its timetable and schedule concerning the sale of forms, our source further argued that there may not be any reason to sell nomination forms to the aspirants to the NWC since most of the positions will be filled through consensus arrangements, adding that the party may sell forms for only non-NWC positions.\n\n\u201cIt is wrong to judge the readiness of the national leadership for our convention based on the failure to meet up with the timetable deadline on the sale and submission of nomination forms last week. There is likelihood that the party may not sell nomination forms for the NWC positions because almost all the positions may be through consensus arrangements.\n\n\u201cThe nomination forms that might be on sale however could be for the non-NWC positions. Let me add that if the party\u2019s leadership fail nomination forms this week, it will be a confirmation that the convention may not hold this weekend as earlier planned.\n\n\u201cOther factors that might necessitate the postponement of the convention might likely be the INEC bye-elections. As of today, I won\u2019t say with certainty that the February proposed date for the convention is cast in stone. Don\u2019t also forget that the bulk stops on the table of President Muhammadu Buhari. We must look beyond interpretation of his body language as far as this convention is concerned,\u201d the source noted.\n\nDoubting the possibility of the convention holding, many secretariat staff ruled out the February 26 date, arguing that the indices and signals are enough confirmation that the date might be changed.\n\n\u201cI wonder how anybody could still believe the possibility of the convention holding on February 26 with the way the secretariat is looking. There were no preconvention activities in the secretariat one week to the convention. There has not been any composition of sub-committees, acceptable resolutions on the controversial zoning arrangements, and more importantly the nomination forms that have not been printed.\n\n\u201cThis secretariat used to be a beehive of activities a week to the convention, but in this case, the only semblance of the possibility of it holding is the marching order President Buhari gave to the Caretaker Committee to organise the convention unfailingly this month. Well, we will, however, get the clearer picture of whether it will hold or not this week,\u201d the secretariat staff noted.",

While Oyetola polled 309, Adeoti scored 146 in Aregbesola\u2019s ward.\n\nThe Chairman of the APC faction in the ward, Adegoke Saheed, blamed the loss of the ward for the absence of Aregbesola, alleging that the committee favoured Governor Oyetola.\n\nFindings revealed that Oyetola won in almost all the polling centres in the state, defeating both Adeoti and Yusuf.\n\nHowever, a faction of the party loyal to the Minister of Interior, Mr Rauf Aregbesola, alleged that the election was marred by irregularities.\n\nA statement issued by the publicity secretary of the faction, Mr Abiodun Agboola, alleged that the election was marred by a series of irregularities attributed to the faction loyal to Oyetola.\n\nAgboola said: \u201cWe strongly condemn the conduct of the primary election because it is nothing but a sham with a fraudulent process to favour Governor Adegboyega Oyetola.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

          "text": "\u2022Minister cries foul, Adeoti heads to court\n\n\u2022Buhari, APC govs to decide new date for national convention\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo\n\nGovernor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State yesterday won the governorship primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) held in the state.\n\nOyetola was backed by the National Leader of the APC, Senator Bola Tinubu.\n\nThis is coming as President Muhammadu Buhari and the governors elected on the platform of the APC will decide a new date for the party\u2019s National Convention following the clash of the February 26 proposed date for the exercise with some off-season elections earlier scheduled by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nOyetola also defeated his main challenger for the APC governorship ticket, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, at Ifofin Ward 8 of the Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, in Ilesa East Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe Osun State governor won in Aregbesola\u2019s ward with 309 votes against 146 recorded for Adeoti, the aspirant anointed by Aregbesola.\n\nThe two aspirants, who contested with Oyetola were former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Lasun Yusuff and a former Secretary to the State Government, Adeoti.\n\nAnnouncing the result in the early hours of today, at the state\u2019s APC secretariat in Osogbo, the Chairman of Osun APC Primary Election Committee and Kwara State Governor, Mr. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, said accredited voters were 247,207 while the total number of votes cast was 235,550.\n\nOyetola polled 222,169 votes to beat Aregbesola\u2019s candidate, Adeoti, who scored 12,921, while Lasun came a distant third with 460 votes.\n\nBefore the primary election, Aregbesola had attacked Oyetola\u2019s main backer and his estranged godfather, Tinubu, telling him that the same treatment meted out to a former Lagos State governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, which foreclosed his re-election bid in 2019, would be administered on his brother, Oyetola.\n\nHowever, Aregbesola was absent from the primary election and was said to have left Ilesa for Abuja yesterday morning for unspecified official duty.\n\nWhile the minister has threatened to explore legal means to obtain justice, alleging that the results of the primary election were \u201cfarcically counted in favour of the governor,\u201d Adeoti has vowed to seek Oyetola\u2019s disqualification in court.\n\nReacting to the election in a statement issued in Osogbo, the state capital yesterday, Adeoti vowed to head to court to challenge what he referred to as \u201cpyrrhic victory\u201d won by Oyetola.\n\nHe accused the governor of rigging the election with the apparent backing of the National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party.\n\nAdeoti said the ugly development in Osun APC has sent a wrong signal as to whether the APC has a future in the state.\n\nHe also accused Oyetola of using intimidation and violence to ensure that the primary election was not free and fair.\n\n\u201dThere was violence in Olorunda Local Government where the Ward 3 Chairman of the Rasaq Salinsile-led APC in Olorunda Local government, Mr. Sala Ademola and his secretary, Mr. Ajisefini were kidnapped. Our supporters were also disenfranchised in all the wards in Ife East by not being accredited and being intimidated with thugs wielding dangerous weapons.\u201d\n\nHe also accused a top chieftain of APC of taking over the electioneering process in Ife and halting the accreditation process, sending out his supporter using thugs, while allowing and counting party members from the governor\u2019s group.\n\nThe APC governorship aspirant also alleged that the Osun State government procured the services of armed policemen who aided the well-choreographed rigging of the election.\n\n\u201dThere was also a massive influx of unregistered members of the party who voted with the connivance of the heavily-compromised National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, of which Oyetola is a member. Overall, there was a massive disenfranchisement of registered APC members in all my strongholds during the so-called primary election.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that there was no way any primary election conducted in the state would be fair if Oyetola remains a member of the CECPC.\n\n\u201cGovernor Oyetola\u2019s membership of the NCECPC is against the democratic norms. We dare say that this is capable of causing disquiet, more than we are facing in Osun APC now, if allowed to pass us by.\n\n\u201cWe are reliably informed that Governor Oyetola is the one who hand-picked the Chairman and members of the primary election committee. It is within human reasonability not to trust such handpicked committee by an interested party member. Such committee would never be fair to other contenders.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, express absolute opposition to the outcome of the election because they were chosen by Governor Oyetola. There can only be point of convergence for us if Governor Oyetola could resign his membership and the process of conducting the primary begins afresh,\u201d Adeoti explained.\n\nAdeoti argued that Oyetola\u2019s participation in the election was a violation of the provision of Article 31(iii) of the APC Constitution (2014) as amended which says: \u201cAny party office holder interested in contesting for an elective office (whether party office or office in a general election) shall resign and leave office 30 days prior to the date of nomination or party primary for office he or she is seeking to contest\u201d.\n\nHe said the process had been orchestrated from the beginning to manipulate the outcome in favour of Oyetola, which was why the date of the primary was changed from March 5 to February 19.\n\n\u201cWe have it on good authority that the NCECPC was influenced by Oyetola to reverse the date to have the primary before the National Convention scheduled to hold on February 26, 2022. It is believed that Oyetola is afraid of contesting a free and fair primary election to be conducted by an objective committee after a neutral leadership of the party would have emerged,\u201d Adeoti alleged.\n\nHe however appealed to his supporters to be calm, vowing to seek a legal redress.\n\nAlso reacting in a statement by his media\u2019s aide, Mr. Sola Fasure, the interior minister and Adeoti\u2019s main backer alleged that the results of the governorship primary were \u201cfarcically counted in favour of the governor.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have received and continue to receive the reports of the shenanigans of the officials who conducted the sham of an election.\n\n\u201cWe have been inundated with reports state-wide of how your names were expunged from the party\u2019s voters\u2019 register, which was not made available until this morning, contrary to the convention of making the list available to the candidates before the election.\n\n\u201cWe have heard of how party registration cards were being hawked this morning to the supporters of the state governor.\n\n\u201cYou are urged not to take laws into your hands. Please leave the rest to the Almighty God and let us explore all peaceful and legal means for addressing the matter in order to obtain justice,\u201d Aregbesola explained.\n\nThe Publicity Secretary of the Aregbesola-backed faction of the party in the state, Mr. Abiodun Agboola, in a statement issued, said: \u201cWe strongly condemned the conduct of the primary election because it is nothing but a sham with a fraudulent process to favour Governor Adegboyega Oyetola\u201d.\n\nHe alleged that there were no records and result sheets in any of the 332 wards of the state.\n\nThe Chairman of the anti-Oyetola faction of the party in the state, Mr. Rasaq Salinsile, who is from Ward 04, Isale-Oba in Iwo Local Government Area also told THISDAY that the election was fraudulent.\n\nOyetola had expressed confidence that he would emerge victorious in the primary election.\n\nThe governor, who applauded the members of the party for turning out in large number said, \u201closing was not an option for a man commissioned by God for an assignment.\u201d\n\nOyetola spoke shortly after he cast his vote at Ward 1, Boripe Local Government Area, Iragbiji.\n\nHe lauded Osun people for conducting themselves peacefully, saying the peaceful conduct of the election has testified to the fact that Osun remains the most peaceful state in the country.\n\nThe governor noted that news of violence making the rounds were mere speculations.\n\n\u201cI just want to appeal to all our people across the state to maintain peace. Election process should not be a battlefield or a do-or-die affair. Let everyone exercise his/her right to choose in determining who represents them at the party level and ultimately at the general election,\u201d Oyetola added.\n\nAlso commenting on the election, the Chairman of Osun APC Governorship Primary and Kwara State Governor, AbdulRazak, also hailed the peaceful conduct of the exercise.\n\nHe applauded APC members for the huge turnout and their peaceful conduct.\n\nHe spoke with journalists after monitoring the election in Iragbiji, the hometown of Governor Oyetola.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you open the pages of newspapers today, what was painted was a picture of the war in Osun. But the primaries election has been peaceful. I congratulate the people of Osun and all the aspirants. They have all done well.\u201d\n\nBuhari, APC Govs to Decide New Date for National Convention\n\nMeanwhile, President Buhari and the governors elected on the platform of the APC will decide a new date for the party\u2019s National Convention.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that this development followed the clash of the February 26 proposed date for the exercise with some off-season elections earlier scheduled by the INEC.\n\nA source close to the APC National Caretaker Committee told THISDAY at the weekend that the clash of the proposed convention with the national elections was brought to the attention of the party after it had written to notify INEC of its intention to hold the national convention.\n\n\u201cElections are national issues that cut across political parties and therefore, it is not expected that party affairs should overshadow national elections. The stakeholders will meet and come up with a new date not beyond two to three weeks,\u201d the source explained\n\nOn whether INEC has been notified, the source said that the electoral body would be notified after the proposed meeting between Buhari, the APC governors and the members of the caretaker committee.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "* Electoral Bill 2022 still inchoate, commission clarifies\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has stated that the 2023 general election is not encumbered and will hold as planned, beginning with the presidential poll scheduled for February 18, 2023.\n\nResponding to speculations that it might postpone the scheduled conduct of the 2023 general election if President Muhammadu Buhari signs the Electoral Bill after February 22, 2022, INEC\u2019s National Commissioner in charge of Publicity and Chairman of Voter Education, Mr Festus Okoye told THISDAY that the commission was not in any form of dilemma relating to the exercise of its constitutional and legal powers.\n\nOkoye stated that the commission was focused and working proactively to deliver on its mandate.\n\nAccording to Section 28 (1) of the Electoral Bill 2022, INEC is required to issue a notice of election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for an election.\n\nThe Executive Director of Yiaga Africa, Mr Samson Itodo, had reportedly stated that in line with the Electoral Bill 2022, the deadline for the commission to issue the notice of election for the 2023 general election will be February 22, 2022, \u201cthe reasons being that the total number of days from February 22, 2022, to February 17, 2023, is 360 days.\u201d\n\nBut Okoye told THISDAY that the speculations and anxiety relating to the shifting of the date of the 2023 elections were based on the Electoral Bill 2022 which, according to him, is still inchoate.\n\nAccording to him, the existing and extant electoral legal framework for the conduct of elections remains the Constitution and the Electoral Act.\n\nHe insisted that the electoral body was in synch with the constitutional provisions relating to the period for the holding of elections, adding that the provisions are sacrosanct and cast in stone.\n\n\u201cThe commission is only permitted to orbit around the constitutional timelines in fixing the date for the holding of elections.\n\n\u201cThe commission is a regulatory body guided by the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as altered), the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended) and its Rules, Regulations and Guidelines.\n\n\u201cAs of today, the existing and extant electoral legal framework for the conduct of elections remains the Constitution and the Electoral Act and the commission will continue to rely on its provisions for electoral continuity, pending any amendment to the said law.\n\n\u201cBy the commission\u2019s Regulations and Guidelines made pursuant to the powers conferred on it by the Constitution and the Electoral Act, the 2023 general election will hold on the 18th of February 2023,\u201d Okoye explained.\n\nHe argued that the scheduled date is in consonance and in conformity with sections 132(1) and 178(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria that gives the commission the exclusive right and power to appoint the date for the holding of Executive and Legislative Elections subject to the timelines and schedule circumscribed in Sections 132(2) and 178(2) of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cBy the said sections, election to executive positions shall hold not earlier than December 30, 2022, and not later than April 29, 2023, while legislative elections shall hold not earlier than 10th January 2023 and not later than May 10, 2023.\n\n\u201cBy Section 30 of the existing and current Electoral Act, the commission shall give notice of the holding of the elections not later than 90 days to the said election and this remains the law and the commission is in good standing relating to its timelines and schedules,\u201d Okoye added.\n\nThe INEC commissioner said that the speculations and anxiety relating to the shifting of the date of the 2023 elections were based on the Electoral Bill 2022 which is still inchoate.\n\nAccording to him, Section 28 of the said Bill requires the commission to give notice of election not later than 360 days to the said election, stressing that the said 360 days will elapse in the next few days.\n\nHe said that the commission was also aware that Section 58 of the Constitution gives the President 30 days to assent to the Bill or withhold his assent.\n\n\u201cThe commission is aware that the Bill was transmitted to the President on January 31, 2022. The members of the National Assembly and the Executive are aware of these timelines in the Bill and the implications of the timelines if the Bill is assented to and these are issues that can be adjusted and streamlined.\n\n\u201cThe commission desires an expeditious resolution of the issues surrounding the new electoral legal framework as there are creative and innovative issues and provisions in the Bill that will enhance and advance the electoral process and our democracy.\n\n\u201cThe commission is focused and will continue with its preparations for the conduct of the 2023 general election. If there are challenges with timelines, the commission will meet, assess those challenges and remain within the constitutional and legal confines in sections 132(2) and 178(2) of the Constitution that requires that elections to executive positions to hold not earlier than December 30, 2022, and not later than April 29, 2023, while legislative elections shall hold not earlier than January 10, 2023, and not later than May 10, 2023,\u201d he explained.\n\nSome civil society groups had declared February 22, 2022, National Day of Protest on the Electoral Bill\n\nThe groups said they were aware that the National Assembly transmitted the Bill to the President on January 2022.\n\nThey said that they were also aware the Bill allows for electronic transmission of results, strengthens INEC\u2019s financial independence and empowers the commission to reject falsified election results.\n\n\u201cThe bill, when signed, requires INEC to issue Notice of Election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for an election. Therefore, the President has to give assent to the bill on or before 22nd February 2022 if the dates announced for the 2023 elections are to be maintained.\n\nAccordingly, they said that they have resolved to declare Tuesday, February 22, 2022, as the National Day of Protest to demand immediate assent to the bill.\n\n\u201cWe urge citizens across the nation to call on President Muhammadu Buhari to act on this matter of urgent national importance\u201d.\n\nThe CSOs that signed the statement include Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room, Yiaga Africa, Partners for Electoral Reform (PER), International Press Centre Institute for Media and Society, Nigerian Women Trust Fund, The Albino Foundation, Centre for Citizens with Disability, Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ), Labour Civil Society Coalition (LASCO), Transition Monitoring Group, CLEEN Foundation, and Civil Society, Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC).\n\nOthers include: Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC), Nigeria Network of Non-Governmental Organisations (NNNGO), Inclusive Friends Association (IFA), Enough is Enough (EIE), The Electoral Hub, Centre for Liberty, Take Back Nigeria Movement, International Peace and Civil Responsibility Centre (IPCRC),100 Women Lobby Group, Women in Politics Forum, Raising New Voices, Millennials Active Citizenship Advocacy Africa and Ready to Lead Africa.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Many heads will roll. So far, all parties concerned are saying what they know. The government is not taking it lightly. Security agencies are on it,\u201d a presidency source told THISDAY.\n\n\u201cIt has security and economic implications. Investigations will involve all of them and heads will roll.\n\n\u201cAt corporate and individual levels, they are cooperating and providing information about their involvement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not out of place to investigate. Do you expect such a thing will happen without investigation when the president has ordered a probe?\n\n\u201cCritical players are being invited. The probe will be very comprehensive and heads will roll. Everyone, who played whatever role will be established\u201d, another source explained.\n\nThe NMDPRA had alerted Nigerians over its discovery of petrol imported into the country that contained methanol above Nigeria\u2019s specification.\n\nThe methanol-blended petrol, which is not made for Nigeria, made its way into the country.\n\nThe quantity was said to be within the range of 200 million litres.\n\nThe NNPC handles all the imports through its \u2018Crude-for-fuel\u2019 contracts, also known as Direct Sale, Direct Purchase (DSDP).\n\nThe agency conducted the business through a consortium of local and foreign oil firms.\n\nEach consortium is said to have received about 20,000 barrels per day of crude oil in exchange for products, making the combined total of about 320,000bpd of Nigeria\u2019s output.\n\nThe consortium, according to NNPC, includes MRS, Oando, EMADEB/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania and Duke Oil.\n\nThe NNPC, consequently, accused the four petroleum suppliers it engaged in the swap-crude-for-petrol of culpability.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, later promised that government would compensate those whose car engines were affected by the toxic fuel.\n\nBut the contractors denied responsibility.\n\nDespite NNPC\u2019s Efforts, Petrol Queues Persist in Abuja, Lagos\n\nMeanwhile, many filling stations were still under lock and key in Abuja and Lagos yesterday while the few that were selling petrol had long queues, despite the desperate efforts by the NNPC Limited to bring the situation under control in the last one week.\n\nMajority of the dispensing centres visited by THISDAY in the two major cities did not have the product while those that were selling, including the NNPC, had long queues of buyers lined up.\n\nRecently, the national oil company had taken a multi-pronged approach to halt the pains encountered by Nigerians as a result of the nationwide fuel shortage.\n\nAmong other measures, the NNPC had announced that between last week and the end of February, it was expecting at least 2.3 billion litres of the product to berth in Nigeria.\n\nAlthough in the last few days, there had been considerable movement of trucks within Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), many of the streets had remained clogged by traffic due to the prevailing condition.\n\nIn addition, the NNPC stated that in collaboration with other stakeholders, it was embarking on a 24-hour service, noting that Nigerians could buy the product round the clock in filling stations.\n\nBesides, it announced that at the moment, the nation has over one billion litres of petrol in stock, adding that all the fuel in circulation in the country is now certified safe after successfully withdrawing the bad fuel that disrupted supply.\n\nBut THISDAY observed that many filling stations were still not selling the product yesterday, despite all the measures put in place by the sole supplier.\n\nIn both Lagos Island and the mainland, long queues of vehicles were seen at the few filling stations selling petrol.\n\nIt was also a brisk business for the \u2018black market\u2019 operators, who were selling one litre of the product for N300 \u2013 N500, depending on the location.\n\nAt Oando in Mabushi, near the Ministry of Works in Abuja, the gates were still locked while there was no petrol at Total filling station on Sultan Abubakar way, Zone 1, although cars were in the queues.\n\nThere were also no sales at the Enyo filling station, near GSM Village, and the Total Filling Station on Herbert Macaulay Street.\n\nBut at the NNPC mega station on Olusegun Obasanjo Way, sales were ongoing, but a long queue of almost one kilometre was observed.\n\nHowever, unlike in the past two weeks when motorists blocked the road, some level of sanity has returned.\n\nIn the outskirts of Abuja, motorists and commuters were still largely stranded due to their inability to access petrol to get to their destinations.\n\nMany commuters were forced to abandon their vehicles on the road in frustration.\n\nAt the Karshi, Orozo, Jikwoyi axis of the FCT, motorists spent hours in queues waiting to be served in the few filling stations that had the product to sell.\n\nLong queues were also on both sides of the Karshi-Nyanya expressway, causing gridlock that stretched down the roads for kilometres.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "* Says inflows from Eurobond, SDR will boost forex supply\n\nFestus Akanbi\n\nAmid a spate of measures being put in place by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to reduce pressure on the nation\u2019s foreign exchange market, analysts from Coudros Securities have expressed confidence in the capacity of the apex bank to meet the forex demand with inflows from the recently issued Eurobond and the IMF\u2019s Special Drawing Rights (SDR).\n\nIn its Weekly economic and market update titled: \u2018Overview of markets in the week ended 18 February 2022,\u2019 the securities company also stressed the need to attract more foreign portfolio investments to sustain liquidity inflow to the economy.\n\nThe analysts argued that the current low level of crude oil production has weakened foreign reserves accretion, a development which they said necessitated the implementation of policies that would encourage the inflow of foreign portfolio investments.\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cthe CBN has enough supply to support the FX market over the short term, given inflows from the recently issued Eurobond and the IMF\u2019s SDR.\n\n\u201cHowever, foreign inflows are paramount for sustained FX liquidity over the medium term, in line with our expectation that accretion to the reserves will be weak given that crude oil production levels remain pretty low.\u201d\n\nThe report called for additional measures to attract FPIs, insisting that: \u201cThus, FPIs which have historically supported supply levels in the IEW (53.8% of FX inflows to the IEW in 2019FY) will be needed to sustain FX liquidity levels. Hence, we think (1) further adjustments in the NGN/USD peg closer to its fair value and (2) flexibility in the exchange rate would significantly attract foreign inflows back to the market.\u201d\n\nAs of last week, Nigeria\u2019s foreign reserves was $40.7 billion almost at the $42 billion thresholds set by the apex bank for mid-2022.\n\nLast year, Nigeria was able to raise $4 billion through Eurobonds, which financial analysts described as a reflection of investors\u2019 confidence in the economy.\n\nThe Debt Management Office (DMO) had in a statement explained that the Order Book peaked at $12.2 billion, which enabled the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) to raise $1 billion more than the $3 billion it initially announced.\n\nThe Eurobonds were issued in three tranches, details, namely seven years \u2013,$1.25 billion at 6.125 per cent per annum; 12 years -$1.5 billion at 7.375 per cent per annum as well as 30 years -$1.25 billion at 8.25 per annum.\n\nAlso last year, the board of governors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had approved the allocation of $3.35 billion to Nigeria as part of a historic general allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) of the International Multilateral Institution.\n\nSDRs are international reserve assets created by the IMF and allocated to members to supplement existing official reserves. Holdings of SDRs by an IMF member are recorded as an asset, while the allocation of SDRs is recorded as the incurrence of liability of the member receiving them.\n\nEarlier this year, the CBN announced a new scheme to improve dollar supply, known as Bankers\u2019 Committee \u201cRT200 FX Programme\u201d, which stands for the \u201cRace to $200 billion in FX Repatriation.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Governor of CBN, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, \u201cthe RT200 FX Programme is a set of policies, plans and programmes for non-oil exports that will enable us to attain our lofty yet attainable goal of $200 billion in FX repatriation, exclusively from non-oil exports, over the next 3-5 years.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Oba Of Benin In Modern Slavery Scandal, Uses Influence To Detain Palace Aide Who Served Him From Age 15 In Prison For Months, Denies Him Bail Over Allegation Of Stealing",
          "text": "The Oba of Benin in Edo State, Oba Ewuare II, is currently enmeshed in modern-day slavery scandal and an alleged violation of human rights of one of his palace aides, Nelson Oghogho \u2013 a 20-year-old who was detained by the police for months and remanded in prison over an allegation of stealing.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Oghogho, who joined the palace in 2016 as a 15-year-old boy, was also denied bail by the police who were reportedly acting on \u201cpalace instructions.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the palace detained Oghogho and another palace aide, identified only as Bright, from May to August 2021 when they were taken to court and the two had been in prison ever since.\n\n\u201cSo everyone is scared of the big name and the family of this boy is really helpless now; He was detained since May 31, 2021. The strange part is that they even denied his bail even when it was a case of someone being accused of stealing,\u201d a source said.\n\n\"It may also interest you to know that these people are doing everything possible to sweep this issue under the carpet so people don\u2019t know about it and they constantly give the impression that Nelson must serve some time for this outrageous allegation.\n\n\"Some time ago, Nelson tried to run away from the palace because of the maltreatment and hardship he had endured. You should also know that his poor parents who are farmers have not been spared by this cruel monarch as their few hard-earned landed properties have been seized and they are constantly at risk.\n\n\n\n\"They have done all they can to beg and are still begging and saying he (Oba of Benin) should have their properties in exchange for their son\u2019s freedom but to no avail. In my opinion, this is a pure case of modern slavery and this should not be tolerated.\n\n\"They are just using influence to keep the poor guy in prison, he was supposed to have been granted bail but they denied the bail, the state council opposed it and they are all trying to please the king.\"\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Oghogho and the other were accused of stealing N200 million cash from the palace.\n\nHe was charged with stealing and conspiracy\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters, a top source revealed that the allegation of stealing N200 million cash from the palace was both frivolous and inhumane.\n\n\u201cHow is it humanly possible for a 20-year-old boy to steal the sum of N200 million in cash from the palace with all the security and pageantry without being noticed and traced? Even a bullion van will hardly hold that much money. It may also interest you to know that these people are doing everything possible to sweep this issue under the carpet.\n\n\"Initially, he (Oba of Benin) said it was $20,000, then, he said N10 million, when he saw that he wasn\u2019t getting as much solidarity. He started increasing it till now it\u2019s currently N200,000,000, which he is accusing Nelson of stealing.\n\n\u201cThe state council gave some flimsy excuses that Nelson will run off if granted bail while his lawyer sat there and said nothing. Seemingly they\u2019ve all been bought over. His lawyer later suggested that we should go for an appeal for the bail and charge an outrageous sum of N1 million,\u201d he said.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the palace aide now 20 years old (to turn 21 this year), wrote some notes while in remand, detailing how his ordeal at the Oba of Benin\u2019s palace started.\n\nHe is being remanded in Oko correctional centre in Benin City.\n\n\n\nIn the notes written by the accused while in prison, and obtained by SaharaReporters on Friday, Nelson said, \u201cBefore reading this book, things you need to know; one, I have been serving the King (Oba Ewuare II) for five years plus. I have been serving without off day, break or relaxation time. I work 365 or 366 days a year.\n\n\u201cI am not on any payroll, I don\u2019t receive any salary. My family don\u2019t get any benefit or compensation. They haven\u2019t received anything from the palace. My education got tampered with since I got to the palace because the school is not functioning well and no proper equipment or lab. I was over-laboured.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have fixed working hours. Sometimes I do work from morning (6am) till midnight (12am); sometimes till dawn. I don\u2019t have time for myself because I was occupied. I was being maltreated. I have photo proof. I was always beaten and threatened every day. I was just waiting for the whole issue to die so I can leave because it was becoming more unbearable. I called my parents and I explained everything to them; I even told my friends. They all advised me to just bear that maybe everything will soon be over.\n\n\u201cIt all started when an issue arose on May 15, 2021, about some missing cash in the King (Oba Ewuare\u2019s) inner chamber. I happen to be one of the close aides to him. So one of my colleagues, Bright, was detained on that same day; May 15 for questioning.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile I was still doing my daily routine without knowing how the whole matter was going. I was beaten and threatened to confess about my colleague (Bright) that I saw him taking the money. But I refused to do so because I never saw him taking the money. Truth be told, it wasn\u2019t very easy; I couldn\u2019t run because they would falsely accuse me. Though I kept on complaining to the person that brought me (Rowland), he kept telling me to keep calm that I can run when everything is over. He told me everyone will conclude I am the one who took the money if I run.\n\n\u201cOn May 31, Rowland told me that I was going to the State Criminal Investigation Department to write a statement that Bright mentioned my name in his statement ad I was really confused because I don\u2019t even know what he was talking about. So I walked up to his car and entered there. I heard a lot of rumour that police can torture you and you will start confessing what you didn\u2019t do. I was really scared.\n\n\u201cThen I asked Rowland if I could go home from the police station because all I wanted in my life was freedom. So I told Rowland I was going to confess that I saw Bright and Igwe coming out from the inner chamber with brown envelope but I don\u2019t know what was inside; that they gave me some cash later that day not to tell anyone I saw them.\n\n\u201cThe story was made up, no incident like that ever occurred. I wanted to get myself involved so I will be chased from the palace and I see that as the only way to freedom. So Rowland drove me to the State CID with two bouncers who they were going to detain too. We met the Commander, anti-cultist unit and I wrote my statement in his office. I was surprised that after writing the statement, Rowland left me there and I was detained on May 31, 2021. At first, I thought Rowland was going to inform the king so that I would be sent home as we both agreed. But I never heard from him for more than a week. I waited for weeks but he never showed up but kept giving excuses when called.\n\n\u201cI was detained for two months, a week and a day. (May 31 to August 8, 2021); my parents never visited nor called to check up on me. It was my girlfriend that kept on bringing food to me. It wasn\u2019t really easy though.\n\n\u201cNote that my parents\u2019 property; a house on 100 by 100 and extra land were seized by the palace even before investigations started. The properties have not been returned yet.\n\n\u201cSo after being detained again on October 25, 2021, we were charged to court. We were taken to a High Court for a stealing case. We were remanded in Oko Prison on October 26, 2021, as awaiting trial persons.\n\n\u201cSo on a fateful day, we were called for a visit by some prison wardens that there were some visitors from the palace. On getting there, we saw Dennis Osaretin, Oyaniyen and one other palace functionary who I assume the palace sent to check to see if we were really suffering.\n\n\u201cTomorrow is Christmas and I am still in prison; worst Christmas ever not for me though because I always celebrate it without going out or having fun but it\u2019s actually the worst Christmas for my family. How are they going to celebrate Christmas knowing their son, brother is in prison? Don\u2019t really know how they feel now but I still give thanks to GOD.\u201d\n\nFrank Irabor, Secretary of Benin Traditional Council, told SaharaReporters that the monarch is too big to respond to such allegations, especially as the matter is in court.\n\n\"I don't understand the case you are talking about, the case is in court, do you want Omo n'Oba (Oba of Benin) to react to that?\n\n\"If someone is detained, even for one year, that is at the discretion of the judge or the agency handling the case. They will want to continue to remand the person, maybe to conclude their investigation.\n\n\"They should not drag Omo n'Oba into it at all; he is too big for that. So there is no need to say the palace or the secretary should react. Let the court handle it. Please, he is too big for that,\" Irabor said.\n\nOba of Benin in Modern Slavery Scandal, Uses Influence to Detain Palace Aide Who Served Him From Age 15 in... by Sahara Reporters on Scribd",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Oba Of Benin In Modern Slavery Scandal, Uses Influence To Detain Palace Aide Who Served Him From Age 15 In Prison For Months, Denies Him Bail Over Allegation Of Stealing",
          "text": "The Oba of Benin in Edo State, Oba Ewuare II, is currently enmeshed in modern-day slavery scandal and an alleged violation of human rights of one of his palace aides, Nelson Oghogho \u2013 a 20-year-old who was detained by the police for months and remanded in prison over an allegation of stealing.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Oghogho, who joined the palace in 2016 as a 15-year-old boy, was also denied bail by the police who were reportedly acting on \u201cpalace instructions.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the palace detained Oghogho and another palace aide, identified only as Bright, from May to August 2021 when they were taken to court and the two had been in prison ever since.\n\n\u201cSo everyone is scared of the big name and the family of this boy is really helpless now; He was detained since May 31, 2021. The strange part is that they even denied his bail even when it was a case of someone being accused of stealing,\u201d a source said.\n\n\"It may also interest you to know that these people are doing everything possible to sweep this issue under the carpet so people don\u2019t know about it and they constantly give the impression that Nelson must serve some time for this outrageous allegation.\n\n\"Some time ago, Nelson tried to run away from the palace because of the maltreatment and hardship he had endured. You should also know that his poor parents who are farmers have not been spared by this cruel monarch as their few hard-earned landed properties have been seized and they are constantly at risk.\n\n\n\n\"They have done all they can to beg and are still begging and saying he (Oba of Benin) should have their properties in exchange for their son\u2019s freedom but to no avail. In my opinion, this is a pure case of modern slavery and this should not be tolerated.\n\n\"They are just using influence to keep the poor guy in prison, he was supposed to have been granted bail but they denied the bail, the state council opposed it and they are all trying to please the king.\"\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Oghogho and the other were accused of stealing N200 million cash from the palace.\n\nHe was charged with stealing and conspiracy\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters, a top source revealed that the allegation of stealing N200 million cash from the palace was both frivolous and inhumane.\n\n\u201cHow is it humanly possible for a 20-year-old boy to steal the sum of N200 million in cash from the palace with all the security and pageantry without being noticed and traced? Even a bullion van will hardly hold that much money. It may also interest you to know that these people are doing everything possible to sweep this issue under the carpet.\n\n\"Initially, he (Oba of Benin) said it was $20,000, then, he said N10 million, when he saw that he wasn\u2019t getting as much solidarity. He started increasing it till now it\u2019s currently N200,000,000, which he is accusing Nelson of stealing.\n\n\u201cThe state council gave some flimsy excuses that Nelson will run off if granted bail while his lawyer sat there and said nothing. Seemingly they\u2019ve all been bought over. His lawyer later suggested that we should go for an appeal for the bail and charge an outrageous sum of N1 million,\u201d he said.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the palace aide now 20 years old (to turn 21 this year), wrote some notes while in remand, detailing how his ordeal at the Oba of Benin\u2019s palace started.\n\nHe is being remanded in Oko correctional centre in Benin City.\n\n\n\nIn the notes written by the accused while in prison, and obtained by SaharaReporters on Friday, Nelson said, \u201cBefore reading this book, things you need to know; one, I have been serving the King (Oba Ewuare II) for five years plus. I have been serving without off day, break or relaxation time. I work 365 or 366 days a year.\n\n\u201cI am not on any payroll, I don\u2019t receive any salary. My family don\u2019t get any benefit or compensation. They haven\u2019t received anything from the palace. My education got tampered with since I got to the palace because the school is not functioning well and no proper equipment or lab. I was over-laboured.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have fixed working hours. Sometimes I do work from morning (6am) till midnight (12am); sometimes till dawn. I don\u2019t have time for myself because I was occupied. I was being maltreated. I have photo proof. I was always beaten and threatened every day. I was just waiting for the whole issue to die so I can leave because it was becoming more unbearable. I called my parents and I explained everything to them; I even told my friends. They all advised me to just bear that maybe everything will soon be over.\n\n\u201cIt all started when an issue arose on May 15, 2021, about some missing cash in the King (Oba Ewuare\u2019s) inner chamber.

          "text": "Years after getting court judgments ordering their reinstatement into the naval service, Dada Labinjo and his wife, Sherifat Ibe-Lamberts (also known as Bola Labinjo), say the Nigerian Navy is yet to comply.\n\nThis is in spite of letters sent to the office of the vice-president and the attorney-general of the federation (AGF), seeking the intervention of the federal government.\n\nHOW IT STARTED: IBE-LAMBERTS\u2019 STORY\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1997, Ibe-Lamberts, who was a lieutenant-commander in the navy at the time, appeared before a court martial on a five-count charge, including an allegation of unauthorised visit to a foreign mission.\n\nOn July 12, 1997, Sherifat was convicted and sentenced to two years of loss in seniority by the court martial. When the naval board ratified the conviction, the sanction was upgraded to compulsory retirement as contained in a letter dated February 2, 1998.\n\nIn the letter seen by TheCable, the naval board said her service was \u201cno longer required,\u201d adding that the retirement will take effect from January 21, 1998.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDissatisfied with the conditions for retirement, Ibe-Lamberts filed a suit against the navy and the case went up to the appeal court. In December 2005, the appeal court ruled in her favour and set aside the ruling of the court martial.\n\nSubsequently, the navy proceeded to the supreme court to request that the lower court\u2019s judgment be set aside. In September 2007, the supreme court dismissed the navy\u2019s appeal for lack of merit.\n\nLABINJO\u2019S EXPERIENCE\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLabinjo, who was then a navy captain, was accused of offences ranging from disobedience of superior order to alleged involvement in oil bunkering.\n\nIn 2001, a court martial convicted Labinjo and sentenced him to six years imprisonment with a recommendation of dismissal. He subsequently approached the federal high court in Lagos to seek a dismissal of the ruling of the court martial on the basis that it was a breach of his fundamental human rights.\n\nOn May 3, 2004, the federal high court in Lagos declared the trial null and void for gross irregularities and breach of the fundamental human rights of the respondent. The court also ruled that Labinjo should be restored to his pre-trial position in the navy with payment of arrears of salaries and allowances.\n\nHowever, the navy, through its counsel, filed a notice in the appeal court on May 31, 2004, and followed it up with an application filed on August 19, 2004.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn May 2008, the court dismissed the appeal filed by the navy for want of diligent prosecution, following the refusal of the navy to file \u201cmore legible copies\u201d of the exhibits of the case presented to the lower court.\n\nThe navy, thereafter, approached the supreme court on the grounds that the appeal court was wrong to dismiss its suit without the opportunity to put forward its case, which the navy said violated its right to a fair hearing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn June 2012, the supreme court ruled that the appeal was without merit and affirmed the decision of the lower court.\n\nREINSTATED \u2014 BUT \u2018WITHOUT PROMOTIONS AND ENTITLEMENTS\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a series of letters written by the couple\u2019s counsel to the ministry of justice, in 2015, Taiwo Abidogun, the solicitor-general at the time, wrote to the defence minister to ask for the navy to comply with the court rulings.\n\n\u201cThis matter has a chequered history, having traversed the hierarchy of courts to the Supreme Court and back. In the circumstances, it is advised that it is in the best interest of the Nigerian Navy to comply with the judgment at the earliest possible time as it is worrisome for agencies of government to be seen in defiance of valid and subsisting court judgments,\u201d the letter reads.\n\n\u201cHowever, in complying with this judgment, the Nigerian Navy may take steps to negotiate the amount to be paid to the claimant. This ministry volunteers its services to act as mediator to facilitate a negotiation between the parties.\u201d\n\nOn April 11, 2017, the couple received letters notifying them of their reinstatement into the force.\n\nBefore his dismissal, Labinjo, who joined the navy in 1975, held the rank of captain, while Ibe-Lamberts joined the navy in 1984 and held the rank of lieutenant-commander at the time of her dismissal. The letters of reinstatement, however, did not state anything on benefits or promotions.\n\nAgain, the couple wrote to the naval authorities requesting that all previous promotions and entitlements be effected in line with the time that had passed. In 2018, the navy, in its response to the letters on payments of corresponding benefits, insisted that the court \u201conly ordered the reinstatement of the senior officers to the Nigerian Navy and nothing more\u201d.\n\nDETENTION AMID LEGAL DISPUTE\n\nWhile the couple awaited the navy\u2019s position on full reinstatement, on September 13, 2018, Labinjo was arrested and detained in an underground cell. The next day, his wife was arrested. They were accused of conspiracy and unlawful dealing in petroleum products.\n\nThe couple spent months in detention amid calls for their release, including interventions by Femi Falana, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), as well as a court order directing that they be freed.\n\nEventually, Ibe-Lamberts was released in August 2019, while Labinjo was released on December 3, 2019. They were then handed over to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for prosecution over alleged offences bordering on oil bunkering. The next court appearance on the EFCC case is scheduled for March 2022.\n\nAPPEAL TO AGF, OSINBAJO\n\nWhile the couple awaits the navy on full reinstatement, several letters have been written to the office of the AGF and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, seeking their intervention on the matter.\n\nIn July 2021, the couple, through their counsel, wrote yet another letter to the AGF.\n\n\u201cThe implication of the judgments in respect of the 2 officers is that the courts have granted accrued promotions to the officers as follows: \u2018Capt DO Labinjo: Commodore with effect from July 2003; Rear Admiral with effect from July 2006; Vice Admiral with effect from March 2011; Admiral with effect from April 2013; and Lieutenant Commander SA Ibe-Lamberts: Commander with effect from 27 August, 1998; Captain with effect from 27 August, 2004; Commodore with effect from 27 August, 2009; Rear Admiral with effect from 27 August. 2013,\u201d the letter to Malami reads.\n\n\u201cIt is on this note, sir, that we humbly request the honourable minister and attorney-general of the federation to use his esteemed office to cause the Nigerian Navy to restore our clients to where they ought to be, by granting their accrued promotions to rear admiral and admiral, respectively, and immediate retirement from the service of the Nigerian Navy thereafter and the payment of all their accrued emoluments, entitlements, gratuity and pensions respectively.\u201d\n\nIn October 2021, the AGF forwarded the petition to the navy, asking for comments to enable him to take an \u201cinformed decision\u201d on the matter.\n\n\u201cI am directed to forward the above mentioned petition dated 12th July, 2021 with reference No: MLC/NN/07-21/01 addressed to the honourable attorney general of the federation and minister of justice by Marina Law Chambers on behalf of the client. A copy is herewith attached for ease of reference,\u201d the AGF\u2019s letter to the navy reads.\n\n\u201cI am further directed to request for your comments to enable the honourable attorney general of the federation take an informed decision on the matter.\u201d\n\n\u2018WE WANT FULL REINSTATEMENT\u2019\n\nSpeaking with TheCable on behalf of the couple, Labinjo said after full reinstatement and receiving payment for all previous entitlements, they will willingly resign from service, since they have exceeded the required years of service.\n\n\u201cWe are asking for three things. One, they (referring to navy) should re-employ us in line with the court order. The meaning of reinstatement is to re-employ the person,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTwo, restore the person. If you reinstate somebody and you did not restore, you haven\u2019t done anything. Would you have done justice? To restore us, they need to get us all the promotions accrued to us during the litigation period.\n\n\u201cThat same day, accept our resignation from the navy. My 35 years\u2019 service in the navy should have ended in 2010, while that of my wife is 2019. All our mates have retired.\n\n\u201cNone of us is technically employable in the navy but they should do documentation, re-employ us, at the same time, accept our resignation and pay us all our previous entitlements and emoluments accrued during the litigation period.\u201d\n\nNAVY YET TO RESPOND\n\nWhen TheCable reached out to Suleman Dahun, navy spokesperson, he asked that a letter be sent to the navy seeking an explanation on the Labinjo and Ibe-Lamberts case.\n\nThe letter was sent via the email address provided by the navy spokesperson but no response had been received at the time of this report.",

          "text": "Pan-African fintech firm Flutterwave on Friday announced a rebrand of its logo and dashboard as well as the addition of small business lending, fintech-as-a-service (FaaS), and more to its suite of offerings.\n\nThe announcement comes 2 days after Flutterwave confirmed it had raised $250 million in a Series D round that tripled the company\u2019s valuation to over $3 billion. Led by founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, the company facilitates cross-border payments transactions of small-to-large businesses in Africa via one API.\n\nIn a virtual event themed \u201cFlutterwave 3.0\u201d, Africa\u2019s most valuable startup and payments giant rolled out a series of products and services including FaaS services for embedded finance, SME loans for its users, card issuance for a wide array of clients while announcing the addition of Apple Pay and Google Pay to its payment options.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFlutterwave Capital, the new SME loans product, is offered in partnership with the company\u2019s lending partners\u2014CashConnect Microfinance Bank, MoneyWise Microfinance Bank, Wema Bank, Zenith Bank, Stanbic IBTC Bank, and Sterling Bank.\n\nThe new product will enable businesses \u201ceasily access loans without collateral, cumbersome documentation, and other stringent terms and conditions,\u201d a blog post on Flutterwave\u2019s website reads, adding that eligible applicants can access the funds they need in less than 2 business days.\n\n\u201cWith Flutterwave Capital, we\u2019re making it easier for business owners to access the funds they require to grow their businesses. Business owners can expand, increase inventory, hire more labour, pay bills, run marketing campaigns, and ultimately grow revenue with these funds,\u201d the company said.\n\nCurrently, only Flutterwave businesses in Nigeria can access loans but the company says it is working to make it available to its businesses in South Africa, Kenya, and other markets where it operates.\n\nAs regards the fintech-as-a-service solution, Flutterwave is opening up its infrastructure to allow other companies to use its APIs to embed financial capabilities into their existing applications, products, and services.\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s FaaS service provides a unified tech stack that includes KYC, account opening, debit card issuance, payments, and real-time transfers through a single endpoint, account servicing, and compliance.\n\nThe solution helps companies bypass the often gruelling work of building the infrastructure, integrating multiple, disparate financial systems, licensing, and compliance required in building and offering consumers digital financial services.\n\nFlutterwave also helps businesses outside Africa expand their operations on the continent with an international clientele that includes Booking.com, Flywire, and Uber.\n\nThe new set of offerings and features is in line with Flutterwave\u2019s ambitious product expansion drive. Last year, the company launched Flutterwave Market for merchants to sell their goods via an online marketplace and, most recently, Send, a remittance service that empowers customers to seamlessly send money to recipients to and from Africa.\n\nIn March 2021, the San Francisco-headquartered and Lagos-based startup raised $170 million in a Series C round at a valuation of $1 billion. The latest financing thus brings its total investments secured since launched in 2016 to $475 million (plus a $35 million Series B in 2020 and a $20 million Series A in 2018).\n\nThe $3 billion valuation sees Flutterwave surpass the $2 billion mark set by SoftBank-backed fintech OPay and FTX-backed cross-border payments platform Chipper Cash last year.\n\nCurrently, Flutterwave has an infrastructure reach across 34 countries on the continent and processes 200 million transactions worth more than $16 billion. More than 900,000 businesses globally use its solution to process payments in 150 currencies and across different payment modes: local and international cards, mobile wallets, bank transfers, and its consumer product Barter, which now allows for multicurrency wallets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Crypto crime grows to $14 billion as crypto popularity increases",
          "text": "In 2021, crypto criminals made a killing, as illicit crypto transactions hit $14 billion, a 79% jump from the $7.8 billion recorded in 2020, according to a report by US-based blockchain analytics company, Chainalysis.\n\nThe growth in illicit crypto transactions is attributed to a 567% jump in overall transaction volume in 2021. Given that overall crypto transactions grew to $15.8 trillion in 2021, it is not surprising that cybercriminals are increasingly using crypto. Despite the increase in the total volume of illicit transactions, illicit transactions represented just 0.15% of the total cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2021\u2014its lowest ever. What this means is that legitimate crypto transactions far outstrip illegal transactions.\n\nScams and theft ranked as the highest source of crypto crime and decentralised finance (DeFi) contributed most part of the funds stolen, the report shows. Scamming revenue jumped 82% to $7.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen from victims. Over $2.8 billion of this total were stolen through a new type of scam called \u201crug pull\u201d. A rug pull is a type of scam where developers disappear with the money invested in crypto projects or exchanges that appear legitimate.\n\nCryptocurrency theft also jumped 516% to roughly $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen in 2021. With 72% or 2.2 billion of those funds stolen from DeFi protocols.\n\nDeFi is a term for a financial ecosystem of tools and applications running on any blockchain that allows an individual to pay, lend, borrow, or store funds without intermediaries such as traditional financial banks.\n\nDeFi saw the biggest year-on-year growth\u20141,964%\u2014for laundering activities, while mining comes second place at less than 500% growth. The Chainalysis report attributed this growth to the hype around the DeFi space: incredible returns on decentralised tokens like Shiba Inu, which encourages people to speculate on DeFi tokens, and the ease of creating DeFi tokens\u2014all of which caused its transaction volume to grow by 912% in 2021.\n\nWhile Chainalysis acknowledges the huge opportunities DeFi presents to crypto users and entrepreneurs, it believes widespread theft and scamming will not allow it to realise its full potential. It suggested that the public and private sectors should engage in communication to teach investors how to avoid dubious projects. Although it noted that, as a long term strategy, the industry may need to prevent \u201ctokens associated with potentially fraudulent or unsafe projects from being listed on major exchanges\u201d.\n\nApart from crypto-based transactions or revenue, the Chainalysis report also shows that the volume of cryptocurrency owned by addresses on the blockchain that it has traced to criminal actors has increased from $3 to $11 billion. This data is important, Chainalysis noted, because it represents how much can be theoretically retrieved by law enforcement agencies. Stolen funds accounted for 93% of such criminal balances, at $9.8 billion; followed by Darknet market funds at $448 million; scams at $192 million; fraud shops at $66 million; and ransomware at $30 million.\n\nIn a separate analysis by Chainalysis, in the same report, 4,068 criminal whales hold over $25 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Chainalysis describes a criminal crypto whale as any private wallet holding $1 million or more worth of cryptocurrency that has received more than 10% of its funds from illicit addresses. It is important to note that the above figure of criminal whale balance won\u2019t align with the overall criminal balance because it calculates all the holdings in the private wallet (both legal and illegal) while the overall criminal balance calculates only holdings of addresses tagged as illicit. Criminal whales represent just 3.7% of all cryptocurrency whales\u2014private wallets holding over $1 million worth of cryptocurrency.\n\nDespite the massive increase in crypto crime, a positive development is the growing ability of law enforcement agencies to seize illicit cryptocurrency from criminals. For example, America\u2019s Internal Revenue Service criminal investigation (IRS-CI) seized, over the course of 2021, over $3.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Also in the US, the Department of Justice (DOJ) also seized $2.3 million worth of cryptocurrency from the operators of DarkSide ransomware, responsible for the attack on Colonial Pipeline. London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) seized \u00a3180 million worth of cryptocurrency from a suspected money launderer.\n\nEarlier this month, the United States arrested and charged a couple, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, for allegedly conspiring to launder stolen cryptocurrency worth 119,754 bitcoin, which is now worth an estimated $4.5 billion. The couple had allegedly laundered the bitcoin stolen in the 2016 hack of cryptocurrency exchange, Bitfinex, but the stolen bitcoin were worth $74 million at the time, a tiny fraction of their current value. The US Justice Department was able to recover more than $3.6 billion of the laundered $4.5 billion worth of bitcoin, despite the couple\u2019s sophisticated laundering technique that saw them shuffle the funds using crypto tools and techniques like unhosted wallets, a darknet marketplace, chain hooping, peel chain, and privacy coin. The agency has labelled the operation its largest financial seizure ever.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Ckrowd\u2019s plan to help African creators monetise their content",
          "text": "The term \u201ccreator economy\u201d became popular throughout 2021 when venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and independent creators not only threw the phrase around but also invested heavily in the content industry\u2014an industry that would leapfrog into becoming a $100 billion industry.\n\nContent creators\u2014writers, artists, social media influencers, videographers, gamers, podcasters\u2014are raking in millions of dollars annually by monetising their craft. But only a tiny fraction of these creators are Africans. This means African creators are still struggling to earn much from their craft, compared to their global counterparts.\n\nTwo things may have caused this: one is, global payment networks like Paypal that should connect African creators with the rest of the world have shut Africans out of their network; secondly, lack or shortage of efficient local creator platforms that connect the rest of the world directly to African creators.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile there are some companies already building to solve the first problem, Ckrowd, a content streaming platform and marketplace, is solving the second problem at scale.\n\nCkrowd is positioning itself as the platform that bridges the gap between African content creators or suppliers and their global content consumers by providing creators with the opportunity to earn income while giving \u201cunique, exclusive, and engaging content experiences to their consumers\u201d.\n\nCkrowd was founded out of a will to do more\n\nCkrowd was founded by Olukayode Adebayo in November 2020. But before then, Adebayo, who was freshly back to Nigeria after a stint with the Nigerian embassy in China, had founded a real estate company that morphed into a hospitality business. He then started a media outfit in September 2016, called KAM Africa.\n\nAt KAM Africa, Adebayo started an initiative that would help creative professionals like musicians and actors understand the business part of their craft. But as he continued with the initiative, he realised that there was a need to bring all these promising enterprises together. Nobody builds in isolation, especially in the entertainment scene. So KAM Africa started Amfest, a festival-like event that brings together African creative businesses.\n\nAdebayo\u2019s cross-continental experience helped Amfest to quickly scale out of its founding country Nigeria into Ghana, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, and even Dubai.\n\n\u201cWe started building business partnerships with other platforms and scaled very fast. It was in the process of supporting the sector that we found out that many of these talents that are now enterprises had a problem with anything that doesn\u2019t involve physical human interaction,\u201d Adebayo told TechCabal. \u201cAt the point of this discovery, COVID-19 happened and it became even clearer as most of them were left without income. So, there was a need to bring them online.\u201d\n\nThe next thing to build became apparent; Ckrowd\u2014the solution to these persistent problems. After doing a lot of research and consultations throughout 2020, Adebayo launched the beta version of Ckrowd early last year and then launched publicly in August.\n\nHow Ckrowd works\n\nThe platform is a direct-to-consumer platform where original and exclusive African content in education, information, and entertainment is distributed directly to local and global consumers in short videos and live stream format. Think of a marriage between OnlyFans, Patreon, and YouTube\u2014in fact, a combination of all the streaming platforms out there\u2014but now for African content.\n\nLast year in December, uduX, a Nigerian streaming platform, partnered with telecoms giant MTN to live stream Wizkid\u2019s \u201cMade in Lagos\u201d concert from London\u2019s 02 Arena to over 238,000 Africans. But the event was quickly moved to YouTube after the day one of the three-days concert. Regardless of what might have caused the relocation, it\u2019s, however, an indication that Africa needs more efficient indigenous platforms that can aggregate content and put more money in the pocket of local creators while providing a seamless experience for local and global consumers.\n\nFor Adebayo, Ckrowd is taking an all-encompassing approach to building for the African creator economy, one that\u2019s a win-win for all the stakeholders.\n\nTo better understand CKrowd\u2019s advantage, let\u2019s look at how existing streaming platforms work: On YouTube, for instance, creators make money according to their view numbers and sometimes from ads. This means, if YouTube pays $0.0001 per view, you\u2019ll need 10,000 views to make $10. In the case of Netflix, let\u2019s say you subscribe at $10 per month, what happens if you are too busy for Netflix that month? Will you be refunded? No!\n\nFrom the creator\u2019s end, 10,000 views for $10 is not sustainable. How many African creators hit hundreds of thousands of views or millions? A small number. For consumers, the subscription model is not good if you can\u2019t flip unused subscriptions.\n\nOn Ckrowd, creators can livestream their content like uduX live and upload on-demand contents like on Netflix. Creators also control their spaces and how they want to be paid\u2014per view or by subscription. Unlike on social media platforms where creators, after creating content and amassing views and followers, would have to go outside the platform to market their views and followers to brands, Ckrowd lets creators set their prices and make their money as they go. It also allows viewers to select how they wish to pay for content\u2014all inside the platform.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to deliver economic value to African creators. The platform pays 70% of total income on content to creators, which we believe is the highest pay-out on digital content to African creators,\u201d said Adebayo.\n\nCkrowd is not only for music and film content; educational, culinary, sports, and other forms of content are allowed on the platform.\n\n\u201cThe Ckrowd platform is similar to a large arena in the cloud where you can broadcast live & short on-demand video content and charge access fees on behalf of the creators of that content. This allows the platform to uniquely function as an edtech, mediatech and adtech hybrid,\u201d said Adebayo.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nCkrowd, from 4 users at its beta launch, has grown to have over 2,000 users on its platform. Last year in October, it raised $160,000 in pre-seed funding; $60,000 of equity funding, and $100,000 export grant investment from an international angel investor group, as well as backing from the Export Expansion Facility Programme from Nigerian Energy Support Programme (NESP).\n\nCkrowd plans to use the new capital to expand with new innovative technologies and strategies to get more customers, accelerate growth and promote intra-African creative industries. In addition to that, the company plans to hire more talent, especially in product, Research and Development (R&D) and engineering.\n\nAccording to Adebayo, the startup has already made headway in some of these plans. It acquired a marketing agency last year to power the ads sector of its business. The company said the agency\u2019s channels had access to about 50 million people across Africa, which means Ckrowd can now reach these people through email, SMS, and other channels available. This sounds like a transfer of data without the consent of the owners; however, if these people opted in with the marketing agency, which has now been acquired, then, by extension, they have opted in with Ckrowd.\n\nThe startup also recently announced the appointment of the founder and director of Music Works International Katherine McVicker and co-founder of Cultural Connections of Africa (CCA) Adeleye Fabusoro as executive members to its advisory board. Adebayo also said the company has built its own production studio and is currently partnering with other media houses across the continent, He hinted that they [Ckrowd] will soon start rolling out the results of the partnerships.\n\nCkrowd is taking on big players like Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, ShowMax, uduX and even cable television channel who\u2019ve got their claws deep in the streaming market. Will it curve, niche down, or dominate? This is not an easy one to predict but from Adebayo\u2019s confidence in the product and their pan-African play, there\u2019s something to root for in Ckrowd.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Please, leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nSolving critical bankend freight industry challenges\n\nEarnipay\u2019s plans to reach 200,000 employees\n\nSolving critical backend freight industry challenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all know Africa lags in terms of modern technology adoption. For example, some freight companies in Africa still manage their shipments using outdated methods like spreadsheets, phone calls, and emails.\n\nFor most of them, multiple software platforms are used to complete various tasks. However, some platforms combine these software to make their work easier, faster, and more effective.\n\nOne of such companies is Freterium, a Moroccan startup that offers a single software that serves multiple functions. And this company has announced $4 million in seed funding to expand across the country and into neighbouring regions.\n\nPartech, a San Francisco-based investor, led the round. CDG Invest, Y Combinator, Flexport, Swiss Founders Fund, Outlierz Ventures, and a few angel investors from the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa were among those who took part.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Mehdi Cherif Alami (CEO) and Omar El Kouhene (CPO), the company creates a comprehensive approach to addressing critical backend challenges in the freight industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Alami, Freterium onboarded more than 20 enterprise customers in its first full year of operation, growing 35% month over month. Over 3,000 people also use its software.\n\nHe also said that the funds would be used to invest in the company\u2019s research & development activities, hire more talent to double the current size of its team within the next 12 months, market its software, and expand across Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.\n\nEarnipay\u2019s plans to reach 200,000 employees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarnipay, a fintech solution startup that provides income-earners with flexible and on-demand salary access, has raised $4 million in a seed round to provide on-demand salaries to African employees.\n\nThe round was led by VC, Canaan. It also saw participation from XYZ Ventures, Village Global, Musha Ventures, Ventures Platform, Voltron Capital, and Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade.\n\nNonso Onwuzulike officially launched the company in January 2022 to improve employees\u2019 financial well-being. It accomplishes this by utilising technology to allow employees to deposit their paychecks into their accounts in a flexible, real-time, and interest-free manner.\n\nEarnipay collaborates with employers and integrates seamlessly with their payroll systems to provide its services to employees, who can then track and withdraw their accrued salaries via the app.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the company will use the seed funding to speed up the development of its platform to serve large enterprise employers. It will also provide employees with the tools to make better financial decisions and improve their quality of life.\n\nBy the end of 2022, the company plans to offer its on-demand salary solution to 200,000 employees.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nMost people with EUPD/BPD aren\u2019t manipulative \u2013 but often those around us can be.

But Meta says it has to process data across continents because it is crucial for ad targeting.\n\nAd targeting or not, the European leaders are very adamant about the new rule. Germany\u2019s new economy minister Robert Habeck said, \u201cAfter I was hacked, I have lived without Facebook and Twitter for four years, and life has been fantastic.\u201d\n\nMeta could be on the receiving end of its threat to the EU as it closed with a market cap below $600 billion on February 8, 2022, losing daily active users for the first time in its 18 year existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWhy female founders should learn the venture capital game\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s $3bn valuation\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\nWomen should play the VC game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, women got less than 1% of startup funding. Sadly, the statistics have been quite similar in previous years.\n\nWhy is it this way? \u201cGetting funded is a bit of a game.\u201d \u2014 the words of Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures.\n\nAccording to her, women need to learn the rules of the VC game and know what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nEnygma Ventures has spent two years teaching women what venture funding requires. Dusek started the firm when she realised how difficult it was for women to access capital.\n\nIn her chat with Chimgozirim, she detailed the rules and tactics that could mean better odds for women in winning the venture capital game. Read all about it here: Female founders need to learn how to play the venture capital game\u2013 Sarah Dusek\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s $3bn valuation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlutterwave has come a long way since it was founded in 2016. The San Francisco-headquartered fintech startup broke into unicorn status last year after a $170 million raise led by New York-based private investment firm Avenir Growth Capital and US hedge fund and investment firm Tiger Global.\n\nIn just 12 months, Flutterwave has tripled that valuation after a $250 million Series D raise announced yesterday, February 16, 2022. The raise was led by global investment firm, B Capital. Leader of its $170 million Series C. Avenir Growth also participated in the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTripling its valuation isn\u2019t the only thing the fintech company has achieved since attaining unicorn status 12 months ago. Businesses using its platform have increased by 610,000 \u2014 290,000 to 900,000.\n\nIts total transaction, valued at $9 billion last year, has grown to $16 billion with 200 million transactions processed.\n\nAlthough Flutterwave started out as an enterprise payment fintech startup, it has detoured into creating fintech products for small and medium businesses and remittance products over the years.\n\nIn 2020 we saw the launch of Flutterwave Store revamped to Flutterwave Market in 2021. The platform now boasts 30,000 merchants according to TechCrunch. Flutterwave\u2019s remittance service, Send, also launched recently to help customers send money within and outside Africa.\n\nAway from fintech: Flutterwave also displayed interest in the creator economy with the acquisition of Disha, a platform that allows creators to curate content and receive payment. However, the payments feature still falls within Flutterwave\u2019s court.\n\nIPO insight? If you\u2019re planning on investing in Flutterwave via stocks the CEO and Co-Founder, Olugbenga Agboola, told TechCrunch that the startup has no plan to IPO anytime soon. The funding will be geared towards its ambitious expansion plans and rapid customer acquisition.\n\nIf you want to go down memory lane before Flutterwave became a mammoth in the African tech space, you can start with the story of Agboola\u2019s first day as CEO.\n\nPlease read here: In conversation with Olugbenga Agboola on his first day as Flutterwave CEO\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions to financial inclusion most times comes in two ways online or offline. However, some people, like Twitter user, Mudia, are of the opinion that the former isn\u2019t true financial inclusion. Mudia sums up his opinion up in a tweet that reads,\n\n\u201cBanking the un-banked, but your solution na app wey dey work from Android 11 upwards.\u201d\n\nMost people with a similar stance believe a solution to financial inclusion that requires a smartphone isn\u2019t practical as most smartphone users are already banked. According to Dataphyte, a media research and data analytics organisation, 38 million Nigerians were financially excluded in 2020.\n\nFintech startups like OPay and TeamApt are tackling the problem with agent banking, taking physical banking services to hard-to-reach locations.\n\nHowever, these agents still need banks to get cash, and that\u2019s where CrowdForce, which announced its $3.6 million pre-Series A yesterday comes in.\n\nThe startup offers agency banking services like OPay and TeamApt, but agents do not need to visit banks to get cash. It solves this problem by partnering with cash-heavy small businesses like fuel stations, converts them to mobile bank branches and stores their cash on PayForce digital wallet, its flagship product.\n\nCrowdForce has partnered with 19,000 fuel stations to broaden its network. It plans to grow its 7,000 agent network by three times a year.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nScientists Created a Cyborg Fish Powered by Beating Human Heart Cells.

          "title": "Female founders need to learn how to play the venture capital game \u2014 Sarah Dusek",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA cursory look at the venture capital landscape in Africa will reveal an impressive number of deals and the triumph of innovation over regulation. Yet, a closer look at the numbers will show a wide gulf between the amount of money raised by men and women.\n\nWhile funding for female founders globally is minimal, African women have seen significantly less money than their male counterparts, receiving less than 1% of startup funding in 2021. One reason for this is that most female-led businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa are small businesses with little capacity for scale.\n\nAccording to Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures, who spoke to Techpoint Africa on Zoom, a second reason is that most women don\u2019t know how to play the venture capital game.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest components that we\u2019ve been working on for the last couple of years has been not knowing how you play this game, and getting funded is a bit of a game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are very specific rules to it; there are specific metrics that people like me are looking for. There are specific types of businesses that work and those that don\u2019t, particularly with this type of funding. Women are more familiar with taking debt and grants, and I think there are a lot of unfamiliarities in the space that disadvantages women.\u201d\n\nDue to this, Dusek, an entrepreneur, revealed that a huge part of Enygma Ventures\u2019 work in the last two years has been teaching women what venture funding requires. She also added that the presence of a few role models makes it harder for women to raise money.\n\nWith venture capital a novel concept in Africa, not too many people, regardless of gender, understand how it works. Therefore, the lack of knowledge plays a role in how women access funding. \u201cIf you know, you can build it,\u201d she said.\n\nHelping women build scalable businesses\n\nBuilding a business is a daunting task for anyone, but it can often seem like an impossible task when you\u2019re a woman. Centuries of restricting the participation of women in the economy to the informal sector have led to a small number of women in the workforce. Dusek knows this all too well, having built and sold Under Canvas, an American hospitality company.\n\nAfter selling Under Canvas, Dusek, who started her career working with non-governmental organisations in Africa, decided to invest in female founders. That decision birthed Enygma Ventures, a sector-agnostic firm providing women with the capital required to scale and grow their businesses.\n\n\u201cMy experience of being a female founder made me realise how hard it is for women founders to get access to capital, and so it\u2019s a natural progression from being an entrepreneur to being a guide to helping other women do the same thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Dusek, Managing General Partner, Enygma Ventures\n\nEnygma Ventures invests in early-stage women-led or women-founded startups across the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East Africa. The ticket sizes for startups the firm invests in vary from $100,000 to as much as $1 million. While the firm is sector-agnostic in its approach to investment, Dusek disclosed that it would not invest in startups that cannot scale.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we look at is the size of the addressable market. So how big is the problem you\u2019re trying to address, and how big could you be?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe quality of the team is another factor that Enygma Ventures considers, with Dusek revealing that they like to see proof that founders have created value. Since opening its doors in 2019, the firm has invested in over 12 women-led startups, including Adbot, Koa Academy, Candor, Premier Credit, Play Sense, and Lupiya.\n\nBiggest mistakes entrepreneurs make\n\nAn entrepreneur\u2019s path is filled with uncertainty. Many of the problems they face are unanticipated or not taught in schools. Consequently, they are likely to make quite a few mistakes. Dusek shared a few that she has seen in her time.\n\nBuilding a venture-backed business means working to meet certain milestones, and Dusek revealed that many early-stage founders are not clear on what these milestones should be.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge with early-stage founders is recognising what your major milestones are. We talk a lot about the valley of death, which is this early-stage era in a startup\u2019s life where it\u2019s very easy for startups to crash and burn and die, or they make it to the next level.\n\n\u201cThe big challenge for startups is how to manage their available cash and get to the next level because if you\u2019re a company that\u2019s taking on venture capital in the early stages, the likelihood is that you\u2019re going to raise more capital to keep growing,\u201d she noted.\n\nThe next frontiers in Africa\n\nWhile there are quite a few factors responsible for the low level of funding that women get, my conversations with various founders and investors suggest that one major factor is that there are not enough women building scalable businesses. Venture capital is, in many ways, a numbers game, and the more women there are building companies that investors like, the higher the chances of women receiving investments.\n\nSo, what industries does Dusek want to see more women play in? Pretty much every industry that can drive economic development in Africa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see more women building any kind of business. I think we\u2019ve got a few frontiers to move the continent forward, and I\u2019d love to see more women pioneering. I think we have huge opportunities in education, healthcare, financial services, and almost anything where we are trying to raise the standard of living for millions.\u201d\n\nIn the early 2000s, the growth of the African middle class and mobile phone penetration, amongst other developments, gave birth to the term \u201cAfrica rising.\u201d Yet, most African countries have failed to live up to the hype. However, a few people still hold out hope that the new crop of entrepreneurs can spearhead the development of Africa.\n\nDusek believes that African economies have a distinct advantage as they do not have to make bite-sized changes but could leapfrog certain developments.\n\n\u201cI am super passionate about Africa\u2019s ability to lead. I feel like so often, we wait for the world to allow us to come to their party, and Africa is at this moment where she has to lead and build her own future, and that\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nVenture capital can be complicated, but Enygma Ventures wants to demystify it. Prospective founders can head over to the website, where an eligibility quiz helps both parties to determine if they\u2019re a good fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n1 \u201c Wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise\u201d Prov. 20:1\n\nAlcohol has turned many in our street to be stupefied. They become object of ridicules and mockery. When alcohol makes them rage they find themselves in a state of extreme anger which in itself is uncontrollable like a mad man. That is why any one who is a new creature cannot go by it nor be deceived by it.\n\nSatan has his strategies; he teaches those who have not given their lives totally to Christ two words to swallow: \u201cDrink moderately\u201d or sometimes: \u201cdrinkbut not drunk\u201d that is Satan\u2019s strategy. He will not tell his disciples do not drink at all. He knows that would keep them entirely from strong drink from alcohol although he knew what that Angel of God told Manoah\u2019s wife: \u201cthou art barren and bears not: but thou shelf conceive, and tear a son. Now therefore, beware, I pray thee and drink not wine or strong drink, and eat not any Maclean thing.\u201d Judges 13:3-4 she obeyed God. But Eve did not obey God. Manoah\u2019s wife did not allow any suggestibility from Satan. Satan would have been capable of suggesting to Manoah\u2019s wife to stick to alcohol but should drink moderately so as not to cause any miscarriage or harm to the child in the womb.\n\nMany people have fallen because they listened to Satan\u2019s suggesting. And he brings his suggestions to people in a subtle way.\n\n2.In a new life one cannot be deceived by Satan. \u201cDrink a little, drink moderately\u201d. That is Satan\u2019s subtle way of opening the door of alcoholism to those who have not totally surrendered to Christ for a new life, for to be a new creature, for to allow old things to pass away and to allow one to be born again. So Jesus was blunt in telling Nichodemus the truth, the gospel truth: \u201cExcept a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\u201d John 3:3.\n\nMany have been deceived into alcohol because they see Priests and Pastors who drink alcohol. The other day I was with some one who still opposed to doing away withalcohol entirely. He was gladdened and satisfied in his heart that Archbishop so and so was drinking alcohol; Bishop so, so and so, mentioning them by their names were drinking alcohol; that Provost so, so and so was drinking alcohol going by names; Cannon so, so and so going by their names were still with alcohol; that Venerable so, so and so going by their names were drinking alcohol; that it was only the present Bishop so, so mentioning his name that preached to his ministers, priests that they should forsake alcohol entirely but that some of the priests were still in alcohol secretly. That was one in his church narrating what he knew. Another could also narrate what goes on in his church concerning alcohol. We can see what great havoc that can be caused when people looking at their leaders see what they do or hear what they say.\n\nMany hundreds, many thousands, many millions have fallen into sin by what they see their leaders do. It is pathetic, disturbing and heart breaking. You look at this scripture: \u201cBut they also have erred throughwine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the Priests and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink\u2026.. Alltables are full of vomit and blitheness so that there is no place clean\u201d. Isaiah 28:7-8.\n\n3.Let those who delight in alcohol forsake their alcoholism and accept Jesus Christ and never seeking any hiding place in the bad examples of their leaders:\u201cmany pastors have destroyed my vineyard and \u2026\u201d Jer. 12:10. What you have to do now if you still drink alcohol, is to come truly to Christ and surrender your life to him and ask for a new life. He will surely do that for you. Be wise and not be deceived into alcohol.\n\nThere is no drunkard throughout all ages that ever agrees that he was at any time drunk. And there is no one in drunkenness that ever agrees that he is a drunkard.\n\nSatan has not relented in his ministrations. To you; he has not relented in whispering to you in his subtle way that you will be in a happy mood when you are in alcohol. Be ware of his suggestibility it is capable of pulling you out of the Christian way. If is capable of removing God\u2019s word from you and replacing it with deceit and unbeliever.\n\nRemember that all that God would use would be filled with the Holy Spiritand not with alcohol or strong drink. Paul was one; Peter, John, Stephen etc were filled with the Holy Spirit. Ask Jesus today to fill you with the Holy Spirit and there will be a change. Remember Hab.2:15\u201cwoe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink\u2026\u201d The end was that the neighbour became naked.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Directives will be given to the school management in that regard.\n\n\u201cFor all concerned, year three students are expected to graduate by the normal school calendar on the 18th of this month, while year two students are expected to finish by September this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernment is working so hard to ensure that the Edo College of Education with three campuses kicks off by the end of this year,\u201d she disclosed.\n\nOsa-Oviawe further noted, \u201cThe Edo State Government frowns at the admission exercise that management of the institution are still engaged in despite the fact that the government has enacted a law to repeal the old school and another to establish a new school.\n\n\u201cEdo College of Education is yet to take off but the College of Education, Igueben no longer exists. The directive of phasing out existing students was given and the management was warned not to bring in new ones, but this position was not adhered to.\n\n\u201cThis is the administrative paralysis that the ministry of education will be going in right away to clean up.\u201d\n\nThe Commissioner stated, \u201cThe government is re-organising the school; in time past, the College never had enough money to provide quality teaching despite offering all the programmes.\n\n\u201cThe new College has been streamlined to focus on different areas. Igueben is the main campus and it will focus on training secondary school as well as technical and vocational education teachers. Abudu is one of the campuses focusing on training early childhood and basic education teachers.

This election process should not be a battle field. It should not be a do or die affair. There should be no violence. Let everybody have the opportunity of participating. I think that\u2019s the process and I think it has gone very well contrary to the speculation\u201d\n\nThe governor who is optimistic of winning the election said members of the party have witnessed tremendous achievements recorded in his first term and would present him for second term to allow continuity of the good work he has started.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll win by the grace of God. I want to appeal to all of us to see this issue as a family affair. It\u2019s APC all through. We should brace up for the challenge ahead. We are going to face another party in this campaign we don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the deputy governor, Mr. Benedict Alabi said the exercise so far was peaceful, devoid of rancour and well organised.\n\n\u201cPeople have assembled since 8am. Everybody here seems to be agog. I am happy we are having a peaceful, free and fair election. The fact is that there is only one candidate that is contesting the primary in Osun and that\u2019s the incumbent governor.\n\n\u201cWe have the other faction with other two aspirants. They are not even visible in this community.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the state Commissioner for Finance, Hon.

          "text": "The Chief Executive Officer, 9PSB, Branka Mracajac, has emphasized the need to pay close attention to content creation as an important factor in driving and accelerating financial inclusion in the country, stating that it is capable of enhancing the future of digital banking in the long-term.\n\nMracajac made this assertion, while presenting a keynote address, themed \u201cContent Creation and Financial Inclusion; The Future of Digital Banking\u201d at the Tech Summit Ogun 2022, which held at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library Abeokuta, Ogun State on Thursday February 17, 2022.\n\nAccording to her, while there are ongoing efforts to support the country\u2019s financial inclusion drive, a lot more rest on formulating tailored strategies that address specific needs. \u201cProviding access to the banking agents and touch points, across the country is happening as we speak; payment service banks,\n\nmicrofinance banks, and FinTech companies are all working on this. But will this be enough? Will the access to digital banks change the mindset of Nigerians in rural areas of the country and be enough to drive the transition from cash to cashless society?\u201d she questioned.\n\nProffering the way forward, Mracajac stressed the need to provide financial literacy through content that speaks to an average Nigerian in unserved rural areas of the country, stating that financial inclusion is a process, not just a point in time and space that we want to reach.\n\nShe added that, developing content that speaks only to the already banked and mirroring the digital financial habits of those who are fully included and heavily banked, will not help to keep the newly on-boarded in the system long-term.\n\nShe stated: \u201cWhile creating and delivering the content for financial inclusion, we need to have in mind the needs of its beneficiaries, the targeted end-users of the financial services who are currently underserved and the only sustainable way is that we join our forces and create the content \u2013 apps and services that will address the specific needs of a farmer in Benue, market women in Onitsha, trader in Kano, fisherman in Delta, and the woman selling ofada rice in Ogun State.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, she noted that, to drive the offline individuals and MSMEs from cash to cashless, from analog to digital and from informal to formal, content creators need to focus on two major goals; one, to deliver relevant and on-point digital financial literacy content, educating people about the principles, ways, modules, and benefits of banking. The second one, she stated, is needed for sustainable Financial inclusion: delivery of digital banking services that are a reflection of the lifestyle of the currently unbanked and underserved population.\n\nShe called on all stakeholders within the financial ecosystem, including content creators to work collectively to develop and implement a digital content strategy for the unbanked to move the financial inclusion needle and ultimately advance the economy, society and improve life of every Nigerian.\n\nIn his own keynote address, titled \u201cDisruptive Innovation: Production and Distribution of Creative Content, the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, who was represented by the Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited (NIGCOMSAT), Dr. Abimbola Alale remarked that the quality of creatives and start-ups that Nigeria has produced is a testament to the potential of the ecosystem, and as such the ministry will continue to support the tech and creative entrepreneurs to play their part in developing Nigeria\u2019s digital economy.\n\nThe Tech Summit Ogun is an annual convergence of Tech disruptors, innovators, startups, organizations and technology enthusiast in Ogun State, aimed at spurring technological innovation towards the digital transformation and technological advancement of Ogun State. This year, the summit attracted over 2000 participants, mainly the youths and start-ups.",

          "text": "As part of conscious efforts to change the negative narrative about Nigeria\u2019s oil-rich Niger Delta, young professionals have tasked governors of the region to invest more in human capacity development and create purposeful opportunities for young people, especially entrepreneurs and start-ups, to thrive.\n\nThe position was canvassed by stakeholders, who gathered at the 2nd Niger Delta MSME Summit held on Saturday, February 19, in Asaba, Delta State, with the theme: \u2018Stimulating MSMEs Growth Towards Post Covid-19 Recovery\u2019.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey advocated that governments of the Niger State States must move away from the political tradition of just signing and awarding contracts, to strategic empowerment and support for innovative creative minds in the region.\n\nThe event jointly organised by the Niger Delta Young Professionals (NDYP) and the Nigerian Young Professionals Forum (NYPF), was sequel to the pioneer edition held in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital in February, 2021.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDelivering his opening remarks at the event, the chairman of the NYPF and convener of the summit, Mr Moses Siloko Siasia, explained that the event was aimed at creating a platform for young business owners to interface with agencies of government and stakeholders on how best to access information, credit, support facilities, as well as build strategic relationships and networks.\n\nThe summit according to him, will also go a long way in changing the wrong perceptions of militancy and other forms of youth restiveness that many associate the region\u2019s youthful population with.\n\n\u201cToday, if you go to Google and search for Niger Delta youths, what you will see are youths with guns inside speed boat and all those bad stuffs. We must change that, we must change that negative narrative, this is not the narrative of the Niger Delta people, our leaders must help us to change that narrative because the time for politics is over in today\u2019s world.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe are in the 4th industrial revolution where people are using digital intelligence and technology to change the worlds economies. We must conform to modern reality and that is why we are doing this MSME Summit to help our young people, so that they can build the capacity to create sustainable livelihood for themselves, their family and the society,\u201d he said.\n\nSiasia further called on successful businessmen from the region the CEO of Heirs Holdings, Tony Elumelu; group managing director of Access Bank, Herbert Onyewumbu Wigwe; chairman of Zenith Bank, Jim Ovia; founder of Stanbic IBTC Bank, Atedo Peterside, CON, and many others, to deliberately leave footprints from their region, stressing that charity begins at home.\n\nLending his voice to Siasia\u2019s call, CEO of BlueCamel Energy Limited, Mr Suleiman Yusuf, lamented that successful people were not enjoying the full proceeds of their wealth, owing to youth restiveness and numerous forms of insecurity arising from the absence of platforms to productively engage them.\n\n\u201cSuccess has found its way to the long list of problems we have in Nigeria because successful people in private industry or government cannot freely enjoy their wealth. They live in highly fortified houses, travel in armoured vehicles and cannot move around without armed personnel.\n\n\u201cThis problem exists because there are no jobs and support mechanisms to promote the spirit of entrepreneurship among youths. Unless jobs and created and young people are engaged, there will be no peace in the Nger Delta and other regions. Government and well to do individuals must begin to allocate resources towards human capacity development, especially for young people who are leaders of tomorrow,\u201d he submitted.\n\nOn his part, the executive secretary of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Engr. Simbi Wabote, represented by the Board\u2019s General Manager, Capacity Development, Dr. Ama Ikuru, acknowledged that Nigeria ranks poorly in terms of human capacity development index.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe discussions we are having at this Summit can change the narrative. We want to see the emergence of young entrepreneurs and support them to succeed. We want to put tools in their toolboxes to ensure the security and economic prosperity of our nation.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that the NCDMB has interventions in place to help promote entrepreneurship such as the $350m Nigerian Content Intervention Fund to help businesses in the oil and gas industry access finance, Wabote added that the Board will continue to associate and support anything that is in the best interest of the good people of Nigeria, especially its vibrant youth population.\n\nSaturday\u2019s event saw the convergence of over 1,000 participants from the nine Niger Delta States, who gathered to build on the success of the innaugural summit held last year, where over 300 Niger Deltans benefited from the NIRSAL intervention loans for small business owners in the area of agriculture.\n\nIn his closing remarks, Siasia appreciated the stakeholders that supported the summit, including the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), led by its Governor, Godwin Emefiele, who is from Delta State; CEO, Heritage Bank Plc, Dr Ifie Sekibo; NCDMB boss, Engr Simbi Wabote, and the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) led by Mr Effiong Akwa.\n\nHigh point of the event was the sharing of heart-touching testimonies by some successful business owners in the Niger Delta.\n\nThey appreciated stakeholders for the platform, stressing that they have grown successful businesses with youths under their employment, whereby creating jobs.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the 2022 Niger Delta MSME Summit is the 48th event to be organised by the NYPF.\n\nThe NYPF has in the space of a few years, held value-adding events in Nigeria and abroad. In one of its strategic events held at New York in 2016, the then United Nations (UN) Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, sent a special goodwill message to the NYPF, acknowledging its drive for human capacity development.\n\nThe third edition of the Niger Delta MSME summit will be held at Akwa Ibom in 2023.",

This will serve as a deterrent to others; this will bolster the fight against corruption.\n\n\u201cThe activities of suspended DCP Abba Kyari in Imo State and the Southeast was dubious and controversial based on the fact that those who were allegedly killed by Abba Kyari, should have been allowed to face the consequences of their actions in any competent court of jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cThe overflow of corpses of Igbo youths at the FMC Owerri and other places in the South-East was the alleged handiwork of IRT team, led by Kyari; no wonder that nemesis caught up with Abba Kyari so quickly. His appetite for the looting of his suspect\u2019s belongings and cash is second to none; that\u2019s why he was obsessed with covetousness and greed to the point of being unaware of the video recording that was used by the NDLEA against him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that IPOB was after Abba Kyari.

Both sides denied doing anything to disturb the peace or to illegally influence the outcome of the poll.\n\nNotwithstanding the disagreement, the minister asked members of the party in the state loyal to him to conduct themselves in a peaceful matter throughout the exercise.\n\nWhile the primary was in progress, the faction of the APC loyal to the minister condemned it.\n\nIn a statement by its spokesman, Abiodun Agboola, the faction alleged widespread irregularities in the exercise conducted by the Osun APC Primary Election Committee led by Governor Abdulrasaq of Kwara State.\n\n\u201cThe Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq led Osun APC Primary Election Committee should know that the primary lacks credibility and fairness,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary and important to inform the general public and Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq led Osun APC Primary Election Committee of the ongoing irregularities in the conduct of the primary election of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the State of Osun.\n\n\u201cWe strongly condemn the conduct of the primary election because it is nothing but a sham with a fraudulent process to favour Governor Adegboyega Oyetola.

This, I will not be part of, this is not good for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Oba Of Benin Takes Delivery Of Looted \u2018Okpa,\u2019 \u2018Ilahor\u2019 Returned From UK\n\nThe elder statesman stressed that more rebels who would stand and speak for the truth were required for Nigeria to move forward.\n\nAccording to him, whoever must live a life of honesty and integrity must be a rebel as Nigerians have no other country to call theirs.\n\n\u201cLooking at the title of the book, I ask myself, why would someone call himself a rebel?\u201d Obasanjo queried. \u201cBut it is good. The truth is that if you have to live a life of honesty and integrity, you have to become a rebel.\n\n\u201cThere would be some time you would be asked have to do something, but you would say no, this is not right. And when you say that you will become a rebel. You may even become a persona non grata. There is no country that we can call our own except Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Serving Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, Pastor Tunde Bakare, also gave a speech at the event titled \u201cWorthy Nation Building Legacies By The Older Generation Of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHe called for inter-generational reintegration between the older and younger generations, as part of efforts to rebuild the country.\n\nBakare, a former running mate to President Muhammadu Buhari, stressed that the effort to rebuild the nation had suffered because of the marginalisation of the youth and the progressives who abandoned politics.",

Verified information from the agents of Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, our governorship aspirant, has it that there are no record and result sheets in any of the 332 wards of the state.\u201d\n\nThe APC conducted the primary election across the 332 wards in the state using the direct mode which allows party members to choose the candidate of their choice.\n\nGovernor Oyetola, who is seeking re-election for a second term, fell out recently with his predecessor and Minister of Interior, Aregbesola who now supports a former Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Moshood Adeoti.\n\nA former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Lasun Yussuff, is also a contender in Saturday\u2019s exercise.\n\nRigging Plan?\n\nAccording to the Aregbesola faction, there was no proper accreditation in a majority of the ward collation centres where voting took place and the accreditation done in some places were skewed in favour of Governor Oyetola as his supporters were allowed to pass through the process without much ado.\n\nIt claimed that the names of many members of the APC who wanted to vote for Adeoti were missing in the register of the party, adding that they had envisaged such by calling for the display of the party register before the conduct of the primary.\n\nThe faction also alleged that appointees of the governor were used as collation officers, which made the purported rigging plan of Oyetola an easy task.\n\n\u201cLoyalists and supporters of Adeoti are being chased and some were brutally attacked in wards where they have a strong presence,\u201d it said. \u201cOriade, Olorunda, Osogbo, Odo-Otin, Boripe, and Ile-Ife are the worst of this act of intimidation and disenfranchisement.\n\n\u201cWhere results of the election were announced (not recorded), the figure declared for Oyetola was highly inflated in the affected wards. INEC officials were noticeably absent in most of the wards to monitor the election.\n\n\u201cThis is unacceptable. It is a shame that a sitting governor could resort to malpractices in his desperate bid to secure a second term ticket.\u201d",

          "text": "Russia\u2019s strategic nuclear forces held exercises overseen by President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, and Washington accused Russian troops massed near Ukraine\u2019s border of advancing and being \u201cpoised to strike\u201d.\n\nWith Western fears of war rising, the White House said U.S President Joe Biden\u2019s national security team told him they still believed Russia could launch an attack in Ukraine \u201cat any time\u201d and he planned to convene his top advisers on Sunday to discuss the crisis.\n\nForeign ministers from the G7 group of rich nations said they had seen no evidence Russia is reducing its military activity in the area and remained \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the situation.\n\nAfter Kyiv and Moscow traded accusations over new shelling near the border, France and Germany urged all or some of their citizens in Ukraine to leave. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russian forces were beginning to \u201cuncoil and move closer\u201d to the border.\n\n\u201cWe hope he (Putin) steps back from the brink of conflict,\u201d Austin told a news conference in Lithuania, saying an invasion of Ukraine was not inevitable.\n\nRussia ordered the military build-up while demanding NATO prevent Ukraine from ever joining the alliance but says Western warnings that it is planning to invade Ukraine are hysterical and dangerous. Moscow says it is pulling back, but Washington and allies say the build-up is mounting.\n\nWashington and NATO say Moscow\u2019s main demands are non-starters, but in Ukraine fears are growing over Putin\u2019s plans.\n\nVenting his frustration at a security conference in Munich, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the global security architecture was \u201calmost broken\u201d. He urged the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, Germany and Turkey to meet to draw up new security guarantees for his country.\n\n\u201cThe rules that the world agreed on decades ago no longer work,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cThey do not keep up with new threats \u2026 This is a cough syrup when you need a coronavirus vaccine.\u201d\n\nWorld Bank President David Malpass told Zelenskiy on Saturday the bank was readying funding to Ukraine of up to $350 million.\n\nThe Kremlin said Russia successfully test-launched hypersonic and cruise missiles at sea during the nuclear forces drills. Putin observed the exercises on screens with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko from a \u201csituation centre\u201d.\n\nIn his most pointed prediction so far, Biden said on Friday he was convinced that Putin has made the decision to invade Ukraine in the coming days, and Austin said on Saturday the nuclear forces exercises were stoking concerns around the world.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden continues to monitor the evolving situation in Ukraine, and is being updated regularly about events on the ground by his national security team,\u201d White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement. \u201cThey reaffirmed that Russia could launch an attack against Ukraine at any time.\u201d\n\nG7 foreign ministers called on Russia to choose the path of diplomacy. \u201cAs a first step, we expect Russia to implement the announced reduction of its military activities along Ukraine\u2019s borders. We have seen no evidence of this reduction,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nZelenskiy said he had an \u201curgent\u201d phone conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron and discussed possible ways of immediate de-escalation and political-diplomatic settlement. Macron is due to speak with Putin on Sunday.\n\nThe nuclear drills follow manoeuvres by Russia\u2019s armed forces in the past four months that have included a build-up of troops \u2014 estimated by the West to number 150,000 or more \u2014 to the north, east and south of Ukraine.\n\nNew helicopters and a battle group deployment of tanks, armoured personnel carriers and support equipment have been moved to sites in Russia near the border, according to U.S.-based Maxar Technologies, which tracks developments with satellite imagery.\n\nMoscow-based analysts said Saturday\u2019s exercises were aimed at sending a message to take Russia\u2019s demands seriously.\n\n\u201cIgnoring Russia\u2019s legitimate rights in this area adversely affects the stability not only on the European continent, but also in the world,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quoted by his ministry as telling his French counterpart by phone.\n\nA NATO official said the alliance relocated staff from Kyiv to the western city of Lviv and to Brussels for safety reasons. The United States and other countries have moved diplomats to Lviv.\n\nSHELLING ALLEGATIONS\n\nRussian-backed rebels seized a swathe of eastern Ukraine and Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv says more than 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict in the east.\n\nSeparatist leaders in eastern Ukraine have declared a full military mobilisation after ordering women and children to evacuate to Russia, citing the threat of an imminent attack by Ukrainian forces, which Kyiv denied.\n\nKyiv and Western leaders say the mobilisation, evacuation and increased shelling are part of a Russian plan to create a pretext for an invasion.\n\nRussia\u2019s FSB security service said two shells landed on Russian territory near the border, Russia\u2019s Tass news agency reported.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military accused Russia of faking pictures of shells to make out they were Ukrainian, and said mercenaries had arrived in separatist-held eastern Ukraine to stage provocations in collaboration with Russian special forces.\n\nUkraine\u2019s foreign minister demanded an independent international investigation of the alleged incidents and the military said two soldiers had been killed in shelling by pro-Russian separatists in east Ukraine.\n\nThe two Russian-backed, self-proclaimed republics in Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk and Luhansk regions were hit by more than 1,400 explosions on Friday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said. And almost 2,000 ceasefire violations were registered in the area by OSCE monitors on Saturday, a diplomatic source told Reuters. read more\n\nMultiple explosions were heard overnight into Sunday in the centre of the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk, a Reuters reporter said. The blasts\u2019 origin was not clear. There was no immediate comment from separatist authorities or Kyiv.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really scary. I\u2019ve taken everything I could carry,\u201d said Tatyana, 30, who was boarding a bus with her 4-year-old daughter.\n\nRussian news agencies said 10,000 evacuees had arrived in Russia. Separatist leaders say they aim to evacuate 700,000 people.",

          "title": "Ukraine\u2019s Zelenskyy Calls on Putin to Meet as Tensions Soar",
          "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, facing a sharp spike in violence in and around territory held by Russia-backed rebels and increasingly dire warnings that Russia plans to invade, on Saturday called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet him and seek resolution to the crisis.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the president of the Russian Federation wants, so I am proposing a meeting,\u201d Zelenskyy said at the Munich Security Conference, where he also met with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris. Zelenskyy said Russia could pick the location for the talks.\n\n\u201cUkraine will continue to follow only the diplomatic path for the sake of a peaceful settlement.\u201d\n\nThere was no immediate response from the Kremlin.\n\nZelenskyy spoke hours after separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine ordered a full military mobilization on Saturday while Western leaders made increasingly dire warnings that a Russian invasion of its neighbor appeared imminent.\n\nIn new signs of fears that a war could start within days, Germany and Austria told their citizens to leave Ukraine. German air carrier Lufthansa canceled flights to the capital, Kyiv, and to Odessa, a Black Sea port that could be a key target in an invasion.NATO\u2019s liaison office in Kyiv said it was relocating staff to Brussels and to the western Ukraine city of Lviv. Meanwhile, top Ukrainian military officials came under a shelling attack during a tour of the front of the nearly eight-year separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe officials fled to a bomb shelter before hustling from the area, according to an Associated Press journalist who was on the tour.Violence in eastern Ukraine has spiked in recent days as Ukraine and the two regions held by the rebels each accused the other of escalation. Russia on Saturday said at least two shells fired from a government-held part of eastern Ukraine landed across the border, but Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba dismissed that claim as \u201ca fake statement.\u201dSporadic violence has broken out for years along the line separating Ukrainian forces from the Russia-backed rebels, but the recent shelling and bombing spike could set off a full-scale war.The United States and many European countries have alleged for months that Russia, which has moved about 150,000 troops near the Ukrainian border, is trying to create pretexts to invade.\u201cThey are uncoiling and are now poised to strike,\u201d U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Saturday during a visit to Lithuania.Harris opened her meeting with Zelenskyy by saying the world was at \u201ca decisive moment in history.\u201dEarlier Saturday, Denis Pushilin, the head of the pro-Russia separatist government in Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region, cited an \u201cimmediate threat of aggression\u201d from Ukrainian forces in his announcement. Ukrainian officials vehemently denied having plans to take rebel-controlled areas by force.\u201cI appeal to all the men in the republic who can hold weapons to defend their families, their children, wives, mothers,\u201d Pushilin said. \u201dTogether we will achieve the coveted victory that we all need.\u201dA similar statement followed from his counterpart in the Luhansk region. On Friday, the rebels began evacuating civilians to Russia with an announcement that appeared to be part of their and Moscow\u2019s efforts to paint Ukraine as the aggressor.German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the evacuation orders could be a tactic to provide the spark for a broader attack.\u201cTo say it very clearly, Ukraine did not give any grounds for the evacuation that was ordered yesterday,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the facts on the ground. We must not allow supposed reasons for war to be constructed out of hot air.\u201dU.S. President Joe Biden said late Friday that based on the latest American intelligence, he was now \u201cconvinced\u201d that Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine and assault the capital.\u201cAs of this moment, I\u2019m convinced he\u2019s made the decision,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe have reason to believe that.\u201d He reiterated that the assault could occur in the \u201ccoming days.\u201dBiden was briefed on Harris\u2019 meetings in Munich and has been getting regular updates on the Ukraine situation, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement Saturday. Biden will discuss Ukraine during a meeting with his National Security Council on Sunday, she said.Meanwhile, Russia conducted massive nuclear drills on Saturday. The Kremlin said Putin, who pledged to protect Russia\u2019s national interests against what it sees as encroaching Western threats, was watching the drills together with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko from the situation room.Notably, the planned exercise involves the Crimea-based Black Sea Fleet. Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula after seizing it from Ukraine in 2014. .Underscoring the West\u2019s concerns of an imminent invasion, a U.S. defense official said an estimated 40% to 50% of the ground forces deployed in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border have moved into attack positions closer to the border.The shift has been underway for about a week, other officials have said, and does not necessarily mean Putin has decided to begin an invasion. The defense official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal U.S. military assessments.The official also said the number of Russian ground units known as battalion tactical groups in the border area had grown to as many as 125, up from 83 two weeks ago. Each group has 750 to 1,000 soldiers.Lines of communication between Moscow and the West remain open: the American and Russian defense chiefs spoke Friday. French President Emmanuel Macron scheduled a phone call with Putin on Sunday. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed to meet next week.Immediate worries focused on eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting the pro-Russia rebels since 2014 in a conflict that has killed some 14,000 people. Violations of a 2015 ceasefire agreement, including shelling and shooting along the line of contact, have been common.A car bomb exploded in the center of the rebel-controlled city of Donetsk on Friday. Adding to the tensions, two explosions shook the rebel-controlled city of Luhansk early Saturday. No injuries were reported in the incidents.Ukraine\u2019s military said two of its soldiers died in firing from the rebel side on Saturday.By Saturday morning, the separatists in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, which form Ukraine\u2019s industrial heartland known as the Donbas, said that thousands of residents of the rebel-controlled areas had been evacuated to Russia.Russia has issued about 700,000 passports to residents of the rebel-held territories. Claims that Russian citizens are being endangered might be used as justification for military action.Pushilin, the head of the Donetsk rebel government, alleged in a video statement that Ukraine was going to order an imminent offensive in the area.Metadata from two videos posted by the separatists announcing the evacuation show that the files were created two days ago, the AP confirmed. U.S. authorities have alleged that the Kremlin\u2019s effort to come up with an invasion pretext could include staged, prerecorded videos.Authorities in Russia\u2019s Rostov region, which borders eastern Ukraine, declared a state of emergency because of the influx of evacuees. Media reports on Saturday described chaos at some of the camps assigned to accommodate the people from eastern Ukraine. The reports said there were long lines of buses and hundreds of people waiting in the cold for hours on end to be housed without access to food or bathroom facilities.Putin ordered the Russian government to offer 10,000 rubles (about $130) to each evacuee, an amount equivalent to about half of an average monthly salary in eastern Ukraine.___",

          "text": "The Minister of Power, Mr. Abubakar Aliyu, has disclosed that the federal government was willing to partner investors in the power sector to improve electricity supply in the country\n\nThis came as the Managing Director of the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company (NBET), Mr. Nnaemeka Ewelukwa, said the government was putting reforms in place to ensure stable power supply in the country.\n\nAliyu, in a statement signed by the Information Officer in the Press and Public Relations Unit of the Ministry of Power, Mr. Mathew Osumanyi Dan\u2019asabe, made this known while receiving the Ambassador of Turkey to Nigeria, Mr. Hidayet Bayratar, in company of two other delegates in his office in Abuja.\n\nHe said President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s desire towards the power sector was to ensure that the electricity supply industry is owned by both government and the private sectors.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria and Turkey\u2019s relationship is a long-standing one which culminated in the signing of an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Turkey and Nigeria in October 2021 for mutual benefits.\n\nAliyu told the ambassador that various interventions were being put into the power sector of the country.\n\nHe described the distribution aspect of the power sector in the country as an area worth investing.\n\nThe minister urged Turkey and the rest of the world to partner Nigeria and share experience in the fields of energy, renewable energy and energy efficiency.\n\nIn his response, the ambassador said their visit was a follow-up to the MoU signed in 2021.\n\nIn related development, the Managing Director of NBET, Ewelukwa, has said that the federal government is putting reforms in place to ensure stable power supply in the country.\n\nEwelukwa made this known at a capacity-building workshop for members of the Power Correspondents Association of Nigeria (PCAN) and Civil Society Organisations in Lagos.\n\nThe workshop, with the theme: \u2018Building knowledge and Plugging Skills Gap in Power Sector Reporting\u2019, indicates a worrisome mismatch that government wants to plug.\n\nHe said the critical reforms that the government has embarked upon are designed to sustain the financial status of the market, ensure technical capacity to remove the deficit in supply to meet the demand of the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the federal government has begun the implementation of the transmission expansion plan which works in sync with the government/Siemens Presidential Power Initiative \u2013 with phase one \u2013 (7,000mw), phase two \u2013 (11,000mw) and phase three (25,000mw) supply.\n\nEwelukwa said \u201cthis government is keen to implement these reforms. To be honest with you, we are having sleepless nights to achieve these.\u201d\n\nHe said that government plans to keep expanding generation, transmission and distribution capacity to meet the country\u2019s demand.\n\nAccording to him, the distribution companies are also improving their performances and facilities to ensure improved power supply.\n\nExplaining NBET\u2019s function in the Transition Electricity Based Market, he said the design is to temporary bridge in the electricity market.\n\nHe said NBET has a long-term role to drive market competition by ensuring that it is moved from a government-centered market to a private-sector driven electricity market.\n\n\u201cWe are enthusiastically looking at the point when we will actually start the innovation process of handing over the Power Purchase Agreements we signed to distribution licencees and eligible customers as the case may be,\u201d he said.\n\nJames Sowole in Abeokuta",
