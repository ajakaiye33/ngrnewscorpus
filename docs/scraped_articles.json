          "text": "Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State has said Nigeria needs restructuring to make governance efficient and increase the citizens\u2019 faith in their country.\n\n\u201cI did say the best way for peaceful one Nigeria is that we have to accept that we must restructure,\u201d Tambuwal told journalists.\n\nHe said political leaders must listen to the people they govern and do the right things to address the concerns, adding that almost all sections of the country were calling for restructuring.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about restructuring in the South-South, what directly comes to mind is resource control,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\u201cTo someone in the South-West, what comes to his mind is physical federalism. Someone in the South-East will tell you they need more states; that is part of a geographical restructuring.\n\n\u201cIn the northern part of Nigeria, restructuring means something totally different. Depending on where you are standing, your understanding of restructuring will be mirrored from that perspective. The key issue for me is that we should all work for restructuring for efficiency,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor recalled that during his term as Speaker of the House of Representatives, concerted efforts were made by the National Assembly made during the constitutional amendment process.\n\nAccording to him, the National Assembly constituted about 360 committees, comprising professional bodies and civil society groups across all constituencies to be the drivers of the public hearing on constitution amendment across Nigeria.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe situation we are having today in our constitution makes it compulsory for a minister to belong to a political party. Therefore, the Attorney-General of the Federation. being also the Minister for Justice has to belong to a political party. How good is this for the judicial system of the country?\n\n\u201cTo me restructuring means, we have to change our ways of doing things and face the concerns of Nigerians. What is the problem if President Muhamadu Buhari yields to the demands of Nigerians by taking a bill to the National Assembly to approve state police?\u201d\n\nLauds Oyetola over Osun\u2019s development\n\nMeanwhile, the Sokoto governor has commended his Osun State counterpart, Adegboyega Oyetola, for providing infrastructure and regular payment of workers\u2019 salaries.\n\nHe spoke in Osogbo during a courtesy visit to Governor Oyetola in Osogbo.\n\nIn a statement on Friday by the Chief Press Secretary to the Osun governor, Ismail Omipidan, Tambuwal, who was accompanied on the visit by a former Minister of Water Resources and a former deputy governor of the state, Mukhtar Shagari, and Senator Ahmed Maccido, encouraged Oyetola to continue to deliver good governance to the people of Osun.\n\nResponding, Oyetola sympathised with the Sokoto State Government over the killings and spate of banditry in the state and applauded the governor for the successes recorded by his administration since 2015.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed, on Friday, declared that the relative peace at Tafawa Balewa in Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area of the state should not be taken for granted, hence everything possible had to be done to maintain the peace there.\n\nGovernor Mohammed made the declaration shortly before inaugurating a 30-man committee constituted by the state government to review the implementation of the reports of Justice Babalakin, Shehu Awak and Justice Bala Umar Commissions of Inquiry on the creation of Sayawa Chiefdom.\n\nReviewing the various commissions of inquiry set up after each episode of ethnoreligious crises in the area, the governor charged members of the committee to be meticulous in the discharge of the assignment given to them.\n\nWhile saying that previous crises in the area led to loss of lives and properties and emphasising that such must stop, Mohammed asserted that the task given to the committee is onerous.\n\nHe declared that his administration, being a responsive one, was determined to put the issue of Sayawa chiefdom to rest once and for all.\n\n\u201cThe relative peace in Tafawa Balewa and environs must not be taken for granted. We must do everything humanly and administratively possible to ensure that the peace is maintained even beyond the area to cover the entire state.\n\n\u201cAs a responsible and responsive government, we are determined to ensure that the issue is rested once and for all. I, therefore, urge you to do diligent work which will be acceptable to all the stakeholders,\u201d Governor Mohammed said.\n\nHe then took a swipe at previous administrations in the state for their lack of political will to implement all the reports of the commissions, submitting that it was only the Malam Isa Yuguda-led administration that took the bold step of going as far as enacting a law creating the Sayawa Chiefdom.\n\nThe terms of reference of the 30-member committee, according to the governor are: To resolve the issue of Sayawa Chiefdom as recommended by Justice Babalakin, Shehu Awak and Justice Bala Umar\u2019s Committees and the enabling law on the creation of the chiefdom and establish the demarcation, allocation of capital and the modalities for the appointment of the chief, his class and title.\n\nHe added that the committee is, to also discuss and resolve all agitations within the chiefdom, including resettlement of those driven out of Tafawa Balewa Town at Burgel Junction; recommend legal modalities of establishing the chiefdom if necessary as well to report on any matter incidental to the assignment.\n\nResponding on behalf of members of the committee, the chairman, Ambassador Jibrin Dada Chinade, expressed appreciation to the governor for finding them among many equally qualified people in the state to carry out the assignment.\n\nWhile assuring that the committee will do its best, Chinade said, \u201cthe task ahead of us an onerous one but by the grace of God, we will do our best to deliver as expected so that all people of the state will be proud of the outcome\u201d.\n\nHe then solicited support and cooperation of all stakeholders in with a view to enabling the committee to conclude its assignment in record time.",

Ugwuanyi reiterated his administration\u2019s commitment and interest in ensuring that there is no hindrance towards continuous improvement in the electoral process, stressing that it was in keeping with this commitment that the state government went out of its way to renovate the INEC office within the short period it was burnt.\n\nAppreciating the good work the INEC REC is doing in the state, Gov.

That didn\u2019t make me to have a change of opinion about Obasanjo.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI have never seen anything genuine about him despite his self-glorification,\u201d Akande wrote.\n\nHe claimed the ex-president\u2019s nationalism and patriotism were fake, adding that his ambition to be the centre of Nigeria\u2019s universe made him express constant hatred for the late Obafemi Awolowo.\n\n\u201cIt was this vaunting ambition that made him express constant hatred to the most altruistic and selfless leader of our time, Chief Obafemi Awolowo.\n\n\u201cHe continues to wonder till tomorrow why the Yoruba people, especially after his tour of duty as a two-time President, continue to elevate Awolowo to the highest pedestal while they have no respect for him. So, he would wonder to his grave!\n\n\u201cIn his detestations for Awolowo, he is ruled by a virulent inferiority complex, believing that he needed to do everything to supplant the greatness of Awolowo or undermine his legacies.\n\n\u201cThat was why he launched the Universal Basic Education in 1978, knowing that free education would be the core of Awolowo programme for the Second Republic.\n\n\u201cThat was also why he continued in this line during his two-term disastrous presidency.\n\n\u201cFor the reason that I was not dancing to his tune, Obasanjo did everything to depress and discredit my government and undermine us in Osun state.\n\n\u201cIndeed, he wanted my government to collapse and once I had problem with Omisore, he adopted him as a willing tool and railroaded him into the Senate despite his detention for the assassination of Bola Ige,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe accused Obasanjo of ordering that Osun State should be short-paid by N216 million monthly from the Federal Allocation.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, we were earning about N150 million when our salary bill was about N260 million.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, the price of crude oil was rising and the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) was back in the account.\n\n\u201cSo instead, of our own income to move from N150 to N300 million, we were experiencing reduction.\n\n\u201cSuddenly also, they decided deducting N216 million from our allocation.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Budget Office in Abuja to find out why they were making the deductions and we were told it was \u2018order from above,\u2019 meaning they were acting on a directive from the Presidency.\n\n\u201cMy finance commissioner, in frustration, advised that perhaps we should bribe them. I said \u201cNo\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wanted to know what the cause of this order from above was but we didn\u2019t find out anything. They did this for a few other states too.\n\n\u201cThey claimed they were deducting for some inexplicable international debts.\n\n\u201cBut I came to know the sinister motive when Oyinlola became governor and they paid the arrears of the deductions to his government,\u201d Akande added in the autobiography.",

The allegations and my responses are now before the public.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesman said he built his house from his sweat, adding that he also sold his landed property, including the land given to him by the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo, to build the Lekki house.\n\nAdebanjo added: \u201cI hereby authorise the EFCC to verify the facts.\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere leader said he has no reason to ask for money from Asiwaju Tinubu after he left office since he never demanded such from him before he became governor.\n\nDescribing Akande\u2019s allegations as \u201cmalicious falsehood\u201d, Adebanjo challenged the former Osun State governor to disclose how he got his own property as he had done.\n\nAccording to him, Akande \u201cis a neophyte, a beneficiary of a struggle he never took part in\u201d.\n\nGiving details of how he built his house, Adebanjo said: \u201cI deny the lie propagated by Akande. I wish to state categorically that my house at Lekki was built with my resources through the sale of three developed properties, loan from GTBank and the sale of undeveloped landed property given me by my former leader, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, of blessed memory.\u201d\n\nOyinlola, in a statement in Osogbo, the Osun State capital, maintained that Akande accused him wrongly.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the Osun State Governor\u2019s Office (Bola Ige House) contract, Chief Akande said I wrongly accused him of corruption in the construction of the Governor\u2019s Office. I did not level any false charges against him. I came into office in May 2003 and discovered that the Governor\u2019s Office complex, which Akande commissioned for use after he lost the election, was not completed.\n\n\u201cThe state government asked the contractor to come back to the site and complete the works; more so when evidence in government accounts showed that he had been paid. But the project consultant shocked everyone with his claim that part of the payment was taken back to finance the 2003 re-election bid of Chief Akande.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe consultant said the contractor could not go back to work unless he was paid his full dues. One of Akande\u2019s appointees confessed collecting money from this contractor for Akande\u2019s re-election.\n\n\u201cI consulted Chief Akande on this. He denied having any deal with the contractor and the consultant. Some people were subsequently taken to court on a seven-count criminal charge. Stakeholders in the state and Alhaji Arisekola Alao later intervened. I have the details of who collected how much in my forthcoming book\u2026\u201d\n\nOyinlola alleged that Akande made N800 million advance payments to contractors in his last days in office, despite complaining that there was no money to pay workers and pensioners, leading to mass retrenchment.\n\n\u201cChief Akande wrote on the Government House that he wanted to build on a site on Ilesa Road in Osogbo, which I stopped. I found it strange that Chief Akande, who boasted that he was prudent and honest as governor, awarded the construction of a Government House in his last days in office, after he lost the election and in advance paid the contractors the entire contract sum of N800 million. Chief Akande confirmed this strange payment on page 393 of his book.\n\n\u201cThis was a man who said there was no money to pay workers and pensioners, but he had enough to pay a contractor in advance for a Government House after losing his re-election. In any case, the state already had an ongoing Government House started by the military government, which Akande refused to complete.\n\n\u201cI completed the project and added chalets plus a presidential lodge.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Jude Chinedu, Enugu, Okey Sampson, Umuahia, Chijioke Agwu, Abakaliki, George Onyejiuwa, Owerri and Obinna Odogwu, Awka\n\nA week to Christmas, there are concerns over security in the South East especially as this is usually a season of homecoming for South-Easterners. The situation is further aggravated by the recent spate of insecurity in the region orchestrated by the so-called \u2018unknown\u2019 gunmen.\n\nThough the situation has drastically died down, the renewed cases of armed robbery and kidnapping of persons, including returnees from abroad, particularly in Imo State, have put many on the edge. The situation has made all the five South-East State Governments, in partnership with the security agencies, to beef up security within their jurisdictions. There has also been an increase in the number of security checkpoints in and out of the region.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nFor Imo, despite the efforts of Governor Hope Uzodimma who recently called for deployment of Special Forces to the state, criminals have continued to make life unbearable in some parts of the state.\n\nIMO\n\nTwo weeks ago, a young man (names withheld), who returned from abroad was abducted by gunmen in broad daylight at Iho, Ikeduru Local Government Area of Imo State. He was yet to be released by his captors as at press time. Added to the ugly situation was the abduction of at least four traditional rulers in the state, including the one from Atta in Njaba council area of the state, Eze Azike, who was viciously murdered by his captors who later dumped his body at the market square. His counterpart at Ihite Ihube, Okigwe, Eze Paul Ogbu and the youth leader of his community, were also murdered and their bodies dumped in a ditch.\n\nFollowing the tenuous security situation in the state, prominent politicians and businessmen, especially from the Orlu zone, have relocated to Lagos, Port Harcourt and Abuja to avoid falling victims to the criminals.\n\nHowever, the state Commissioner of Police, Rabiu Hussain, has assured the people of his command\u2019s preparedness to provide adequate security for all those who are willing to spend their Christmas and New Year holidays in the state. He also disclosed that the command has deployed more officers at strategic locations to increase the visibility of the police.\n\nThe CP said: \u201cYou will observe that recently, the state has enjoyed relative peace owing to the crime fighting strategy put in place by the command and in keeping with the promise to rid Imo State of crime and criminality. The command under my watch is enjoying a robust partnership and synergy with other security agencies and community stakeholders in the state. However, we have refused to rest on our oars, as the reward of hard work, they say, is more hard work.\n\n\u201cAs we all know, the Christmas season is at hand and there are tendencies for increase in crime. To this end, we shall leave no stone unturned in our efforts to rid Imo State of crime and criminality.\u201d\n\nSaturday Sun gathered that some of the strategies included intelligence-led stop and search/patrols in the three senatorial zones of the state; visibility policing by ensuring that the Operation Search and Flush patrol teams are visibly placed strategically within and outside the metropolis.\n\nHe added: \u201cAlso, I have dispatched more plainclothes policemen to black spot areas like Ama-JK, Douglas, Tetlow, Orji, World Bank, Ama Hausa, Orji Axis and Control Post, to checkmate crime and criminality in such areas especially, the stealing of phones and other valuables. \u201cAll the exit and inlet routes of the state will be well manned by the Command\u2019s Special Forces.\u201d\n\nThe Imo Police boss further disclosed that the command is partnering with communities and that they are being encouraged to form vigilance groups neighbourhood watch, and other groups. He noted that presently, communities are working with their various DPOs. \u201cThe command is also working in synergy with the Imo State Hunters Association with a view to making sure that the bushes are not used as criminal hideouts or camps for kidnappers,\u201d he said. The State House of Assembly in October approved N31.9billion as supplementary budget for Gov. Uzodimma, a large chunk of which is for the fight against insecurity in the state.\n\nSo far, the government has provided logistics including operational vehicles, communication equipment, armoured personnel carriers and others for the security agencies operating in the state.\n\nThe new strategy may be paying off as over 30 suspected kidnappers together with those who had abducted the traditional rulers of Ihube Amagu Community in Okigwe and that of Mbutu Community in Aboh Mbaise were arrested in Orsu Local Government Area on Monday through joint security operations.\n\nEBONYI\n\nIn Ebonyi, the state government has deployed operatives of Ebubeagu Security Network to communities and flashpoints in the state. Special Assistant to the Governor on Internal Security, Panchris Ikechukwu, who stated this in an interview with our correspondent in Abakaliki, warned criminal elements to steer clear of the state during and after the Yuletide, insisting that there would not be any hiding place for them. He further urged Ebonyians, especially those living outside the state, who may wish to return for the Christmas celebration to feel free to come home, assuring them of adequate security throughout the period.\n\n\u201cThe Ebonyi State government is doing everything possible to make sure that the state is safe for Christmas celebration, so, that Ebonyians who will be returning from different parts of the country and the world to celebrate the Christmas will do so without any problem. \u201cTo this end, my office is very prepared, as always, to ensure peaceful and crime-free Yuletide celebration in Ebonyi. As I am talking to you, my men are everywhere in all parts of the state. I urge Ebonyians to go about their normal businesses without fear of attacks. We have about 15 patrol vans stationed in strategic places in the state. If you notice anything fishy, don\u2019t hesitate to report to my men close to your area. \u201cI advise criminals and criminal elements to stay away from Ebonyi State this Christmas because any of them that engages in any criminal activity will be fished out and dealt with,\u201d he said.\n\nConsequently, the Executive Chairman of Onicha LGA, Ogbonna Igboke has directed the town union leaders in the area to put up security barricades in strategic locations in their various autonomous communities. This he said would assist the council to arrest any emergency security challenge whenever it occurred.\n\nAddressing selected security stakeholders at the council\u2019s secretariat in Isu, Igboke regretted that hoodlums involved in some of the security issues recorded in the council in the recent past would have been apprehended if the barricades were in place as he had severally directed. He warned that any president-general who lacked the capacity to assist the government realize its objectives especially in the area of security will be shown the way out. Other resolutions reached in the meeting were a total ban on the selling, buying and consumption of \u2018Mkpuru Mmiri\u2019 and other narcotics in all parts of the council; further ban on night ceremonies beyond 7pm without due approval from government and a charge on security agencies to arrest and prosecute anyone found guilty of any crime.\n\nABIA\n\nIn Abia State, the Commissioner of Police, Mrs Janet Agbede said security has been beefed up for the yuletide.\n\nThe command\u2019s spokesman, Geoffrey Ogbonna, a Superintendent of Police (SP) who spoke on behalf of his boss, said every security measure had been put in place to ensure the state was safe during the Christmas and New Year celebration. Although he would not disclose their strategy for security reasons, Ogbonna however, assured it would be unfolded as the days rolled by.\n\nHe appealed to Abians to avail her officers and men information about the hideouts of criminal elements, assuring that such information would be treated with utmost confidentiality. She advised hoodlums operating in the state to relocate from Abia \u201cbecause they know the price to pay if they are caught. Abia is not safe for criminals\u201d.\n\nSimilarly, Commander of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) in the state,\n\nObioguru Johnbull said his men had already begun operations aimed at making the festive season crime-free. Johnbull who revealed that they had already started Operation Keep Abia Safe for the Yuletide said: \u201cWe\u2019ve started raiding criminal hideouts, black spots and doing what is called mopping. Anybody that is arrested with anything incriminating, will be immediately charged to court.\n\n\u201cBy mopping, we mean raiding criminal hideouts, arresting criminals and immediately charging them to court where they are remanded at least within this Yuletide, so that they will not be allowed to roam about the streets, causing problems for others.\u201d\n\nHe argued that if these hoodlums were removed from the society during this period, they would not be around to commit the offence they would have committed, if allowed to move about freely. \u201cThat is our strategy for this period. It has already started and would last till December 22. Already, we have arrested about 45 persons and we are screening them and any of them found culpable, will be charged to court.\u201d\n\nThough the Commissioner for Homeland Security, Chief Sopuruchi Nwabekee could not be reached, a senior official of the Ministry told Saturday Sun that the government has put much on ground to ensure adequate security. He said men of the Homeland Security outfit would in a matter of days be deployed to strategic places in the state to augment efforts of the police and other security agencies in providing security for the people during this period and beyond.\n\nENUGU\n\nOur reporter spoke with heads of some security agencies and government officials in Enugu State and was told that preparations were in top gear to ensure the security of lives and property in the state.\n\nCommissioner of Police in Enugu, Abubakar Lawal, expressed the command\u2019s readiness to ensure the safety of the populace within the period. He said he had ordered the Area Commanders, Divisional Police Officers and heads of tactical and operational units of the command, to deploy all the intelligence and operational assets at their disposal to ensure that criminal flashpoints, highways, streets and other places of public interest, within their areas of responsibilities were effectively patrolled and policed.\n\nHe also said that he has ordered for full enforcement of the ban on fireworks and other explosives to avoid hoodlums using it as a cover to create panic and perfect their criminal intentions. Lawal urged parents and guardians to ensure that their wards refrained from engaging in the use of such items as anyone offender will be arrested and prosecuted. These were contained in a statement by the spokesman of the command in Enugu, Daniel Ndukwe on Wednesday.\n\nOn their part, Public Relations Officer of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Enugu State, Danny Manuel, said the corps had stepped up activities as the Yuletide is synonymous with increase in crime, vehicular traffic, road accidents and fire disasters. To this end, he said the corps had divided the state into three area commands for proper monitoring and surveillance of dangerous spots prone to high criminal activities within the state.\n\n\u201cSo, these are the strategies we have mapped out and we are working hand in hand with security agencies like the Road Safety, the Police and even the military. The security situation in the country and in the South East has called for collaboration to make sure that we give our people the maximum security they are expecting.\n\n\u201cWe are assuring all Igbo residing outside the South East and outside the country that are ready to come home for Christmas that adequate security measure is guaranteed. So there is no cause for alarm. But if you suspect anything, don\u2019t hesitate to contact us,\u201d he urged. On his part, the Sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps, Enugu State Command, Joseph Udoabba, said that aside the deployment of officers at major flashpoints in the state, the corps has introduced the use of body cameras, which the activities of officers will be monitored from a central location. He said: \u201cWe are ready. We have done the simulation and everybody was on ground. We have just started it and it will continue for the period of the one month and even beyond.\n\n\u201cSome form of technology has been introduced and that is the use of body camera. What that means is that everything that is happening is monitored real time from our control room somewhere in Abuja and anybody molesting any of our members will be seen.\n\n\u201cAnd if our men using it are involved in any form of illegality, it will also be captured. So, it is a two-way something. It will protect the team from any form of molestation while also protecting the road user from being extorted.\u201d In addition, the Permanent Secretary, Enugu State Ministry of Transport, Ogbonna Idike said that the state government was deploying 814 traffic personnel to ensure free flow of traffic during the yuletide.\n\nHe said that these personnel would be drawn from neighbourhood watch groups, Forest Guard personnel and traffic officers within the ministry. Idike said the agency had already increased its patrols and manpower ahead the yuletide.\n\nANAMBRA\n\nThe police in Anambra said that they were adequately prepared to protect lives and property this season. Spokesperson of the police command, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, revealed that the command had developed a number of strategies to check criminal activities.\n\n\u201cWe are everywhere evolving strategies on how to tackle security concerns as they come up. We assure Ndi Anambra of watertight security during the Christmas period and we have concentrated on event centres, recreational centres and churches. \u201cOur patrol has been very robust and we are also in partnership with other sister agencies to make sure that there is adequate security\u201d, he said.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

Adinuba, who described Anambra as the safest state in Nigeria, said that more security measures would be deployed to ensure watertight security. He said that a police helicopter would be hovering around and monitoring security situations in the state.",

          "text": "From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, has given South East governors two weeks to launch Ebubeagu. Speaking on the abandoned project of floating the Ebubeagu security outfit for the zone, Prof. George Obiozor, the President General of the organization, said the ultimatum follows Ohanaeze\u2019s meeting with the governors recently, and in which they gave their assurances to launch the security outfit to enhance security in the zone.\n\nHe, therefore, charged them to keep their promise and make the project a reality before the end of the year. In a related development, he re-echoed the determination of the South East to produce the President of the country in 2023, vowing that the current insecurity challenge rattling the nation will not deter the organisation from realising the objective.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nObiozor said this in Owerri on Friday in his Christmas and New Year messages delivered to newsmen. While acknowledging the harsh times being experienced by the zone and the country in general, he expressed optimism that the coming year \u201cwill be a lot better than the outgoing one for Ndigbo and Nigeria in all ramifications.\u201d\n\nHe noted that \u201cinsecurity in the South-East is politically orchestrated to achieve a desired political objective and also to deceive and divert the attention of the people of southeast and the rest of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe explained why Ndigbo should be given the Presidency: \u201cNo people in recent history have been unfortunate or at least had a mixed fortune or blessings as Ndigbo in Nigerian politics and governance. For example, quite often the Igbo energy and enterprise are misunderstood as being over-ambitious. The Igbo talents and ability to turn adversities into advantage, obstacles into opportunities and difficulties into dividends were misrepresented as attempt at domination.\n\n\u201cConsequently, Ndigbo were confronted with anger or envy, hostility and violence at any given crisis in Nigeria and even outside Nigeria. Ndigbo seek Nigerian unity but not the unity of slaves and masters; we seek peace but not peace of the graveyard. We seek justice because we know that throughout history those denied justice have had no interest in peace.

It is alleged that Chief Bisi Akande\u2019s building at Ila-Orogun, which I understand is more than double in expanse of my house in Lekki and some other properties he has in Lagos and abroad were financed by Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201cHis house in Ibadan was also alleged to have been built by the contractor that built the secretariat in Oshogbo, when he was the governor of Osun state.\n\n\u201cI hereby challenge Chief Bisi Akande to clear the air by disclosing the source of financing these properties as I have done above.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Bola Tinubu, the great philanthropist, should also disclose the source of his wealth with which he bankrolled the elections of APC in the south-west and that of Gen. Muhammad Buhari and his various properties in Lagos. He should also authorise the EFCC to verify such details as I have done above,\u201d he said.\n\nAkande reiterated that since Tinubu himself was present at the book presentation, he expected him within a few days to refute such a malicious falsehood about him, emanating from his \u201cman Friday.\u201d\n\nHe noted that it was shocking that Tinubu who just some three years ago at n the occasion of the presentation of Adebanjo\u2019s auto-biography, \u201cSaying It As It Is,\u201d attested to the fact that if not for \u201cMy incorruptibility and strength of character he, Bola Tinubu would not have been Governor of Lagos State in 1999.\u201d\n\nAdebanjo wondered what Tinubu could be demanding from him after his two-term governorship to make him pressurise him to build a house for him, when he did not get a naira from Tinubu before he became the governor.\n\nDescribing Akande as a neophyte and a beneficiary of a struggle he never took part in, Akande averred that he owed himself a duty to put the record straight for posterity about the \u201cbig lie\u201d that Tinubu built the house for him.\n\n\u201cI therefore deny categorically (sic) that my house at Lekki was built with my resources through the sale of three developed properties, loan from GTBank and the sale of undeveloped landed property given me by my late leader, Chief Obafemi Awolowo of blessed memory,\u201d he argued.\n\nOn the details of the properties he disposed to build the Lekki home, he listed a four-bedroom duplex with two bedroom flat enclosed with two undeveloped plots at plot four, block 14, Nuru Oniwo Street, Aguda Surulere, Lagos state, where he lived hitherto. He added that the house was commissioned in 1972 by Awolowo.\n\n\u201cA wing of the duplex was once occupied by a staff of the security outfit then known as \u201cspecial branch\u201d headed then by the late Alhaji M.D. Yussuf who later became Inspector General of Police when Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo was the Head of State.\n\n\u201cIt was later occupied by one of the wives Chief Pius Akinyelure, who often visit his wife there in company of Senator Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201cThe gate of this property was forced open by Abacha security forces when NADECO was holding a sendoff party for American ambassador Walter Carrington in my house. I took the federal government to court for damages and I was awarded N1 million which has not been paid till today by the federal government, Mr. Olisa Agbakoba (SAN), was my counsel,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, he mentioned a two-storey building at Odedola Street, Surulere, Lagos state, which he bought through an estate agent by name Mr. Shiwoniku, who has since relocated to UK and has a brother who is a legal practitioner in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe house was sold to a Ghanaian by name Mr Akappo. He is still alive and he lives in one of the flat in the building,\u201d Adebanjo noted.\n\nHe also mentioned a plot of 45X100 which he said he inherited from his mother Salamotu Anomo-Adebanjo, who built a bungalow on it.\n\n\u201cShe bought the land when I was in primary school in 1940 from one Pa. Idowu Onitiri for \u00a320, which she paid by instalment of \u00a310, \u00a37, \u00a33. His son Akanbi Onitiri, executed the conveyance for me without extra payment after showing him the purchase receipts from his father, when I was developing it in 1976. Akanbi Onitiri is the father of Sumbo Onitiri, a well-known estate surveyor in Lagos.\n\n\u201cThe building was sold to a woman through an estate agent. I then took a loan from GTBank to complete the house in Lekki where I am living now,\u201d Adebanjo recalled.\n\nHe added that when the interest on the loan became unbearable, he was compelled to sell the undeveloped land given to him by Awolowo in Dide-Olu Estate in Maroko Victoria Island.\n\n\u201cOne Mr. Ade Otusanya, a friend of my son, Femi Ayo-Adebanjo bought the land. The contractor who built my Lekki house is Hakeem Sulaiman, Senior Partner of Messrs HA associates.\n\n\u201cThe Electrical and Mechanical Contractor is Tokunbo Oshokoya, Senior Partner of Messrs Oshea Projects. The Architect is Mr. Deji Johnson. The Quantity Surveyor is the late Otunba T.B Adebayo.\n\n\u201cThe Lekki property, the house in my village, Isanya Ogbo, and three-bedroom flat in a town house, at Omorinre Street in Lekki are the properties I have in the whole world,\u201d the Yoruba leader said.\n\nFurthermore, Oyinlola who said his forthcoming autobiography had already taken care of all the issues raised in Akande\u2019s book about him, however said he decided to make preliminary replies for the benefit of Nigerians who may be interested in hearing his own immediate side of the story.\n\nThe former Osun Governor stated: \u201cChief Akande said I wrongly accused him of corruption in the construction of the Governor\u2019s Office (Bola Ige House). I did not level any false charges against him. I came into office in May 2003 and discovered that the Governor\u2019s Office complex which Akande commissioned for use after he lost the election was really not completed.\n\n\u201cThe state government asked the contractor to come back to site and complete the works, more so when evidence in government accounts showed that he had been paid. But the project consultant shocked everyone with his claim that part of the payment was taken back to finance the 2003 re-election bid of Chief Akande.\n\n\u201cThe consultant said the contractor could not go back to work unless he was paid his full dues. One of Akande\u2019s own appointees confessed collecting money from this contractor for Akande\u2019s re-election. I consulted Chief Akande on this.\n\n\u201cHe denied having any deal with the contractor and the consultant. Some people were subsequently taken to court on a seven-count criminal charge. Stakeholders in the state and Alhaji Arisekola Alao later intervened. I have the details of who collected how much in my forthcoming book.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Oyinlola wrote: \u201cAkande wrote on the Government House that he wanted to build on a site on Ilesa road in Osogbo which I stopped. I found it strange that Chief Akande who boasted that he was prudent and honest as governor, awarded the construction of a Government House in his last days in office, after he lost the election, and in advance, paid the contractors the entire contract sum of N800million.\n\n\u201cChief Akande confirmed this strange payment on page 393 of his book. This was a man who said there was no money to pay workers and pensioners but he had enough to pay a contractor in advance for a government house after losing his re-election.\n\n\u201cIn any case, the state already had an ongoing Government House started by the military government which Akande refused to complete. I completed the project and added chalets plus a presidential lodge. Everything was completed and commissioned within my first year in office. \u201cThe state has continued to use the structures till date. Akande, in his book, condemned my decision to opt for that project instead of his own idea. Further details on this are in my forthcoming book.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Obinna Chima\n\nThe World Bank yesterday announced its approval of a $700 million credit from its International Development Association (IDA) for the Nigeria Agro-Climatic Resilience in Semi-Arid Landscapes (ACReSAL) Project.\n\nThe project is expected to increase the implementation of sustainable landscape management practices in northern Nigeria and strengthen the country\u2019s long-term enabling environment for integrated climate-resilient landscape management.\n\nAccording to a statement from the multilateral institution, the productivity of major crops in Nigeria had been steadily declining over the past two decades, in part due to climate change, forcing an expansion of the area under agriculture and increased imports to meet the food needs of Nigeria\u2019s growing population.\n\nIt noted that persistent water shortages, especially in the extreme north, continue to exacerbate land degradation, desertification, and habitat loss.\n\n\u201cResource shortages, violent conflict, outdated agricultural systems not adapted to changing dryland conditions, lack of access to finance, weak value chain linkages, an uncompetitive environment for agribusiness, and poor market access are other key barriers to increased agricultural productivity in Nigeria. \u201cBetter environmental and water resources management and resilience against disaster and climate risks (largely water-related) are needed to sustain economic growth and protect the most vulnerable,\u201d it added.\n\nWorld Bank\u2019s Country Director for Nigeria, Shubham Chaudhuri noted that Nigeria was faced with water scarcity and droughts which occur every five years, on average, with the potential to increase in frequency due to climate change.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis scenario not only threatens food security, livelihoods, and productivity, but also exacerbates fragility and increases the risk of violence.\n\n\u201cWith communities and households that are most dependent on natural resources for their survival and vulnerable to desertification, this intervention will improve multi-sectoral watershed planning and investments to help about 3.4 million direct beneficiaries adapt to evolving dryland conditions.\u201d\n\nThe Washington-based institution pointed out that in recent years, the Government of Nigeria had established several initiatives in the agriculture sector to combat desertification including afforestation and reforestation programs, dissemination of proven agricultural technologies and sustainable agricultural practices, and promotion of efficient energy sources.\n\nHowever, it stated that efforts to stop and reverse desertification had been complicated by the need to feed a rapidly increasing population in a region where natural resources were dwindling and over 90 percent of national food production depends on smallholder farmers who lack the capacity to increase food production without degrading land.\n\nThe ACReSAL Project is a 6-year strategic project prioritising actions within four components: Dryland Management, Community Climate Resilience, Institutional Strengthening and Project Management, and Contingent Emergency Response.\n\nIt is expected to improve the capacity of the country to adapt to a changing climate, largely through enhancing multi-sectoral convergence (across environment, agriculture and water) and technology modernisation, including improved use of data, analytics, and connectivity.\n\n\u201cThe project will specifically target the inclusion of vulnerable and marginalised groups, including women, youth, the elderly, persons with disabilities, internally displaced people, and ethnic and religious minorities using an integrated watershed approach across sectors and levels of governance,\u201d Task Team Leader, ACReSAL, World Bank, Joy Iganya Agene said.\n\n\u201cThis will help reduce the vulnerability of millions of the extreme poor in northern Nigeria, strengthening their own role in the management of their natural resources while also addressing land degradation, strengthening climate resilience, and lessening livelihood vulnerability in dry, semi-arid and dry sub-humid regions in the northern states,\u201d Agene added.\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s IDA established in 1960, helps the world\u2019s poorest countries by providing grants and low to zero-interest loans for projects and programs that boost economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve poor people\u2019s lives.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Umar of the High Court of Kebbi State and Justice Edem Kooffreh of the High Court of Cross River State.\n\nA statement from the NJC\u2019s Director of Information, Mr Soji Oye, noted that although there was no written petition, allegations of corruption or impropriety against the subject Judges, council nevertheless, initiated investigation pursuant to its inherent disciplinary powers under the constitution to unravel the circumstances that led to the spate of exparte orders granted by these courts of coordinate jurisdiction over matters bearing same parties and subject matter.\n\n\u201cThe meeting, which was chaired by the Deputy Chairman of Council, Justice Mary Peter-Odili, agreed with the recommendations of the Investigation Committee set up in September 2021, that Justice Okogbule Gbasam of the High Court of Rivers State be barred from elevation to higher Bench for two years whenever he is due, as he failed to exercise due diligence in granting the Exparte Order in Suit No: PHC/2183/CS/2021 between IBEALWUCHI EARNEST ALEX & 4 ORS AND PRINCE UCHE SECONDUS & ANOR, as there was no real urgency, in the circumstances of the matter, that would have required an Exparte Order.\n\n\u201cHis Lordship is also issued with a warning letter to be circumspect in granting such Exparte Orders in the future.\n\n\u201cCouncil also resolved that Justice Nusirat I.

          "text": "Aviation authorities in Ghana have heightened their clampdown on Nigerians who test positive for Coronavirus while travelling through any of their airports.\n\nOfficials of the West African nation move affected Nigerian travellers to M Plaza Hotel in Accra, the country\u2019s capital, and force them to pay $100 (N56,000) per night to isolate themselves at the place.\n\nAccording to findings by SaharaReporters, the amount does not give the affected person access to water or food at the hotel.\n\nAs a result, about five Nigerians including a pregnant woman, who are currently being forced to stay at the facility by Ghanaian Government officials, have not had their bath and a decent meal for about six days.\n\nDespite repeated pleas to move them to a government isolation centre in the city, the Ghanaian officials have declined the request, instead offering only antibiotics to the Nigerian travellers, who tested positive for the virus while on transit.\n\nOne affected traveller told SaharaReporters that after keeping a Nigerian on transit with COVID-19 at this Accra hotel for one week, they allow you to leave only after you have paid another $700 to retrieve your passport.\n\nHe said, \u201cPassengers who test positive for COVID are forced to pay $100 a night in a hotel that\u2019s not worth the amount.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t feed patients, no water or food at the hotel.\n\n\u201cThe worst part is that after seven days of paying $100 if you still test positive, they allow you go but you must pay $700 before having your passport back.\n\n\u201cThose who don\u2019t have money are left at the lobby of the hotel without drugs which is usually antibiotics.\n\n\u201cThere is a pregnant woman currently among the Nigerians being forced to stay at M Plaza Hotel in Accra.

A lawsuit demanding Kanu's fundamental human rights had been instituted at the court.\n\nJustice Benson Anya of the Abia court had said in the last court proceedings on December 10 that the parties will receive notice on the date the court will render its judgment.\n\nKanu is facing charges of treasonable felony levelled against him by the Nigerian government, but Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court, Abuja, had adjourned his case till next year, January 18.\n\nEjimakor said, \"It is my hope as his lawyer that he will not spend Christmas in detention, but we don't have any court case this year again.\n\n\"The Abuja case is next year January 18, while the Umuahia has been concluded but we have to wait for when they will call us for judgment.\"\n\nSimilarly, Igboho, who was arrested by the Republic of Benin authorities at the Cotonou Airport on July 19, 2021, has since been in a detention facility in the neighbouring country.\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters on Thursday, Pelumi Olajengbesi, one of the activist's counsel said the chances of getting Igboho out of prison in 2021 is very slim.\n\nHe, however, does not rule out the possibility of Igboho's release as he added that efforts were being made to secure his release.\n\n\u201cFrankly, the hope of getting him released this year is still very slim. There are diplomatic consultations going on in respect of that because as you know, Igboho in the eyes of the law is a very free person, he has committed no crime.\n\n\u201cWe know he's being held against his will. He's a prisoner of conscience and so we believe that he will be out soon but I can't guarantee he will be out before the end of this year. There are lots of diplomatic discussions going on in that regard.\u201d\n\nConcerning the health of the agitator which had sometime ago been reportedly failing, Olanengbesi stated, \u201cI can tell you right now that Chief Sunday Igboho is hale and hearty, very motivated, a very strong person. If you know him very closely, you will know he is a very courageous person. We continue to pray that God gives him more strength to remain focused.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported efforts made by some major pro-Yoruba bodies to get Igboho out of jail, including holding protests to register their displeasure at his continued detention.\n\nIn November, Yoruba self-determination group, Ilana Omo Oodua announced that it had begun the movement to secure the release of Igboho.\n\nThe group disclosed this during the inauguration of its Elders Advisory Council in Ibadan.\n\nEarlier this month, members of the Agbekoya Solidarity Movement of Nigeria, representing the interest of farmers in Ibadan, Oyo State, took to the streets to call for the immediate release of the activist.\n\nThe protesters started the protest from Mapo Hall in Ibadan, carrying placards boldly demanding the release of Igboho who they claimed was fighting for their rights.\n\nThe group had approached the palace of the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji, with a letter stating their demands.\n\n\n\nThey requested that the king present the letter to President Muhammadu Buhari on their behalf.\n\nAlso, a Nigerian-American philanthropist, Toyin Dawodu urged the Benin Republic government to immediately release Igboho from detention.\n\nDawodu, in a statement, warned that the Beninese government must ensure the adequate release of the activist within seven days or \u201cface serious consequences of the nature of an economic embargo that as a country, it may never recover from, in a very long time.\u201d",

          "title": "Inside TeamApt: How an upstart overturned competition to dominate agency banking",
          "text": "Six years after TeamApt, a little-known banking software development company, had launched, it stirred excitement after Bloomberg reported the startup\u2019s move to raise $150 million at a billion-dollar valuation\u2014which would elevate it to the coveted unicorn status. TeamApt\u2019s co-founders had bootstrapped the company from a four-man team in their flat in 1004 Estate to building products, MoneyTor and AptPay, which serviced virtually all the commercial banks in Nigeria. TeamApt followed the growth with a $5.5 million Series A round by 2019.\n\nHowever, it was Moniepoint, the product it launched next, that skyrocketed the company to near-unicorn status.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Nigeria had 4.3 bank branches per 100,000 people in 2018, thereby leaving many of its 200 million population either unserved or underserved. Moniepoint provides payment, withdrawal, and deposit services to these underbanked users through an army of agents mostly in mom-and-pop stores across the country. In 2019, when OPay announced a total of $170 million in fundraising from two rounds and marched thousands of point-of-sale (POS) terminal-wielding footmen across the country to convert agents and successfully grow agency banking in the country, Moniepoint launched that September after a beta-testing phase, with about 1,000 agents.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have money then, so we were taking terminals from banks and manually sending them to agents, individually, in other parts of the country. That was so base and hectic,\u201d says Tolu Adetuyi, Moniepoint Head of Growth.\n\nAfter the $5.5 million raise, TeamApt had cash in the bank to place orders for terminals in China and invaded the Nigerian market. Now it processes over $4 billion monthly, servicing 18 million unique customers, and has over 120,000 active merchants in almost all of Nigeria\u2019s 774 local government areas (LGAs)\u2014only the terror-prone LGAs in the country\u2019s northern regions are left out. A regulator report seen by TechCabal back in June capturing transaction volumes by super agents showed TeamApt recorded an agent transaction volume of roughly 50 million, which accounted for 75% of total agent volumes collated for the month reported. Although, an industry analyst under anonymity told TechCabal that he doubts OPay\u2019s numbers were captured in the report.\n\nSo how did TeamApt become this super agent?\n\n\u201cBack then, our fee was only 1% of each transaction, which was high, but that was what we could afford, but we obsessed about our agents and offered them unmatched user experience,\u201d Adetuyi explained.\n\nTolu Adetuyi, as growth lead, along with 40 other support staff, oversee a massive network of agents engaged through Whatsapp groups dedicated to each LGA in Nigeria and a few other separate high-level Whatsapp groups of LGA agent leaders also called cluster managers, state managers, and regional managers. These performing agents-turned-managers are responsible for increasing and engaging the agents in their communities in order to increase their affiliate commission. They earn 0.4% on withdrawals and \u20a67 on transactions.\n\n\u201cMy phone is always buzzing, and I\u2019m attending town hall meetings. That\u2019s like, the whole of my work. I know what\u2019s happening on the streets right from my room,\u201d Adetuyi tells me excitedly via a Google Meet call.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s strong feedback loop facilitates rich market intelligence which enabled the company successively introduce groundbreaking features to the market which some competitors adopted and eventually became industry standards.\n\nMrs Ogunleye, an agent in the Alimosho local government area of Lagos, runs a grocery store and owns three POS terminals. \u201cI started using Moniepoint because of their daily commission settlement while others were paying monthly,\u201d she tells TechCabal.\n\nSources at TeamApt credit Moniepoint\u2019s early success and breakthrough growth to this payment feature. \u201cMany of these agents are like petty traders who need their daily earnings for restocking and running their households. I study my agents. I literally have documents on agent motivation,\u201d Adetuyi shares.\n\nMoniePoint also provides agents with live analytics dashboards to see a detailed breakdown of their performance and earnings. This transparency enables agent trust in the commission given and drives them to improve their performance as opposed to opaque estimated monthly earnings.\n\nTeamApt deploys an interesting 70% active POS terminal performance management system for cluster managers. That is, for every 10 terminals given, at least 7 must be doing transaction values exceeding certain amounts. The figure is determined by the area and market trend. This drives cluster managers to identify and recruit the best agents and engage them daily to improve their performance. Failing cluster managers can\u2019t get additional terminals, and this means their multi-level earnings on their agent network caps. No one wants that. So they\u2019d have to retrieve the non-performing terminals and give them to better agents.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really want people who use our terminals only when they are broke. It affects your cluster manager\u2019s appraisal, which in turn affects your state co-ordinator and regional manager\u2019s appraisal. We want active agents who use them daily. We try to prevent what they call bozo explosion, where we bring in lots of agents but are not able to service the 20% that\u2019s going to give you most of your revenue, then you end up losing them,\u201d Solomon Amadi, Vice President at TeamApt, tells TechCabal.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s agent network is a vibrant talent ecosystem that allows enterprising agents to grow through the rank. Merchant agents can become cluster managers at LG level, grow into state managers, and finally regional heads, while increasing their earnings along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a talent war. Competitors are calling and trying to poach our star agents, so much so that we know the name of some of the employees calling them because our agents tell us. That\u2019s why we sign exclusive contracts with some of these agents,\u201d Amadi disclosed.\n\nThe talent grab, though, goes both ways. TeamApt also tries to convert performing agents on other platforms.\n\nTo improve the reliability of its product, TeamApt introduced to the market a 24-hour resolution service for false debit card withdrawals. Usually, it takes 8 days after physically visiting a bank branch to resolve an unsuccessful card withdrawal where the customer\u2019s account got debited. But TeamApt funds customers from its account once it can verify the transaction and later sorts out the reconciliation at the back end with the bank.\n\n\u201cThe solutions we introduced to the market seem commonplace but many of them weren\u2019t being done till we did. In Nigeria, we just like to copy and paste models without thinking to adapt them to our peculiarities. But, first principles thinking has really helped us in how we approach problems and come up with the solutions we have introduced,\u201d Adetuyi concludes.\n\n\u201cFirst principles thinking\u201d is a phrase I heard often while interviewing management executives at TeamApt. It\u2019s a problem-solving thought process of attacking problems by first identifying the fundamental issues. It was first taught by Aristotle and currently made popular by South African-born physics engineering genius, Elon Musk. Tosin Eniolorunda, founder and CEO of TeamApt, champions the thought process and is instilling it into the company culture.\n\n\u201cWhen we hit a roadblock while thinking up a solution, Felix (TeamApt CTO) would often say, okay, let\u2019s go back, let\u2019s go back,\u201d Eniolorunda tells me as he rolls his wrist backwards. He shares that his exposure to first principles philosophy came in stages. The first time was in his 100 level at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) as a mechanical engineering student.\n\n\u201cI got into OAU on merit, first try. So, I was feeling fly with myself. But I now failed in my first year. My CGPA was 3.3,\u201d he shares in-between laughs. \u201cThat was a major learning experience for me. I learnt the power of focus. Secondly, it sparked a new way of thinking because adversity changes us. I questioned myself on why I want excellence and I began to think of how to get there.\u201d\n\nTosin, the first born of a building contractor father and primary teacher mother, worked and paid his way through tertiary school and graduated with a second class upper in mechanical engineering. He had always wanted to be an entrepreneur and build \u201csomething massive\u201d. With TeamApt seemingly to be crowned with unicorn status, the company now has its eyes on digital banking but with a slant. \u201cThere\u2019s a me too movement in tech. Everyone is launching digital banking with different offerings. But the fundamental question is, what do customers really need? Zero cost transaction accounts? That\u2019s good, but I think credit is one of the key needs. So, we will be launching a hybrid credit-led banking solution that also caters to the offline market,\u201d Eniolorunda concludes.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Want luxury fashion? Play Africa\u2019s first metaverse crypto game",
          "text": "The digital age has seen people try to imitate reality online. A result of this trend is that people are buying the online versions of what they would normally buy in real life: luxury houses, dresses, and even land. For example, this year saw the purchase of the world\u2019s first digital home, sold for over $500,000 on the NFT market. Instead of physical artworks, people now buy Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), digital assets whose ownerships are recorded on the blockchain.\n\nDigital fashion allows designers to model their designs in pixels instead of silk, cotton, lace, or polyester. Digital fashion can be in the form of digital fashion conceived to produce physical garments or fashion that a person can wear only with augmented or virtual reality. Or it can be fashion that is sold directly to an avatar.\n\nPowered by blockchain and NFTs, the digital fashion world is steadily growing. This growth is marked by the emergence of fashion houses like The Fabricant, which creates digital-only fashion; and RTFKT, a company that specialises in making digital sneakers that can be used and traded in virtual spaces as NFTs. In what represents a landmark moment in digital fashion, The Fabricant sold the world\u2019s first digital-only dress, \u201dIridescence\u201d, for $9,500 to a Canadian, Rachel Ma.\n\nThe Fabricant\u2019s \u2018Iridescence\u2019 | @the_fab_ric_ant\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic forced designers to rethink and seek a digital option to showcase their collections, leading to the creation of hyper-real digital showrooms around the world.\n\nA product of digital fashion, hyper-real fashion, is used to explain the use of tech to virtually showcase fashion products. By removing the need for humans to physically examine fashion products, hyper-real fashion tech continues to blur the lines of a prominent human physical experience: shopping.\n\nThis has also led to the development of Obsess, an experiential e-commerce platform, that uses 3D to create 360-degree virtual stores. Their portfolio includes brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Dior, and Charlotte Tilbury. \u201cVirtual stores can be created completely digitally and don\u2019t have to exist in real life. Brands use this option to create super engaging experiences for their customers,\u201d says Neha Singh, Obsess\u2019s founder and CEO, in an interview with Vogue India earlier this year.\n\nPositioning for \u201cmeta fashion\u201d\n\nThe metaverse is the use of the combination of technology like virtual reality, augmented reality, and video to create a digital world. The metaverse, unlike the way we currently access the internet, is immersive.\n\nSome of the earliest collaborations between the metaverse and fashion industry can be seen in games. There is Burberry\u2019s first-of-its-kind NFT collection with Mythical Games\u2019 Blankos Block Party, Gucci\u2019s Garden Metaverse with Roblox and their Aria Collection Film at Christie\u2019s, and Louis Vuitton\u2019s \u201cLouis The Game\u201d NFT in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French house\u2019s founding.\n\nWhile it is evident that the metaverse will enjoy massive investments from the fashion industry, the gaming industry is not left behind. Collaboration between the fashion and gaming industry in the metaverse presents a huge economic opportunity. Some notable collaborations in recent times include Balenciaga and Fortnite working together to design accessories and skins, Burberry partnering with Tencent to create exclusively designed skins for Honor of Kings characters.\n\nThe fashion industry is investing in the metaverse to create the branding of the future. While the metaverse is still new and building around it is still ongoing, its building blocks\u2014fashion avatars, digitally designed spaces, exotic pets in games\u2014are not entirely foreign.\n\nIn an attempt to tap into the trend of combining fashion and the digital world, Delz Erinle, a product and UX designer and Niyi Okeowo, an art director, started Thrill Digital, a company that started as a virtual fashion showcase and now pioneers a fashion metaverse. Thrill Digital uses a combination of Web3 technologies like XR (AR/VR), video, audio, crypto, and gaming to create its own fashion metaverse and other unreleased digital products.\n\nDuring the pandemic last year, Erinle saw how difficult it was to shop. So, he decided to bring in Lead Developer and Chief Technical Officer (CTO), Luke Jeffers, to use 3D to create a VR shopping product, to make shopping more accessible and effortless for an audience that was stuck at home.\n\nPivoting from creating the initial idea of a fashion show, Thrill started working on a VR shopping product. Thrill Digital pitched a lot of investors and won Epic Game\u2019s MegaGrant worth $40,000 in January this year to create the VR shopping product. They eventually delivered the product during Lone Design Club fashion week in February.\n\nAfter that, Erinle carried out research in a mall in London where he asked people if they would play a game to win luxury prizes. The feedback they got from people was affirmative. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to create a metaverse project initially. It was like a virtual shopping experience, first, \u201d Erinle said.\n\nThis was how Thrill Digital started Astra, a fashion crypto game where players can win real-life fashion luxury items. The game would have its own crypto token, which must be connected to a crypto wallet like the popular crypto game, Axie Infinity. The game will be open on December 20 and users can play to win a Balenciaga Small Hourglass Tote Bag. When players win a luxury item on Astra, it would be delivered to them wherever they are in the world.\n\nErinle, who doesn\u2019t believe a fully fleshed metaverse has been created yet, explained the metaverse as \u201ca collection of interoperable virtual worlds which people can experience using an avatar. The metaverse is a virtual 3D environment where people can interact but this time with phones; it is an immersive experience.\u201d\n\nLead 3D designer, Charles Egbejule, believes daring to dream they can build a mini metaverse out of Africa was one of the biggest challenges they had to face. While lead VR architect, Adekunbi Ajai, believes building remotely from different parts of the world also poses a challenge for the team. But they were able to adapt and can now easily communicate, she added.\n\nFor the team\u2019s brand designer and co-founder, Niyi Okeowo, one difficulty they faced was raising awareness on a new concept like digital fashion. \u201cWe were trying to sell the product while teaching people about it.\u201d\n\nThe audience that Astra is targeting is people who love fashion, people who use crypto, and people who love games\u2014or people who love all three.\n\nSo here is how the game works: players amass as many crypto tokens as they can within an allotted time, after which a leaderboard is created where winners will be declared and win luxury fashion.\n\nJeffers explained that NFTs would play a huge role in claiming ownership of clothing accessories and land in Astra.\n\nErinle explained that it chose to build its metaverse on the Solana blockchain because of its low gas fees and low energy consumption. Citing a report that says transactions on the Solana blockchain consume less energy than two Google searches, Astra believes it is contributing to the reduction of environmental sustainability issues.\n\nThe game will be available first on PC before VR headsets and, hopefully, mobile devices.\n\nTapping into the play-to-earn trend\n\nLike the play-to-earn crypto game, Axie Infinity, Astra will make money through protocol profits too. Revenue is generated via fees for interacting with a protocol\u2014a game\u2019s unique crypto token.\n\nAxie Infinity made huge profits using a similar approach this year. The leading crypto game has raked in $84.9 million in funds, making its protocol profit one of the biggest in the market. In the case of Axie Infinity, whenever a player sells one of the Axie creatures, he pays a 4.25% marketplace fee. He does this when he sells land or special items. Another way Axie makes money is through the fee of 4 AXS, the game\u2019s native token for \u201cbreeding\u201d more digital creatures called Axies.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ventures Platform launches a $40m fund, invites Seni Sulyman as venture partner",
          "text": "As far back as 2005, Kola Aina knew he wanted to invest in companies. He even registered a company name after his MBA program\u2014one which he\u2019s too embarrassed to share and ended up not using. After a number of rejections, unreplied messages, and bootstrapping his first business, Kola Aina launched Ventures Platform, an early-stage pan-African VC firm, in 2016.\n\nToday, Ventures Platform, announced a $40m fund for African tech startups. The new fund which has reached the first close is being led by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).\n\nThe fund features participation from experienced investors and some new leading names in Africa\u2019s technology and corporate ecosystem,, including UAC Nigeria, VFD Group, Gbenga Oyebode, Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, as well as global investors like Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, and Adam Draper. A sizable portion of the fund comes from local partners, Ventures Platform told TechCabal.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Ventures Platform has backed almost 70 startups including Seamless HR, PiggyVest, Mono, and Paystack\u2014which Stripe acquired in October 2020 for over $200m.\n\nThis new fund will allow Ventures Platform to significantly deepen its long-standing presence in Nigeria and West Africa while also investing in select companies in East, North and Francophone Africa that are able to expand across the continent.\n\n\u201cPrior to this fund, we could only write one cheque, then introduce the entrepreneur to our network of investors for a follow-on round. Now we\u2019re not only able to write their first cheque but also write follow-on rounds for our companies,\u201d Kola Aina, founder and General Partner at Ventures Platform, told TechCabal.\n\nThis new capital injection will enable Ventures Platform to double down on existing investments in its category-leading portfolio via subsequent rounds. Aina believes that being able to double down on existing investments means they can assure startups that they have a long-term capital partner. It also helps Ventures Platform defend their ownership stake in the companies, as they can participate in the upside they helped build, which is important from a returns perspective.\n\nAs part of a move to further deepen its expertise, Ventures Platform has also onboarded leading figures across African tech as Venture Partners, including Seni Sulyman (ex-VP at Andela, founder at Black Ops.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very bullish about the market; it\u2019s about the entrepreneur first. Across our portfolio, we now have two companies whose entrepreneurs we\u2019ve funded twice. We funded their first project, it didn\u2019t work; we\u2019ve funded them again,\u201d Aina said.\n\nAina has a heart for entrepreneurs as he\u2019d been one before becoming an investor.\n\nFascinated by the power of capital\n\n\u201cI was just always fascinated by the power of capital. I always wanted to end up being an investor, even when it wasn\u2019t popular.\u201d\n\nWhat attracted Aina to investing? It was the notion of giving people money and seeing them build something meaningful with it.\n\nIn 2009, Aina moved back from the US to Nigeria and co-founded Emerging Platforms, a software company. Initially, they had some customers willing to pay, but the business needed funding. They tried to raise funds but faced rejection at every corner.\n\n\u201cWe wrote a letter to every bank in Nigeria, got introductions but everyone said no. So, we went back to the drawing board and bootstrapped the business.\u201d\n\nThe harrowing experience of fundraising stayed with Aina and ignited the desire to change how people got access to capital in Africa.\n\nMaking new mistakes\n\nFortunately, the bootstrapped business thrived and Aina started angel investing in 2014. Two years later, he had an epiphany that waiting for the government and donors to solve society\u2019s problems was pointless. A better alternative was to find and fund young people using technology to solve these problems.\n\nInspired by Silicon Valley-esque accelerators, Ventures Platform was born in 2016. The initial approach was to get the best entrepreneurs from across Africa to fly into a campus in Abuja for a 16-week acceleration program. They were paired with investors, team members, capital, and mentors.\n\n\u201cObviously everyone told us acceleration is too difficult to do in Africa, but we told them we\u2019ll make new mistakes.\u201d\n\nWhile making new mistakes, they also got a few things right. One of the things Ventures Platform did then that was pioneering and different was that it was fully transparent with its terms of investing in startups. It offered $20,000 for 10% equity.\n\n\u201cAt that time it was one of the fairer deals out there,\u201d Aina said.\n\nThis transparency helped ventures attract talents like Kayode Oyewole, partner at Ventures Platform and Fola Olatunji-David, who later left the firm to become Head of Startup Success and Service at Google. Aina also believes that sharing the firm\u2019s manifesto helped move the market forward in setting the terms of evaluation for pre-seed companies in Africa.\n\nAlongside the accelerator, Aina continued investing and got to invest in startups like Paystack, Kudi, Kangbe (now Reliance HMO), Printivo and Tizeti.\n\nAfter the first year, Aina and his team saw that the accelerator wasn\u2019t ideal for the continent, so they pivoted to an early-stage fund model.\n\n\u201cWith people living together on campus, you\u2019re not just investing and helping people scale their businesses, you\u2019re also dealing with personalities. It was almost like the Big Brother House but for investing.\u201d\n\nNotably, the initial capital used to run the accelerator and invest in startups was Aina\u2019s personal funds. He had to have a conversation with his wife telling her that he needed to raid their savings to support startups.\n\n\u201cWe did over a million dollars in investments in the early days. But, in retrospect, that was a smart decision because it helped us show a track record.\u201c\n\nBy late 2017, Ventures Platform started raising external capital: syndicate funds. This happened because people who were impressed with the performance of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies wanted to invest in Ventures Platform.\n\nThe syndicate style investments continued until mid last year when Aina felt it was time for Ventures Platform to start working on raising its first institutional fund.\n\nWhy did he wait this long to raise an institutional fund?\n\n\u201cI wanted to see evidence that there\u2019s liquidity in this market before I raised an institutional fund. Startups are not just about inspiration or motivational talk. It\u2019s real business. Startup founders sometimes forget that I have to return money to my investors.\u201d\n\nWhy $40m matters\n\n2021 has been a record year for African startups as they\u2019ve raised over $4 billion so far. It\u2019s easy to see $40m, in an era where $100m raises are the new normal and wonder \u201cWhat difference does $40m make?\u201d\n\nAina believes that while the increase in capital inflow is important, the venture capital space needs to be seen as a continuum. For him, Venture Platforms\u2019 role is to find companies early and support them along the way as they gain product-market fit and look to scale.\n\n\u201cThere was a period when a company raising $500,000 was huge. Five years ago, you could count the number of local funds in the market. I think it\u2019s day one for this fund. We must not get ahead of ourselves. We want to stay disciplined. We\u2019re very clear about our thesis and are staying grounded to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBy failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Franklin\n\nA few weeks ago, we started a discussion on The Next Frontier. Since then, we\u2019ve explored The Next Frontier as it relates to edtech and fintech. This week, we\u2019re doing something a bit different.\n\nDrawing from previous discussions, we will look at four future developments in tech and what they could mean for you either as a student, startup founder, entrepreneur, or policymaker.\n\nAI and more data applications in edtech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Pixabay on Pexels\n\nThere have been considerable developments in Africa\u2019s edtech space, from remote learning to self-paced learning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the future, the application of artificial intelligence and proper data management would be groundbreaking. In the case of AI, it would be improving learning efficiency for students and teachers.\n\nOne of the challenges of traditional education is the inability to tailor teaching to the needs of students and AI can help with that through personalised learning.\n\nSo this could mean that while there may be several students in a class, they would all be taught at different levels and tested on different subjects.\n\nThe other development would be in the use of data. As more students use edtech solutions, a lot of data would be gotten that could also help in providing better learning outcomes.\n\nEven more interesting is that these developments would not be beneficial to students alone. Teachers would be able to develop curriculums that draw on the students\u2019 strengths.\n\nRepetitive and administrative tasks would also be cut down or eliminated using AI.\n\nAPI healthtech startups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@nci?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>National Cancer Institute</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@nci?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a>\n\nThe fintech industry has benefited a great deal from the presence of API fintech startups as they have eased interoperability. The same looks set to be done for the healthtech space.\n\nCurrently, there are no African startups providing healthtech startups with an API. Consequently, data obtained exists in silos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAPI startups could, therefore, be a game-changer. Imagine for a moment that you are a patient who has been using a healthtech provider but now needs to switch to another for some reason.\n\nWithout API startups, the process of getting your medical history has to begin afresh, but with an API startup, all that information could be gotten in seconds.\n\nIn addition, healthtech APIs mean that startups no longer have to build all the solutions they need but instead focus on the areas in which they excel.\n\nCompanies investing in companies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem matures, one trend that Abdul Hassan, Mono Founder and CEO, believes could become commonplace is companies investing in companies.\n\nAlready, we\u2019re seeing some form of it with Interswitch\u2019s investment in Okhi and Flutterwave\u2019s investment in CinetPay.\n\nWhat this would do is help companies consolidate their efforts. So rather than have several companies in a space but only slightly moving the needle, the resources and skills can be combined to go after a larger market.\n\nUsing the fintech industry as an example, it could mean that more financially excluded people get access to financial services.\n\nCompanies investing in companies would also mean that the smaller startup could leverage the assets and experience of the larger startup to build more efficient services and attract other investors.\n\nContactless cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use the Lagos State Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service, you will be familiar with contactless cards. You transfer money to it and use it to pay your bus fares.\n\nNow, imagine your financial service provider issuing such a card. You\u2019d no longer be bothered about leaving the house without cash or your ATM card.\n\nYou could pay for groceries or dates without using cash or punching in your ATM card PIN. It is also a safer option for users as it reduces the chances of being robbed. For business owners, it also improves the customer experience while protecting against fraud.\n\nIf you were not aware, The next frontier is also the theme for Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nHolding on January 22, 2022, it will feature startup competitions and exhibitions in addition to conversations on The next frontier. We would love to have you there, so if you have not registered, follow this link to do so.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "A Zimbabwean Data Protection Act to rule them all. Or not",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn December 3, 2021, Zimbabwe joined the list of African countries that can now boast a data protection law.\n\nLike the second instalment in this series, a tweet spurred this article. This tweet by tweeter, @RangMberi intrigued me for two reasons.\n\nNever having followed the Zimbabwean scene, it was nice to see. However, the tweet\u2019s contents were of more interest to me.\n\nFrom the screenshots Mberi shared, several acts such as revenge pornography, child pornography, and taking pictures of people\u2019s genitalia without their consent have become illegal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a data protection act, these were some intriguing provisions.\n\nA walk down memory lane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nBefore the current Act, Zimbabwe\u2019s laws have made provisions \u2014 albeit in a fragmented manner \u2014 for data protection and privacy.\n\nThe Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act dealt more with the collection, protection, and retention of personal information held by public officers. Other laws included the Consumer Protection Act, Census and Statistics Act, and the Interception of Communication Act, among others.\n\nBut this new law has been in the works for a while as well. First gazetted in May 2020 as the Cybercrimes and Data Protection Bill, it has since undergone some changes.\n\nInitially, The Cybercrimes and Data Protection Bill was to cover all things incidental to Cybercrime and Data Protection. Essentially a mash-up of two different but related fields.\n\nBut a lot of people weren\u2019t having that. Transparency International complained that it was a human rights lawsuit waiting to happen \u2014 especially regarding government spying and stifling freedom of speech. Other persons decried the bill as well.\n\nIn July 2020, Joint Parliamentary Portfolio Committees released a report asking that both fields be separated and an independent body be set up, among other recommendations.\n\nAnd it appears Parliament may have listened, somewhat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe current state of affairs\n\nThe Data Protection Act, as it is known now, is styled after the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) model law on data protection.\n\nIt provides for most of what you\u2019d expect from a data protection law; things like data rights of the data subject, what personal information is, and what sensitive information is, among others.\n\nIt provides extensively for consent \u2014 very important \u2014 and it introduces the vital issue of representation of infants and persons that are mentally, legally, or physically incapacitated by their parents and guardians.\n\nIt also explains other important provisions and duties of the data controller and processor, which we have touched on in previous articles.\n\nThe Act also establishes a Data Protection Authority (DPA), but this is where it gets a bit tricky. The DPA appointed in this case is an existing authority called the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (POTRAZ).\n\nPOTRAZ is Zimbabwe\u2019s telecommunications sector regulator, already saddled with responsibilities in that regard. Adding this to that is an interesting move, especially considering all of the duties assigned to them under this new law.\n\n\u201cI think they are going to be saddled with too much administrative authority. Because imagine having to handle all these breaches that will come within 48 hours. I don\u2019t know yet how adequately prepared they are for this.\n\n\u201cI tried to put together the duties of the DPA, and I don\u2019t know \u2014 resource-wise \u2014 whether they\u2019d be able to achieve all of that,\u201d Nellie Tiyango, a Zimbabwean lawyer, tells me.\n\nBut there\u2019s also the fact that POTRAZ already has some experience on the data collection and protection front.\n\n\u201cIt should have been because POTRAZ was already collecting data. Because that\u2019s where our telecoms as well fall under in terms of picking up sensitive information. We\u2019ve got the Interception of Communication Act, and I think POTRAZ was in charge of that. The rationale could have been that they already have a lot of data. And it might be easier than starting afresh.\u201d\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee, the new act was renamed the Data Protection Act instead of the Cybercrimes and Data Protection Act.\n\nHowever, after comparing the previous bill and the current Act, I found that it was merely rearranged to have all the parts touching on data protection at the beginning and the chapters touching on cybersecurity at the end.\n\nI worried that this could also create a duplication of laws and expressed this to Tiyango. But she had a differing opinion.\n\n\u201cData and cyber go hand-in-hand. There needed to be something that speaks to the issue of cybersecurity from a data perspective, which is what has been done. And I\u2019m sure [that] when we get the Cybersecurity law we will be able to see whether there\u2019s a duplication. I don\u2019t think that this causes any confusion. It\u2019s necessary.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the Act does not mention notifying a data subject where there is a breach of their data. So, say Peter, a Zimbabwean who uses a fintech app for sending money, has his data stolen by someone who hacked into the company\u2019s servers, it appears he might never find out that his data has been stolen.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation \u2014 the first comprehensive data protection law \u2014 provides for this. For some reason, Nigeria\u2019s National Data Protection Regulation has no such provision.\n\nThere are also issues of cross-border transfer of information between countries within and outside the SADC.\n\nFor instance, say you are conducting a cross-border transfer of funds, your data is flying over several countries, and the platform you are using has to ensure that the receiving platform has adequate resources in place to protect your data. If it doesn\u2019t, then your data should not be transferred.\n\nTiyango is interested in how this would play out, especially in scenarios where data is transferred to a non-SADC country.\n\nThe tech ecosystem and data protection\n\nAccording to Tiyango, \u201cThe Act aims to create a technology-driven business environment, encourage technological development, and the lawful use of technology.\u201d\n\nFrom what she tells me, companies like electronic communications networks or access providers, data collection and analytics techs, fintechs, mobile service providers, payment platforms, Internet service providers, satellite television service providers, and health services, including laboratories and testing techs, would have to comply.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tumisu on Pixabay\n\nThe Zimbabwean Act is fresh out of the oven and needs time to cool before we can fully dissect all of the possible scenarios that could occur here.\n\nWill POTRAZ be able to handle all of its duties? Will there be a marked difference between the Data Protection Act and a possible Cybercrimes bill? Most of all, how would all of this affect the data rights of Zimbabweans?\n\nThis is a developing story, and we\u2019ll be bringing more on this as we get more information.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phrase \u201cUber-like platform for ambulances\u201d reechoed in the room, as HELP, an acronym for Health Emergency Linkage Portal, announced the launch of its GPS based mobile application and emergency healthcare hotline on October 5, 2021.\n\nThe healthtech and logistics company is on a mission to provide quality health care emergency services via a mobile application that allows you to order for an ambulance in case of an emergency, or schedule ahead of a medical appointment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProper and affordable health care is a fundamental human right. Sadly, in most developing countries like Nigeria, good healthcare is a privilege and accessing medical facilities can be an onerous task. The healthcare sector in the country is crippled with challenges like sluggish response to emergency cases, poor health infrastructure, low number of health workers, amongst other limitations. Deji Faborode, Co-founder and CEO of HELP, says this is the gap they are trying to bridge, one step at a time.\n\n\u201cA lot can be done and we\u2019re still scratching the surface of healthcare solutions in Nigeria. Things are not working as they should as a result of misaligned objectives. Our people are scared for their lives, because what happens in the case of a health emergency? Existing emergency structures don\u2019t meet the demand. This is what brought the vision for HELP. One of the gaps we\u2019re hoping to bridge is the hopelessness in emergency situations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe goes further to add that the big picture is creating interconnected systems to complement the existing ones, in order to have a fully working and unified body of ambulance service providers.\n\nDeji Faborode (CEO), Yewande Alebiosu (COO), Victor Iwenya (CTO) and Tomiwa Ogunbona (CPO) birthed the idea to leverage technology in enhancing interconnectedness, building a collaborative healthcare ecosystem, and breaking the silos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome 23 months later, the HELP journey to improve access to emergency care has kicked off.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe HELP mobile app is currently available for Android users on the Play Store and is soon to be available on the App Store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHELP website\n\nIndividuals or corporate bodies sign up, create an account, receive an OTP to confirm registration, and can search for and access ambulances nearest to them. There is also a Healthcare facility navigator which serves as a directory of hospitals and pharmacies closest to the user\u2019s geographical location.\n\nThere are two levels of external partners at HELP, Service Partners and Client Partners. Service partners on the HELP platform include hospitals, health facilities, and private ambulance owners in the country. Client partners include Health Maintenance Organisations(HMO) and Corporate organisations who enroll their members.\n\nThe Client partners\u2019 subscription plan comes in three tiers, Gold, Silver and Bronze. Each varies with the size of the ambulance being ordered and the equipment available for the service needed. Every ambulance type has a base price but prices vary based on distance covered and time spent.\n\nEach user has a unique wallet on the app created for making payments. This cuts out the hurdle of having to re-enter financial information.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe HELP app has a feature that allows you to fill in the details of the emergency, to provide adequate information to the paramedics present in the ambulance. The HELP app comes with a feature that allows one to share details like driver\u2019s information, trip history, and the hospital sending the ambulance, with their loved ones. Due to the geo mapping system integrated on the app, routes taken can be tracked and recorded.\n\nBeyond an application, HELP has a hotline, 0-700-HELPSTATION, for cases where there is inability to access mobile networks in an emergency situation. Interestingly, a random person can access the HELP service with the code.\n\nAs the floor opened for comments, some members of the audience shared stories of having lost loved ones as a result of delayed responses to emergency calls and lack of medical assistance in crisis situations. These problems reflect the pillars of quick response, accessibility and coordination that HELP is looking to run on.\n\nOn plans for investments and expansion, Faborode shares that as much as the startup is open to social grants and funding, the key focus at the moment is gaining traction, spreading the word and above all, providing excellent service to users.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Race for investment dollars belongs to environment-conscious firms",
          "text": "The increasing scrutiny by investors and multilateral organisations on a company\u2019s environmental, social and governance risks before making investment decisions could reshape the global investment landscape, leaving behind companies that refuse to change, analysis shows.\n\nCurrent trends suggest that a company\u2019s environmental, social and governance (ESG) record as well as sustainability initiatives will play a critical role in whether it gets investments, secures government approvals and licences or even engages in international business.\n\nIn corporate speak, ESG is a term that denotes a stakeholder-centric approach to doing business. Under the environment, a company commits that its operations would not harm the environment, would be socially responsible, for example, in the use of customer\u2019s data and uphold corporate governance principles including ensuring gender equality.\n\nSome of the world\u2019s biggest financiers and lenders say ESG now plays a critical role in their decision to spend investment dollars with many singling out environmentally conscious companies as deserving of their investment.\n\n\u201cESG principles inform the way we run our firm, approach investing and partner with the assets in our portfolio,\u201d said the world\u2019s largest private equity firm, Blackstone, in its 2021 ESG report.\n\nThese private equity firms that largely source capital from institutional investors, such as pension funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds are increasingly being pressured to fund environmentally responsible companies.\n\nEven pan-African multilateral development organisation, the African Finance Corporation, has also said it \u201censures that it carries out its lending, investment and advisory services to its clients and counterparties in a manner that is not negatively impactful on the environment and which ensures sustainable development.\u201d\n\nA recent survey by a leading professional services firm, PwC Nigeria, found that investors are paying keener attention to ESG risks and opportunities facing companies they invest in and are ready to take action.\n\nThe survey sought the views of 325 investment professionals from 43 territories. 53 percent were asset managers and 34 percent were analysts, and they had a combined $11.6 trillion assets under management.\n\nNearly 80 percent of the respondents said ESG was an important factor in their investment decision making; almost 70 percent thought ESG factors should figure into executive compensation targets, and about 50 percent expressed willingness to divest from companies that did not take sufficient action on ESG issues.\n\nThe results suggest that investors are torn between what they view as a responsibility to the planet and society and their fiduciary responsibilities to their clients.\n\nWhile three-quarters of the investors surveyed said they thought it was worth sacrificing short-term profitability to address ESG issues, about the same number said they would be willing to accept only 1 percentage point or less of a haircut on their investment returns.\n\nHowever, the reality is that pressure to factor climate and environmental concerns into investment decisions is building globally and could become a norm.\n\nAlready, several financiers have indicated their unwillingness to lend to oil and gas projects around the world. At the COP26 in Glasgow, 34 countries and four international finance institutions committed to ending financing for \u201cunabated\u201d fossil fuel projects in overseas countries by the end of 2022.\n\nCampaigners are urging multilateral development banks including the World Bank Group, the African Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and others to stop funding fossil fuel projects.\n\nRead also: ESG: Nigeria fails on the environmental, social and governance fronts\n\nThese campaigns are having some impact. Norway\u2019s $1.4 trillion Sovereign Wealth Fund says it has exited hundreds of companies in the past few years because they were not compliant with ESG targets.\n\nThe European Union has proposed a rash of new laws to wean its economy off fossil fuels and could impose further tariffs that will impact businesses around the world including Africa.\n\nOne contentious proposal is the introduction of a border carbon adjustment tax that would impose tariffs on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with products imported from outside the European Union. In effect, this would protect European companies from goods made in countries with less stringent climate policies.\n\nSome of the insights deduced from the PwC survey are that companies are better served if they embed ESG directly into their corporate strategy and investors are emphasising the importance of leadership from the top team, starting with the CEO to communicate clearly the ESG goals.\n\nHowever, companies need not go overboard proving they are compliant by inundating \u201cinvestors with reams of data just for the sake of more disclosure or to overreach and fall prey to \u201cgreen-washing\u201d critiques,\u201d noted the PwC analysts.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 cases on Wednesday hit a nine-month high as 1,424 new cases were confirmed. Lagos, the epicentre of the country\u2019s coronavirus infection accounts for 55.8 percent of that total, with 796 cases.\n\nThis surge follows the detection of highly transmissible omicron in the country and a gradual rise in inbound travel.\n\nAnd Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general, World Health Organisation (WHO), has said that the omicron variant should not be underestimated and is spreading faster than any other COVID-19 variants as it is now present in 77 nations.\n\nAccording to data released by the National Centre for Disease Control, 152 cases were detected in Delta, FCT 130, Edo 129, Oyo 82, Ondo 39, Rivers 39, Kaduna 15, Enugu 9, Anambra 8, Kwara 7, Ogun 7, Bayelsa 4, Kano 4, and Akwa Ibom 3.\n\nOmicron has 10 times more mutations on the spike protein than the Delta variant, according to scientific studies, raising fears about transmissibility, symptoms, and whether it can evade vaccines more easily.\n\nScientists say the combination of four particular mutations helps Omicron evade antibodies.\n\nFindings show that Omicron has pushed Nigeria\u2019s average daily cases of up by 451 percent, from 74 cases seen in the first week of December.\n\nA total of 2,859 cases were confirmed in the week ended December 12, compared with 520 in the preceding week. Nigeria now has 217,481 cases confirmed and 2,981 deaths recorded across the federation.\n\nNigeria recorded its first three cases of omicron on December 1, days after it was first discovered in South Africa, and has entered a travel ban tussle with some countries.\n\nThe rise, 75 percent led by Lagos, has activated the reality of the fourth wave of the disease in Nigeria, reliving a similar pattern of surge that played out this time last year.\n\nIn December 2020, Nigeria was pushed into the second wave of the pandemic by a sustained rise in community infections, claiming 1,197 lives.\n\nRead also: COVID-19\u2019s threat to agriculture: A touching story of rural peasant farmers\n\nA new variant of COVID-19, lineage B.1.1.7 (Alpha), which cancelled Christmas in the UK, was found in Nigeria but after initial discovery in the UK.\n\nAbout 5,618 new cases had been recorded by the middle of the month, raising the total number of infections since the start of the pandemic to 73,175 as of December 13.\n\nA fresh record of the highest daily cases was set December 13 with 796 infections, overtaking 790 cases set July 1, during the gradual easing of the two-month-long lockdown that affected Abuja, Lagos and Ogun states.\n\nWhile intensified testing and surveillance at major points of entry reflect in the current infection rate, the WHO says the variant reported in more than 60 nations poses a very high global risk, with mutations likely leading to higher transmissibility.\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate Omicron \u2013 WHO\n\nAccording to Ghebreyesus, \u201cOmicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant. We\u2019re concerned that people are dismissing Omicron as mild,\u201d at a COVID update in Geneva.\n\n\u201cSurely, we have learned by now that we underestimate this virus at our peril.\n\n\u201cEven if Omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems. I need to be very clear: vaccines alone will not get any country out of this crisis. Countries can \u2013 and must \u2013 prevent the spread of Omicron with measures that work today,\u201d the WHO chief said.\n\nHe warned that making choices about strategies to halt the pandemic was the wrong approach: \u201cIt\u2019s not vaccines instead of distancing. It\u2019s not vaccines instead of ventilation or hand hygiene. Do it all. Do it consistently. Do it well.\u201d\n\nIn the past 10 weeks, the international vaccine rollout initiative, COVAX, has shipped more vaccines than in the first nine months of the year combined, with most nations using vaccines as fast as they get them.\n\n\u201cA small group of countries are facing challenges rolling out vaccines and scaling up rapidly, and WHO and our partners are working closely with those countries to overcome bottlenecks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlthough we expect further improvements in supply, there are no guarantees, and the hard-won gains we have made are fragile.\u201d\n\nOmicron existed since 2020 in quest for variant origin \u2013 Scientists\n\nScientists seeking convincing knowledge on how Omicron managed to quietly evolve and sustain mutation have come up with varying theories on how the highly infectious variant might have originated.\n\nOne of them, Sarah Otto, professor of evolutionary biology at the University of British Columbia, said the variant might have hidden under the radar for over a year because Omicron\u2019s genetic traits bear more similarity to forms of the virus that circulated in 2020 than more recent strains, such as Beta and Delta.\n\nThe disease detectives went to work after reports of the discovery of Omicron sprang up from South Africa towards November end and the genetic sequencing details were uploaded to a global database.\n\nA common theory among virologists is that Omicron spent months mutating in an individual with a weakened immune system and a chronic infection, according to a Financial Times report.\n\nOther theories accuse the use of anti-COVID drugs of speeding up evolution and that there is the possibility that a crossover into an animal species that later jumped back into humans occurred.\n\nGiven that South Africa has faced the first wave of Omicron infections, it is likely that the variant traces its roots to somewhere in the region, said Richard Lessells, an infectious diseases physician at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban.\n\nA South African research team, which included Lessells, discovered an untreated HIV patient late last year who was infected with COVID-19 for more than six months and gave rise to a string of mutations that affected the spike protein, the part of the virus where most of Omicron\u2019s adaptations are located.\n\nA UK study observed a similar process in a COVID patient with blood cancer. The immune response of an untreated HIV patient would be \u201ctoo weak to clear the virus but strong enough to drive the process of evolution,\u201d explained Lessells.",

          "text": "Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest crude oil exporter, is hoping to post its first budget surplus in nearly a decade next year on the back of improved oil prices and restricted government spending, a reality that is everything Nigeria wished for.\n\nUnlike Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer struggling to fund its yearly budget, or even fund an opaque subsidy scheme, Saudi Arabia has declared it will achieve a budget surplus of $24 billion, or about 2.5 percent of its gross domestic product, in 2022, its first since 2014.\n\nThe improvement in financial fortunes is expected to give Saudi the financial muscle it needs to not only scale up its oil production capacity by 1 million bpd to 13 million barrels per day, but also invest heavily in mitigating its carbon emissions, according to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\n\u201cSurpluses will be used to increase government reserves to counter the needs posted by the coronavirus pandemic, strengthen the kingdom\u2019s financial position, and boost its capabilities to face global shocks and crises,\u201d Salman told Saudi\u2019s official press agency, SPA.\n\nData from the Saudi Arabia budget office show the country\u2019s economy is expected to grow by almost 7.4 percent next year, after expanding by a modest 2.9 percent in 2021.\n\nThe budget document noted that Saudi Arabia\u2019s economic growth would be driven by high oil prices and \u201cthe expected improvement in non-oil GDP assuming that the economy continues to recover gradually from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nRead also: Saudi, Malaysia oil savings relieve citizens in lesson for Nigeria\n\nProject watchers say Saudi Aramco\u2019s multi-billion Zuluf offshore incremental project is expected soon to see the light of day, with the Saudi state-owned firm expected to place awards within months for the project.\n\nThe much-delayed Zuluf development is expected to cost up to $8 billion and aims to boost the country\u2019s crude output by as much as 600,000 barrels per day, almost doubling the field\u2019s production capacity.\n\n\u201cWe see more flexibility on the project spending front and Zuluf is expected to be at the forefront of Aramco\u2019s growth ambitions,\u201d one person close to the Saudi long-term agreement (LTA) arrangement with offshore contractors told SPA.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s fiscal projections next year are a marked improvement from recent years that have seen the country post heavy budget deficits as the coronavirus pandemic disrupted global economies and hammered oil prices.\n\nNigeria\u2019s story is the exact opposite of Saudi\u2019s successful economic reform.\n\nThe Federal Government spent N6.17 trillion more than it earned in 2020, leaving its fiscal deficit at 4 percent of GDP, the highest in 21 years, according to Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) data analysed.\n\nFurther analysis shows although, in the first seven months of 2021, revenue rose to N2.45 trillion from N2.17 trillion in the corresponding period last year, expenditure rose faster, climbing 16 percent to N6.43 trillion from N5.53 trillion within the same period.\n\nThe above resulted in a deficit of N5.1 trillion in seven months of 2021, representing 51 percent, increase compared with the N3.36 trillion recorded in the corresponding period last year.\n\n\u201cIf we do not meet our revenue target, which looks too ambitious, the deficit financing for 2021 will likely be higher,\u201d Toki Mabogunje, president, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), said.\n\nNigeria needs to think in terms of decentralisation to move forward, Joe Nwakwue, chairman, Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), said, noting, \u201cThe government must focus on setting up the right regulations and allow private sector to drive the oil and gas sector.\u201d\n\nMost experts have long urged for reforms that could unleash faster growth often feeling they are being held back by an out-of-touch Federal Government in Abuja.\n\nNigeria\u2019s unemployment rate has more than quadrupled over the last six years as the economy went through two recessions, overshadowing efforts by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration to create jobs.\n\nThe widening fiscal deficit and other challenges to revenue in Nigeria are unlikely to scuttle the government\u2019s plans to tap between $3 billion and $6 billion from the international debt market this year, according to Samir Gadio, head of Africa strategy at Standard Chartered Bank.\n\nThe last time Nigeria\u2019s fiscal deficit exceeded 4 percent was in 1999, when the government opened the taps on infrastructure spending to give the economy a boost after years of military rule.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nABUJA \u2013 The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) on Wednesday in Abuja, winged four pilots and 12 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operators who successfully completed their Basic Helicopter Pilot Training at the Draken Europe Helicopter Academy, U.K.\n\nThe Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, expressed delight for the additional expertise in the NAF ever-expanding inventory of manned and unmanned aircraft systems.\n\nAmao noted that the training was part of his vison of enhancing and sustaining critical airpower capabilities required for deployment in pursuit of national security imperatives.\n\n\u201dI am glad to note that, through foresight and diligence, we are effectively engaging one of the key drivers of my vision which is to pursue purposeful training and human capacity development.\n\n\u201cThe foregoing is based on the premise that, for NAF to function efficiently, both as a highly technical service and as a fighting force for the effective defence of Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity, it must have the right numerical strength.\n\n\u201cAnd, more importantly, the right quality of manpower in all relevant competencies.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we have continued to train personnel of all specialties both locally and abroad.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, officers, airmen and airwomen of the service are undergoing training in various countries including the U.S., South Africa, India, Belgium, Egypt and Pakistan, among others.\n\n\u201cIn addition, hundreds of personnel across all specialties are being trained locally in spite of budgetary constraints.\n\n\u201cIn the area of pilot training, 11 student pilots are currently undergoing training in South Africa, while three are undergoing Alpha Jet conversion in Egypt.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, 12 student pilots are undergoing Super Tucano training and four student pilots are undergoing helicopter training in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIndeed, two of these student helicopter pilots have completed their training and are expected to graduate very soon.\u201d\n\nThe CAS added that, within the country, 12 student pilots are undergoing Basic Fighter Training while two have recently completed jet conversion at 403 Flying Training School, Kano.\n\nHe added that 12 student pilots were undergoing Basic Transport Training, 32 undergoing Ab-Initio Flying Training and eight undergoing Instructor Training at 401 Flying Training School, Kaduna.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, 22 trainees are undergoing UAV Initial and Basic Training at 401 FTS, while 16 student pilots are undergoing Helicopter Pilot Training at the International Helicopter Flying School Enugu.\u201c\n\nAmao explained that all these efforts were targeted at ensuring combat readiness at significantly higher levels to counter both domestic and foreign threats to the nation\u2019s security.\n\n\u201cIn furtherance of this, we also recently reviewed the curricula for the various schools in the NAF Institute of Technology to meet expected standards, while also conducting instructional training for the instructors to ensure enhanced performance.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the training curriculum for NAF cadets in the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) has been reviewed and new criteria specified for NAF officers that can be eligible for posting to the Academy as instructors.\n\n\u201cIn addition, I authorised the audit of selected ground and flying institutions in NAF by a team of experienced retired senior officers with a view to upgrading the practices and facilities at the institutions to meet international standards.\u201c\n\nAmao noted that the ongoing efforts would go a long way in positioning the institutions as centres of excellence in producing pilots, engineers, technicians and other specialists.\n\nThis, he said, would avail the personnel the opportunity to be well equipped to carry out their constitutional roles more effectively and efficiently in the defence of the territorial integrity of the country.\n\n\u201cSpecial arrangements are also currently being made to upgrade UAV training facilities to enhance the operational capacity of UAV operators in anticipation of increased tempo of air operations with the recently acquired UAVs.\n\n\u201cWhile sustaining capacity building programmes for the NAF Regiment in joint efforts for synergy of air-ground integrated operations with sister services.\u201c\n\nThe CAS congratulated the young pilots and UAVs operators for successfully completing their various courses.\n\n\u201cYou have put in the necessary hard work to get to this stage and your efforts have been recognised with the pinning of wings on your uniforms.\n\n\u201cYou have therefore, left the stage of student aviators and have become pilots and UAV operators responsible for utilisation of national resources in our counter-insurgency and other security efforts.\n\n\u201cIt is expected that you apply and build on your current experiences during your pre-deployment tactical training.\n\n\u201cLike I advised the last set of pilots and UAV operators, you must be relentless in the pursuit of excellence and professionalism as operational pilots and operators, while working with your colleagues across other specialties in the service.\n\n\u201cYou must also strive to imbibe the doctrine of jointness at the frontlines as you interact with personnel from our sister services and other security agencies in pursuit of national securities imperatives.\u201c\n\nAmao thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for providing the enabling environment for NAF and the entire Armed Forces to function more effectively.\n\nEarlier, the Chief of Training and Operations, AVM James Gwani, noted that the winging was the 5th under the administration of Amao.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the young pilots would boost NAF\u2019s operational manpower, especially as the service was inducting and expecting more platforms to address the various security challenges across the country.\n\n\u201cI most sincerely express profound gratitude and appreciation to CAS, whose leadership has created the enabling environment for timely turn out of pilots and UAV operators in the NAF.\n\n\u201cTo the pilots and UAV operators, tomorrow brings a new journey, but today marks the end of a chapter in your career as you have become qualified pilots and UAV operators.\u201d\n\n...",

The stakes are too high; we cannot allow Nigeria to continue the way it is going.\n\n\u201cOur great party must come to the rescue and take over the reins of power in this country. What we see ahead is not pleasant at all. I just pray that God Almighty sees us through next year, financially, so that we can even have presidential elections.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI don\u2019t just see how we can continue to be deceiving ourselves. We try to prevent the country from growing by limiting and restricting imports, coming with all forms of phantom excuses to limit people from buying and importing what they cannot produce and need to live.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, they are restricting foreign exchange availability; they are just throwing millions of Nigerians into poverty.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy commitment today is to our great party, the PDP. I accept the responsibility of leading our e-registration process. We have done a very successful pilot in Edo, which I am hoping that the new committee will adopt so that we can roll out and build membership across the country. The soul of our democracy is making sure that we build our party like institutions,\u201d the governor noted.\n\nAddressing members of the delegation, Obaseki stated, \u201cThe decision is of the majority of our people, which is the way we will go. Atiku Abubakar is a Nigerian that is committed to this country; his achievements are visible. So, he is eminently qualified to contest the position of President of Nigeria and as you know, at the end of the day, power ultimately comes from God.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Dokpesi commended the governor for his giant strides and transformational projects embarked upon by his administration since he assumed office.\n\nHe noted, \u201cThe way and manner that people are suffering across the country is not acceptable. We have never been so divided as a nation; everybody now refers to us as the poverty capital of the world. All the indices clearly show that we are a failed state.\n\n\u201cEven in Abuja, we are afraid of the possibility of invasion by Boko Haram, bandits, and unknown gunmen. The APC-led federal government, without mincing words, has failed totally in fulfilling the promises they made in 2015.\u201d\n\n...",

          "title": "Southeast insecurity: Ohanaeze alleges sabotage, insists on Igbo presidency in 2023",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nApex Igbo sociocultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has alleged that the prevailing security situation in the Southeast geopolitical zone, is being orchestrated by dubious individuals to achieve a desired political objective and also to deceive and divert the attention of the people of the zone and the rest of Nigeria from the agitation for an Igbo president of Nigeria in 2023.\n\nOhanaeze president-general, Prof George Obiozor, who stated this in his Christmas message to Ndigbo and Nigerians on Friday, noted that insecurity is a poisoned arrow deliberately fired on the Southeast.\n\nHe, however, assured that the architects of the mischievous scheme will fail woefully, while insisting that insecurity should not be an excuse to deny the Southeast the opportunity to produce president of Nigeria.\n\nObiozor noted that year 2021 has unarguably been a hectic one for the world and equally for Ndigbo, noting that it has been quite a long and tortuous period.\n\n\u201cSymbolically,\u201d he said, \u201cit has been one year that thoroughly tested our faith and further solidified our resolve as a people.\n\n\u201cJust as we were smarting from the disruptions of the previous year, occasioned by the Covid-19 induced lockdowns, EndSars protests and the attendant economic uncertainties, the peace of the Southeast and most parts of Ala Igbo was disrupted by the activities of some of our Youths. Killings, arson, police and military brutality and extortion were among the challenges we had to contend with in the outgoing year.\n\n\u201cBut, I thank God for the resilience and cooperation of our political, religious, traditional and business leaders who worked with us so tenaciously to overcome these challenges. To the glory of God, Ala Igbo is returning to her peaceful and boisterous state.\u201d\n\nAddressing the issue of insecurity in the Southeast, Obiozor said, \u201cInsecurity in South East is politically orchestrated to achieve a desired political objective and also to deceive and divert the attention of the people of south East and the rest of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cInsecurity is a poisoned arrow deliberately fired on the South East. We in Ohanaeze say categorically that the architects of this mischievous scheme have failed woefully. Insecurity will not be an excuse to deny the Presidency of Nigeria to the South East in 2023.\n\n\u201cInsecurity as you know is everywhere in the country and a serious National problem. Nigeria is not new to crises and conflicts; the only good thing about it is that the Country has had a magic solution to it, whenever the country reaches the brinks. The magic has worked in the past in Nigeria\u2019s leaders\u2019 capacity to develop doctrines of necessity, these are equally doctrines of creative use of conflicts and crises in nation building and National unity. And these doctrines have worked in the past, this too shall pass. It is these doctrines that have enabled the country to stand strong and united when any other country would have disintegrated and perished. This accounts for Nigerians resilience and manifest destiny.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide calls upon the South East Governors to keep their promise by rolling out the security outfit, Ebubeagu before 31st December, 2021. This will go a long way to enhance security situation in the South East.\u201d\n\nThe Ohanaeze leader maintained that the Igbo deserve, and should be supported to produce president in 2023.\n\nHe regretted that many have tended to interpret Igbo industry as being overbearing, which he said, attracts envy towards them. According to him, other Nigerians must understand the Igbo and give them their due.\n\nObiozor said, \u201cNo people in recent history have been unfortunate or at best had a mixed fortune or blessings as Ndigbo in Nigeria politics and governance. For example quite often the Igbo energy and enterprise were misunderstood as being over ambitious. The Igbo talents and ability to turn adversities into advantages, obstacles into opportunities and difficulties into dividends were misrepresented as attempt at domination.\n\n\u201cConsequently, Ndigbo were confronted with anger or envy, hostility and violence at any given crisis in Nigeria and even outside Nigeria. Ndigbo believe and seek Nigeria unity but not unity of slaves and masters, we seek peace but not peace of the grave yard. We seek justice because we know that throughout history those denied justice have had no interest in peace.\n\n\u201cToday Nigeria President of Igbo extraction is imperative and an idea whose time has come. Definitely our history and political reality in our country makes it a national necessity which is anchored on equity, justice and fairness.\n\n\u201cNigerian President of Igbo extraction is politically justifiable and morally defensible. It is a signal of healing and uniting the Nation. In 1999, the country for the purpose of healing the Nation and creative use of crises and conflicts yielded the Presidency to the South West.\n\n\u201cI ask Ndigbo everywhere from today to make every effort to convince other Nigerians in Political parties and organizations that ours is a righteous cause whose time has come. In this connection, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide will soon announce a Political Action Committee to go round the country to canvass for the support and understanding of other Nigerians for this noble project.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the plan for the development of Igbo land, Obiozor said Ohanaeze will focus on the implementation of the Alaigbo stabilization fund, the technical committee of which is headed by Prof. Osita Ogbu.\n\nThe Ohanaeze president decried the menace of drug abuse in the region, noting that it\u2019s worrisome and must be tackled.\n\n\u201cIt is sad that the once reverred and famed Igbo youths are now associated with a very dangerous and destructive drug called crystal meth (mkpuru mmiri). This new low in our psycho-social milieu must be condemned and reproved by everyone. Youths world over remain the hope and enduring legacy of a society. We shall not allow our youths degenerate any further on account of this new destructive drug in town,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI therefore call on all parents to restrain their wards from any form of drug abuse, be it cannabis sativa (Indian hemp), hard drinks or crystal meth. I equally call on the couriers or dealers of these destructive drugs to stop forthwith. We should not be seen as aiding and abetting illicit drugs. The psychological and social harm of this phenomenon is too much to bear. It is therefore unacceptable to continue treading on this destructive path.\n\n\u201cMuch of the violence and criminality witnessed in Igbo land could be owed to the spate of drug abuse prevalent among our youths. The time to end this antisocial and deviant behaviour is now. Ohanaeze Ndigbo will liaise with the Chairman of National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) with a view to stemming the tide of this very disconcerting trend.\u201d",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi\n\nI have just come across an article questioning the experience and political credential of Mr. Dele Adeleke, one of the gubernatorial aspirants in Osun state, and I can\u2019t help but wonder what could have prompted such concerns. Even more baffling is the idea that he lacks political roots. I must say it is laughable and hypocritical.\n\nWhile it is good to have held political office in the past, it is definitely not a condition or a pointer to the ability of an aspirant to organize and deliver. There are so many successful elected officers who never held elective office before becoming elected into office.\n\nAs understandable as it is that during political campaigns, narratives emanate from various quarters to discredit credible opponents, it is important that those who push such negative narratives look for credible points.\n\nBe that as it may, I have in the light of this, found it needful to quickly nip things in the bud by providing the antecedents of the man in question, so that the records can be straightened as fast as possible.\n\nMr Dele Adeleke before joining the gubernatorial race on the platform of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, played the following roles with the stated capacities listed below:\n\n* Director-General, Adewale Aribisala for Reps campaign organization.. 2007.\n\n* Special Adviser (Probono Services) on MDG to Hon Wale Aribisala (MHR) 2008 to 2010.\n\n* Lead Technical Team \u2026 Nigerian contingent to Agritech in TelAviv, Israel 2009.\n\n* Head of Elections Operations/Situation Room Manager\u2026 Osun West Senatorial By-Election 2017\n\n*Head of Elections Operations/Situation Room Manager\u2026 Osun Governorship Election 2018\n\n* Panelist .. EU/ECOWAS Panel on Electoral reforms 2019.\n\n*Head of Elections Operations/Situation Room Manager\u2026 OYO state Governorship Election 2019.\n\n*Head of Elections Operations/Situation Room Manager\u2026 Ondo State Governorship Election.\n\n*Head of Elections Operations/Situation Room Manager\u2026 Kogi State Governorship Election.\n\n*Situation Room Manager; Anambra state Governorship Election.\n\n*Member 2021 National Convention planning central working committee.\n\nFrom a personal perspective, I dare say, it is foolhardy to trivialize or diminish an asset such as Dele Adeleke, who has recorded this lineup of milestones within and outside our dear Osun state. If we must criticize or discredit, let it be done with some semblance of honour.\n\nSunday Oguntuyi wrote from Osogbo",

After the first month, after March, when they couldn\u2019t come back, we asked that their pay be suspended. This is in tandem with the ILO principles at work,\u201d the minister said.\n\n\u201cSo, that same money for 2018 April and May, Mr. President has again approved that the finance minister refunds or re-imburse, on compassionate grounds, those payments,\u201d he announced, saying the approval was predicated on the grounds that the group of workers has been showing a lot of dedication and concern to the Covid and that their Hazard Allowance for 2021 had remained what it was before.\n\n\u201cSo, on compassionate grounds and\u2026we agreed that they should be getting this money to keep their moral high. We\u2019re not yet free of COVID-19 and the new mutants, we need to do everything to keep the health workers here, happy. In the same vein, he has also directed us to conclude the discussions on the other allowance for the health workers so that they can enjoy it anytime from now,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the threat by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) to go on strike over non-implementation of the 2020 Memorandum of Action (MoA) reached with the union, the minister said the union should educate its members on the quantum of money the federal government has already paid to them.\n\nHe said they may be threatening to go on strike not knowing that money has already been paid while the 2009 agreement, which is the other dispute that the union has, is still at the level of Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).\n\nNgige explained: \u201cOn the side of ASUU, you will also notice that there\u2019s been some brewing crisis. ASUU and their direct employer, which is the Ministry of Education, there\u2019s a tango and the tango is running round the MoA, the Memorandum of Action signed in 2020.\n\nLast week, N22.127 billion was also released to the University system for the unions, workers university system to benefit in consonance with the MoA we signed in December 2020.\n\nNgige said the altercation going on now and for which ASUU is asking their union branches to vote is an indication that a lot of them don\u2019t know that government has paid the quantum of money. \u201cMaybe it has not gotten into the accounts of the people, the persons involved, but I expected ASUU to inform their people, let them know that this is what has happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey also have a grouse with the negotiation of 2009. The 2009 agreement was being renegotiated before Babalakin left and a new committee was set in place. He said government is reneging on the standing agreement with the workers.\n\nOn the University Transparency Accountability Solutions (UTAS) designed by ASUU, Ngige said the proposed salary payment platform has not been perfected to obtain the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) compliance certificate.\n\n\u201cNITDA has written just last week to give their results on the tests they have done, that those two broad categories of tests, (user acceptance test, which involves NUC and the universities vice chancellors, bursars, and registrars), that has been done.

Specifically, he said the anti-graft agency should probe Akande\u2019s allegation that Tinubu built his (Adebanjo) Lekki house for him. Adebanjo said he built his house from his resources and a loan he took from Guarantee Trust Bank.\n\nHe maintained that, he raised the money by selling three of his properties, including the property he inherited from his mother, adding that when the burden of paying the loan he took from GTBank was too much on him, he had to sell a portion of the land Chief Obafemi Awolowo gave to him at Ibeju Lekki to offset the loan.\n\nThe Afenifere leader who showed evidence of the property he sold and mentioned those he sold it to, explained that he had to relocate from Surulere to Lekki because of frequent attacks by armed robbers in Surulere.\n\nChief Adebanjo said he became disappointed when Tinubu who ought to debunk the allegation by Akande refused to do so. Chief Adebanjo said he was not a rich man, but he has integrity which he cherished, explaining that his house in Lekki and a three-bedroom flat he built in his town Isanya Ogbo were the only properties he has.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe Lekki property, the house in my village, Isanya Ogbo which I built 40 years ago, and 3 Bedroom flat in a town house, at Omorinre Street in Lekki are the properties I have in the whole world.\n\n\u201cI hereby authorise the EFCC to verify the above facts. It is alleged that Chief Bisi Akande\u2019s building at Ila-Orogun, which I understand is more than double in expanse of my house in Lekki and some other properties he has in Lagos and abroad were financed by Bola Tinubu. His house in Ibadan was also alleged to have been built by the contractor that built the secretariat in Osogbo, when he was the Governor of Osun State.\u201d",

          "text": "A businessman, Mr Sylvanus Ahamonu, on Friday narrated before an Ikeja Special Offences Court, how he was allegedly kidnapped, tortured and made to pay $420,000 ransom by alleged kidnap kingpin, Chukwudimeme Onwuamadike (alias Evans) and his gang members.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Ahamonu, gave evidence online via the Zoom App, as the third prosecution witness in the trial of Evans and a dismissed member of the Nigeria Army, Victor Aduba.\n\nWhen the witness was asked to identify Evans, who was standing in the dock alongside Aduba, he said, \u201cI know him, that is Evans.\u201d\n\nHe, however, was unable to identify Aduba.\n\nLed in evidence by Lagos State counsel, Mr Yusuf Sule, Ahamonu said his ordeal began in the evening of June 23, 2014, while he was returning his residence from work, in his car.\n\nHe said his driver was waylaid by two or three men in police and military uniforms, who claimed to be men of the defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\n\u201cEvans came into my car brandishing an AK-47 rifle. He was wearing a three-quarter Jean trousers.\n\n\u201cI saw his face, he cannot deny it. The men in army and police uniforms were beating me. They said I was wanted by SARS.\n\n\u201cTheir bus was parked closeby and they took me into the bus, put me on the floor and covered my head. They placed their feet on my head throughout the trip.\n\n\u201cAfter about two or three hours, they transferred me to a Sienna car and took me to a building where they handcuffed my hands and legs and began interrogating me about my personal life and business,\u201d he testified.\n\nThe witness said that three weeks into his alleged captivity, his abductors contacted his wife and asked her to pay $2 million ransom or he would be murdered.\n\nHe said his spouse, in order to meet up with the demands, sold their property and contacted family, friends and well wishers, after which she was able to raise $200,000.\n\n\u201cThe money was given to them, and they said it was not complete, they said she must provide the complete money or they would kill me.\n\n\u201cShe additionally sold some things in the village, and gave him another $200,000, and he said the money was not complete yet.\n\n\u201cMy wife raised another $20,000, to give him. We gave them a total of $420,000,\u201d Ahamonu said.\n\nHe told the court that Evans also threatened to kill his immediate elder brother, Dominic, who dropped off the first tranche of $200,000, because he reported the abduction to the police.\n\nThe businessman alleged that Evans also kidnapped his relative, Onyebuchi, who paid the final tranche of $20,000 ransom.\n\nHe said he was later released alongside Onyebuchi.\n\nHe said that his path and Evans\u2019s crossed again after he (Evans) was captured and held in police custody.\n\n\u201cThe police announced that anyone who had been kidnapped by Evans before should come to identify him.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw him, he started begging for forgiveness, he told everyone the amount of money he received from me, and how he treated me.\n\n\u201cMy hands and feet were handcuffed for two months and I was blindfolded for that period. I nearly died.\n\n\u201cEvans told my wife to take me to a hospital, and that if I should die, he would kill her. I had to be flown abroad for treatment,\u201d Ahamonu said.\n\nWhile being cross-examined by Evans\u2019s counsel, Mr Victor Opara (SAN), Ahamonu said he never met Evans prior to his alleged ordeal.\n\nHe said when he was accosted by the gang and told that he was wanted by SARS/authorities, he initially did not panic because he was a law-abiding citizen.\n\nOn raising of the funds for the ransom, he said that he had a very large family as well as a lot of friends who were anxious for his wellbeing.\n\nHe told court that the family members and friends helped to raise the money.\n\nWhile being cross-examined by counsel to Aduba, Mr Emmanuel Ochai, Ahamonu said that the abduction occured on Kara Road, off Osolo Way, Ajao Estate, Lagos.\n\nNAN reports that Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo adjourned the case until Feb. 4, 2022, for continuation of trial.

          "title": "Sylvester Oromoni, others: Boarding schools now death chambers?",
          "text": "The controversial death of 12-year-old student of Dowen College in Lekki, Lagos state, Sylvester Oromoni Junior, has revived agitations for investigation into allegation of wrongful deaths, maltreatment and bullying of boarding school students in Abuja, Akwa Ibom, Rivers and other parts of the country. Are boarding schools now death chambers, PAUL OKAH asks in this report.\n\nTo the average Nigerian, bubbling Master Sylvester Oromoni Junior, a boy of 12-year-old, would have been alive today had it been his Delta state-based politician parents did not make the \u201cmistake\u201d of sending him to study in faraway Dowen College in Lekki, Lagos state, where he was reportedly bullied and allegedly killed by fellow students in controversial circumstances for refusing to join a cult group.\n\nOn Wednesday, December 1, a Twitter user identified as Perrie (@perrisonoromoni, first broke the news of the death of Omoroni, attaching the tweet with the photo of the deceased, which was later taken up by human rights activists and well-meaning Nigerians.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cThis is my 12 years old cousin that was beaten to death at a school that cost over 1 million naira. They called my uncle that he got injured playing football. Reaching the hospital, it was confirmed that he was being bullied and beaten up, causing internal damages. They tried to put him in a cult, he refused and they killed him. In a secondary school. They literally beat him to death.\n\n\u201cThe 12-year-old was battered on Friday, but died on Tuesday, after a series of tests and x-rays indicated that he sustained internal injuries. The school management had reached out to Sylvester Oromoni Senior, the deceased\u2019s father, a Delta State politician, claiming the boy sustained injuries while playing football at the school.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re from Delta state, but he goes to a boarding school in Lekki. They called my uncle that his son was injured when he was playing football. Reaching the hospital, it was confirmed that he was being bullied and beaten up, causing internal damages. After tests and x-rays, it was confirmed he was beaten up badly. He died yesterday (Tuesday) morning and his entire body was swollen.\n\n\u201cThe deceased had previously complained about pressures to join a cult group, but the young Oromoni only informed his parents while in the hospital. Before his death, he reportedly said the school\u2019s cult members threatened to kill him if he reported them. Before passing, he said they\u2019d been pressuring him to join a cult. He was admitted on Friday. He said they were going to kill him if he talked.\u201d\n\nPublic outcry\n\nFollowing the public outcry, pressures and reactions elicited by the tweet, Lagos state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, ordered the closure of Dowen College on Friday, December 3, detailing security agencies to investigate the incident to a logical conclusion.\n\nSubsequently, on December 6, the family detailed human rights activist, Femi Falana (SAN), to handle the case, while the Lagos state police revealed on December 7 that it arrested three out of the five students mentioned by the deceased as having beaten him up. This is as the House of Representatives directed the Inspector General of Police to investigate all victims of crimes in boarding schools.\n\nPrevious incidents\n\nOromoni was not the first student to have died controversially in a boarding school as the dust was yet to settle on the case of a 14-year-old female student of Premiere Academy in Lugbe, FCT, Keren-Happuch Akpagher, who was allegedly raped to death by a yet to be identified staff of the school. A used condom was reportedly found in her private part.\n\nSimilarly, an 11-year-old student of Deeper Life High School, Akwa Ibom, Don Davis, is still battling to stay alive, after he was allegedly sexually assaulted by seniors.\n\nNigerians fume\n\nSpeaking on the death of Oromoni and other victims, in her verified Facebook page on Friday, December 3, alongside pictures of victims, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) candidate in the 2019 governorship election in Kogi state, Natasha Hadiza Akpoti, detailed the atrocities committed by students and teachers in boarding schools, demanding for justice for victims.\n\nShe said: \u201cSylvester Oromoni, the 12-year-old student of Dowen College, Lagos, died from internal injuries sustained by torture from students for failing to join a cult. Don Davis, the 11yr old student of Deeper Life High School, Akwa Ibom, was sexually assaulted by seniors, while the school tried covering it up. I am glad the fighting spirit of his mother pushes on for justice.\n\n\u201cKeren Akpagher, the 14-year-old student of Premier Academy, Lugbe Abuja, died of sepsis earlier this year. A used condom was found inside of her, possibly raped severely by a staff (security or teacher). She died before she could build up courage to mention names. The school stonewalled the investigation.\n\n\u201cThese three innocent souls are our children. We must all join voices and support the parents to call for criminal charges to be pressed against the schools and those identified as collaborators. Thorough investigation should commence, leaving no stone unturned; no matter how highly placed the parents of the erring wards are.\n\n\u201cWe need the establishment of a body under the supervision of the Federal ministry of education to monitor, supervise and evaluate activities of all private schools (boarding and day) in Nigeria. There is need for the expansion of Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC Nigeria) activities to oversee activities of private schools especially boarding facilities.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cFCCPC can, amongst others, pay an impromptu visit to boarding schools to inspect the quality of food served. I remember the watery beans at FGC Idoani and the GGUSS. Oboroke\u2019s watery akamu with chippings of overnight Amala as the same poorly washed pot is used for everything.\n\n\u201cPay a visit to the hostels, especially at night, to see the students sleeping on bare floor, kneeling all night in the cold as punishment, bunk-shocking, dirty toilets, lack of drinking water, not to talk of bathing water, etc. Interview students randomly to unravel and intercept the torture and sexual abuse by fellow students and /or teachers.\n\n\u201cBelieve me, there are so many more students suffering abuse in boarding and day schools, but have had fear imbibed in them that they are too scared to speak up. \u2018A cry for help is a death sentence,\u2019 the victims are often warned.\n\n\u201cSo, take a good look at these three faces. Two dead, one alive. Even the boy, Don, that\u2019s alive will never be the same again. I\u2019ll plead, let\u2019s join voices and forces to have these schools support the call for justice and ensure stringent measures are in place to curb the evil of bullying and abuse.\u201d\n\nCommercialisatio of education\n\nSpeaking with Blueprint Weekend, a social commentator, Johnson Edeh, said that many proprietors of private schools thrive in collecting fees from parents and students, without paying attention to their welfare, suggesting the deployment of undercover security agencies to monitor activities in boarding schools.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe best way to get evidence in those schools for proper justice is to register undercover security agents in all the schools in Nigeria by the FG. Let them pretend to be students. Collect forms, get admitted in the schools and get to work as secret agents. They will get all the evidence to prosecute those beasts in the schools sexually assaulting students.\n\n\u201cWe should also teach our children to be bold and courageous too. This country is becoming something else. You send your children to school with hard earned money, yet live with the fear of the unknown. Who is to be blamed? You do all your possible best to train your children at home, yet they go outside and get polluted by the rotten ones.\u201d\n\nParental failure\n\nOn her part, a civil servant, Alhaja Fatima Yusuf, told Blueprint Weekend that there are always tell tale signs of children being abused, advising parents to pay close attention to their children for safety purpose, alleging that students are constantly fed poisons in boarding schools.\n\nShe said: \u201cIf your son or daughter suddenly stay too long in the restroom, if they start locking themselves up in their rooms, if they avoid eye contacts with you (if they used to), if they get irritated and angry unnecessarily, if they start exhibiting strange sleeping routine, like waking up with shouts or shocks, have some talks with them confidentially. They need you.\n\n\u201cThere are statutory supervisory roles for state and federal ministries of education for oversight functions to schools, from primary to tertiary institutions. This is to ensure not just standards of education, but also for the safety and well being of the students. However, corruption has not allowed the government officials to do their jobs well.\n\n\u201cIn some of the schools, where schools fees are over a million per term, these children are fed with junk and unwholesome can foods containing so much preservative chemicals that potentially expose them to cancer later in life. We need government intervention in all schools to correct these anomalies. The government officials should publish quarterly supervisory reports that would make them liable where and when anomaly is detected or occurs.\u201d\n\nTeachers\u2019 take\n\nAlso speaking, a secondary school teacher in Wuse, FCT, Mrs Jennifer Eze, said that boarding schools have become harbinger of death, advising parents to train up their children in day schools.\n\nShe said: \u201cAs a teacher, who is known for discipline and moral lessons, the challenges I face from parents and even my colleagues are enormous.\n\n\u201cThis society detests teachers who try to correct or punish students for wrongdoings. Parents\u2019 responses are dampening our morale by the day. Students do bring phones to school, watching pornographic stuffs in the classroom.\n\n\u201cIf you seize their phones, you will be castigated and fought by parents. This country, with the crop of students we have in our schools, has no future.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I am against boarding schools, because you cannot shift your responsibility as a parent to another fellow all in the name of your career. If the man is busy, the woman should be there for the children. Both of you should not be busy looking for money at the detriment of your children. In Nigeria of today, you can hardly get faithful staff, not with the peanut salaries that most schools are paying. They are only using the job as a stepping stone for greater offer.\n\n\u201cMost of the private schools in Nigeria are after money and nothing else. They will not employ enough and competent staff; just to make excess profit. So, all hands must be on deck to put an end to this. FG, human rights activists, etc, should go after these schools and make them face the music. Every school and everyone involved must be prosecuted.\u201d\n\nParental guidance as panacea\n\nSimilarly, a secondary school teacher in Jabi, Mr Theophilus Nathaniel, said that parents should send their children to day schools in order to effectively monitor their progress and not ship them off to die of moral decadence in boarding schools.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m in the system. I am a Mathematics/Computer teacher at Government Science College, Abuja and its only girl\u2019s school. Although we do have one or two issues, but, to be frank, there are nothing compared to all these problems recorded in private boarding schools. I would always prefer to take my child to government owned secondary schools: either boarding/day.\n\n\u201cI stand to be corrected, but since the advent of private schools in Nigeria, secondary schools have suffered great moral decadence and gross atrocities. Many parents often take their kids to boarding schools, simply because they\u2019re avoiding responsibilities and also many of the children at boarding schools are products of broken homes.\n\n\u201cThere are so many imbalances when it comes to shaping a child within the secondary school cadre. Majority of the shortfalls are mostly found within the private boarding schools. To a large extent, there are little of such terrible atrocities within the government owned schools, because discipline and strict measures are being put in place without petting any child of whosoever to practice rubbish.\u201d\n\nDowen College speaks\n\nAfter initially denying culpability in the death of Oromoni, in a volte-face statement on December 4, signed by its board and management, as a result of pressure and public outcry, Dowen College condoled with the family.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe deceased was dearly loved by his teachers, his fellow students and he was a beacon of light for the school,\u201d adding that his untimely death was \u201ctragic and unfortunate and requires a thorough and proper investigation and that Dowen College is fully committed to this.\u201d\n\nThe statement further said: \u201cWe are assisting the authorities to get to the bottom of this heartbreaking incident. The first steps taken by the school, in conjunction with the Ministry of Education, has been the immediate closure of the school to aid in the investigation. Understandably, at this time of intense grief and suffering, emotions are raw and tensions are high.\n\n\u201cWe pray that God, who alone knows how to comfort the sorrowing, will comfort Sylvester\u2019s family and all those who loved and knew him. We commiserate with the Oromoni family and the students of Dowen College who have lost a friend and fellow student.\n\n\u201cThis is a traumatic experience. We assure our parents that the school is taking steps to ensure the safety and security of their children and wards.\n\n\u201cThis is paramount. Every child is valued at Dowen College and their health and well-being is of the utmost priority to the school.\u201d\n\nReps seek strict guidelines\n\nFollowing widespread concerns over Oromoni\u2019s death, the House of Representatives, on Tuesday, urged the Federal Ministry of Education to set out strict guidelines for the operations of boarding schools across Nigeria.\n\nThe House, while condemning in strong terms, recent incidences of inhuman treatment and abuses happening in boarding schools across the country, mandated the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to immediately commission and take over the investigation, prosecute and punish the perpetrators of the identified heinous crimes.\n\nThis came Tuesday, following a motion, calling for condemnation of such acts in boarding schools, sponsored by member representing Oruk Anam/Ukanafun federal Constituency, Unyime Idem, who noted that while there is no way to make a broad conclusion as to whether boarding schools are good or bad, some recent developments in Nigeria have triggered public outrage as many share their experiences.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe parents of the deceased said he was attacked for declining to join what he termed as the secondary school\u2019s \u2018cult group\u2019 dominated by older boys at Dowen College in Lekki, Lagos.\n\n\u201cAnother incident leading to the death of 14-year-old Karen-Happuch Aondodoo Akpagher of Premier Academy, Lugbe, Abuja on the 22nd day of June 2021, is one that left many heartbroken. Her parents narrated how their daughter was sexually assaulted and later died of complications as a result of a condom left in her private part. Six months later, there is still no news of a suspect being arrested.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "text": "More than 20 people were feared dead after a fire broke out Friday in a building in Osaka in western Japan, officials said, and police were investigating arson as a possible cause.\n\nThe fire started on the fourth floor of an eight-story building in the major business, shopping and entertainment area of Kitashinchi, Osaka fire department official Akira Kishimoto said.\n\nTwenty-seven people were found in a state of cardiac arrest and one other woman was injured, Kishimoto said. The woman was conscious and brought down by an aerial ladder from a window on the sixth floor and was being treated in a hospital.\n\nLater Friday, 19 people were pronounced dead and three others were resuscitated, NHK national television and other media reported. Japanese authorities declined to confirm those reports.\n\nIn Japan, the authorities customarily describe those without vital signs as being in \u201cshinpai teishi\u201d or a state of cardiac and pulmonary arrest, and do not confirm deaths until they are pronounced at hospitals and other necessary procedures are done.\n\nA doctor at one of the hospitals treating the victims said he believed many of them died after inhaling carbon monoxide as they had limited external injuries.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said \u201cmany people have died or being in a state of heart and lung failures,\u201d without disclosing the exact number. Osaka Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura offered condolences.\n\nThe building houses an internal medicine clinic, an English language school and other businesses. Many of the victims are believed to be visitors at the clinic on the fourth floor, fire department officials said.\n\nThe cause of the fire and other details were not immediately known. Osaka police said they were investigating to determine whether the fire was caused by arson or an accident.\n\nMedia reports said police were searching for a man who witnesses saw carrying a paper bag from which an unidentified liquid was dripping. Police declined to confirm those reports.\n\nNHK said a female outpatient at the clinic\u2019s reception desk saw the man, while another person nearby said the fire started soon after he put the leaky bag on the floor.\n\nPeople on other floors of the building were believed to have been safely evacuated, Kishimoto said.\n\nNHK quoted a witness as saying she heard a woman\u2019s voice coming from the fourth floor calling for help. Another witness told TV Asahi he saw flames and smoke coming out of windows on the fourth floor when he stepped outside after hearing a commotion.\n\nIn total, 70 fire engines were mobilized to fight the fire, which was fully extinguished more than six hours later, officials said.\n\nIn 2019 at the Kyoto Animation studio, an attacker stormed into the building and set it on fire, killing 36 people and injuring more than 30 others. The incident shocked Japan and drew an outpouring of grief from anime fans worldwide. In 2001, an intentionally set blaze in Tokyo\u2019s Kabukicho entertainment district killed 44 people \u2014 the country\u2019s worst known case of arson in modern times.",

          "text": "The World Bank on Thursday announced its approval of a $700 million credit from its International Development Association (IDA) for the Nigeria Agro-Climatic Resilience in Semi-Arid Landscapes (ACReSAL) Project.\n\nThe project is expected to increase the implementation of sustainable landscape management practices in northern Nigeria and strengthen the country\u2019s long-term enabling environment for integrated climate-resilient landscape management.\n\nAccording to a statement from the multilateral institution, the productivity of major crops in Nigeria had been steadily declining over the past two decades, in part due to climate change, forcing an expansion of the area under agriculture and increased imports to meet the food needs of Nigeria\u2019s growing population.\n\nIt noted that persistent water shortages, especially in the extreme north, continue to exacerbate land degradation, desertification, and habitat loss.\n\n\u201cResource shortages, violent conflict, outdated agricultural systems not adapted to changing dryland conditions, lack of access to finance, weak value chain linkages, an uncompetitive environment for agribusiness, and poor market access are other key barriers to increased agricultural productivity in Nigeria. \u201cBetter environmental and water resources management and resilience against disaster and climate risks (largely water-related) are needed to sustain economic growth and protect the most vulnerable,\u201d it added.\n\nWorld Bank\u2019s Country Director for Nigeria, Shubham Chaudhuri noted that Nigeria was faced with water scarcity and droughts which occur every five years, on average, with the potential to increase in frequency due to climate change.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis scenario not only threatens food security, livelihoods, and productivity, but also exacerbates fragility and increases the risk of violence.\n\n\u201cWith communities and households that are most dependent on natural resources for their survival and vulnerable to desertification, this intervention will improve multi-sectoral watershed planning and investments to help about 3.4 million direct beneficiaries adapt to evolving dryland conditions.\u201d\n\nThe Washington-based institution pointed out that in recent years, the Government of Nigeria had established several initiatives in the agriculture sector to combat desertification including afforestation and reforestation programs, dissemination of proven agricultural technologies and sustainable agricultural practices, and promotion of efficient energy sources.\n\nHowever, it stated that efforts to stop and reverse desertification had been complicated by the need to feed a rapidly increasing population in a region where natural resources were dwindling and over 90 percent of national food production depends on smallholder farmers who lack the capacity to increase food production without degrading land.\n\nThe ACReSAL Project is a 6-year strategic project prioritising actions within four components: Dryland Management, Community Climate Resilience, Institutional Strengthening and Project Management, and Contingent Emergency Response.\n\nIt is expected to improve the capacity of the country to adapt to a changing climate, largely through enhancing multi-sectoral convergence (across environment, agriculture and water) and technology modernisation, including improved use of data, analytics, and connectivity.\n\n\u201cThe project will specifically target the inclusion of vulnerable and marginalised groups, including women, youth, the elderly, persons with disabilities, internally displaced people, and ethnic and religious minorities using an integrated watershed approach across sectors and levels of governance,\u201d Task Team Leader, ACReSAL, World Bank, Joy Iganya Agene said.\n\n\u201cThis will help reduce the vulnerability of millions of the extreme poor in northern Nigeria, strengthening their own role in the management of their natural resources while also addressing land degradation, strengthening climate resilience, and lessening livelihood vulnerability in dry, semi-arid and dry sub-humid regions in the northern states,\u201d Agene added.\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s IDA established in 1960, helps the world\u2019s poorest countries by providing grants and low to zero-interest loans for projects and programs that boost economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve poor people\u2019s lives.\n\nObinna Chima",
